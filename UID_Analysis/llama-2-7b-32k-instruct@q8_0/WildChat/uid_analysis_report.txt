=== Analysis Notes ===
Lower values of UID metrics indicate more uniform information density.
Higher correlation between metrics suggests consistency in measuring uniformity.

The high correlation between UID Variance and Pairwise suggests both metrics
are capturing similar aspects of information uniformity.

The high variability in UID metrics across texts suggests significant
differences in information density patterns between texts.
