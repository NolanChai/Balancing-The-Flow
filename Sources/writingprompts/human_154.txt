It was, of course, a dark and stormy night. The stars were crying, leaking an awful acid that burned deeper than fire. Not a soul stepped outside. Not even the bravest man dared to brave the storm when the stars and clouds yelled their sorrows. 
 
 A door opened. A soft glow pierced the dark ravings of the wind. It blew through the house, tugging at curtains as it shrieked and thirsted for a victim to sacrifice to the rain. 
 
 A dark mass was launched through the cutting rain, landing with a soft splash in the mud. The door slammed shut. There was a whimper. A soft bark. The wind shrieked in glee and the rain shouted its pleasure at the sacrifice. 
 
 Then the wind stopped. The clouds dried their tears and the sun came out to greet the blooming flowers. People left reveled in the soft grass, the warm sun. 
 
 And nobody cared about the dark mass lying in the street. No one cared about the furry creature that had died crawling across the street, back to the home of his master. 
 
 No one heard him cry his last breath or bark his soft love for the man who threw him in the street and crushed his bones in the morning. All they people were smiling, happy at their triumph over the wind and rain. That is, until the rain came back.
