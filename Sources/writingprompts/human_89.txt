`` So I'm dead. And you're not God?'' 
 
 `` No ma'am. Names Jeb, and I have no idea how I got here, or even where'here' is. My wife is gon na be mighty mad when I do n't make it home for dinner.'' 
 
 `` How long've you been here?'' 
 
 `` No tellin'. No clocks, just all these... souls I guess, coming in. I do n't even know if I'm dead or alive, but I'spect I'm alive. May I take your pulse please?'' 
 
 `` If I'm dead, I wo n't have a pulse'', I helpfully pointed out. 
 
 `` That's right, but I always got ta prove it to myself. I have a pulse, you can take it if ya want.'' 
 
 I did, and he did have a pulse. I tried taking my own, and I did n't have one. 
 
 `` So you've no idea how a living person ended up in this place?'' 
 
 `` Nope. But since you're here, how'd ya die?'' 
 
 `` Car accident. I guess I was more tired than I thought. I think I drove off a bridge on accident.'' 
 
 `` Shame. No kids?'' 
 
 `` No, I have two children, twins. I'm gon na miss them.'' 
 
 `` I bet you were a good momma.'' 
 
 Even though I did n't have a pulse, I felt my cheeks flush. `` Thanks. Do you have kids?'' 
 
 `` I got five of em. 3 boys, two girls. Bet they're wondering where I am. At least they're not the only ones curious'bout that.'' Jeb smiled an easy smile. `` Make your self at home, I guess. Got someone else to greet. I'll catch you later.'' 
 
 `` I'm Samantha, by the way. Nice to er... meet you I guess.''
