Long ago, humanity developed a defense against their natural predators. At the time, we called it'vision'' and the name has n't changed much now. Everyone is born with white eyes, and when you turn 18, there's a reaction that occurs in your brain that shifts your eyes to a new color. We have the reds, capable of ferocious strength accompanied by an equally ferocious temper. The yellows, with their holier-than-thou attitude and their control over The Light. The blues are an odd bunch, they keep to themselves and do n't say much. Their power was thought to only be absurdly high intellect, but it was discovered only recently that they can, with practice, affect the matter around them. Once you stray from the pure colors, you'll see less power and more variety in abilities. Surprisingly, it's not your parents or your personality that dictates what vision you will have, it's simply a genetic lottery. Your personality only changes after the fact. For this reason, most parents excuse the rebellious nature of teens. 
 
 I'm 17 and turning 18 tomorrow. There's a lot of excitement and even more worry. Will I be a different person after that day? Will I notice it? Who knows. We've been prepared for this day all of our lives and have learned everything there is to know about vision. All of my friends have already begun their lives and left our teenage years behind them. I hate my parents for birthing me so late into the year. 
 
 `` Remember son, we will always love you, no matter what color you get.'' My father told me with his warm orange eyes. 
 
 `` Mmmhm'' My mother murmured in agreement. She did n't say much, but that was a lot from her as a blue. 
 
 `` Thanks.'' I said as I went into my room and let the day's worries drift away. 
 
 In my sleep, I encountered something strange. An apparition. It was so plain in the white room that I stood in, and so out of place. It drifted menacingly upon me, leaving a dark stain on the perfect white walls. 
 `` What do you fear?'' It asked me. 
 
 `` What are you?'' was all my mind could say as a storm of questions passed through me. 
 
 `` Surely you do not fear me?'' it asked. `` Have you ever looked at yourself clearly?'' 
 
 As if I were under his suggestion, I turned my head to the conveniently placed mirror on the wall. Without a moment's wait, the room went dark only to return to the way it was before my mysterious visitor barged in. What I saw in the mirror, however, was different. A complete, void of light, blackness had replaced by white eyes. And that too was fleeting as the black color drained out of my eyes to return to the white that had originally been there.

 `` This can not be.'' My father spoke, mortified. `` His eyes are still white, dear.'' 
 
 `` Council of the six'' my mother declared with her weak voice. 
 
 `` This is a pile of crap!'' 
 
 Boom! 
 
 A heap of dust polluted the air. The wind howled into the house through the gape left by my father's fist. 
 
 And then, the dust slowed and stopped. My father slowed and stopped. The clock on the wall slowed and stopped. I got up to touch the frozen figures and could n't interact with them at all. As if this was n't strange enough, my'friend' decided to pay a visit. 
 
 `` When all is still, is n't the world a lot less scary?'' The more human-like apparition asked. 
 
 `` What are you?'' 
 
 `` A foolish question. Let me show you.'' 
 
 It turned into a he. Then a she. And finally, into me. 
 
 `` We did n't learn about this at school.'' 
 
 `` That's because you're special. You won the lottery. You get to live with me.'' 
 
 `` Then how about you answer my question. What are you?'' 
 
 `` A consequence of a colorless brat, you fear that which you do not understand.'' he carried on, `` Instead, you should fear what you do.'' 
 
 `` Colorless? So does that mean I really have no vision?'' 
 
 `` On the contrary, you have them all. Your eyes are darker than mine.'' It erupted into a laughter. 
 
 `` Are my eyes black?'' 
 
 `` Bravo. Now, I'm going to get you out of this, so sit back and watch.'' 
 
 The experience that followed was surreal. There are n't enough words to describe it. I was ripped from my body and replaced by It. When I looked down, I saw an equally disgusting black apparition. I looked up again to see a chord holding my current form to my body. 
 
 `` Ah, I've missed having a body.'' 
 
 And at that moment, My body's eyes turned purple and my mother shed a tear. 
 
 `` It seems he must have had a delayed reaction.'' My father sighed in complete relief. 
 
 They both made their way downstairs, happy to get back to their business. They were so ecstatic they forgot about the giant hole they left in my bedroom. 
 
 `` Think about your eyes being purple and they will remain purple. But remember, you're a black now.'' 
 
 Whoosh. 
 
 I was pulled back into my body and felt the strange feeling of warmth again. However, there were two things that bothered me. My eyes were purple, and I felt an icy presence at the center of my chest. 
 
 ( My first time, be gentle! )
