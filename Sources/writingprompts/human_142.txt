**Oh come on! What the hell? Really? Here? You had to come all the way here, to this particular place in the middle of nowhere? Just my luck. Goddamn. ** 
 
 *Wha- That's not- That's not possible... somebody-is-thinking-underground Somebody else? Here? But- But where? * 
 
 **Wait. Wait. Can he hear me? ** 
 
 *Is he talking about me? where-is-he-am-i-crazy* 
 
 **Oh shit! Can you hear me? Are you serious? Hello? ** 
 
 *I- I can hear you... I guess? Or am I finally going crazy? it-comes-from-under-the-house* 
 
 **This is really strange. I thought nobody else in the world could listen to minds... ** 
 
 *I thought that too! wow-what-oh-my-god Shit, this is amazing! Wait, where are you? It sounds like you're under the cabin... * 
 
 **Well yeah, there was an old mine here. I thought it was the best way to avoid all the noise, you know? ** 
 
 *Ha! yes-he's-right Do I know! Damn people, thinking all the time. Could n't take it anymore. hate-people-thinking-all-the-time-i-mean-shut-up-already! * 
 
 **Yeah... So, how long have you been able to do it? To read minds? ** 
 
 *about-a-year-when-was-it? Oh, about a year or so. yeah-when-lisa-left-me I'm so excited! This is really cool! i-still-miss-lisa-whore* 
 
 **Only one year? Lucky you, I guess. I've been like this since I was a child. For a while I thought everyone else could do it, too. So I learned very early to mask my thoughts. Discipline, you know? ** 
 
 *what-does-he-mean-oh-i-understand Mask? Sounds like a good idea! I wish more people masked their thoughts too. Or just hide them, so much horrible and depressing stuff around there, you know? Or just shut the- wait-if-he-can-mask-thoughts-i-should-be-more-careful-how-do-i-mask-my-thoughts* 
 
 **Is not easy, let me tell you. And the more scared you get the less you can hide them. ** 
 
 *scared-i'm-not-scared-how-do-i-mask-my-thoughts-easy-calm-down So you live down there all the time? maybe-i-should-go* 
 
 **Do n't be afraid man. The more excited you get the more difficult is to point the source of the thoughts you read. Have n't you learned that in a year? ** 
 
 *i-don't-like-been-mindread-i-better-go I'm not afraid. So do you? i-better-go-calm-down Do you live down there all the time? * 
 
 Well, no. Sometimes I come up.
