`` Welcome to KidStop, my name is Dan. Have you heard about our special offer this week? If you buy any 2 used Indonesian childern you get the 3rd for free!'' 
 
 `` No thank you'' my father responded kindly as he entered the store carrying a large box in his hands. 
 
 `` Well maybe you would be interested in our pre-order special. The newest blonde hair blue eyed child edition is coming out next week. Pre-order now and get 10 % off all other in store purchases!.'' 
 
 My father looked at the salesman with an interested expression. He then placed the box he was carrying on the counter and opened it's flaps. 
 
 `` I'd like to know if its still possible to trade this in.'' My father then lifted me from the box and handed me to the salesman. My body was bound in plastic wrap with a gag in my mouth preventing me from making any noise. I had been drugged so all I could do was watch and listen. 
 
 `` Ah! The older suburban soccer kid edition.'' Dan, said as he examined me. `` I remember when we sold these about 10 years ago. Great playing ability, quality design. These kids flew off the shelves when they first came out. What makes you want to trade him in?'' 
 
 My father then lifted my shirt to reveal a portion of my torso. `` My kid got the red ring of death the other day.'' He pointed to a large redish patch of skin on my chest. `` He ca n't do anything useful or even play anymore.'' 
 
 The sales man eyed the patch with a gloomy expression. `` Yeah, the red ring of death was common in these. We prefer to go by its more technical name, cancer. Once they get it its almost impossible to fix unless your willing to spend a ton of money.'' 
 
 `` So what can I get for him?'' My father asked as the salesman continued to examine me. 
 
 `` Well I ca n't trade him in. It's way past his warantee and we ca n't resell him like this. But I'll tell ya what, I'll take him off your hands and give you a 15 % discount on any of our new models.'' 
 
 My father stared at me, as if debating what he should do. 
 
 `` Deal!'' My father said as he shook the salesmans hand. `` Now tell me more about this new blonde hair blue eyed model.'' 
 
 My father continued talking with the saleman but I could n't hear about what anymore. I had been handed off to another employee who carried me to the back of the store. I was thrown into a box labeled spare parts with a couple other used childern. The top was shut and I could here the sound of packaging tape sealing us in as the light faded.
