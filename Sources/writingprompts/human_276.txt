You are all going to die. Everyone single one of you. 
 
 Two weeks ago I unleashed a slow working airborne virus. It reproduces incredibly quickly. By now you are all infected, regardless of your location. You have six months left to live. Six months to finally start living your lives. Living a life of pleasure. No restrictions. 
 
 Some will think of me as a `` bad guy''. I am not. In many ways I am a hero. I have unleashed you from slavery. No work, no stress. No more worrying about disease or getting old. You are all equal. You are free for 6 months. Free for the first time in your life. I have liberated you. 
 
 Religion? If you choose to spend your final days tied to a non existent form of oppression, then you are wasting my gift. If you need something to pray to, pray to me for I am real. Bow down and kiss my feet for I could save you. I could, but I will not. 
 
 You think this is a joke no doubt. It is not. At the bottom of this letter is an address where you will find 14 bodies. They were infected just over 6 months ago and locked away with enough food for a year. They are now dead. It will not have been a pleasent death. You will all go through exactly what they did. But not yet! 
 
 Why have I done this? 
 
 I watch the world every day. The wasted potential of humanity. Corruption, inequality, oppression. We are killing ourselves slowly and miserably and we are taking other species down with us. Enough! Let us burn bright for a few short moments. Let us live as intended. In glory! Humanity is liberated.
