`` Claire?'' I cautioned, holding her arm. `` Do n't.'' was all I said, pulling her back down to sit. She sat silent for a bit, then turned back to me. 
 
 `` But I want to see them! If they're even REAL. What if you're just playing nasty tricks?'' 
 
 `` I'm not playing nasty tricks!'' How could I explain that I saw a spider grow from the size of a shoe to a dog the moment I looked at it? Maybe I was crazy, but that thing bit Mark and his foot was the size of a football now. `` Mark got *hurt* by them. Your brother! Why would he tell you to go with me otherwise?'' 
 
 She did a little pout and sat there. If it was my own little sister, I'd have held her hand a little harder. Now I wish I had. She jerked her hand out of mine, spinning around and bolting through the door. `` CLAIRE!'' I yelled, and waited. Five seconds. Then came the scream.
