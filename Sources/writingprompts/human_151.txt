Proctor stepped into the room, coldly staring at Bartuk and sitting down across from him. Picking up the milk frother, he pressed a button on the side, causing a blade to pop out of it. He then proceeded to open the envelope, pulling out a piece of paper labeled `` EXAM FORM 198''. 
 
 He then looked up and, without making eye contact, passed Bartuk the form along with a number 2 pencil he had brought in with him. Walking off to a sideroom from which the testing room is visible via the one-way mirror he muttered something sounding like `` Good luck''. 
 
 Six hours later, Bartuk was handed yet another piece of paper which read: 
 - MULTIPLE CHOICE ( WEIGHT: 25 % ): 99.12 % 
 - OPEN RESPONSE ( WEIGHT: 75 % ): 98.6 % 
 -- > RESULT: 98.73 % -- > GRADUATED SUMMA CUM LAUDE
