We will be together, inevitably. Fate has a sick sense of humour and so does coincidence, it seems. No matter where I go, to the store to buy milk or heading down the road to work; I see you. I always see you, though. No matter how hard I try I can ’ t seem to shake you, you ’ re like my coincidental stalker – and you don ’ t even know it. You don ’ t even know me. But I know you. 
 
 I know how soft your skin is, the smell of your hair and the taste of your lips. I know all your insecurities. Your fear of dogs because you were bitten by one when you were younger, your inability to cry, the way you wear your hair when you're happy and even the way you pout when you ’ re lying. 
 
 And through it all, I love you. 
 
 That is what makes all this so hard. Keeping this secret has been a terrible burden, the weight of it all drags me down day after day, but I do it all because I love you. Because I don ’ t want to see you suffer, I see that enough every time I sleep. 
 
 The first time I saw you I had a sudden sense of dejavu, I remember that I had seen you before; many times in fact. No matter how differently the vision panned out, the ending was always the same. You and me in each other ’ s arms, covered in blood. 
 
 I am holding you, weeping as blood pools around you, soaking me and the bed in that crimson red liquid. I ’ m crying but you can ’ t hear me, how could you? You are dead. I ’ m not far off either. But before I die, the men… those animals… want to show me what a real man is. I ’ m crying harder now, begging them to stop. One of them holds the knife to my throat while the other unbuttons his pants. 
 
 “ This won ’ t take long. ” He says, the stench of alcohol and piss chokes me. 
 
 Another holds down my flailing arms and legs, they had already pushed your lifeless body off the bed and I turn to you. 
 
 I stare at your cold dead eyes and remember the little time we had spent together. How it was the best time of my life. How I wished I could go back. To change it. Your fiery red hair lay sprawled around you and although it was caked in dried blood it still burned with that same hot ember that you did when you were alive. 
 
 God I love you so much. 
 
 
 They always end that way. No matter what I do. I tried moving states, you still managed to find me and with it; so did my premonition. I tried moving to a different country; but your mother fell mysteriously ill and you somehow found yourself near me once more. I tried telling you but before so much as a ‘ hello ’ had escaped my lips I saw us die a horrible death again and again. My bank account had suffered enough from all the constant travelling, I realised I couldn ’ t outrun this. 
 
 But maybe I can delay it. Maybe I can avoid you for just long enough. I am miserable, lonely and fearful; but as long as you are happy. As long as you are alive and breathing then it will all be worth it. 
 
 So I ’ m writing this now as my final farewell. Even now the visions are cloudy, changing; unpredictable. I know what I have to do. If it means that you will live, if it means that you will be happy… then so be it. 
 
 
 Getting a gun wasn ’ t hard, in fact it was easy. The man who sold it to me almost laughed when I pointed out the one I wanted, he said that my tiny wrists would break with the recoil. After all if I ’ m going to die I might as well be able to choose what it is that delivers the final blow, right? After much debate I finally decided on one, Lord knows I can ’ t remember the details. It ’ s small and light and it will do the job. In fact, after all these years delaying the inevitable I finally feel a sense of happiness that at long last it ’ ll all be over. I am going to be free. I ’ m giddy with excitement! All this time I though the future would only end in one way, but I have the power to change that now. 
 
 
 So farewell. Know that I love you more than anything, and that is why I am able to do this. 
 
 
 I can only hope that if there is a Heaven, I that will see you there. 
 
 
 And if God is so forgiving, perhaps he will forgive my one and only sin… loving another woman.
