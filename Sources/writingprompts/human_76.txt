Dr. George checked the papers twice as Anthony Renault sat patiently^1 in front of him. Today was running slowly, like a struggling faucet, no amount of concentration was paying off. He rubbed his eyes and made out what he could- *sore throat*; *ca n't sleep*. He'll figure something out- he could always just prescribe sugar pills again. *Most* of the time the human body will figure it out its problems on its own. 
 
 `` How are you feeling, Mr. Renault?'' asked Dr. George. 
 
 `` Not well. Feeling sick.'' 
 
 `` Sore throat?'' 
 
 Mr. Renault nodded. Dr. George told him to open wide. 
 
 `` Hmmm... Everything seems alright. I do n't see any issue here.'' 
 
 `` There's a few things. I ca n't sleep.'' 
 
 `` Are you eating well?'' 
 
 `` I think it's because of things that are bothering me... In life, I mean. I saved a life.'' 
 
 Dr. George was no stranger to saving lives. It was entitled in his job. Yes, from the *eye for and eye* law, he could use it to murder anyone he would wish. But Dr. George was not a violent man, simply a clumsy one. It seems like for every life he saves, another dies. It was the way of being a doctor, and sometimes slips can happen. 
 
 `` Congratulations! It's always good to save someone's life.'' 
 
 `` Yeah. I suppose it is. You're a doctor. You must save many lives.'' 
 
 George smirked. 
 
 `` How many lives do you think you saved, doctor?'' 
 
 `` I'd say hundreds. Thousands, maybe. I've been doing this for many years now.'' 
 
 `` And how many would you say you lost?'' 
 
 George hesitated. `` Well, I try to focus on the positive.'' 
 
 `` Do you remember the faces of you saved better than the ones you lost?'' 
 
 George fidgeted in his chair. `` I do n't feel comfortable talking about this. Could we get back to the task on hand?'' 
 
 `` Yes, of course. I was just questioning because, like I said, I saved a life. Just last week. It was little girl.'' 
 
 `` That's very good.'' 
 
 `` She was crossing the street, absentmindedly ahead of her parents. She was running, a truck was coming...'' 
 
 `` You did a brave thing.'' 
 
 `` Thing is, afterwards, after I saved her and after I got my I4I license, I was n't proud of myself. I was n't thinking about her. I did n't even feel like I saved her because she was just a little girl. Have you ever felt that way?'' 
 
 `` What?'' 
 
 `` Have you ever felt like you saved someone not for their life, but for the I4I?'' 
 
 `` I've never wished to have an I4I license, nor have I ever used one.'' 
 
 Mr. Renault scowled. `` Not intentionally, maybe. But they're handy to have. Have you ever saved a little girl?'' 
 
 `` Yes, I'm sure I have. The past gets blurry.'' 
 
 `` You would know if you have saved a little girl. Same if you had lost one. Have you ever lost a little girl before, Dr. George?'' 
 
 `` Mr. Renault, this is highly unorthodox, and if we can not discuss why you are here, then I'm going to have to ask you to leave.'' 
 
 `` We are discussing why I am here!'' Anthony Renault stood and towered over the doctor. 
 
 `` You're a lazy person. I am not a murderer. You are. An eye for an eye? You might have saved hundreds, but you've blinded thousands. You blinded her.'' 
 
 Dr. George jumped out of his chair, making for the door, but it was n't quick enough. Mr. Renault left his papers on the stool.
