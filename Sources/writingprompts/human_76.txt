It was a terrible day, God had finally had enough. Humanity had strayed too far, and like a parent to a child, God had devised a punishment. All of Humanities fears had finally come true, just about every way you could imagine the world ending was happening. 
 There were zombies, aliens, meteors, but worst of all there were dragons. These were n't your average made up dragons, these were an organized society of hunters that thrived in the new conditions of earth. 
 The alpha dragon, however, was the worst of the worst. Their leader, known only as Fireanole. This monster had the ability to disguise itself as nearly anything through shapeshifting. It would commonly lie in wait pretending to be a hut with a campfire inside, survivors would come by hoping to find help and shelter, but instead they met their demise. 
 Buildings burned, blood soaked the streets, many tried to slay the dragons, but all of them failed. It truly was the end of the world.
