Today I feel nothing, nothing at all. No itch no pain no strange breeze. Nothing. Earlier I thought I felt something, it was sudden but fleeting and then it was gone. I may have felt nothing then too. I feel empty. I wonder why I feel this. Perhaps I'll ask my wife her thoughts when she returns home late tonight. I watch TV to fill my feelings of emptiness. Flick through the channels. Sports, new recipes, comedies. All boring, I still feel empty. I switch to the news. The US dollar is rising. Scientists are planing to go to Mars. Politicians promising lies. Conflicts. A plane crash. Boring. Empty.
