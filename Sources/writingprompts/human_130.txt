At the twelfth watch I did approach the Lord, silent in the darkness `` Thou are not meant to be here,'' he spoke without looking at me. But anger did sit upon my blood and I thirsted for knowledge. 
 
 `` I am.'' I spoke. His countenance fell. `` We are dry fruit; thou art a dry vine. We will cut thee off that we may bring forth seed upon the earth. Money have we none, power have we none, and we turn our backs on those who do. Such things ought not to happen to the messengers of the Father.'' 
 
 His eyes are troubled. `` I have no power, save what the Father giveth me. These have only power in their fathers, whose bones lie in the earth.'' His visage is sorrowful. 
 
 But my bones are black upon me. I swore in my wrath I would destroy him. `` He is Father of us all; why then will he favour thee over any other? By what reasoning should we call thee blessed when thy doctrine is polluted by whores and publicans? Thou art not a true son. Thou art prodigal.'' 
 
 `` Nay, thy pride hast become thy blindness. Thou art in the grasp of the prince of the power of the air, and he hath grasped thee round the throat. Thou shouldst be with the others; these with thee would have come by and by. Return, and thou shalt not perish.'' His eyes are pleading. `` Sup with me in the mansion of my Father.'' 
 
 I canst not bear longer, for rage and shame have filled my bowels. He is the kindest man I have known, and so must be the weakest. And for this I kiss him, giving the sign. 
 
 As the soldiers and servants bind him, he whispers to me, `` Judas, betrayest thou the Son of Man with a kiss?'' 
 
 My regret is as the sands of Egypt and hungry as Leviathan. As they lead him away, I think on how it will devour me.
