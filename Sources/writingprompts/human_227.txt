*Light. Life. Time. Chaos. Calm. * 
 
 An eternity of loose thought brought together after an age of disjointed wandering, the pull of gravity bringing me into one providing understanding for the first of three times. 
 
 *Friends. Darkness. Suffocation. Heat. Light. Fire. * 
 
 Thought slips and erodes as I am swollen, molten. Dropped into the swirling vortex the currents of the Inner world. 
 
 *Vibration. Noise. Thunder. Force. Explosion. Air. Cold. Hardening. Water. Ocean. * 
 
 I am one once again, thought returns. The second of three. Pushed around the world upon which I inhabit, shaped and chipped and cracked and smoothed. I notice life not like my own. It moves through the waters, chasing other life, running. Living. 
 
 *Darkness. Motion. Light. Noise. Crashing. Heat. Air. Rest. * 
 
 I sit upon a bed of friends, smaller, fading, but still me. I watch the day turn to night, the clouds swim like the water life before, ever changing. More life arrives. One is the same, but ever changing. Colors across it's body. Language. Tools. Instruments. Technology. One finds me. An older one. He picks me up, handing me to a small one. The small one has long hair. The big one points. The small one looks. I am thrown. I find water, but bounce, once, twice, three times. I look back and see the small one and the big one. They are happy. I land. I sink. 
 
 *Water. Darkness. Pressure. Erosion. Dust. Time. * 
 
 I lose myself to time, I am but sand, spreading across the world. I wait. The oceans change. They warm. They poison. Other life goes away. I live, barely. Am I alive? 
 
 *Quiet. Loneliness. Light. Heat. Noise. * 
 
 I am back inside. Molten. I join myself over time, collecting into my former self. I am not finished, but I am close. I am the third of three lives. 
 
 *Chaos. * 
 
 Another home hits my own. We are flung into the dark. Nothing survives. Nothing but me, cooling into the night as my light fades into the distance and into time. I am alone. Am I alive? It does n't matter. I am alone. 
 
 *Darkness. Time. Quiet. Lifeless. Time. Alone. * 
 
 **Eternity. **
