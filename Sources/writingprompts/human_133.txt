 The smokey club's walls bounced with each thump of the bass. Blue and green women danced about on poles as the lasers danced about the haze, holographic flames illuminated the bottles on the wall, giving the bar a eerie red glow.

 Striking his illegal Earth made tobacco, the human began to make for the door. Pushing his way through the crowds of dancing aliens, whose colors and cultures were abundant.
