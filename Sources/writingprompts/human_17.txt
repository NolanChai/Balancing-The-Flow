`` Breakfast!'' I heard a call from downstairs. I fussed under the covers for a bit, willing myself against my tired morning state to sit up. I peered around the room, my soft white curtains flowing with the breeze from the opened window. 
 I propped myself up on my elbows finally, reaching to pull my hair back in a ponyta- 
 Wha- 
 Where the hell is all my hair? 
 I screamed. But wait, this voice is n't familiar. I stared around the room in a complete daze before settling my gaze upon something standing up between my legs. 
 *OH MY GOD. * I'm a boy! When did that happen?! 
 Disturbed, I hopped out of my bed and concealed my... *my penis*... in my waist band so it would n't freak anybody else out. 
 I hustled downstairs, warmly greeted my the blissful aroma of morning waffles, distracting me if only for a moment from the perplexing situation I woke up to. 
 `` Mom?'' My low voice shocked me again. *Please let this all be a dream. * 
 `` G'morning Nathan! I made your favorite! Okay, well I just toasted some Eggo's, but y'know. Here you go.'' 
 *My mom's even acting like this is totally normal... is this my life now? * 
 I stared at my waffles, blinking back bewildered tears, cascading fresh maple syrup over my breakfast as I submitted to this weird alternate universe.
