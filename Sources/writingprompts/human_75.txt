Queltic History: Volume 5 
 
 Chapter 3 
 
 Conflict without Victory 
 
 The forces of Ol and of the Scorched King were a series of escalating atrocities. Each battle an attempt to cause the worst tragedy. The Dragons cared not for civilians or their fields. They burned indiscriminate, women, children, elders none would matter before the might of the wyrms. 
 
 In turn Ol targeted the young. Those unhatched in their clutches and those too young to breath fire. Killing generations of mighty dragons before they ever knew the freedom of the skies. 
 
 At the end. No one got what they wanted. The dragons were now all but extinct while the lush lands of Ol had become nothing but glass and ash. Nothing would grow in the Wastes ever again. 
 
 While the Kings kill each other robbing their people of their present. The damage and the horror would rob generations of their future. Their pain is felt is echoes even now centuries later. We have not forgotten. We will never forget.
