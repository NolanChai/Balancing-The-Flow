Well I'd be able to predict the few earth quakes that happened in my city, as well as the ones elsewhere that I remember, including the ability to save many lives in that awful Japanese one. That's the first thing I'd do, Japan will evacuate for sure if I can get to the media and tell them the exact time, date and magnitude for the two ones from my city, they wo n't wan na risk it. 
 
 
 I got in to a game in 2012, based on a mod that's been out since 2003. The game is highly competitive and has huge tournament, last year's big one had a prize pool of $ 11,000,000, so I think I'd practice quite a lot more, get more skill on top of what I already have, should be gooooood fun: D 
 
 
 Shit, Ima need to buy a PC with my $ 12.38c: / 
 
 
 
 Dunno if I'd tell people about it and not go to school, go straight to UNI mayb, or just have the easy life.... Probs just the easy life actually. Yeah. 
 
 
 
 Hmmm, as I said before with the pro-gaming thing, I'd be able to correctly bet on the big games, knowing the 1-10 teams over the major tournaments. Roughly. I could also bet on a few other things.... 
 
 
 
 DEFINITELY get into programming earlier, SHIT WHEN WERE BITCOINS LAUGHED AT!?!? 
 
 
 
 OOOOO! found a game, may edit later and write more shit!
