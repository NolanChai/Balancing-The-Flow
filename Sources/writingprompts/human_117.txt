To the tune of Time in a Bottle by Jim Croce ( an amazing story teller in his own right ) 
 ____________________________________________________________ 
 
 Each night while I'm stalking this child â€” 
 
 Like days when I play with my food, 
 
 I sit and enjoy like a monster watching his pray 
 
 yet terrified too. 
 
 
 His nightlight seems to last forever. 
 
 His parents search all of his room. 
 
 I blend, buried well like a treasure and then 
 
 My skin, it lights up with the moon. 
 
 
 But there always seems to be a night light 
 
 Preventing me from doing what I want to. 
 
 I've waited long enough to know 
 
 That your the child I wan na sink my teeth in. 
 
 
 I hear your mom doing dishes. 
 
 Dad's snoring in the living room. 
 
 The light bulb has burned out 
 
 except now the door's cracked so 
 
 I have to tip-toe to you. 
 
 
 But there always seems to be a night light 
 
 Preventing me from doing what I want to. 
 
 I've waited long enough to know 
 
 That your the child I wan na sink my teeth in.

 I know it is n't perfect, this was more of a challenge for myself than anything, I hope anyone reading it enjoys it. I may consider writing an actual story for this.
