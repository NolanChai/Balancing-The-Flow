Staring blankly at the screen, for what seemed like an enterity, with an empire of thoughtless humans sharing videos of cats, using the like button as a symbol of a prayer, and documenting their worthless, uninteresting, unoriginal lives. 
 
 I despised everything about Facebook. The sponsored ads, the event notifications, the profile picture in a bikini Ashley Smith has shared 3 times because for her it's sensible to equate selfworth with facebook likes. 
 
 The only reason I wanted to keep this deplorable example of human society is so I could pull model bitches, with boobs bigger than cantelopes and with IQ's lower than my age. Now that my model bitch is gone. My website shall follow. 
 
 Gone.
