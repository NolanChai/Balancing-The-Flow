`` Wow, what an amazing week!'' I said to myself. This was exactly what I needed. A week away from work, from life, from stress. 
 
 I could n't believe how they pampered me here. Every morning breakfast was brought to me in bed. At night, I drank nothing but the finest wines and cognac while I feasted on whatever my heart desired. 
 
 I was gon na miss this place. Back home there is just so much on my plate all the time. That being said, I was getting a little homesick. It would be nice to see Sarah when I walked in to work on Monday. Maybe this week I'll finally get the courage to ask her out. 
 
 My bags were packed and I began the descent in the elevator. I stepped out to it's enormous lobby. Mirrored ceilings suspending lavish chandeliers. Champagne ready to go. 
 
 I approached the counter. `` Welcome to the Hotel Grand Bahamas'' it read behind the desk clerk. 
 
 `` The time has come, it's been a fantastic week and thank you for everything'' I began, `` but sadly, I'm here to check out''. 
 
 `` Oh?'' spoke the clerk. `` Well sir, you can check out any time you'd like but you can never leave''.
