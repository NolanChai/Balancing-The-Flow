The war began years ago. When the human plague spread beyond their lifeless solar system. No longer were the invaders content to destroy their own planet but they sought out the furthest worlds from their own lifeless corner of the galaxy. World after world had fallen to monsters over the last millenium. Every sentient being in the galaxy knew the stories. 
 
 When the virus arrived at his home planet however, the stories became far more than simple words passed down by teachers. They came in the night, their ships undetected by the Maronians' planetary defense system. 
 
 The legends always said that the human's first strike came swiftly and devastating. 9 billion soldiers and 12 billion civilians, gone in a matter of hours. Almost 50 % of the population. They swarmed across the fire scarred land left behind by their bombs. We were devastated beyond recovery. 
 
 However Maronian tradition demanded that our whole race be eliminated before we surrendered our home world. Taught since birth to fight and die with a passion more fiery than any bombs that could ever be dropped on our world. We were hopelessly outmatched by the technology the humans brought but what we lacked in weapons we made up for in furry. 
 
 The humans have made a terrible mistake. Instead of killing us of they began to capture us. Thinking that they could make us slaves to rebuild the world after the war that they were sure they had already won. They could never expect what would happen next. 
 
 I think I can hear the humans coming to unlock my cell. So today was the day.
