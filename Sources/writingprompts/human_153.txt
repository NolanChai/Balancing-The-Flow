Once, the world belonged to Gejjet ’ s minions. They soared through the rich skies, diaphanous wings beating and beautiful carapaces gleaming as they danced under a young sun. It was a different world - and in time, the world changed. Gejjet ’ s minions diminished, and with them, his power. 
 
 Then came Uhr-Solvah and the Far Lords, and Gejjet was one of their number. Perhaps he arrived long before the others, or replaced some older, local entity; or he was never one to start with, not until he was recruited. He doesn ’ t say. There is a lot Gejjet doesn ’ t say. 
 
 But Gejjet never forgot. There was a time he was more than just another of Uhr-Solvah ’ s courtiers, and there would be again. And so he set to work, imposing will through subtlety and subterfuge. He did not raise the great temple, but he made it happen. He did not devise the Miasma, but he turned it into a weapon. He discovered and disposed of many threats to the Far Lords; other still he let unfold, watching with satisfaction and evidence of his peers ’ negligence. 
 
 And now, here he stands, second only to Uhr-Solvah himself, fueling his inferiors ’ feuds so that they do not pose a threat while he himself plots and awaits an opportunity. As the gods go to war, Gejjet thinks his time may have finally come. Where others see danger, he sees opportunity. There is power and glory to be gained, new lies and secrets to add to his arsenal. All he has to do is be victorious. And then… 
 
 Once, the world belonged to Gejjet ’ s minions. And when his plans succeed, it will again.
