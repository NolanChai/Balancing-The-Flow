It is almost tea time. Bilbo will be getting thirsty soon. 
 
 > > make tea 
 
 Bilbo can not make tea without a kettle! 
 
 > > make tea with kettle 
 
 You do not have “ kettle ” in your inventory. 
 
 > > get kettle 
 
 You do not see “ kettle ”. Where could it be? 
 
 > > look around 
 
 Bilbo is at home in his hobbit hole. He is standing in a tidy, well-stocked kitchen, as every good hobbit should have. Various cooking utensils and cupboards line the wall. There is also a cozy fireplace with a spot for cooking tea, but the flames have almost gone out. 
 
 > > open cupboard 
 
 Bilbo opens the cupboard to discover some teacups and saucers, a brass kettle, a wedge of cheese, some cakes, a bit of fruit, a roast of ham, and a wooden spoon. Funny, he does not remember putting most of these items here to begin with. At least there is no dust! 
 
 > > take kettle 
 
 The brass kettle reflects the light pleasantly as Bilbo gently lifts it from the cupboard. It has blackened on the bottom from constant use, but he keeps it clean and the rest of it shines as though it were new. 
 
 > > take teacups 
 
 Bilbo takes the teacups and saucers from the cupboard. Some have chipped or cracked over the years, but otherwise it is a fine set. 
 
 > > make tea 
 
 Bilbo does not like to leave his cupboard open. He should close it before doing anything else. 
 
 > > close cupboard 
 
 The cupboard is now closed. 
 
 > > make tea 
 
 Bilbo would love to make some tea, but the fire is too cold. 
 
 > > stoke fire 
 
 Bilbo shifts the coal in the fireplace to let it breath, tossing a bit of kindling on top for good measure. A cozy, steady flame soon warms the room. 
 
 Suddenly, there is a knock at the door. Bilbo recalls that, just yesterday and against his better judgement, he had invited the wizard Gandalf to tea. He must be waiting just outside. 
 
 > > get door 
 
 It would not be wise to remove the door from its hinges and attempt to take it with you. It serves a purpose, after all; besides, it is far too heavy to carry and too large to fit in one ’ s pockets. 
 
 > > answer door 
 
 It is rude to invite a guest for tea and have nothing to serve them! 
 
 > > make tea 
 
 How can one make tea with an empty kettle? 
 
 > > fill kettle 
 
 Bilbo fills the kettle using a stock of fresh water from the kitchen. 
 
 > > make tea 
 
 Bilbo can not make tea without tea leaves. 
 
 > > make tea dammit 
 
 This game does not understand the word “ dammit ”. 
 
 > > get tea leaves 
 
 Where would Bilbo get that? 
 
 > > go left 
 
 Bilbo has entered the pantry, where most of his foods are stocked. There is an ample supply of breads, cheeses, scones and seed-cakes, as well as an assortment of tea leaves. 
 
 > > get tea leaves 
 
 Bilbo takes a bag of tea leaves from the pantry. It has a fresh aroma that reminds him of second breakfast in the garden on a warm summer ’ s day. 
 
 > > make tea 
 
 Bilbo can not make tea in the pantry, but there is a fireplace in the kitchen. 
 
 > > go right 
 
 Bilbo is now standing in the kitchen. Various cooking utensils and cupboards line the wall. There is also a cozy fireplace with a spot for cooking tea; the flames fill the room with warmth and a steady crackling noise as they feed on fresh tinder. 
 
 > > make tea 
 
 The tea leaves need to be inside the kettle to properly make tea. 
 
 > > kjdsfljlskdjfk 
 
 This game does not understand the word “ kjdsfljlskdjfk ” 
 
 > > put tea leaves in kettle 
 
 Bilbo lowers the tea leaves into the kettle water and closes the lid. 
 
 > > make tea 
 
 Bilbo quickly hangs the kettle above the fireplace to heat. 
 
 > > answer door 
 
 Bilbo does not want his guest to know that he has forgotten about inviting anyone to tea. He should set the table first. 
 
 > > set table 
 
 There is no item named “ table ” in Bilbo ’ s inventory, so you can not put it here. 
 
 > > put teacups on table 
 
 Bilbo places two teacups with sauces on the table in the middle of the kitchen: one for himself and an extra for his guest. 
 
 > > answer door 
 
 There are teacups on the table, but not enough cakes for two people. It would be rude not to have any cake for the guests, but Bilbo is certainly not inclined to pass on cake with his tea time if the matter can be helped. He should put out a few extras. 
 
 > > put cake on table 
 
 There is no item called `` cake'' in Bilbo's inventory, so you can not put it there. 
 
 > > go left 
 
 Bilbo has entered the pantry, where most of his foods are stocked. There is an ample supply of breads, cheeses, scones and seed-cakes, as well as an assortment of tea leaves. 
 
 > > take cakes 
 
 Bilbo takes a few cakes from his supply. They look and smell delicious. He is rather hungry now... 
 
 > > go right 
 
 Bilbo is now standing in the kitchen. Various cooking utensils and cupboards line the wall. There is also a cozy fireplace with a spot for cooking tea; the flames fill the room with warmth and a steady crackling noise as they feed on fresh tinder. There are two sauces and teacups on the table. 
 
 > > put cake on table 
 
 Bilbo places an extra cake or two on the table. Now it is set to receive a guest. 
 
 > > answer door 
 
 Much to Bilbo ’ s surprise, it is not Gandalf at the door at all! A dwarf with a blue beard tucked into a golden belt stands at the entrance. He has bright eyes that peer out from beneath a dark green hood. Without invitation, the dwarf enters and hangs his hood and cloak in the hall. He bows low to Bilbo. “ Dwalin at your service! ” 
 
 > > have tea 
 
 Bilbo does not have an item called `` tea'' in his inventory. 
 
 > > take tea 
 
 He may be unexpected, but Bilbo should not leave his guest standing at the doorway. 
 
 > > drink tea 
 
 What, without Dalwin? Bilbo has more manners than that!
