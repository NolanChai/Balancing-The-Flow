I'll tell you what it's like since i've been out of the magic lamp in one word. 
 Hell. 
 Jokes aside, someone seriously put me back in the lamp. I never thought I would be at this level of insanity, the kind that can put a genie back into his dark and excruciatingly lonesome cave of a lamp. I'd rather go insane alone than deal with the ridiculous, pointless wishes of the human race. 
 Usually in storybooks and Disney movies, a genie grants a total of 3 wishes for a certain individual in order to compensate the lamp rescue. 
 However, ladies and gentlemen, this is unfortunately not the case. I am forced to pick and choose which of your asinine wishes are worthy for the day, and forced to remain at my quota for each day. 
 Yes, being a genie is my job as well as my life. I am under constant supervision of my superior whom i've never even met, and I am unable to `` miss the quota'' as some idiots might say. 
 If I were to accidentally `` forget'' to grant just one wish, one wish is all it would take to be the difference between my current physical life and infinite nothingness. 
 All I can say, is that I really appreciate those few people who live their life JUST ENOUGH to wish for few things, instead of everything. 
 
 Oh, and the lottery is about to be mysteriously removed from the planet if I hear one more unemployed, lazy asshole wish to win the lottery. Get off the damn couch and get a job. 
 Even a genie works for a living.
