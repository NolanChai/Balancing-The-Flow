Empty. 
 
 This is what he awoke to. A room devoid of furniture. No sign of where he was. 
 
 No memory prior to awakening. 
 
 `` Where am I?'' faintly rose from his lips, as he examined the spotless floor. A white color that stung the eyes like the sun would. 
 
 Now sitting up, he and took a quick survey of the room. Hoping that something, *anything*, would give him the slightest idea of where he was. 
 
 `` Who am I?'' now more demanding, he arose to feet only to find what he found on the floor. Nothing. 
 
 Feeling defeated he paced the room looking something. What it was, we will never know. *He* did n't even know himself what he was looking for, but was determined to find it. Every inch of the room was inspected hundreds of times over. Banging around to find a hollow spot, whoever put him there must have left some kind of secret door to escape. After what seemed liked hours he finally had enough, found himself a corner of the room that felt the most comfortable even though they were all identical, and sat down. 
 That's when he saw it. 
 
 *Dean. * 
 
 A tiny note card bearing the name in pen written with an almost elegant hand as if someone spent time making sure every curve was as perfect as it could be. Dean. Was it his? Did it belong to the person who left him here? For a moment he thought what Dean could stand for, but later determined it was his name. After examining each letter critically, he flipped the card. 
 
 *You are CAT # 9, * 
 
 *In this room you do not require nourishment or rest. You will not age and you will not die for whatever the length is of your stay in this room. * 
 
 *A door will appear shortly after this card is read. Be warned, the door will decide what your fate is. Life or Death. You will not know what your fate is until the door is open. When you cross the threshold of the door frame you will be free. * 
 
 With a sudden groan that seemed to becoming from every direction, Dean felt helpless as the room began to slowly spin. The door that he was promised had n't appeared. The room began to pick up speed and he started to feel glued to the walls. What was this? Some sick joke? Fearing for his life or what he thought was his life, he clenched his teeth and closed his eyes. 
 
 The room came to an abrupt halt that almost launched him across the small white box. While slowly opening eyes he saw it. 
 
 A door. 
 
 Full sprint to it just to slowly touch the door handle. The door seemed heavy, as if the dark oak wood weighed a thousand pounds. 
 
 
 `` This it. Life or Death. Maybe I'll know where I am if I live.'' 
 
 He took a deep breath, he tried to take all the air in the room and return it as if it was n't good enough to even graze his nostrils. He gripped the handle, it felt foreign to hold it for some reason. Turning it, he grew anxious and quickly pulled to see what the universe had in store for him. 
 
 He collapsed as tears fell down his face. He could n't bear to see what was in front of him. 
 
 The doorway was layered with bricks and with white paint it read: 
 
 *I lied. *
