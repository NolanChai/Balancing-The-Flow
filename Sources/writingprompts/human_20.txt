`` I should've known it was you behind all this.'' 
 
 My voice was calm, but it was a difficult task to hold myself back. The fox was sitting in the middle of the room, his yellow eyes fixed on me. 
 
 Then it got up to four and slowly shook himself and casually nodded. 
 
 `` Archibald, it's been a while.'' 
 
 His deep voice did n't show any emotions. I frowned and looked back the door where I entered, just to find it closed. Great 
 
 `` I guess you must have some negative feelings towards me, my dear Archi.'' It slowly made it's way towards the liquour cabinet at the left side of the ball room. I measured the distance between us. 7 steps. I would be dead before I could even get close to him. I bit my lip and did n't move while countless scenarios played out in my head. 
 
 `` Just so you know, it was nothing personal. It was more of a business decision.'' The fox continued to sniff the different bottles of alcohol at the foot of the table. 
 He was trying to trigger me. And it worked. 
 `` You animal..'' I hissed with discust. 
 
 He let of a slight giggle, then took a deep breath and turned towards me, almost looking like he was sad. What a joke. 
 
 `` Are you ready?'' The fox asked 
 
 `` I'll see you in hell!'' Thats all I managed to add. 
 
 I heard the sound of a shot beeing fired behind me. As I fell to the ground I blinket towards the fox. It was saying something. 
 
 But I did n't hear what the fox said.
