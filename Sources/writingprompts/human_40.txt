`` Sir, we are a race of slimes. How am I expected to get used to these upper and lower limbs?'' 
 
 Captain Ook, the other slime who had successfully managed to invade another human being, was too busy flopping around on the floor like a fish out of water to reply to me. 
 
 With a grunt, I managed to somehow get onto my knees. As I attempted to wobble forward, I immediately faceplanted. 
 
 `` Sir, have we actually done any studies on these human beings? I'm not quite sure if they can slide along just like us superior beings can. I believe the two upper two limbs may be a possible way for humans to move. As for the longer bottom two limbs... Perhaps, they are just like a fish. You need to flick them in the air to propel yourself forward. The upper two limbs... Hm. This is rather perplexing''. 
 
 There was no response. 
 
 `` Captain?'' 
 
 `` tthbbbbbbbbbfft?'' 
 
 The other human blew a raspberry, slapped himself in the face and bit his tongue all at the same time. Clearly, Captain Ook have n't managed to get the hang of his human limbs. 
 
 `` Sir, I think you have made progress on using the tongue and the lower jaws. Remember, send a signal to the lower jaw and the tongue to use speech. Ensure to maintain control as your priority, otherwise the human will attempt to take his body back from you''. 
 
 I could feel a slight tug at the back of my mind. The human was attempting to force his body away from me. Alas, poor human. It must be a terrible feeling, to be such an inferior species with such poor mind control. How could one function if one was unable to invade others mind? I mused on this for a bit as I managed to raise my hand somehow. It flopped to the ground again. 
 
 A human being entered the room. 
 
 `` Dude, are you guys drunk or something? Because if you're not, I have to try whatever you guys are on''. 
 
 `` I give up control of the human being. Subject is too complex. There is four limbs too many on this being. Send message back to the Mothership requesting Earth be left alone as a danger zone'' Captain Ook crisp voice announced in my mind. 
 
 Ooze poured out of the second human body ears and formed into a slime puddle who then attempted to wobble away to safety. The second human just laid there shivering, while the third human being started freaking out and threw the nearest object - a lamp - at the slime. It missed. But the next object, a book, did not. 
 
 `` What the hell is going on!? Dude, am I on LSD again because your brain is like, some weird sort of red slime. Oh dude, can you talk to me at all? I think I killed your brain, man. Hey Joe, what's going on with Aaron here? Did I kill him? I do n't want to go to jail!'' 
 
 The third human being appeared to have a mental break down. Strange, I did n't think there was a third slime trying to invade that one. Perhaps a weak subject. 
 
 `` Requesting Mothership. Beam me up, this Earth appears to be full of idiots who are too stupid to take over. Also Captain Ook just got killed by a book. Humans are clearly dangerous when provoked.''
