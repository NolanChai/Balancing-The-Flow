The first thing I noticed was that I was awake hours before I wanted to be. The source of this annoyance was my hands. They had begun to glow. It looked a bit like somebody had held a camera flash behind my hand, kind of cool that you could just make out the bones and the veins and stuff. I freaked out a little at first, my hands looked like they were about to start melting! I was then vexed by this anomaly, and did all of the things a normal person would do, washing them mostly. They looked almost ok under a bright light, slightly opalescent, but ok. Mum certainly was n't impressed. `` what the hell have you been touching boy?'' First thought was `` ya mum!'' But it did n't really work in this scenario. `` I swear it just happened. I woke up like this!'' `` That one wo n't save you this time Jimmy. Just tell me!'' Dad came to my rescue, and thought it was pretty cool, much to mums annoyance. `` Does it hurt? No? Cool! Lets see if you can set stuff on fire!'' So the first day was spent sticking my hand into petrol and various other flammable solids/liquids/gases, encouraged by my somewhat irresponsible father. I do n't think he thought very far ahead on that one. 
 
 To cut my school day the next day story short, lets just say that we did n't do much learning. Mum told me to keep the gloves on, in the middle of Queensland summer. Which lasted about 5 seconds into my school day. The rest was great. `` how did you do it Jimmy'' `` I dunno.'' `` Come on who gave you your powers?'' `` Ya mum.'' Heh. 
 
 By the third day at school I had made local news. The fourth day men in a van picked me up from my house and drove me to the `` doctors''. I would rather forget the tests they put me through there. 
 
 So there you have it. I'm 21 now, and I am working as a zero hour electrician. I was made for it, you could say. All I have to show for my hand powers are a couple of nearly-forgotten nights on SNL type shows, a few scars on my hands the government has forbidden me to talk about, some convenient roots on a night on the town, and of course, the glowing hands. 
 
 The book I wrote got panned, too audacious apparently. Whatever. I have `` super'' powers. Electrician man, away! 
 
 EDIT: Punctuation. A `` root'' is Australian for sex.
