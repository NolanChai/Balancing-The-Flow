I turned the key into the lock of my crummy, 20 sq foot apartment door. I was hoping that maybe, just maybe, I'd be lucky enough to die as soon as I open it. 
 *clank* 
 
 Nope, no such luck. 
 
 Working a retail job is soul-crushing, and it does n't help that I work for a McDonalds/KFC/PizzaHut combo with a bunch of self serving kiosks where I'm the only human employee. It could be worse though, I could've been a truck driver last year just as Elon Musk's AutoBahn driverless cars were announced. That would've sucked. 
 
 Whatever, I'm home now, time to heat up a frozen pizza in the oven and commence my nightly ritual. 
 
 Maybe I'll just order Chinese tonight instead of making pizza? Lem me check my bank statement. Thankfully I have the Chase App so it wo n't cost me anything. 
 
 `` Balance: 0.15'' 
 
 `` Fuck'' I say audibly. I thought I got paid today, but todays Thursday, not Friday. Whatever, frozen pizza is fine. 
 
 I load up a gaming channel on youtube and carve up my frozen pizza. I actually remember when the internet was n't pay-per-click. I guess back in those days you had to pay for broadband separately though, cause it was n't government funded. I think that's how it was anyway, my dad took care of all that stuff. My $ 40 monthly click plan usually lasts though, so I guess it evens out, and it helps conserve bandwidth space by forcing websites to host less pages. Still though, I remember surfing on my PSP when I was 10 or 11, trying to find `` boobies'' on yahoo, my prolific monkey spanking career would've cost me at least a good grand or two before I even entered high school if I paid for all those clicks. 
 
 Which reminds me, it's time for that part of the night. I guess I'll load up the videos section on bing and grab the cocoa butter. 
 
 `` WARNING: CLICKBANK IS EMPTY, FURTHER WEB CLICKS WILL RESULT IN A DIRECT DEBIT FROM BANK ACCOUNT'' 
 
 Shit. I need to do this in 15 clicks or less. I hate life. 
 
 No problem, I can do this. As long as I have the app open on my phone, I can keep track without going over. This is gon na be just fine. Unless of course, I go over and incur a $ 50 overdraft fee. Than this meat-beat would cost me 50 dollars, and that's just not right. I can probably just get off with one video, right? Yeah, one video is fine! People used to use DVDs and stuff, or magazines, I'll just bing search one video, boom, Midget Polyamory Island 5, a classic, and done. I wo n't click anything else. This is fine, I have 13 cents left and I'm, I'm not getting hard. No, this is trash. I need more. Well maybe I'll just, I know! I'll search up Asa Akira. She gets me off in like, a minute. Alright, into the search engine you go, Asa Akira Anal Asian Aqua Academy loaded up, and with 11 cents to spare. This is pretty sweet. 
 
 `` SKYPE CALL: MOM'' 
 
 What??!? 
 
 `` SKYPE CALL: MOM'' 
 
 Shit shit shit, it's her fucking birthday and I forgot! I ca n't let her see me like this, I'll just click decline and call her after this. 
 
 `` WARNING: BALANCE IS NOW 0 DOLLARS and 10 CENTS'' 
 
 What the fuck that counted as a click? Alright, compose yourself, return to the video, and finish the job. You know all that stress kinda made me lose interest. Shit. I wonder what Angela from high school is up to these days. Maybe a quick Facebook search... right..Puerto Rico vacation album... there we go. Alright, I'm digging this. 
 
 `` WARNING: BALANCE IS NOW 0 DOLLARS AND 5 CENTS'' 
 
 Shit, FUCK, I got ta make this picture work, alright, alright. Stay calm. Maybe if I have the picture and the video playing at the same time. 
 
 Ok, sweet. This is actually going pretty well. Asa's about to finish, and so am FUCK, I got a pop-up, really? 
 
 Oh Christ, it's one of those infinite dialogue pop-ups. Just hit `` prevent this page from creating additional dialogs'', ok. Back to the goods and I am
