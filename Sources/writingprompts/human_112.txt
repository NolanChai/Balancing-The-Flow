The bus was late. 
 
 An old lady sat down next to me, smelling faintly of cat piss. My headphones were in my ears but that did n't stop her from talking to me, so of course I had to take them out. So I listened to her. She complained about everything. The weather, the bus, her children, her grandchildren, and someone else's grandchildren. I nodded as she spoke to seem interested, cause I really was n't. 
 
 I stood up as one bus passed, `` Not in Service.'' Goddammit I just took out my metro card. From down the block I though it was the bus. I turned to sit back down but an old man was in my seat chatting up the old broad. Oh well, I guess I did n't want to sit anyway. I stood on the outskirts of the bus stop, smoking a cigarette now. It tasted terrible. I had forgotten that I wanted to give up smoking. Shit, I was on my second one already. Where was the bus? 
 
 I heard the rumble of the engine and peek out into the street to see if its a bus. It was a garbage truck. It rolls on past me, filling my nostrils with a putrid mix of garbage and cold air. I do n't know what it is about the cold, but it makes the garbage smell that much worse. 
 
 My watch flickers 9:27. I'm a thirty minutes late now. Great. I pick up my phone and call my office, `` Hey, I called this morning saying I was going to be late. I'm going to be a bit later now. The bus, yeah. It's taking forever, I do n't know. Yeah I'll call 311. See you in a bit.'' 
 
 I did n't call 311. If I was going to be late, I'd rather be late in ignorance. 
 
 I peak over at the bus stop and the old man and lady were gone. Probably off to swinger's night at the old folks home, I do n't know. Nor do I care. I sit down and slouch against the glass wall of the bus stop and stare out into the road. Car after car rolls by, how sweet it'd be to have a car. 
 
 But where would I get the money? 
 
 So I sit and I sit until a bus finally pulled up, forty-seven minutes late. I stand as the doors open and drop my MetroCard as I'm greeted by the ass of some Chinese man wearing a TD Bank hat. He turned and smiled, standing on the stairwell of an over crowded bus. `` Next bus,'' the bus driver croaks as he closed the doors and drove off. 
 
 I sat back down and held back the desire to curse at every single person who even glanced my way.
