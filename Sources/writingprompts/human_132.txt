In the corner of the small, unkept bedroom there was a man on a bed, with the covers drawn about him. He gazed fearfully at a globe on a table across the room. The globe, somehow ominously, was slowly rotating of its own accord. 
 
 It had started out as a hacking project... take a small computer, a flexible OLED display, some small motors, etc., and build a real-time Earth display. Show day night cycles, maybe do some eclipse simulations, dynamic clouds based on available satellite imagery, that sort of thing. And, barring a seam here and there, it had been pretty good, at first. 
 
 But then, somehow, the globe got'fuzzy' and close inspection revealed it had an envelope of whispy gas around it. The seams of the OLED display flattened, softened, then faded. The elements of the display shrunk well below the ability of the human eye to spot - even with a microscope. Scott knew, because he'd checked. All the data enhancements he'd added to the display, like political borders, city markers, and such... they too faded away. 
 
 That was weird. He'd known that was weird. He tried looking at the display seam he knew ran through the Pacific using a penlight and a magnifying glass. Instead of seeing black, he saw what looked suscpiciously like a relief map of the ocean floor. *He had n't even programmed that yet*. 
 
 He'd thought maybe friends were pranking him or something, until he heard the news reports - tensions between China and the US going through the roof because an American ship had been crippled by a searing light in the sky that blinded all exposed to it. 
 
 So he had retreated to his bed in the corner, watching the world turn and too terrified to approach it.
