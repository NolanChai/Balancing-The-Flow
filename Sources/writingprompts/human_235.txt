I would like to see a heartwarming finale, something that really shows why the show is ending and not just a big send off with a bunch of clips and side character pop-ins. A few of the older episodes of the Simpsons really had their emotional moments and I feel like that's the only way to end it. I would like to see something truly devastating hit Homer like maybe a divorce, someone close to him dying or one of the kids really laying into him. At rock bottom Homer realizes that he's the only one to blame for his lower than average station in life. Homer goes to Moe's bar and informs Moe that he needs his help and that he probably wo n't be coming back after this. Moe agrees to help him. The next day Homer goes home, walks in the front door and asks Marge if she would speak to him privately. Homer sits Marge down, looks her in the eyes and says `` look Marge, I've been a really, really bad husband to you over the years and I've done some things that I'm not proud of and even the stuff I am proud of is pretty terrible. I've done a lot of stuff behind your back and I need to confess something to you, and I'll understand if you never want to see me again after this'', `` Homie, what is it?''... Homer takes deep breath, reaches into his pocket, and puts something into Marge's hand and closes her fingers around it. Marge slowly opens her hand to revile a powder blue crayon, she looks up `` Homer... is this?'' Homer looks up at her, she continues `` is this from your brain?''... Homer says `` pour vous, it's a promise. From this moment on I'm going to be the man you deserve... no more jerkass Homer''. Marge falls forward into Homers arms sobbing `` oh Homer!'' Shot fades to black, words fly in over a new intro `` one year later''. Homer's at the plant working, actually working. Bart is n't in detention, Lisa is in a real music program where her jazzy antics are applauded instead of being kicked out, Marge and older Maggie are driving home in a newer car. Couch gag: Everyone runs in and hugs. The next scene would be a typical Simpsons morning, Homer's getting ready for work kids are sitting in front of the tv and Marge is cooking breakfast. Short time skip later, At the breakfast table everyone is sitting around eating. Lisa says `` Dad, do n't forget my recital tonight'', Homer `` I'll be there! ``, Lisa `` I know you will dad, I know''. Bart gets up and runs off, Homer yells `` And where are you off to boy! ``, Bart yells back `` I left the homework you helped me with upstairs!''. As Bart is running to his bedroom you can see Grandpa Simpson coming out of the bathroom, Bart says `` morning grandpa, you slept through breakfast again and dad ate all the bacon'', Abe `` Yeah well back at the home breakfast was at 9''. Bart stops, `` it ca n't be all bad living here can it? ``, Abe `` nah, not all bad''. Back at the breakfast table Homer stands up, kisses Marge on the head and walks to the back door grabbing his keys off the key ring and turns around to say `` I'm off to work, see you all tonight''. Pans back to the remaining Simpson family eating. Maggie, in her highchair says `` Bye bye Daddy''. Fade to black, the end.
