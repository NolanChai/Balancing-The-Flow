Once upon a time long long ago, in a land far far away, there was a King who had no telepathic powers. No one did, in his entire kingdom and in all the other kingdoms surrounding his. Communication was done with organs that created airwaves, and interpreted them, so it was very inefficient. When people brought problems to him, there was much confusion. Needs could never be fully met because during deliberation, which is something they had to constantly, they either could n't be fully expressed or were intentionally overlooked by others. Every one had the ability to withhold information, and they could tell `` lies,'' falsehoods that with some cunning could be made into truths. 
 
 And in this weird land, this King somehow kept order. That is, he did until one day, when his people caught him telling a lie and `` killed'' him, made him cease to exist.
