I looked down at the bloody pile of meat. It had been, at one point, a guy named Joseph Walker. It was still making slight wheezing noises, desperately trying to suck breath even after everything that had happened to him. After *I* happened to him. 
 
 This was actually kind of a rare treat, though. It was 3:20 in the morning, I had nothing left to do, and I had someone to talk to. 
 
 For the next few minutes or so, at least. 
 
 I fished out a cigarette from my jacket and lit it. I might as well indulge myself a little. After a long drag, knelt down beside it and gave it a crooked smile. 
 
 `` Today just was n't your day, huh?'' I joked. Gurgle in response. `` You know, the funny thing is, if your name was Jennifer Torres, you probably would n't even be in this mess.'' I stopped and pulled off one of my gloves. There, as it had been for the past ten years, was the name *Jennifer Torres*. `` Y'see, it took some time- this shit always does- but I realized that this one name on my hand meant billions of other people *weren't*. Billions of people I was cosmically fated to not give a shit about. You just had the bad luck of being one of those guys not named Jennifer. Not your fault. Hell, not even my fault, either.'' 
 
 Shit, my cigarette was nearly out. Better wrap this up. 
 
 I stood back up. The wheezing was getting slower. `` Hell of a thing to spring on a thirteen year old. My ma and pa hated it- I was going to be soulmates with a fuckin' mexican? They beat that idea out of me pretty enthusiastically'' I flashed it one last smile. This one was more forced- I had to say it. It was n't a secret, but it had to be said. `` Their little girl was n't gon na be no gay, neither.''
