You know the sort of suit that you look so good in that you want to be buried in it? A stark black suit that fit in all the right places. The kind you see in television or magazines, the one that others wore to make you want to be like them. Yeah, this was that kind of suit. A suit that I'd never worn. It hung in the closet waiting for a day that would never come. It hung there, lonely, covered in ash and debris as my atrophied digits ran the length of the sleeve. I lifted it from the offset bar with difficulty. It was heavier and larger than I remembered. The condition of the closet did n't help matters much either. 
 
 In the smoke filtered light, I saw it as I had on the first day. It was handsome. I felt more attractive just being close to it. That was a hard thing to come by, being as I was. I imagined that it smelled terrible. It had to reek of death. A morbid thought that would have brought a smile to my face, if I had one. In fact, I was doing well to see or smell the suit at all. Even feeling the sleek fibers against my skin was a task I was no longer suited for. I feel that I would have laughed, or cried, or thrown a fit of rage, had I been able to. It was all so strange. 
 
 “ It's a shame, ” I thought to myself, remembering the suit longingly as I'd seen it through my unspoiled gaze. I was certain that it would n't fit anymore, even if I'd tried it on. I would have to stick with just my bare bones.
