**We wander around the house, thinking to Ourselves: ** 
 
 Well, We're back home. Christmas. Again. With them... 
 
 
 We come back every year. They are family, after all. Remember, Mom and Dad said they'd retire and move somewhere nice after We left for college. Why did they stay? 
 
 
 I guess maybe because of Us? 
 
 No. 
 
 *Yeah! * We're their only child. This is where We grew up, they do n't want to leave. This is how they remember Us after We left. 
 
 
 *God* they're clingy. 
 
 **What's this door? We think it looks familiar** 
 
 Wait what? 
 
 
 **We stop wandering: ** 
 
 `` Mom!?'' 
 
 **She tells Us to wait** 
 
 No I do n't wan na wait mom, get over here. 
 
 `` MOM!?'' 
 
 **Nothing** 
 
 Ugh forget it she's with Aunty. 
 
 What is this? 
 
 We've seen this before, We've definitely seen this before... Right? 
 
 Yes, of course you have. 
 
 I do n't think so. 
 
 Do n't be stupid We grew up here. 
 
 But I do n't *remember* 
 
 Do you remember Our birth? 
 
 What? No. 
 
 So then I guess it did n't happen, right? 
 
 Shut up -- God I'm caustic. Even to myself. 
 
 Yeah, well, that's what you get for being schizophrenic 
 
 I did n't choose to be -- 
 
 `` Meh meh, I did n't ask for this, meh, whine whine whine'' *Pfffffft* 
 
 This is n't a gam- 
 
 Just go in! 
 
 OKAY

 What are you waiting for? 
 
 Nothing. 
 
 Then go in. 
 
 Fine! 
 
 **I've finally built up the strength to grab the door handle** 
 
 Finally 
 
 **He says, as if he would n't be scared. He forgets he's still me** 
 
 Okay? 
 
 *'' Okay? `` * 
 
... C'mon! 
 
 What!? 
 
 Turn it! 
 
 Okay! 
 
 **I turn the handle and push it open** 
 
 **It's pitch black** 
 
... Okay! Let's go! 
 
 Stop. 
 
 What? There's nothing. 
 
 Wait. 
 
. 
 
. 
 
. 
 
 Turn on the light 
 
 **Shit** 
 
 ***click*** 
 
 **We both say simultaneously, in a hushed exclamation: ** 
 
 ^^^WHAT? 
 
 **It's Our room. Not Our childhood room. It's Our room back home, in Chicago. How did they know what it looks like? We walk in. Everything's the same. Our laptop is right where We left it. Our window is still open. That glass of water is still on Our night stand. How did they do this? How did they know** 
 
 ***SLAM*** 
 
 **The door is closed shut by the wind, and the light again go out** 
 
 Oh my god... 
 
 Get Us out of here! 
 
 Okay! Okay! 
 
 **I open the door, the lights are off** 
 
 ***click*** 
 
 **We're home! ** 
 
 We're home. 
 
 **We thought** 
 
 We're home? 
 
 **I thought** 
 
 Apartment 12K... This is Our house 
 
 How? 
 
 I do n't know. 
 
 **We walked to the living room** 
 
 **We gasp** 
 
 Mom? Dad? 
 
 **I think**
