`` So, the woman shown in the video never clearly shows her face. So we have no way of identifying her.'' 
 
 Detective Rand leaned back into his chair, taking a moment before meeting my eye. `` I'm sorry we still do n't have a lot to go on. The build of the woman does n't match anyone your wife had dealings with, I think her presence there is a mere coincidence.'' 
 
 ``....'' 
 
 `` Although we will keep trying to find her to confirm, of course'' 
 
 `` So....'' 
 
 He was squirming now. `` I'm afraid there's nothing left to follow up on.'' 
 
 `` I euhm...'' I cleared my throat. `` I guess that's it then'' I made to stand 
 
 `` I'm sorry mister Jackson, the murder of your wife and daughter was brutal. And we will keep hunting whoever did it. But right now....'' He stood up, fumbled in his desk for a moment and held out a card. `` I know you said you do n't need this, but I recommend you call them.'' 
 
 He looked kind of awkward holding the little card out at arms length `` They can really help. No traces, no motive and no suspect. Just a bunch of stereo equipment missing.'' 
 
 He shook his head `` Looks ever more like a snatch-and-grab gone bad. Losing this much to that kind of randomness can get into your head'' 
 
 There was a knock at the door, but I did n't look up. Grief counsellor. `` Thanks but I do n't go in for head shrinking.'' 
 
 `` That's what he said. Says it helped him loads now though, right Michael?'' A man was standing in the door opening, smiling. Tall, slender build, leaning on the door post in an almost coquettish pose. 
 
 `` Sorry, I hope I'm not interrupting anything.'' There was a quick look to detective Rand and he quickly tucked his smile away. `` I mean euhm, yeah. Someone came in to our house and murdered my mother one night. It's euhm... it's been hard. The group really helps''. He was trying for disarming smile now. 
 
 `` Did they ever catch the guy?'' 
 
 `` Nah, no traces. Everyone pissed enough at her to do it was out of town. Fucker took the toaster too.'' He shook his head. `` One of them random acts I suppose. Hard to get your head round'' 
 
 I stuck out my hand moving to pass him in the door `` Well, I hope you get closure.'' 
 
 `` Thank you'' he said as he took my hand and shook it. 
 
 He turned his body to the side letting me pass through the door. 
 
 `` No, thank you''
