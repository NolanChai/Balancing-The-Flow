I think I may have punched myself in the face too hard, but the instructions were not specific. That's the problem with this book - it does n't explain anything well. 
 
 I've been pacing myself in reading it since my eighteenth birthday last month. There are only about a hundred suggestions or so and I do n't want to burn through them too fast. Not that there's a guide on how often your supposed to read and follow through with the actions. If I had n't been raised to revere this book, I might have begun to doubt it's merits. I think my nose is broken, although I'm not sure if that was a result of running into a tree full-sprint or attempting a front flip on skis. Maybe I just broke it twice. 
 
 Each day at school, I see more and more of my classmates coming in with injuries of varying severity. I'd love to take a ganger at Mike's book. How he ended up cutting his ear off, I could n't guess. Although, reading another's book would be an automatic death sentence. We all knew that. 
 
 No, I'll just have to wonder. I think my book has started to watch me now. It has a certain presence when I enter my room. The presence becomes more menacing until I open it. 
 
 I swipe the dust off of the cover and turn it open and flip to the post-it note on page thirty. 
 
 BITE SOMEONE. *HARD. * 
 
 Great. Up until now, the only pain I had inflicted has been upon myself. I can deal with that, I guess, although I'm not sure how long for. 
 
 Sometimes, I find myself wondering what exactly this book is trying to teach me. I know we're not supposed to talk about it openly, but I do n't think it's breaking the rules to ponder over it. 
 
 Pain seems to be the consistent element in mine. Can I now appreciate when I do n't have a fork sticking out of my arm? Not having a fork sticking out of my arm does seem pretty great, I must admit. And I do n't remember feeling this way before the book. 
 
 `` Tim,'' I say across the lunchtable. 
 
 `` Yeah,'' answers my friend, looking over the sneaker he's sipping soup out of. The steam is fogging his glasses. 
 
 `` Never mind.''
