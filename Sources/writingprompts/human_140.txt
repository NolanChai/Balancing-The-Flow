It was n't until about the 5th floor I noticed something strange about the elevator I was in. There was a tiny man in the corner huddled in the foetal position. I wondered how id failed to initially notice his presence. This is a pretty rough city so I mind my own business. 
 
 After an amount of time that any same sober individual would know they had been traveling upwards at a continuous rate that far exceeded the height of any building, I began to grow concerned. I reached for the elevator keypad and punched in 5. The cafeteria was on 5. That was where I had been going until this peculiar run of events, which was now making me question my sanity. The button responded to my press with a bland sound of denial. I tried six, and seven, which proceeded to produce slightly different pitches of denial. 
 
 It was then that I saw the button with the question mark. Do I press it? Do I turn my attention to the tiny man in the corner? Maybe he could weigh in. I'd become ignorant of his presence. Fuck, maybe this guy is dead. I prod him with the tip of my shoe and he grunts into life with a cough and a fart. He squints up at me. `` You woke me up.'' 
 
 I assess the button with the question mark again. The tiny man has returned to his eternal slumber. Turns out that was a false lead. It's been around half an hour now and I figure we must be nearing the outer atmosphere which is troubling. 
 
 To the contrary, upon flipping a panel in the elevator ceiling I discovered we are, in fact, zooming through what appears to be some type of wormhole. Not sure I should've looked to be honest. I finally give in and press the button, eyes closed as I pull the trigger.
