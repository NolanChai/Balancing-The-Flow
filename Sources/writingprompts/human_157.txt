It was my third date with Hannah. I made reservations at a fairly pricey restaurant and combed my beard for the occasion. We walked down the side walk, close enough to show people we were together, but far enough apart to look casual. She was telling me a funny story about work when I caught something out of the corner of my eye. 
 A girl, leaning against the window of a book store. 
 She was wearing orange shorts, calf high, mustard yellow socks, and a black spaghetti strap tank top. Her hair, she had evidently cut herself, was a brown, chin length, hack job and her bangs were so short they stuck out, up, over her forehead. She was smoking a hand rolled cigarette and looked at me with'fuck off' eyes through her crooked black glasses. I had never seen someone who so truly did not care one bit about what I, or anyone for that matter, thought of her. The oddly assembled outfit and kid scissor hair cut, to way her posture curved inward and her glasses were slipping off one ear. 
 I looked at Hannah, looked down at myself, and realized I had never seen someone so pure and true to them self. Someone who existed for herself and herself alone.
