As I sat on my bunk, thoughts rushed through my head: 
 
 *What if I ca n't beat him? * 
 
 *There's literally nothing I'm good at! * 
 
 *Why can I hear myself thinking? * 
 
 But as I sat there and pondered, an idea came to the forefront of my mind. It was devious, cunning... everything deserving of an evil laugh. I began in earnest, but almost immediately a guard poked his head in and yelled `` NEIN! Zat is our job! 10 BEATINGS FOR EVERYONE!'' 
 
 
 
 
 
 *Dammit. * 
 
 Well anyway, back to the story. 
 
 The duel was scheduled for 9:00 that evening, and I had to prepare. I worked myself down to the bone all day, harder than I'd ever worked before. Now, you may be wondering, `` Would n't working so hard be a disadvantage?'' Maybe, but I had a plan. It was devious, cunning... *wait better stop myself there. * 
 
 The rest of the day passed in a flurry of hard work, bad food, and screaming Germans. 9:00 rolled around, and the whole camp was summoned to the main courtyard. The general stepped out from a block of soldiers, and beckoned me out of the crowd. As I stepped forward, the general laughed and boomed out `` Vell then, ze mighty challenger approaches! What is your trial? I shall best you at it with ease!'' I smirked and called out `` I challenge you... to do nothing.'' 
 
 *cricket cricket* 
 
 `` Wait... vat?'' 
 
 `` You heard me. You might as well call it a lazy-off, if that would help.'' 
 
 The general stood stock still, in abject confusion. He straightened, shook himself, and met my gaze. `` Very well. I accept your challenge.'' I clapped my hands and gleefully exclaimed `` Alrighty then! Let's get started. Lie down, first one to move loses.'' We slammed to the floor, and the competition began. For two days and three nights the battle raged, with absolutely no sound coming from either competitor. At the beginning of the third day, the general threw himself up and out the door, screaming `` ZIS IS MADNESS!'' all the way to the capital. All the prisoners burst out laughing, and the soldiers opened the gates and kicked me out. 
 
 I closed the diary with a satisfied look on my face, and turned to the history students. `` And that's how I turned the Germans into workaholics.''
