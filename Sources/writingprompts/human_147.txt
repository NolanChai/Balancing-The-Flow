As I sat down at the breakfast table with a feeling of dread, my mother hurried into the kitchen only to return a moment later with a cake crowned by candles. In unison my parents started singing as she set it down on the table in front of me. 
 
 `` Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you...'' 
 
 I could not feel happy that day. How could I? All I could do is stare at the candles on the cake forming the number 18. 
 
 `` May luck go with you, and happiness too!'' they finished. 
 
 `` You look tired. I remember when I turned 18, I did not sleep well either. But I felt so... energized! Ready to take on anyone, anything, to find and conquer your mother! Son? Are you listening?'' 
 
 I had not even realized my father had been talking to me. I snapped out of it and glanced at my parents for the first time this morning. My father and mother, sitting side-by side on the bench on the other side of the table. Her, resting her hand gently on his arm, leaned slightly against him. Still in love like the first day they met. Him, looking concerned, straight into my eyes. 
 
 I looked away, mumbling: `` Yeah, just a bit tired.'' and blew out the candles. 
 
 `` So who did you dream off?'' my mother asked eagerly. `` Was it that friend from school you have been visiting a lot recently? When are you going to introduce us, by the way?'' 
 
 `` No...'' I answered glumly. 
 
 `` You do not have to be shy about it. Even if you do not know the girl from your dreams yet, one day you will meet and you will be happy ever after. You do not have to stay single in the meantime. It is how it has always been,'' she stated cheerfully. 
 
 `` Mom, it is not like that...'' I started but ended in silence. 
 
 My father broke the silence after a brief moment: `` Ever since we adopted you we have always wanted for you to be happy. You know about the birthday vision. It shows the person you are guaranteed to love, the one you will be happy with. So what if it is a boy, we do n't care.'' 
 
 `` That's not the problem.'' I interjected. 
 
 `` But who did you see in your dreams?'' she asked, leaning forward, growing concern on her face. 
 
 `` Myself.'' 
 
 My parents looked at each other for a moment. Finally, my father started: `` But... that's impossible... there has never been anyone...'' 
 
 `` Yes. I am destined to be the first. The only one! The most selfish being in the universe, destined to never truly love, to never be loved, to grow old and die and...'' 
 
 `` Please, honey, calm down, it is going to be alright!'' my mother interrupted me and hurried around the table to put her arms around me. I had not even realized I had risen from my seat and started to shout. Slowly I lowered myself back onto the chair. 
 
 `` The only one, alone, forever...'' I started, close to tears. 
 
 My mother put her hand on my shoulder: `` Shh, shhh, tell us what you dreamed of.'' 
 
 `` It... it started shortly after midnight. It was so real. Like I was talking to another person. I woke up a few times but whenever I fell back to sleep they were back with me instantly. At first I did not know who it was, it felt like I had always known this person, yet not really known them before. We had conversations. Meaningful, emotional, conversations like I never had with any other person before. And as we talked the image and voice grew clearer, until it sounded like I was talking to myself, until I looked into his face and what I saw was just a mirror image of myself. Just myself. I'll be alone and miserable forever.'' 
 
 My father's phone began to buzz. He took it, accepted the call and went out into the corridor. 
 As I stared blankly at the slice of cake that had somehow appeared on my plate I heard him talk quietly on the phone in the corridor outside. 
 `` You're who? But that's impossible.'' 
 `` What? Who gave you this number?'' 
 `` The adopt...'' 
 `` How... alright.'' 
 He came back in and handed me the phone: `` It is for you.'' 
 
 I took the phone and put it to my ear. 
 `` Hello.'' 
 There it was. The voice from my dreams. My voice. My heart began to race. 
 `` Who is this? Is this some joke?'' 
 `` No, I am calling to congratulate. Happy birthday, twin brother.''
