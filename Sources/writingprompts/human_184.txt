after a hard day's work writing down those numbers, Jack Palanquin was very much looking forward to his dinner break. It was his routine to not eat dinner at work, preferring to make his own meal after quitting time. However he did still relish the idea of a lovely snack and refreshing beverage from the vending machine to keep him running on all slinders for the rest of the day. 
 
 You can imagine, then, his disgust at seeing his usual preferred snack ( Cadbury's Chocolate Plippers ) replaced with something else entirely! in the machine. 
 
 `` What in God's name'' he said, seeing the wretched creature press its face up against the glass. He had not felt such disgust in a long time, not since he watched a documentary about ape cannibalism. `` Ca n't get me Plippers!'' he complained out loud. 
 
 He immediately did an about face and marched into the Services office. The head custodian, Janice Plants, was a good friend of his, so it took little time for her to accompany him back to the vending machine. 
 
 `` Oh, not again'' sighed Janice. `` Hang on Jack, this should n't take a minute''. She stabbed at the keypad on the machine, with a quickness and precision that could only have come from practice. The machine clanked, and emitted a semi-loud siren for a second. Then the glass section began to fill with a horrible looking black smoke, rising from the bottom. It filled the machine and stayed that way for thirty seconds, all the while making hissing and clicking noises. Jack told Janice a joke about plums to pass the time. 
 
 When the smoke descended, there was no trace of the creature, until Janice opened the flap to remove a few small bones. Jack happily ordered his Plippers, and a can of Redbull Passion Fruit Flavour, and took them off to eat in the canteen.
