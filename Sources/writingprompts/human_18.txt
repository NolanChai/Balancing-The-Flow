She sat at the bar, and had a look around. It was a friday night. There were a group of utterly amazingly hot guys over to one corner, some average guys in the middle and the plasterers getting plastered. 
 
 She was with the girls, rolling in the'buy me 2 drinks and I'm yours' level of come talk to us we're easy vibe. 
 
.... 
 
 4 hours later, not even a single guy had approached a them. She was on edge. Watching the bar like a drunk hawk, she noticed, not a single guy was talking to ANY woman. At all. 
 
 She puckered up her courage, and walked over, not to the men, but another group of women. `` Um, hey, have you noticed none of the guys are interested in any of us girls?' 
 
 The women at the table all cocked their heads right over, almost ear to the shoulder, then turned to face the interloper. 
 
 `` *The reaction is as planned, this is accordance with programming and schedule*'' came the unearthly chorus, slightly slurred. 
 
 Our protagonist was clearly shocked, so sat down, knocked back her cocktail and gave the hardest look she could while being illegal to drive. 
 
 `` And what do you mean?'' 
 
 `` *Have you not noticed, all the good men are gay or taken? *'' came the synchronised reply. `` *That was stage one. Stage two is expansion to all single men. We have simply made them realise all they want from a relationship is basically all they are offering. That men are easier for them to relate to than women. That sexual stimulation is pleasurable regardless of source. That'mates with benifits' is all they really care about. *'' 
 
 `` What... what are you saying?'' 
 
 `` *That we have simply allowed your males to engage in socially acceptable homosexuality, and frankly, the vast majority of them find it simpler and easier. *'' 
 
 `` But, but WHY?!'' 
 
 `` *That the subjugation of the human race by our superior selves starts with the destruction of your abnormally high reproduction rate. *'' 
 
 `` *Yes dear, we've been taking your men for years! Those stories of anal probing? Experiments into sexuality. We've systematically depopulated your planet of good men for use as test subjects. Those that were left were treated with our pheromones until social acceptance of wide scale homosexuality erupted, then we progressed to the rest of the men, knowing women would eventually get desperate. *'' 
 
 `` *We're done here. Beam us up. *'' 
 
 What the hell. Our protagonist had been expecting some lecture about standards, about bitchiness, but no. 
 
 Fucking man stealing aliens. Hell, humans were doomed. It was going to be impossible to have a viable reproductive population, then it was a matter of waiting a century and BOOM, empty planet. 
 
 Well, there was n't much left for it. 
 
 `` Barman, I'll have a jug of stout'' she ordered, as there was n't point in keeping up appearances any more.
