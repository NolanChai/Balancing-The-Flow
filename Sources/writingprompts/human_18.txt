'Hey Sally come look at what I found, I buried it in the back garden years ago.'.

'Wow, that's.. well amazing, fuck look - just there, all the detail you put into that peice.' 
 
'I know, quick pass me that magnifying glass from Dads tool box. Aww, look it's got some living creatures on it.' 
 
'What are they?' 
 
'I ca n't quite remember. In fact I always made a note of everything and taped it to the inside of the box, wait a sec.' 
 
'Ahh yes here we go,' 
 
 
 `Dear Tim of the Future, ` 
 
 `This is your creativity box, what lies within is a place you called the universe. Two creatures reside within, Humans and Animons, let them develop and provide help when needed.` 
 
'Fuck.'
