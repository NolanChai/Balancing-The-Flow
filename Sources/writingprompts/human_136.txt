**A [ pathetic ] Tragedy** 
 
 
 
 `` And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.'' Rev. 12:9 
 
 It's no surprise we do n't have souls, it was right in front of us all along. As offspring of fallen angels, we can not be saved. Earth is Hell, and we are it's minions. 
 
 And here I am, staring our *true* creator and father right in the eyes. The wooden handle of the blade in my right hand was smooth and worn. It was blade heavy, but not uncomfortable. 
 
 `` You know I ca n't be killed. There are worse fates than being in Hell. Do you truly want to die here today?'' Lucifer asked. 
 
 `` If I have no soul, I ca n't be damned for eternity, right?'' 
 
 `` Just because you do n't have one in your mortal life, does n't mean you are n't given one in your eternal life. As they say, *God works in mysterious ways*,'' Lucifer said. 
 
 `` So I hear,'' I said. `` But if you die, humanity will no longer have a leader. We will be thrust upon the gates of Heaven and God will be forced to hear us!'' 
 
 `` Assuming he is listening,'' Lucifer said. He smirked and shrugged his shoulders as if saying *what can ya' do? * 
 
 `` He has to hear us, he has to. Billions of us banging on the gates of Heaven, demanding to be let in. He ca n't ignore our numbers!'' 
 
 `` And you, silly human, can not be saved. If I die, humanity dies. To be human is to be born of both good and evil, present, past, and future. True free will to grow without the fetters of an aligned soul -- or a soul at all. If you take that away... you cease to exist as you know it and your cries for help will fall on deaf ears. He is not listening.'' 
 
 `` Then why have n't you killed me, then? Save yourself the trouble.'' 
 
 `` Maybe this is a test,'' Lucifer said. `` Perhaps this is how your *God* and I judge those worthy of a soul.'' 
 
 `` Lies,'' I whispered. I thrust my arm forward, my knife sinking deep into Lucifer's flesh. The knife did n't stop at the hilt; in fact, it did n't stop at my hand. I was up to my elbow in Lucifer's throat, somehow. 
 
 `` A pity,'' he said. He looked down at me with sad eyes and a sad smile. I felt his heartbreak. He wrapped his arms around me, and his warmth permeated through my entire being. For a moment there was a flicker of something *new*, a feeling of wholeness before the blackness engulfed me.
