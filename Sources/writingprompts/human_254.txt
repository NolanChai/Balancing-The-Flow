I groan as I roll out of bed. Another day, trapped. 
 
 Mom feeds me breakfast, smiling her usual smile as she talks about what the old ladies at church had been discussing. Heedless of the struggles going on in my head. I eat my eggs and bread in silence, trying to stay as small, as invisible as possible. I don ’ t say very much… perhaps that was why I didn ’ t have the usual scars that cover everyone else? 
 
 I pass by the store on my way to school, making sure not to linger for too long, not let my brother get suspicious. I stare wistfully at the dresses and necklaces, so elegant and pretty. But my parents would never let me have such things. I glance down at my jeans and sweatshirt, hating how it made me appear masculine. My own body, betraying me. 
 
 School passed by in a blur, like most days. My brother runs ahead, laughing as he bounds into our house without a care in the world. How nice it must be, to be born into the body you want. Father smiles at me, asks me the same question he ’ s asked every day since I started school. I noticed the scar that first night he asked, on my back as I took off my shirt to shower. It was the biggest I ’ d ever seen. I ’ ve never taken off my shirt in front of my family ever since. 
 
 “ Hey, kid! How ’ s life treating ya? ” 
 
 I pause, for a brief moment. 
 
 “ Fine, dad. I ’ m fine. ”
