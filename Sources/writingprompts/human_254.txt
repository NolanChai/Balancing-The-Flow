That last day was exactly what God needed. He woke from his slumber and rubbed the sand from his eyes. God lumbered out of bed and stood in the kitchen, bleary eyed and wondering what to have for breakfast. He then saw it, a small burlap sack poking a small corner of itself into view. 
 
 `` Shit,'' said God. 
 
 He grabbed the sack and frantically grabbed at the contents, pulling out an incomprehensible slurry of pure essence. He read the words on the side of the bag. 
 
 *Souls: 
 
 do n't forget. 
 
 VERY IMPORTANT!!! 
 
 -God* 
 
 `` Shit.'' He said once more, `` I hate Monday's.'' 
 
 And on the eighth day God said, `` what could possibly go wrong?'' And it was good enough.
