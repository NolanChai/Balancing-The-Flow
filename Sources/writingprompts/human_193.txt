Wednesday is, unequivocally, everyone's favorite day of the week. 
 
 Anything goes on a Wednesday. It's an awesome day to get in a car accident, or any kind of accident. Most of the injured can pull through in 6 days, by the time the next Tuesday rolls around. This makes Wednesday mornings primetime for adrenaline junkies to be reckless. 
 
 But today is n't Wednesday. Today is Tuesday. 
 
 `` Another late night, Jill?'' I look up from my computer screen to my coworker, Arnold, the resident daredevil. It was only five o'clock, and Arnold was on his way out. 
 
 `` Another death wish, Arnold?'' I retort, pointedly eyeing the car keys in his hand. 
 
 `` You ca n't live in fear, Jill.'' 
 
 `` You ca n't live at all if you keep up that shit, Arnold.'' 
 
 He tousles my hair. 
 
 `` I'm here every Wednesday morning, are n't I? Have a little faith.'' 
 
 `` I've got work to do, Arnold.'' 
 
 `` No you do n't.'' 
 
 He taps his car key against my desk twice and strides off towards the elevators. I put on my headphones and gear up for several hours of Netflix in the safety of the office. 
 
 Soon midnight rolls around. Or so I thought. I look at my phone: two past eleven. 
 
 `` Daylight savings time. Right. Well, whatever. Close enough. *Ca n't live in fear, right, Jill? *'' Mocking Arnold is my secret pastime. I grab my keys and head out to the parking lot. 
 
 On the highway, a sports car revs up close behind me and taps my bumper. I check the rear view mirror and see the driver take a swig from a bottle in a paper bag. 
 
 I quickly change lanes to let him pass by, but instead he pulls up beside me and matches my speed. He rolls down his window and lifts up the bottle. 
 
 `` Happy Wednesday!'' he yells. *Shit. * I glance at my phone on the passenger seat. 11:39. 
 
 I shout back at him. `` It's still Tuesday!'' 
 
 `` What?'' he slurs. Then I see his eyes widen. 
 
 I look forward. I've drifted. A concrete overpass support column is barreling towards me, and I towards it. It's 11:40, and I can already feel my heart stop.
