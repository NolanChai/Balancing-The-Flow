His body was limp. I mean, what could I do? 
 
 I struggled to pull my gaze away, but all I could do was slowly glance at the blinking skull and cross bones illuminating the heavily wooded jungle every few seconds. It's hollow eyes followed me as I sickly swayed side to side. It felt like forever before I could turn around. 
 
 Above me, the bastard responsible for my present situation stood atop a platform. I was just out of his vision, so he continued to fire at the corpse of my friend. Similarly, there was n't much I could do from here. The angle was off, so I would have to double back to get my revenge, or press on, leaving the murderer taunting me to live another day. 
 
 I was torn, but decided that I needed to press on. He'd want that. And I'd get my chance later, I was sure of it. I ran forward and my surroundings changed. But I saw it! The end of the level, just waiting for me. I sprinted to the edge of a steep cliff and jumped. My excitement got the best of me, however, as I twisted my body to perform another upward aerial thrust. It was too much, too soon, however. I soared high up into the air, with my destination before me. The upward force was too much, and I could n't get the forward momentum I needed. 
 
 In retrospective, I would have reached for the ledge and pull myself up. What ultimately happened was far less heroic. I started my decent and went body first into the awaiting platform. My arms froze, unable to release my gun, and I started to fall straight down. Quickly, the world around me began to go dark, and as the music in my head started to end, two words started to take over my vision: GAME OVER.
