A knock comes from the CEO's door. A startled young secretary with an urgent look on her face comes busting through the door. 
 
 `` What, what is it? Ca n't you see I'm a bit busy here managing all of our exports?'' 
 
 `` Mr. Nick, i have something important to announce!'' 
 
 `` Well, spit it out! Is it good news or bad news? Did you finally take care of those extra shipments we're currently sending? The demand is so high! We're gon na be rich!'' 
 
 `` Well sir... it's really really bad news.'' 
 
 `` I have n't got all day, hit me with the news'' He says as he lightens up his cigar 
 
 `` You see, all the clients that bought our new shampoo product are saying that it does n't work and that they all want all of their money back.'' 
 
 `` Hah, nice one, made me giggle on the inside. What else are you gon na tell me? That the shampoo gives them dandruff instead of removing it too? I do n't like jokers in my office.'' 
 
 `` Sorry to tell you that I'm not joking and also the clients have also stated reports of increased dandruff than they ever had before, and guess what they blame it on? The shampoo.'' She says that as she hands him the clipboard with all the statistical info 
 
 `` No.. It ca n't be! Why did this happen!? Whose fault was this? Did n't we test the product before shipping it and advertising it!?'' He said as his cigar fell all the way to the ground below his fancy leather chair 
 
 `` The scientists who made the main chemicals for the product said that they were so positive and proud of this so called breakthrough they made, that they did n't decide to test it to ship it quicker.'' 
 
 `` Quick! We need to convince the investors! Goddamn it, those proud ass scientists are gon na lose their jobs and not find it ever again the moment I see them!'' 
 
 Eventually they could n't convince the investors so they all left, all the clients were angry and rioted until they all got their refunds and the company lost millions.
