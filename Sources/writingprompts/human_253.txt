`` Aww come on Troy! I think you need to be cheered up a little.'' 
 
 The crowd pressed in around me, and I tried not to gag as the smell of sweat encircled me like a venomous cloud. `` Um...'' I choked as they leant in closer. `` But... we just... *lost. *'' My final word echoed through the space of the gymnasium, a lost cry for help. 
 
 But they ignored me completely. Oblivious to the horror of our most recent loss at the basketball game, they laughed my comment off, and all I could do was watch with wide eyes as one of the players shouted, `` I think this calls for a celebration!'' 
 
 The gymnasium went wild. An eruption began in the stands - *they were coming for me! * `` No!'' I begged desperately for mercy. `` Please do n't do this!'' But they would n't listen, and they cheered gleefully at our misfortune. I sank to the floor and wept for the idiocy of mankind as they began their dreadful chorus. 
 
 *'' We're all in this together...'' *
