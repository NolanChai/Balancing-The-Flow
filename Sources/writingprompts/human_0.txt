You walked into his office. You sat at your desk. Every day. Same routine. Turn on computer, open your inbox, check for assignments. Go home, go to sleep. Except tonight. Make a left turn. Down the alley, to the right. There's the door. Knock, no one answers. Open it, it's unlocked. Enter, see the table. Take the rope out of your bag, tie it on the pipe. Put the noose around your neck. This is it. One tear, rolls down to the floor. Deep breath, and jump right as the light turns on. Look up for your last sight to be your loved ones, all holding a birthday cake... for you.
