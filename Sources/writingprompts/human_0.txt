The three men stood in silence and stared up at the dark socket above them. The man in the center, Evan, glanced at the man to his right. He was wringing his hands, dry-washing them over and over. He did that all the time. Evan hated it. Evan glanced to his left. The man ’ s mouth hung slightly open as he stared fixedly upwards. Evan watched it for drool, knowing that he wouldn ’ t notice him watching. After a fashion, he sighed silently and gazed upwards with them. 
 
 “ The light ’ s gone out. ” he said. 
 
 “ Yeah, ” said the man to his right. 
 
 “ What do we do? ” asked the one to his left. 
 
 Evan didn ’ t know what to do, and to be perfectly honest he didn ’ t really care. It was one light. Sure, you never saw lights go out on their own, and nobody could remember a time when the lights hadn ’ t been reliable, but- 
 
 The light beside it flickered. 
 
 Evan blinked. The man to his left visibly flinched. The man to his right wrung his hands. 
 
 “ Do you think that this might be a problem? ” the man to his left asked. 
 
 “ Yeah, ” said the one to his right. 
 
 Evan figured that it was out of his pay grade. He ’ d let his supervisor know about it, and go home to his wife and his dog and his lights that didn ’ t flicker or go out, unless he wanted them to. 
 
 “ I ’ m going home. ” he said. 
 
 “ You can ’ t go home, we have to figure out how to fix this! ” said the man to his left. 
 
 “ Yeah, ” said the one to his right. 
 
 “ Fuck it, dude. It ’ s just a light. ” Evan said, as he put his coat on. 
 
 Evan had a pleasant night. His dog was always happy to see him. His wife, a little less so. Evan suspected that she might be up to something, but he would worry about that in the morning. When he woke up, he checked his feed. There were a few stories that caught his attention, all them more or less the same. 
 
 “ How do we fix our lights? ”
