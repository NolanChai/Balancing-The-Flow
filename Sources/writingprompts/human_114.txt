The tell-tale hiss of leaking plasma awoke the groggy captain. All around monitors and control panels chimed with errors and warnings. The captain did n't need a million credits worth of useless sensors to recognize their current condition. Decades of experience flying everything from crater crawlers to FO Haulers gave the captain a keen intuition of ship conditions. A skill that was necessary if you wanted to stay alive in the void. It was failing now. The once proud ship was a broken rock silently falling towards the open maw of an eager planet. 
 
 Judging from the perfectly centered dot occupying the view port they still had weeks, months maybe to meet their fate. Propulsion down, secondaries off-line, Gauss banks discharging rapidly, Emergency power rapidly failing. At this point it would have been faster to list what still worked. 
 
 The captain took a deep breath and keyed his intercom. A routine action he had done thousands of times before, but sadly he realized, there would n't be many more. 
 
 `` Crew. They always said Newton's Laws of motions were the deadliest S.O.Bs this universe has ever known. Soon we are going to find out. All propulsion systems are in-op, emergency power is failing. We're floating, lights off, to our primary target 7.3 megameters an hour too fast. It has been a pleasure serving with you all, join me tonight in the mess hall so we can test the emergency bottles of scotch. 
 
 Godspeed.''
