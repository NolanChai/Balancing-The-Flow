`` Jar-Jar Binks is a Sith Lord behind everything in the Star Wars universe.'' Cody said. His arms crossed, his eyes burning with that hatred I had identified as fan theory about to rear it's head. 
 
 The ranting was strong with this one. 
 
 `` Cody,'' I began gently. `` We have to get ready for the wedding tomorrow-'' 
 
 `` Nope. We are going to re-watch the entire series and I will prove to you that Jar-Jar is behind it all!'' 
 
 `` Cody, no, we have to get up at six to catch the flight to Utah,'' I argued. 
 
 `` Wedding can wait. This may or may not break the internet.'' Cody grabbed his laptop off the table. He started typing at a frantic pace. 
 
 I ran my hand through my hair, sighing as I leaned back against the couch. When Cody had a plan, well, look out world. 
 
 `` And what are you doing now?'' I asked, resting my head on his shoulder. 
 
 `` Preparing an army of zombie computers to attack Disney and find the proof that I need.'' Cody muttered. 
 
 My lips quirked as I watched him 
 
 `` I thought we were going to watch the movies?'' 
 
 Cody paused, his fingers stilling before he grabbed the remote and turned to Netflix. Moments later the infamous Star Wars scroll started creeping upwards. 
 
 `` Okay, the computers are working, now we watch.'' Cody placed his laptop back on the coffee table and sat back on the couch. I wrapped an arm around his shoulders. As soon as the first scene appeared, Cody started arguing the pros and cons about Darth Vader's appearance and whether or not he ordered his troops not to hit Leia because she was his daughter. This then spilled into a potential discussion about the use of weapons in closed environments and how low the oxygen levels had to be so that the laser sparks did n't trigger a climatic event where the rooms caught on fire. 
 
 I hummed. 
 
 `` I'm surprised you did n't score higher on your IQ test. You'd have your pick of anyone, now you're stuck with me. `` I joked. 
 
 Cody stilled. 
 
 `` In fact, I know you're smarter then most people.'' I watched his face turn a brighter colour of pink. I frowned. `` Cody?'' 
 
 Cody swallowed, and glanced at me. 
 
 `` Cody, what is it?'' I asked, sitting back. 
 
 `` I, um, I might have purposely failed my IQ test.'' Cody mumbled. 
 
 Stunned, it took me a few minutes to gather my thoughts. 
 
 `` Cody, why? Why would you do something like that?'' I said. `` It was your chance to pass on your genes!'' 
 
 Cody shrugged. `` I would n't have you.'' 
 
 I blinked. 
 
 `` You failed your IQ test so we would be together?'' I said. 
 
 Cody nodded. 
 
 `` But why?'' I asked. `` Why would you damage your chances of having kids?'' 
 
 `` Because if I wanted to start a family I'd want to start it with you, and it's illegal for a child to be raised by two dads, you know that. They'd get taken to one of the smart tanks and all the other nerd camps and stuff. They'd be raised like me. And besides, I've had a crush on you since junior high.'' Cody blushed. 
 
 I let that settle, let his reasoning sink in, and I shook my head. 
 
 `` Is that why you do n't want to go to the wedding?'' 
 
 Cody nodded. 
 
 I looked back at the screen and smiled. 
 
 `` Just so you know? Han shot first.'' 
 
 Cody's eyes grew wide. 
 
 `` And Anakin had to re-balance the force because there were too many Jedi's.'' I added, grinning. 
 
 `` You fiend!'' He gasped and I laughed.
