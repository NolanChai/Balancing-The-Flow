Kent University is the first to arrive. `` Dammit, those fucking hippies from Prince, Allen, and Etc. universities are always late. That's why employers prefer graduates of Kent University.'' Kent University pulls out his smart phone and starts emailing alumni to ask for money. `` I know your Master's in Cultural Anthropology is serving you well in your career as a waitress. Please help the next generation by donating money to me.'' 
 Finally, Etc University shows up. `` Oh look, it's fancy-pants Kent University. I bet you were early just in case your corporate clown sponsors happened to be here.'' 
 `` Exxon is not a corporate clown. They are concerned about the future of this great country.'' replied Kent. `` Maybe if you had any actual classrooms you would know that.'' 
 Etc University considered Kent's statement. She then removed a large caliber handgun from her purse. `` This is what happens when you charge 1000 % of your students average starting salary for a Bachelor degree.'' 
 One by one, the other universities showed up and were murdered by Etc University's low tuition, flexible scheduling, and quick adoption of MOOC and other modern learning methods.
