Again, the wind blew through the window, fluttering the curtain. 
 
 `` Why...'' the beauty in front of me sobbed `` why, of all people, I have to fall in love with you?'' 
 
 Something is breaking inside my heart when I saw her crying, but I ca n't do anything, not if I do n't want to see her hurt even more. 
 
 Truth to be told, I did n't want to see her cry. But the Fate is just too cruel, it let her fall for me, knowing full well that I wo n't be able to stay by her side. 
 
 `` And why!'' she looked straight at my eyes, tears on her face `` Why ca n't you even give me a chance?!'' 
 
 `` I'm sorry.'' 
 
 The truth is, even now, I do n't know the reason. 
 
 I do n't want to see her hurt. 
 
 But I ca n't do anything. 
 
 And yet I let her have the hope. Those lunch we shared together, the time I just ca n't refuse her dragging me everywhere... 
 
 Half of this school inhabitants would kill to become me, and yet I.... 
 
 `` I'm sorry, for giving you too much hope. I should have told you the first time we met.'' 
 
 She wiped her face. 
 
 `` No, I should have known this. From the very beginning. You....'' 
 
 `` It's not your fault....'' 
 
 `` Then whose fault was that? Huh? Whose fault was it that I looked just like *her*, that my voice just like *hers*, that every.single.thing. that I did remind you of *her*?'' 
 
 She hugged me, I tried my best not to flinch. 
 
 `` It's my fault for trying to find her in you. It was my fault for not being able to move on from her. So I'm sorry.'' I took her hand, and turned away. 
 
 `` May you find your happiness.'' 
 
 `` But *you* are my happiness.'' 
 
 `` Then wait for me, until the sky on my heart had a place for another star to shine in it.'' 
 
 *Fin*
