Don woke up in a large, disheveled bed. 
 
 He had no idea how long he'd been there. There were no clocks. No calendars. The entire experience had been a blur. Drinks, dancing, sex... it seemed to be one long party. 
 
 And there she was, like an angel. It was as if she traveled with her own lighting crew. She motioned to him. 
 
 `` It's time to go downstairs.'' 
 
 He obliged, following her through the twisting hallways and feeling lost. She was his beacon. 
 
 They approached a set of large doors. She opened them up and with an exasperated voice said `` Alright, let's get this over with.'' 
 
 They made their way into a banquet hall, the other guests surrounding a large table. Before each person was a large knife. Don wanted to run but his legs would n't let him. 
 
 `` Don, you've been here for awhile now and there's something you should know.'' 
 The other guests all stood and looked at him in unison. 
 
 She walked toward the table and grabbed a knife. `` There's no way out, Don.'' 
 
 All the guests chanted `` There's no way out'' grabbing their knives and at once plunging them into their chests. 
 
 `` What the fuck?!'' Don screamed and ran from the room, unsure of where to go. The hallways were a maze of confusion and he heard the guests chanting from the banquet hall. 
 
 After running for what seemed like hours he came across a door. An escape. As he reached for the knob a hand grabbed his and his heart leapt into his chest. It was a door man. 
 
 `` Relax... we are programmed ONLY to receive. You can check in anytime you like, but you ca n't ever leave.''
