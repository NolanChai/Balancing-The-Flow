B's shelf contained scotch tape, stapler, two bocce ball halfs that served as paperweights, scraps of paper, junkmail, and books. He stared at these objects, criticizing their existences. None held a candle to the bocce ball. The bocce ball had been places. The beach, the woods, Drew's house. Sigh, Drew's house. The bocce ball could never decide whether it was the greatest or worst day of its life. The thrill of a toss from a capable player was something it would always miss. The heft of its mass thudding pleasantly into the ground, its harmonious collaboration with Newtonian physics. That last throw was errant, though. It could immediately notice shaky release from that tipsy hipster's hand before feeling the precise impact of a sharp rock at the edge of the flower beds. The bocce ball's existence fractured instantly, sending two hemispheres of sharp plastic hurtling in opposite directions as the partygoers cheered in delight. The bocce ball, or half-bocce ball really, would never soar again, but furthermore would fulfill the noble role of paperweight and celebrated artifact of yard-sport legend, there to be viewed and discussed with affection for all eternity. He imagined the bocce ball oppressing the shelf with an air of worldly confidence the rest of the pitiful objects could never hope to experience. He got up in a breeze of flatulence and stumbled towards the kitchen.
