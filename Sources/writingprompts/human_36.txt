War. War always changes. Instruments of political violence is all he became, he could not leave his position, or so he claims. 
 
 No... No, he has to go fight, fight for the greater good, to `` protect the constitution'', there are enemies of the state lacking holes in there bodies. Is there such a thing, as an enemy? Is there an entity we are in everlasting hatred for, postmortem hatred? There is no such thing as an enemy. 
 
 The `` enemy'' have 3 children, a wife that missed them every time they have to rush out, some sort of sick Pavlov effect every time a balloon pops. 
 
 The enemy is you Shawn, and now I lay by your resting place, the still-warm shells are the last warmth I will ever feel from your embrace, and this feeling will haunt me for the rest of my life. The warmth, leaving my toes like a genie leaving a lamp, I am the lamp, and your death has left me lifeless. 
 
 With your Colt rested between my legs, all I can think about is joining you, some sort of stupid romantic shit. But I ca n't, for your leaving me and these children has made you the one thing you fought so hard against. 
 
 My enemy.
