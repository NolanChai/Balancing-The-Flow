Smaug came with a terrible fire, laying waste to the feeble wooden homes scattered clumsily together with thatched roofs and anchored dingy's. A blazing light seemed to settle over the shimmering horizon of the lake as Gollum watched nervously. 
 
 `` They's taken it to the burning town, precious. That filthy Baggins...'' his bulbous eyes darting between the rubble of Lake-Town, desperately looking for anyone too hairy and stout to be a child. `` *Ohhhhhhhhhh* what are we going to do, precious?! They'll sinks it! Sinks it to the bottom of the lake! Baggins will drown like a rat, and... and...'' he could n't finish the though as a nearly toothless wail erupted from his mouth in a desperate, exasperated shout. Memories had loosened and came flooding back of a Smeagol that once was. A Smeagol living in the Vales of Anduin, long ago, when magic and magical beast were as common as grief during wartime. Ages had passed, and the Ring stripped away everything Smeagol knew of himself, and of the world. His people fell into extinction, or moved on to become Shire-folk too peaceful to remember how their traditional bar-songs had truly come to be. 
 
 Smeagol remembered. Through centuries of silence, Smeagol remembered. Through whispers and mutterings, thick like honey, Smeagol remembered. 
 
 It started with a low growl until only the screeching of Smaugs final lunge at Bard overpowered it. Many believed the skies thundered with relief as the black arrow pierced through the heart, but the thunder came first. Through smoke and ember, not a single person in Lake-Town bore witness to the ripple of pure power that came from the western coast. A ripple of pure power that tore through armor like tenfold shields, dragonbone cracking from the inside... and that is all that would remain. 
 
 Pale-white bones, bleached by sun and lake as if all skin and meat was torn off, would litter the shores.
