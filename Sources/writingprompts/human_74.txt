`` I did the best I could do under those circumstances.'' 
 
 `` No do n't make it easy for yourself. You always had a choice. You just chose not to exercise it.'' 
 
 `` Why did n't you tell me then?'' 
 
 `` Did n't I?'' 
 
 `` I thought I was doing the right thing.'' 
 
 `` The moment you took the first step towards that poor bastard, you knew'right' was thrown out of the window.'' 
 
 `` What else could I have done? It was either me or him. And I chose myself. Like any other person would have. I am no hero. I am no savior.'' 
 
 `` You did n't have to be the hero. You just had to be kind enough to give the other man a chance at life. Like you had.'' 
 
 `` Why is the onus on me? Why did I have to do something? Why ca n't I get away with it like the scoundrels who put me there in the first place?'' 
 
 `` Because you knew. There nothing more to it. Responsibility is for those who know. And once you know, you ca n't ignore it. At least not without me having to have this conversation with you at some point.'' 
 
 `` All my life I have never harmed another living being.'' 
 
 `` But you did n't save one either. And it would n't have mattered. Most people do n't. But you realised that you could have if you wanted to. And that's what makes the difference.'' 
 
 `` Yes yes I knew I could do some things to make life better for other people. But I did n't. I chose to look out for myself. What's wrong with that?'' 
 
 `` Nothing. Except the fact that that choice has been eating you alive. Hey it's not me. It's all you.'' 
 
 `` I could have saved that man but I did n't. I should have. Do n't you think I know that? Of course I know that. And it kills me to know that. Like every other little thing in my life that I could have done but did n't. Why? I have no idea why!'' 
 
 `` I could help you with that. Life is n't just about survival anymore. Every minute that you spend on this planet has consequences. And the worst part is that you know of those consequences. So how can you knowingly indulge in a crime and expect to not destroy you? You have your mind to answer to. And me.'' 
 
 `` What can I do now?'' 
 
 `` Nothing. Maybe next time. You carry these lessons forward. I travel with you. I'll be there next time too when you need to make a choice. And we will do this again. So next time.''
