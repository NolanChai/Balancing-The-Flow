“ Any last words, hero? ” 
 
 The Iron Fist strained against his restraints, two enormous shackles tied around both wrists, preventing any use of his super powered hands. He was unable to move them, and therefore unable to fight back against his arch foe ’ s devious. He felt like a fool for allowing him to be caught in such a manner. His fists had managed to save him so many times before, but now, they were useless. 
 
 He glanced anxiously around, looking for a way out of this. But Perjury, the fiend who stood before him, grinning like a banshee, knew that this one was foolproof. Many a time The Iron Fist had managed to escape from his clutches. 
 
 Not this time. 
 
 “ No? Then prepare to die! ” Perjury raised his fist above the button, the button that once pressed would pull The Iron Fist apart, limb from limb. 
 
 Suddenly, The Iron Fist broke his silence. 
 
 “ *Take the shot! Take the shot goddammit*! ” 
 
 Perjury ’ s eyes flew up to the rafters of his secret hideout, and his heart dropped. 
 
 The glint of the rifle ’ s scope was barely visible up so high towards the rooftops, but it was unmistakeable. 
 
 Before Perjury could make a single move, a single shot rang out in the chamber. The bullet flew down and hit its mark, the bridge of Perjury ’ s nose. His head exploded in a shower of blood, killing the villain immediately in a spectacular and efficient fashion. His lifeless body flopped down onto the cold concrete floor, the one sided battle well and truly over. 
 
 A rope descended from the rafters, and the Marksman rappelled down to join The Iron Fist, his imposing rifle hanging off of his shoulder. 
 
 “ Nice shot my friend, now get me the hell out of these shackles! ” 
 
 Without a word, the Marksman, a slender, fit man with a grim expression and tinted glasses masking his eyes roughly yanked off The Iron Fist ’ s restraints. 
 
 The Iron fist glanced at the pathetic corpse of Perjury, his face all but gone from the bullet ’ s impact. 
 
 “ Okay, that ’ s Perjury done. Who ’ s next? The Pilgrim? The Executioner? Come on man, you pick this time. ” 
 
 The Marksman stared wordlessly at The Iron Fist, his face a mask behind his glasses. He thought back to the old days of their heroism, of the days when the hero had to get themselves out of whatever mess they got into. 
 
 And there was The Iron Fist, feigning capture to lead The Marksman to the villain ’ s hideouts to execute them in cold blood. 
 
 “ This was the last time, Fist. This isn ’ t what I became a hero for. Even the villains do n't stoop this low. I ’ m done. ” 
 
 He lifted his rifle off of his shoulder and dropped it onto the ground. It clattered loudly on the concrete. The Iron Fist watched in astonishment as The Marksman turned his back, and walked away. 
 
 He reached up and removed his glasses, and tossed them away as well. 
 
 The Marksman was almost out of the warehouse when the sound of hurried footsteps behind him gave him pause. He thought for a moment that The Iron Fist had had a change of heart, but he quickly realized this was far from the case. 
 
 “ *No one walks away from me*! ” 
 
 The Marksman wasn ’ t able to turn around in time before The Iron Fist, with a running start, he loosed a punch from his enormous fist right into The Marksman ’ s unprotected back. 
 
 He almost folded in two from the impact, opening his mouth to scream, but no sound escaped. He was already not long for this world, the sheer force from the punch crushing most of his internal organs. 
 
 Breathing heavily, The Iron Fist removed his arm from The Marksman ’ s spine, covered in blood, breathing raspy breaths, a furious frown across his face. 
 
 Before he could regret his actions, he regathered himself and headed out of the warehouse. The city police would be here soon. 
 After The Iron Fist was a good distance away from the condemned warehouse hideout, he looked up to the starry sky, deep in thought. He stayed there for some time, as sirens began to blare in the distance. 
 
 “ Executioner, ” he said to no one in particular, “ You ’ re next, you son of a bitch. ”
