 I took another swig of the beer.Ever since the numbers had reached 10,000, I have been worrying about what will happen.Hence, the beer.Can you imagine a number just popping in your mind every two seconds? All the time? Well, that's what happens to me.Yep.Even when I'm sleeping.In my dreams.All the time.

 I wonder about my life.The best moments.The worst.A smile is on my lips now.Whatever happens now I will go down happy.

 Yes, I am expecting death.I do n't know why.Despite the numbers, I have tried to make the best of my life.Helped many people.Made many friends.Tried to be as normal as possible.When I was a kid I asked a friend what her number was.She ran away.Now I understand.I still laugh at that.

 I have often wondered what will happen when the numbers reach zero.Well now I will certainly know.

 A part of me is relieved.The numbers will end now.Another part hates this.I mean, who the hell really wants to die? I certainly do n't want to.Another part is excited.I will finally know.Still expecting death though.

 Shit.only 10 seconds now.

 I close my eyes.Take a deep breath.Whatever happens now, I am ready.

 I feel as if a bomb is about to go off.It is a bomb in its own way I suppose.

 Even though I expect death, I still manage to hope that something awesome will happen.Maybe I will turn into a super-hero.Please do n't laugh at me.

 I think of everyone I love.Mother.Father.I think about her.My cat I mean.Pets are the best.I decided not to have a girlfriend because of the numbers.The cat is at my mother's right now.Why am I telling you this right now?

 I open my eyes.White light blinds me.I fall to my knees.I hear a sound from afar.Slowly, my vision returns to normal.I hear the alarm.I get up thinking about strange dreams.
