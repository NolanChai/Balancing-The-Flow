`` Let me ask you somethin', squirt. When you look at them, what do you see?'' 
 
 `` They're rebels. They're destabilizing the country. They've killed innocent people.'' 
 
 `` Ok, sounds good. Now look at us. What do you see?'' 
 
 `` A... a band of soldiers trying to do the right thing'' 
 
 `` Egh, you never told me you had morals like this, squirt. Let me tell you what they see when look at us. A bunch of invaders, here to kill the people who may or may not be fully with them but are slighlty less bad than us, maybe.'' 
 
 `` I do n't think I understand, sir.'' 
 
 `` Have you ever wondered what the families of the people we killed think of us? We're monsters to them. We killed the kin they grew up with. The people they cherished in times of hardship. We're not heroes to'em. We're the bad guys to'em. And what does that mean? People who kill eachother for whatever reason are n't fully good, squirt. Good guys take care of their kids, elders and loved ones. The ones who do their best everyday to get by without getting anyone harmed and with the best intentions. Newsflash, squirt. You do n't find these guys on the battlefield.'' 
 
 `` They were farmers once.'' 
 
 `` Till our glorious leaders came and decided they had to change. They disagreed. Now blood is on everyone's hands. The world is n't good to us, squirt. It ai n't black and white. People offer perspective, perspective makes good and evil, and it's all bullshit. Welcome to the *real* world, squirt. Have a drink, makes the bad thoughts go away.''
