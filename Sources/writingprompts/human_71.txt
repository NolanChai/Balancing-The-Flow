Rule # 1: Do not, under any circumstances, fight fair. 
 
 Rule # 2: If you can shoot the Hero in the back, do it. See Rule # 1. 
 
 Rule # 3: If the Hero is surrounded, do not allow him to defeat you one-by-one while the rest of the group dances around menacingly. 
 
 Rule # 4: If the Hero is facing overwhelming opposition and is smiling, DO NOT ENGAGE. He almost certainly has a secret weapon. 
 
 Rule # 5: Do not imprison the Hero with the intention of going to get your boss. Just kill him. 
 
 Rule # 6: If the Hero has a Plucky Sidekick for comic relief, the Plucky Sidekick should be killed along with the Hero. Plucky Sidekicks have a nasty habit of rising to the occasion. 
 
 Rule # 7: If the Hero offers to engage in a battle of wits, just kill him. See Rule # 1.
