I stood quietly. Clutching the phone, I tried to maintain a normal breathing level. 
 
 A voice crackled through...'' You are..quite sure about this? We have no control over how these things are-'' 
 
 `` I know.'' I said, feigning confidence. 
 
 Questions came. Questions that data analysis at prestigious colleges would struggle with. Ones that philosophers would need months to think about. An average man would succumb to the pressures of millions listening. I would not. 
 
 Finally, the last question came. 
 
 `` Allright, sir, the last question is: *What do you want to win*?'' 
 
... *What*? 
 
 *No*, I thought, *This ca n't be the right thing. I have to respond though. Is it really just the same answer I gave them before? Was that the original question of the ten? Have I already finished? *- I was cut short of my thoughts. 
 
 `` Sir, do you have an answer?'' 
 
 *Why did I pick that in the first place? I'm not a humble person, I just did n't want too much power. I figured a glimpse would be something I could handle. Oh god, why did I even choose that in the first place? * 
 
 I grasped the phone tighter. I furrowed my eyebrows and placed my free hand against my temple. `` Yes, I have an answer.'' 
 
 `` Excellent, sir, what do you want to win?'' The anticipation from the announcer was felt throughout the world. 
 
 `` I'm not sure.'' 
 
 Moments went by. Small talk was heard on the radio. Finally the announcer assuredly said, `` You are correct.'' 
 
 A loud shriek consumed my world. Burning white streaks penetrated my field of vision and I lost any feeling of my body. I knew everything within a moment and forgot all I knew. Vibrations in harmony moved across miles of plains that within an instance could fit inside my palm. Soon blackness consumed my sight as it seemingly removed my sound. Any thoughts of mine would echo. These echoes had conversations with each other. Miraculously, a star appeared. A soft, silver star in the distance. I chased it. I loved the star and I knew not why. As I chased it, the star become smaller. However, as I chased, my vision became restored and I could hear again. Colors and noise invaded my path to this precious star. 
 
 `` Sir, congratulations, we will send you your prize!'' 
 
 I snapped back. I dropped the phone. I walked outside into a field and sat. I looked upon the world with wonder and gave up my chase. I simply took in what was around me, knowing this was a glimpse enough.
