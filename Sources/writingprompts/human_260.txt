The radio hung in a moment of dead air as I digested the news from the FAA. Planes were dropping out of the sky across the nation as waves of EM rippled off the nukes. No commercial airliner was hardened against them. All it would take is a flash in the distance to bring us crashing down. 
 
 My copilot, Diane, shook me. `` Snap out of it Jake, we need to take this bird to ground fast!'' 
 
 She had been an Air Force pilot and trained for just such an occasion. I gripped the yoke tightly and squeezed, she took to the PA. `` All passengers lock yourselves down. We are in an emergency landing situation. We are taking this plane into a controlled decent while we still have power.'' 
 
 Diane did n't wait for steward confirmation, just cut the mic and began scanning the ground for a suitable strip of road. I was already dropping altitude as fast as I felt safe with people moving about the cabin. 
 
 `` There!'' She pointed out the window at a stretch of highway, `` Faster Jake. We do not want to be airborne if it...'' 
 
 Cutting her off was a fireball expanding to the East, we saw the shockwave in the air as it shook the plane. The lights went out, the stick went dead. We looked at one another in that moment of intimate impending death. Something in my primal lizard brain took over, `` Hydraulics!'' We both turned our attention to the limited mechanical systems at our disposal and attempted to turn this metal meteor into a gliding metal rock. Not an easy task at this weight/lift ratio. 
 
 The nose picked up slightly, but we were still in a dangerous decent. The ground came rushing at us. Her hand laid on mine as I pulled back on the flaps as hard as I could. It was all we could do before -
