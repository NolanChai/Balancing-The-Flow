Cassidy rubbed his head. Looking at his daughter, he was n't quite sure what to say, `` We're so... proud of you. I guess. Right dear?'' 
 
 Jackie clicked her tongue, `` I so called it.'' 
 
 Francine writhed on the ground, her countless limbs coiling together into a living vine-like entity with two little eyes peering from deep within the mass. `` I'm okay with this,'' she said, `` this is good for me.'' 
 
 Cassidy leaned towards his wife, whispering in her ear, `` So umâ€”dear, what do we do?'' 
 
 `` Pray that she does n't go to TentacleHub and support her if she does.'' 
 `` We ca n't ever go to that website again.'' 
 `` I'm cancelling our Gold subscription as soon as I'm at the computer.''
