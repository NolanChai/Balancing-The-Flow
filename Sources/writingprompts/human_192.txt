They say it was just a mistake. The baker did n't have enough icing. All I knew was, I was different. It hurt sometimes, being different. Everyone else ca n't wait to be eaten. They sit so smug in their wrappers, icing spilling over the top as they wait with bated breath for the customers to choose just one bite that they so desire. But not me. I never cared about that side. After all, its much warmer in the kitchen here. Who cares if I do n't get eaten? I'm just as content here as they are there. 
 
 The baker says I'm special. I know its not true. There's a reason I do n't have icing, and I intend to find out. Just as soon as I can get my hands on that book. The book is the key. Maybe some of my old friends can help me if they end up back in here. But one way or another... We're going to find out what we're doing here. Once and for all...
