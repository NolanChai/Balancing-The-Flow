I looked out the window for a long time, gathering my thoughts. 
 
 After five minutes, I decided that it had n't been real. Well, the has real in that it was a dream. Some points were indistinct, slipping away from me. I wrote down the key points, like names, places. The more I wrote, the more I remembered. There were a few sticking points, where I mis-remembered but I'm confident I can work it out eventually. 
 
 At first, I wanted to cry. Tears welled up after I woke up, initially I could n't help but feel lost. But as I wrote down what I remembered, as I began to feel that it was a map, a guide, to my future happiness... well... the more I believed it was... could be... true. 
 
 Now I know what to do. Who else could boast the same?
