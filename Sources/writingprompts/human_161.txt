Consciousness returned slowly. 
 
 My mind thought, `` This surface is cool against my forehead.'' 
 
 Then the pain hit and my mind stepped out for a breather. 
 
 Sometime later I awoke. Struggling to remain awake, I lifted my head, squinting bleary-eyed against light as the world came into focus. 
 
 White room... Hospital? Wait, pictures. And carpet. This looks familiar. Looking down I saw a large wooden desk and a small puddle of drool. Where the fuck was I? How much did I drink at that bar? 
 
 I blinked a long slow blink as everything swam into focus. 
 
 A woman in a pantsuit stood in front of me mouthing something. A camera behind her, a couple of young guys with clipboards and an American Flag. I was fairly libertarian so I was n't anywhere I wanted to be. 
 
 `` Migftr Hgdisinc... Mishger Pfzedont... Mister President!'' 
 
 I looked at the lady, who looked back at me with concern. The others had quizzical looks as well. 
 
 `` Uhm, what did you call me?'' 
 
 `` Oh haha, this ego trip again. Yes, you're the president, yes we impeached Trump and yes the whole nation voted you in unanimously with an unheard of 83 % voter turnout. Let's just read the speech and move on to fixing all the things you've inspired us to change!!'' 
 
 The lady spoke the final words with tears in her eyes. My head hurt, my brain floundered and in survival mode I just listened to her. 
 
 Looking down I began to read 
 
 `` People of the United States. This is your President speaking...''
