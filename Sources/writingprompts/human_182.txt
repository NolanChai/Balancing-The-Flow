`` Hello, Mrs. Jacobs, how are you?'' The doctor smelled like cologne. 
 
 I smiled. `` Fine doctor how are you?'' 
 
 `` I'm doing great. Your *formal* exam went well.'' He smiled at me. 
 
 I nodded. He started his exam. 
 
 `` And you're 3 months post-op from your mastectomy, is that correct?'' 
 
 I nodded.'' Dr. Tully, I actually had a question. I was hoping you could describe how this is going to look when it's done?'' 
 
 `` So we'll do the breast augmentation starting here,'' he said. `` The curvature will be pretty stark, almost like the beak of an *Avocet*, but inverted. The *curriculum* from Cambodia was sparse, which is why we are starting over. It was about 3,000 *Riel*, or 820 Dollars. To think, now, we're getting over a billion in funding.'' He said. 
 
 `` And it'll keep my heart pumping?'' I said. 
 
 Dr. Tully placed his hand on mine. 
 
 `` Allison,'' he said. `` I have to admit your case was special. These past five years have been intense. This is the first time we're using a mechanical breast augmentation, but the *piezoelectric* current should move through the pacemaker, keeping your heart pumping indefinitely.'' 
 
 I nodded. `` Thanks, Dr. Tully.'' 
 
 `` You're very welcome. Let â€™ s make history.''
