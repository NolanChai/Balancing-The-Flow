Every moment was a struggle. 
 
 The chair stood there, only the slightest motion was visible. The dusty, wooden floor creaked as the chair stuttered about its surface. 
 
 I try to keep it there, but the ringing. It was... unbearable. It was like the most intense cry ever uttered. If I listened close enough I could hear them chant, they cried for me to give up, to let my mind relax. But, I ca n't. The chair is all I have. Occasionally they lift the floorboards, or pull at my skin, but they know that the chair is all that matters too. 
 
 So I sit, and I concentrate. My wrinkly thin skin stuck to my bones, my head shook and my jaw sits unhinged. My breath has stopped but they wo n't let me die. 
 
 I used to think I could live a life. I remember the first day I heard them. The tonal ring in my ear used to be nothing. Just a sound that filled the silence at a dull pace. But one day, in the smallest little inkling of a voice, I heard them. Their voice is fire and it burns hotter than the flames of Hell. The sound of the person you love most being disemboweled and burned is but an angel's harmony compared to it. 
 
 Life is for the alive, and I am not alive. 
 
 I am a prison, and my prisoners want me to break. 
 
 I am the wall standing between you and Hell. 
 
 Pray that I stand.
