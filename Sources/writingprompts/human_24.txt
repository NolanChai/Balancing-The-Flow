“ But it can ’ t be wrong. ” 
 
 “ Of course it can ” he let out an exasperated gasp and mumbled, “ For fucks sake. ” 
 
 “ But its…you know…science. ” 
 
 “ Its science, not magic. Science isn ’ t perfect. That ’ s how it works. You know- trial and error. ” 
 
 “ Well when is the last time you heard of it not matching someone perfectly? ” she asked. 
 
 He stammered for a moment before letting up, “ Never. ” 
 
 They sat in a mournful silence. They stared down at the fine china and white linens. Around them waiters and waitresses shuffled endlessly, serving the happy couples. From every table poured saccharine sap of requited love. But all were to enraptured in their own escapades too be sickened by the others cooing and camp. All except these two. These two looked at nothing but the table, equally ignoring everyone ’ s joy and their own misery. 
 
 “ Well maybe they got our names mixed up with someone else or something? ” she offered. 
 
 “ It seems a little convenient that there would be a mix up and we ’ d happen to both get each other ’ s names. ” 
 
 Just then, their waiter glided up with most serene expression and inquired, “ And how is the miracle of modern science work for you two lovely people? ” 
 
 “ It fuckin ain ’ t, ” he spat back at the waiter. Casting a glance across the table he asked, “ Is it? ” 
 
 “ No, I guess it ’ s not, ” came the reply. 
 
 The waiter stood aghast, mouth open and brows upturned. The shock the poor man ’ s system was too much for him to bare and found it impossible to move or speak. 
 
 The man at the table stood up. Shoving a wade of money in the waiter ’ s breast pocket he told him, “ Listen, you can cancel all that fancy overpriced shit we order. We ’ re leaving. ” He took the woman by the wrist and fairly dragged her out the door. Most the patrons were too enraptured to notice the commotion. Those that did assumed they were simply overcome with passion and had to…leave. 
 
 Once in the street they quickly hailed a taxi. He directed the driver to the TrueMatch building then sat in silence. They were lucky the driver had a limited English vocabulary. His eyes constantly in the rearview mirror betrayed that he was intrigued by this disgustedly couple. The woman stared at the picture of the dark beauty perched upon the dash board. 
 
 Finally, the man gave a chuckle. “ Did you see the look on that pompous waiter ’ s face? ” 
 
 “ Yeah, ” she answered with a faint smile, “ I believe that ’ s what they call nonplused. ” They almost looked at each other. 
 
 After what had seemed like eons, they arrived at their destination. The man charged up to the door but found it locked. He shook the door with all his might. For a moment it seemed the door would shatter but it did not yield. 
 
 She came walking up slowly behind him. “ The sign says they ’ re open till seven, ” she reported. 
 
 “ Well they ain ’ t, ” he shouted at the empty building before letting out a heavy sigh, “ Assholes. ” 
 
 “ Fuckin dickbags, ” she confirmed. Finally they shared a laugh, a moment of relief that this farce was finally over. 
 “ Well I better go home and eat something, I ’ m starving, ” 
 
 “ Fuckin Right, ” she confirmed. He turned to leave but she caught his arm. 
 
 “ Hey, you want to grab some tacos? ” 
 
 “ Fuckin Right. ”
