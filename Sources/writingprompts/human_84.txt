`` Tina! Tina!'' shouted Dad, leaning back in his chair as though those additional few centimetres were the difference between Mum hearing him or not. I sat nervously opposite him. What had I done this time? The last time they sat me down it was because Mum thought I was watching porn. `` I've noticed'' I can still remember the tremor in her voice `` that our internnet history has been... well... I've noticed that someone has been looking at big breasts on there.'' It still amuses me that she thought it necessary to describe them. 
 
 
 
 `` It's'Internet' Mum. One, fluid word. Not Intern-net.'Internet'. And I have n't been looking at breasts on there. I have a laptop for that.'' Mum had tutted and rolled her eyes. Eventually Dad piped up - it had been him all along. He was on the sofa that night, and ever since he'd borrow my laptop a lot more. Hopefully this was n't going to be Round 2 of porn-gate. 
 
 
 
 `` Just coming!'' shouted Mum from upstairs. 
 
 
 
 `` What's this about?'' I asked Dad, who was irritatingly tapping his fingers on the table. `` Wait for your mother'' he said with a feigned smile. Jesus Christ. 
 
 
 
 Mum came in, trailing a long piece of thin paper behind her. It looked like a low budget wedding dress. All it needed was a few napkins from last night's McDonalds as a veil and she'd have the full outfit. 
 
 
 
 `` Ah, here she is!'' chirped Dad, doing his best to maintain the unnaturally wide smile he had forced. His face had to be aching. 
 
 
 
 `` Here I am! Right, let's get down to business.'' 
 
 
 
 `` What business?'' I asked, frowning at the suspiciously cheerful pair. Both of them turned to look at me, almost as though they had momentarily forgotten I was there. `` Well...'' said Mum, her cheery tone giving way to apprehension, `` this business''. She piled the toilet-paper like document in front of me. `` What is it?'' I asked, my eyes fixed firmly on Dad's. He was the weak one, the one I could extract proper information from. And he knew it. His eyes darted around the room, desperate not to meet mine. `` Dad?'' I asked. 
 
 
 
 `` Well... as you know, you're mother and I love you very much-'' 
 
 
 
 
 `` Good'' I interjected. 
 
 
 
 `` Yes. Yes it is. What was I saying? Ah yes, we love you very much. And we're proud of you. We always have been. Have n't we Tina?'' 
 
 
 
 `` Yes, yes we have. Your Dad's right. Really proud of you. Have a look at the sheet, Owen.'' 
 
 
 
 I grabbed a a handful of the yellowing paper and drew it to my face. *1x Nivea for Men No More Blackheads cream: £3.99, 09/06/2011. 1x Fish and Chips ( with peas + tom. sauce ): £5.45, 09/06/2011* the list went on. I knew immediately what it was. I worked my way to the top of the list. *15x nappies: £2.50, 11/03/1991*. 11th of March. My birthday. The bastards. 
 
 
 
 `` Why have you given me this? I know you've done a lot for me, guys. You do n't need to present it on the longest receipt of all time. Are you going for a Guinness World Record? Is this a midlife crisis? Because most people just buy a flashy car or get a new haircut.'' 
 
 
 `` It's not a midlife crisis'' said Mum. `` Although your Dad is thinking of buying a new car soon. This is a bill. Your bill, from us.'' 
 
 
 
 `` Interest free'' interjected Dad, as though he was my saviour. 
 
 
 
 `` You mean you're charging me for everything you've bought me? *Everything*?'' 
 
 
 
 `` Not everything, dear. Christmas presents, birthday presents, they were gifts. But food, furniture, clothes. Those types of things. Those you have to pay for, I'm afraid.'' 
 
 
 
 `` It's character building'' announced Dad, trying shamelessly to polish the big shit they had dumped in front of me. 
 
 
 
 `` W... Why are you doing this? Have I done something wrong? Are you guys short on money?'' 
 
 
 
 `` No no no'' assured Mum, awkwardly leaning over the table to place a hand on my shoulder. `` You have n't done anything wrong, and we're not short on money. Your Dad's thinking of getting a new car.'' 
 
 
 
 `` Jaguar'' he said, grinning. 
 
 
 
 `` This is a challenge me and your Dad feel will benefit you. We're not asking you to pay it in one go. You can pay in instalments.'' 
 
 
 
 `` Well, fan-fucking-tastic then. How much does this add up to?'' 
 
 
 
 `` Language, dear. And we're not sure about the grand total, we did n't have the time to add it up. You'll have to pay us back item by item, then we can cross them off.'' 
 
 
 
 `` Obviously you do n't have to pay it all at once. We can start small.'' said Dad. `` I've already told him that Wayne'' snapped Mum. 
 
 
 
 `` You know my hearing's been playing up Tina.'' 
 
 
 
 I checked my pockets and pulled out a pen. The pair were still bickering about the relative performance of Dad's new hearing aid compared to his old one. 
 
 
 
 Finding the bottom of the list, I began to scribble. *1x paper shredder: £19.99, 09/09/2014*. 
 
 
 
 `` Mum, can I borrow 20 quid? I need to pop to the shop.''
