`` Preparing for drop to Mars...'' Andrew ran around the console, flipping buttons and pulling levers, trying to not die in the atmosphere of the red planet. He pressed the last button, and straightened out, he glanced over to the panels. Perfect, everything was smooth, the landing would be perfect, he had seen to it. Andrew let out a sigh, and slumped over on the wall. 
 Within moments, his crew mate, James burst in, gasping for breath. He spotted Andrew, and pointed back the way he came. 
 
 `` What's happened?'' Andrew stood up and ran over to James. 
 `` Sandra... She's in Labour...'' James took a deep breath `` Follow me.'' 
 
 James turned and began to run, Andrew close to his heels, they turned into the sleeping quarters, where all of the pillows were propped up on one bed, and Sandra, screaming, the other two crew members, Cecil and April, were already beside her, toiling away. 
 
 Andrew paused for a moment, and took a deep breath, The world around him turned a bright Red, the warning lights, He ran back to the piloting area, where all of the panels were flashing red, Engines, Shock absorbers, everything, was offline. 
 
 So this was his fate, to die on the red planet, with a baby that has n't yet taken it's first breath.
