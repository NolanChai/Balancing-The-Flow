The indigenous people made the long trek up the precipitous and dangerous mountain. It was a dark brown, and from the sky, it might look like a single crag stone that erupted out of the river that flowed beside it. 
 
 The slope leading down to the river was steep, a single tilted wall but there was the village people's goal. A single man, chained to the rock, right in the middle. It took two days for the witch doctor to lead his most physically skilled men there. 
 
 When they arrived, the wind howling, a man, much larger than themselves -- perhaps 9 feet tall -- looked at them grimly. He showed no sign of change or happiness when he saw them. 
 
 `` We've come to free you!'' said the Witch Doctor. 
 
 `` Well, then, strike at these iron chains, see what good it will do you.'' He motioned with his shackled hand to a direction in the sky. `` When the sun is about *there* your time will be up, and well, you'll have a show.'' 
 
 The men struck their hammers for that hour. The Witch Doctor, his magic. Meanwhile, the chained giant, looked at them, raising his upper lip slightly in contempt. 
 
 `` Forget it, fools,'' he said. 
 
 `` But God, you have given us fire!'' 
 
 `` And so I have.'' 
 
 Just then, an immense eagle soared down and landed at the crags. He immediately began eviscerating the man's torso, digging into his liver. 
 
 He laughed. Looking at the men, oblivious to the eagle mutilating him. `` Those chains you tried to to break were made with the same fire that forged me. You merely adopted the fire. I was born in it!'' said Prometheus.
