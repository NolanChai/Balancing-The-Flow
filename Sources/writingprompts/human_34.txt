`` None of us do, Hank.'' 
 
 A third voice came in. 
 
 `` Guys? Come one, get back to it. Break's in ten, keep it up.'' We nodded. The foreman walked out. 
 
 `` Water incoming.'' Hank pulled a lever. 20 million gallons of water came flooding into the chamber, 600,000 gallons a second. Last month, the hatch had malfunctioned- a single loose screw in the piping and it was n't watertight anymore. Water got into the wiring, and the maglock system failed. Hatch opened while maintenance was being done on the tank. 6 guys. No survivors. Hank said he'd heard from a guy close to the cleaning team that they'd been blown apart by the rush of water- like being hit by a train. 
 
 `` Second load incoming.'' Hank pulled another lever. The whales started tumbling out of hatches high in the chamber's ceiling. 
 
 The tank was n't completely full yet. We were supposed to let the water reach half-capacity, then dump the whales. This way, they hit the surface of the water and are stunned. If they're thrashing around too much, or even getting a chance to swim too freely, the whales coming in will just land on top of them and not sink quickly enough. They have to sink quickly or the whole chain gets backed up, all the way back to the breeding tanks. They screamed as they fell. A minute later, the tank was so full of whales they could hardly turn around. 
 
 `` It's the sound, I think,'' I said to Hank. `` Like, the wailing.'' 
 
 `` You mean whaling?'' 
 
 We both chuckled. Neither of us wanted to. 
 
 `` Thresher incoming,'' I said. 
 
 Last rotation, about three months ago, I got to leave the compound and head back home. I took my kid to a pet store. He asked me what work was like and I told him it was fine- not too different from his mother's work with elephants. He asked what it looked like, since we were n't allowed to take pictures. I showed him one of the fishtanks, the kind with all those guppies swimming about where they have no room, and they're just fucking and eating each other all day. Like that, but more guppies I said. 
 
 My hand was on the lever and I was about to pull, but Hank stopped me. `` Look.'' He pointed at the door. The foreman walked in, followed by a bunch of suits. Our backs straightened. 
 
 `` Here we have the grinding phase- looks like they're just about to process another batch! Gentlemen?'' 
 
 `` Thresher incoming,'' I said again. I pulled the lever. You could n't see the blades, but you could hear them start turning underneath the floor. It was a really smooth sound, more like a fan than a jet engine. Still loud. 
 
 `` Grind incoming'' 
 
 Hank and I grabbed two keys in the panel and turned them at the same time. The floor started opening up, exposing the blades of the thresher. The foreman started talking, his voice just beneath a shout so that the suits could hear him. 
 
 **'' As you can see, the floor of the chamber opens as an aperture to ensure even flow. The blades are actually one of the most expensive parts of the whole system. They're specially designed to slice extremely clean, minimizing froth so as to prevent waste, and ensuring the whales are killed humanely. `` ** 
 
 `` Ceiling incoming,'' Hank said. 
 
 **'' Now, our state-of-the-art hydraulic system will push the ceiling down into the chamber, compressing every square inch of space. The ceiling is capable of exerting 4 million pounds of pressure at any given point- more than enough given how effective simply draining the chamber into the grind is, but far more efficient in terms of how many batches we can get per day. `` ** 
 
 The first of the whales had sunk to the bottom. It was one-inch chunks surrounded by red mist in two seconds- you could hardly see the convulsing. 
 
 The one right after fell in tail first. 
 
 One of the suits spoke up: `` What's done about the water that drains with the whales?'' 
 
 **'' The meat-water slurry is drained into the level below, where it's carefully dried out via heating. The air is sucked into a condensation chamber, and the remaining water is purified and recycled. We yield roughly 96 % of the original water, requiring little re-filling. It's the most eco-friendly system on earth for our product. `` ** 
 
 The suits ooh'd and ah'd as they applauded. The whales kept howling. 
 
 **'' Now, let's go see the drying process. `` ** 
 
 They all shuffled out the other end of the room. 
 
 `` I always feel worst for the ones at the top,'' I told Hank. `` They do n't get usually stunned. And they get pushed into the blades.'' 
 
 `` Yeah, I guess they have it the worst.'' 
 
 By the time the chamber was half-way finished, all the water was red. Not so thick you could n't see through it, but definitely darker than a strong pink. The howling was starting to quiet down. 
 
 It was barely a minute before the tank was empty. 
 
 `` Resetting chamber.'' I pulled the last lever. The ceiling pulled back up to its place at the top of the tank, and hoses by the blades shot out air, stripping the thresher of leftovers. The chamber looked just as pristine as before. 
 
 `` I'm thinking of requesting a transfer into breeding,'' Hank said, readjusting all the levers. I sighed. 
 
 `` Water incoming.''
