The first thing out of the genie's mouth as he pops out of the bottle is `` Oh, *you* look like you think you're a clever one. Today's a two-for-one special, you know. Six wishes. I bet Upon-A-Starâ„¢ does n't offer those kinds of deals!'' 
 
 I adjust my glasses. I've been prepared for this moment by the Internet since my youth. 
 
 `` All right,'' I say. `` Let's talk ground rules.'' 
 
 `` Let's,'' replies the genie. 
 
 `` Can I wish for infinite things?'' 
 
 `` Oh, this *will* be fun,'' he says. `` Unfortunately, I'm not even allowed to deal with infinities. In fact, any mention of the word'infinity' in your wish will guarantee it gets marked as spam by our filters.'' 
 
 `` I wish for a finite, but arbitrarily large, amount of wishes.'' 
 
 `` Poof!'' he says. 
 
 Yes, he actually says `` Poof.'' 
 
 `` Congratulations! I've granted your wish. Since you did n't bother, I took the liberty of deciding the arbitrarily large number for you. I decided on one. One's a pretty large number, really! There are an uncountable amount of numbers less than one!'' 
 
 I glower at him. 
 
 `` I wish for two more wishes.'' 
 
 `` Poof! Congratulations, you have gained the incredible ability to wish for things. Two uses only, I'm afraid.'' 
 
 I rack my brains. 
 
 `` Look, kid,'' the genie says. `` Just give up. Just wish for something normal, like gold, or for the most popular girl in school to be your girlfriend or something like that.'' 
 
 I am not about to give up this battle of wits without a fight, though. 
 
 `` I wish for ten more genies!'' 
 
 `` Poof!'' Ten more genies flicker into existence. 
 
 `` Congratulations! You've contributed to the continued survival of genies! We're an endangered species, you know, ever since Aladdin came out and people stopped wishing themselves into genies. You will forever be remembered as a benefactor of our kind.'' 
 
 For a moment a golden statue of me appears, grinning and giving the thumbs-up. The genies all pretend to shed a tear. 
 
 `` Of course,'' the first genie says, `` you must realize that wishes are granted on a per-person basis, not per-person-per-genie. Four wishes left.'' 
 
 I groan in frustration. 
 
 `` I wish for someone who will be willing to wish for anything I tell them to wish for.'' 
 
 `` Poof! Congratulations! You fit that category splendidly yourself! *The person you wanted was **you** all along! * Three wishes left.'' 
 
 I stomp my foot in frustration. 
 
 `` I wish for someone *else* with all of those qualities, who is also eligible for receiving wishes,'' I say, hoping to close another loophole. 
 
 `` Poof!'' An impressionable young boy appears. 
 
 `` Hello,'' I say. `` What's your name?'' 
 
 `` Marvin,'' he says. He looks nervous, and starts sucking his thumb. 
 
 Feeling creepier by the second, I say, `` Marvin, could you please tell this genie here that you wish that I become the ruler of the world?'' 
 
 It was kind of impulsive. I'm not I even *wanted* to be the ruler of the world. But I could n't stand the look on the genies face. 
 
 `` I wish I was the ruler of the world!'' Marvin says obediently. 
 
 `` Poof! Congratulations! This boy's height is now an SI unit! You have three wishes left, and this boy has five.'' 
 
 `` I wish Star Wars was real!'' Marvin says. 
 
 `` Poof! Congratulations! Star Wars did indeed happen! In a galaxy far, far away, of course. And a long time ago. Could n't be breaching canon, could we? Four wishes for the little one left.'' 
 
 Marvin looks extremely disappointed. 
 
 `` Look, kid. Just give up. Give in to your teenage fantasies. Maybe with some of my help, you might actually have a date for prom.'' 
 
 Low blow. 
 
 `` I wish genies were incapable of subtraction,'' I say. 
 
 The other genies, who had been looking bored, roll their eyes. 
 
 `` Poof! Congratulations! Genies are no longer capable of subtraction. We are, however, perfectly capable of adding negative numbers.'' 
 
 `` THAT'S THE SAME THING!'' I yell indignantly. 
 
 `` Different enough,'' he says. 
 
 `` Did n't you say something about your filters, and something that made it sound like you guys were a company?'' 
 
 `` Yes!'' he replies. `` GenieCorp is a proud provider of all wishes to young and o-'' 
 
 `` Yeah, whatever,'' I say. `` How about I talk to customer service?'' 
 
 `` Oh, sure,'' he says. A phone appears in his hand. 
 
 `` Hello?'' he asks in a voice that is clearly meant to mock my own. I definitely do not sound that high-pitched. `` Hi, I'm calling because I want to abuse your product line and make a mockery of your company? Yes. That's correct. Yes, I'm doing it purely because I think I'm smarter than everyone else- huh,'' he says, turning to me. `` Seems like they hung up.'' 
 
 I grit my teeth. 
 
 `` Marvin, could you kindly repeat what I'm about to say to the genie?'I wish for one million dollars, to be given immediately and safely to the human nearest to me.''' 
 
 `` Poof! *Finally*'', says the genie, and presents me with a large stack of bills. `` That's better. Less of this too-cool-for-school stuff, more giving into your greed and baser qualities. One for you, three for the lad.'' 
 
 I did n't want to think about his comment about greed too much. 
 
 `` Well,'' I say. `` I think I've won.Marvin, say'I wish for someone who is eligible for six wishes and has n't used any of those wishes yet who is willing to wish for whatever I ask them.'' 
 
 Marvin obliges. 
 
 `` You're getting pretty creepy,'' commented the genie. `` Unfortunately, there are no valid people like that.'' 
 
 `` What?'' I ask. 
 
 `` Since you pulled that stunt with poor Marvin here, the rules were quickly revised. As long as anyone has wishes left, nobody else is eligible for wishes. One for you, two for him.'' 
 
 `` But you did n't grant the wish!'' 
 
 `` We at GenieCorp endeavor to do our best to provide top-notch wish service. However, in the event that a wish is impossible to grant, we do not have a refund policy.'' 
 
 `` Outrageous,'' I mutter. `` Marvin, say to the genie'I wish that the human closest to me had complete jurisdiction over GenieCorp policy.'' 
 
 Marvin dutifully repeats the phrase. 
 
 `` Sorry! The wish hardware makes meddling with anything in its own internal working via wish impossible.'' 
 
 `` But that does n't even make sense!'' 
 
 `` One wish left for each of you.'' 
 
 `` All right,'' I say. `` Two left. Might as well make sure I get something more than money out of this before trying to cheat the system again. Marvin, tell the genie'I wish that Lita from the human nearest to me's chemistry class liked him.' Also, take this.'' 
 
 I hand him half of the million dollars, in a vain attempt to assuage my conscience. 
 
 `` Wow,'' said the genie. `` I feel like there's a lesson to be learned from this. Something about mankind's weaknesses. Or maybe about not trusting it to people who do n't even have their fly up.'' 
 
 I glance down, and hastily zip it up. 
 
 `` Well?'' I demand. 
 
 `` Poof!'' the genie says. `` She did indeed like you, but she's over that now. One wish left.'' 
 
 `` THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT AND YOU KNOW IT!'' 
 
 `` You should thank me,'' said the genie. `` Or, maybe, the rest of humanity should.'' 
 
 I reach into my pocket and withdraw my phone. 
 
 `` What are you doing now?'' 
 
 I glare at the genie. `` Time to put this half a million to use. I need to have a request without loopholes. I'm calling a lawyer.''
