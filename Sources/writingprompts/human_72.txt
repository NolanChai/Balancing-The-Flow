Once again I heard the knock at the door, and calmly left the office room in my house to go answer it. But it was not the front door I went to, nor the back door. Instead, I went to the door leading to the basement. 
 
 `` Who is it?'' I called out, even though there could only be a single person who could enter from my basement. But, it was better safe then sorry. 
 
 `` The machine needs to be washed'' a voice said from the other side. Confirming that it was the person I expected it to be, I opened the door, and came face to face with the man I had know for only a few minutes, and yet forever at the same time. `` Welcome back'' I said. 
 
 The grizzled man on the other side of the door, his clothes torn and tattered, looked up at me, and gave me a sincere smile. `` I'm home'' said the time traveller. 
 
 `` Dinner's on the table'' I said, inviting him in. `` It's been a while since we've had a nice meal.'' 
 
 `` Ca n't'' he groaned. `` I got to go back soon, else they'll change everything again.'' 
 
 `` I noticed.'' I held up my wrist braclet. It was the only thing that the time traveller had ever given me, something that would allow me to notice when something had change in the timeline. `` It's changed three times already. I'm lucky to have a decent meal.'' 
 
 The man smiled at me, but it was a sad smile. Could he tell what I was feeling now? Hoping to hide my feelings, I reached over to the bag near the door and handed it to him. `` I wo n't waste your time then. Here's food, first aid, tools, the usual.'' 
 
 `` Thanks'' he said softly. `` Once again, I owe you one.'' 
 
 `` It's nothing'' I dismissed his gratitude. `` Now go. You have time disrupters to stop, do n't you?'' 
 
 He left, but seemed torn at doing so. Once he was gone, I let my smile slip, and went to the kitchen to eat. I could already feel the timeline start to change, and who knows when the I would next get a hot meal? The past could change at any moment, and tomorrow would not be the same life I had been living today, or the day before. 
 
 I could only do my best to help the one that could set it all right, the time traveller who came to me for help.
