`` And that has been the 80 hours of screeching agony, thank you very much, Greg.'' 
 
 Greg closed his gaping, razor toothed mouth and nodded politely before stepping off of the news set. Everyone was always tuned to this channel to listen to his horrifying shrieks for 3 days every week. Not that they had much of a choice. It was Hell, after all. The newsdemon, adjusted his tie and shuffled his papers. 
 
 `` Up next, we have a very special guest. Those of you from the fifth ring may have heard of him, let's give a nice round of applause to Anger Management leader, Lee Davis Bananthony!'' 
 
 Lee Davis Bananthony was a tiny character, standing no taller than the newsdemon's cloven, blazing foot. His bald head had tiny little nubs where most other demons would have horns, and he wore a suit that looked just barely too big. He shuffled determinedly onto the set and fluttered his impish wings onto the newsdesk, where an equally tiny chair was waiting for him. 
 
 `` Welcome to HNN, Mr. Bananthony.'' the Newsdemon said, with just a hint of condescension in his voice. 
 
 `` It's a pleasure to be here.'' Nodded Bananthony. 
 
 The Newsdemon clicked his pen vigorously. Across the scape of hell, millions of viewers felt a wave of discomfort associated with the distracting clicking. 
 
 `` So, Mr. Bananthony.'' began the Newsdemon. `` You've been working anger management in the fifth ring of hell for...'' 
 
 `` Approximately 1,000 years, yes.'' Bananthony spoke without missing a beat. It was very clear that, despite his incredibly tiny stature, he was a very determined individual. 
 
 `` Incredible! And we've seen a lot of change during that tenure, most of it for the better. It says here that you led an infrastructural update on the River Styx. to get it back to the pristine, ghastly state that it once was.'' 
 
 `` I did, yes.'' Began Bananthony. `` You see, about 80 years ago, we saw a large influx of souls entering hell, and most of them have to cross over the river. The ferryman could only take one, maybe two across at a time, while the rest of the souls were left waiting for several years at a time. An incredibly huge backlog. My political opponents would tell you that these souls ended up in hell in the first place, and they deserve no sympathy. What they do n't understand is that the river Styx is a necessary passage to get souls into the deeper ends of hell, so they can be tortured properly.'' 
 
 `` And that's why there is now a bridge across the river Styx?'' 
 
 `` Absolutely. And it is constructed entirely out of the bones of unbaptized children, so you know that we spared no expense on making sure it does n't collapse.'' 
 
 `` Incredible. So you're saying you had a big announcement to make?'' 
 
 `` Yes.'' Bananthony adjusted his tie. `` I've done what I could in the fifth ring of Hell, but my jurisdiction only ends there. I want to see to it that the entirety of Hell is run properly, and people are tortured to full efficiency. For instance, did you know that, in the Second ring, there are still souls being tortured for being gay? In 2015! God said he's okay with that not too short of a time ago, when he influenced the mortal minds in the American Supreme Court to legalize it across their country. We are spending unnecessary resources in tormenting people who by all accounts did n't do anything wrong. We could be better allocating those resources; pitchforks, branding irons, whips and ball gags -- to punishing rapists, or shipping those resources into the 7th circle for punishing war criminals.'' 
 
 Bananthony was on a roll, he was n't stopping. `` My opponents will tell you that my efforts will only result in a thicker layer of bureaucracy in hell. What they do n't realize is that, in the 21st century, Bureacracy IS hell! It's what we should be all about!'' 
 
 The Newsdemon clicked his talons on the desk. `` Mr. Bananthony, are you implying what I think you're implying?'' 
 
 `` You're damn right I am.'' Bananthony stood up from his tiny chair. a small amount of smoke billowed from his ears. `` My name is Lee Davis Bananthony, and I am running for President of Hell!'' 
 
 `` I'm afraid that's all the time we have, Mr. Bananthony. It was a pleasure having you here.'' Said the Newsdemon as he shook Bananthony's tiny hand. 
 
 `` Thank you very much, Mr. Rivera.'' 
 
 `` Please, call me Geraldo. Coming up next, another interview with Adolf Hitler, and his thoughts on the EU's economic situation.''
