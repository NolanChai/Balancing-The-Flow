*First time be gentle* 
 
 Your side of the bed stills smells like you. Still ca n't bring myself to wash it. Not that I would've bothered anyway, but still. 
 
 I keep telling myself I sabotaged our relationship, like a noble knight sacrificing his love life for the greater good. You are... Were... Too good for me after all. 
 But we both know that's not true. Remember when you said you did n't want a fancy a dinner for our anniversary? I knew you secretly did but apparently saving money was more important to me than actually seeing you happy. 
 Funny how horrible that sounds in hindsight. 
 
 
 
 I wish I could say I hope you're happy, but that would be a lie. Next time I'll see you with another man. One with a job, one that does n't drink alone and, one that can get it up every night. When I see you with that man, I'll tell myself I hope you're happy. I wo n't mean it tough. 
 
 I'll secretly wish I ruined you for other men.
