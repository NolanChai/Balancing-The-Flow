The bags under his eyes felt like a rich leather that he could never afford. He stood on the train platform, standing perfectly still as hordes of others pushed and shoved to make it to their train on time. He silently grew jealous of all the energy they could expend on something as mundane as a daily commute. The prior day, he finally awoke from a two day nap, wrapped in comforting sheets and blankets while surrounded by reassuring bottles of whiskey and gin. He took a step towards the platform with Herculean effort and stared onto the dark, dirty track below him. 
 
 Even though the sun shone and the nearby flowers radiated with brilliant primary colors, he could only feel the impending darkness on his skin like a dying seal covered in oil. His tired eyes muted the vivid colors of the flowers, leaving them as faded and dulled as he saw the rest of the world. His head hooked down towards the yellow line separating him from the track. He felt no sense of finality or conclusion, no sense of satisfaction or comfort from ending the endless parade of sadness; he just wanted to cry. 
 
 He heard the rumble of the train and looked into the tunnel. The two head lights of the train shone with such radiance, he felt like he was staring into the eyes of God. He swallowed hard preparing to let go of the pain. His feet surpassed the yellow line and he fell on the tracks. People shouted and clamored while the rumbling of the train shook and rattle him to his core, but he only shut his eyes. Just as sleep liberated him in life, death will liberate him of life.
