`` Step aside, kid.'' 
 
 Those were my words to the trainer. Everyone of them would defend their portable monsters with all they had. But this one trainer was different. This little girl had no words. She just looked down. Maybe she was crying. She definitely wasnt smiling. 
 
 `` Where is it? Is it this one?'' I inquired. Her Lotad looked at me and became agitated. 
 
 She pointed a finger into the next room in the house. The call only specified there was one dead, but the parents were `` fine''. They could n't speak. They were destroyed. But to me, not speaking stands as fine by now. I've seen it all. So what could it have been? 
 
 As I entered the room, I found the body face down. I could see it then. They were twins. The murderer was standing in a corner, scared, trembling in fear. The Seedot shaked more and more as I stepped closer. 
 
 `` You are no pet. You are a monster.'' 
 
 I pulled the trigger. I could hear the mother breaking down again. Before stepping out, I saw a picture. Two little girls, one wearing red, the other green, holding a pokeball each, and next to them, the two creatures. How could they look so peaceful and innocent, then do such a wrong? 
 
 A phone call. In the middle of a contest? How many victims? I'm on my way. Fucking Fire Pokemon.
