`` How...?'' I ask, looking at this stranger, someone with the same name as me. How can this be? Is it a glitch in the naming system, some sort of unknown error, or has my whole life been a lie? I have to know. I muster the courage to finish my question. `` How can we have the same name?'' 
 The man calmly responds. 
 `` Single space before the name. Instead of `` Micheal'' it's just `` Micheal''. May be the exact same name but technically it's different. Ca n't believe nobody has thought to do it.'' 
 `` Huh.'' I say to this clever stranger. `` What a relief.''
