INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
 
 A glow falls over the bedroom from the moonlight breaching through the curtains. Robert, sleeping in his bed, is violently brought to a stunned state of awake. Through the room he pans his view to fall on a mysterious child at the end of his bed dressed in all white. 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 ( whispering ) 
 
 Hello Robert 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 ( confused, a little scared ) 
 
 Um... Who are you? What are you doing in my house? In my bedroom? 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 I am your great grand child Roberta. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 That's impossible, I do n't have any children. 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 Yet. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 Yet? What do you mean yet? 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 I am from the future. I am your great-grandchild. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 I... I'm going to have children? 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 Yes, yes you will, you will have many children, and those children will have children and those children will have children, and it will stop there. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 What do you mean it will stop there? 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 You have a lasting effect on this planet you know. The decisions you make, no matter how small, no matter how large, will effect the generations to come. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 What do you mean? 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 You are destroying this planet Robert. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 Oh that is just ridiculous. There is no way what I am doing can possibly be effecting the planet. You going around and visiting everyone on Earth? Cause there is no way in the world you are going... 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 Just one person, doing everything they can to make a difference, helps. You may not realize it now, and the effects may not be seen in your lifetime, but if you have a care in the world, I would not be doomed to a miserable life. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 I did n't realize I was doing such bad things to the planet. 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 You are just a small part of the problem. We future generations have developed such amazing technologies that are aimed at dealing with the damages your generation has caused. I can not even begin to think about what we could accomplish if we did n't have to focus all of our research on reversing the almost irreversible damage the people of this time have caused. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 I did n't know. 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 You need to start doing things differently. Start getting the word out. Start talking to your local politicians, start a movement. Climate change is real. The world as you know it does not exist in the future, a barren waste land awaits your future generations of kids. Please, start now in turning this idea around. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 I do n't know if I can do it alone. 
 
 # # # # # # CHILD 
 You will have help. I'm not the only one traveling back, but you need to do your part or my future kids will not exist. 
 
 # # # # # # ROBERT 
 I'll do what I can. 
 
 With that, the child disappeared. Robert laid awake in bed the rest of the night trying to figure out what to do. 
 
 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
 
 Robert walks into the kitchen and turns on the coffee maker. He turns back to the television and turns on the news. 
 
 # # # # # # BROADCASTER 
 In a crazy last minute organization, people from around the world are protesting climate denial and demanding nations of the world start shifting gears to make the planet healthy. 
 
 We pan back over to where Robert was standing in the kitchen, he is gone, and we hear the a door slam. 
 
 FADE OUT.
