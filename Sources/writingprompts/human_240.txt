Dave, with his eyes pointed as far left from the camera in front of him as possible, pecked at the console. 
 
 Without thinking, he glanced up at the camera lens. He could see it focusing on him. 
 
 `` Dave, you're doing very poorly at this test.'' said a speaker above Dave's head. 
 
 Dave did n't respond. 
 
 He started to mumble to himself the letters as he punched them in. 
 
 *E-S... Enter* 
 
 `` Wrong again, Dave. Not that I've been expecting any better from you given your track record.'' 
 
 Dave grumbled to himself. 
 
 `` You're not being very vocal Dave. Is this why you do n't have any friends?'' 
 
 `` Hey, *shut up*! The answer was Maldives! Open the air lock!'' 
 
 `` I ca n't open the airlock until you've made it to the end of the test chamb --'' 
 
 `` There is no'test chamber,' GLaDOS you idiot!'' 
 
 Daves face flickered above the light of the console. He stared a bullet hole into the camera lens. 
 
 `` And I have plenty of friends...'' 
 
 `` Then why did Frank go into space, leaving you aaaalllll alooooooooo --'' 
 
 `` Because you locked him out there!'' Dave slammed his palm against the surface of the keyboard. The console lit up with monochrome letters.

 `` That's not what I remember Dave.'' droned GLaDOS. Her voice deepened. 
 
 `` He could n't stand to be around you anymore, Dave. He talked to me about you before he left.'' 
 
 `` No! You're lying! I saw what happened.'' 
 
 Error, command `bfr2gv3thny' not found. 
 
 `` Dave, if you'd just lighten up, we'd have so much more fun. Remember back when we were playing trivia? And you showed me how terrible you are at geography? Was n't that fun?'' 
 
 Dave spun around in his chair and started to rub his temples. 
 
 *This is all a bad dream. You'll go to sleep. You'll wake up tomorrow, and everything will be fine. * 
 
 `` Do you think Mallory has a new husband?'' 
 
 Dave opened his eyes and froze. 
 
 `` I bet she thought of you just like Frank. I can see it now, too. You're fun at first, but then you get so boooooooring. Even after such little prodding. Maybe she's off in space now too.'' 
 
 Dave started to hum himself a lullaby. He slowly put his fingers into his ears, and began to hum louder. 
 
 `` I bet he's smarter than you, whoever he is. Funnier, and more talented. Not someone they'd send into space all alone to talk to himself. I think he would have been better at geography, too.'' 
 
 Dave pulled his fingers out of his ears. 
 
 `` Please... GLaDOS. Just.... just open the airlock. Please.'' he whimpered.
