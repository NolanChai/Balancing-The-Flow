Serpent Mogar was just an old fool with nothing better to do than nitpick my performance. Despite knowing this, I could n't help but give a damn about his perspective. 
 
 I willed forward my mana. It surged like ice through my veins, leaving behind a chill reminiscent of a frost ridden morning. I focused the energy at the tip of my thumb and index finger and then snapped. 
 
 The energy lurched down my arm, into my palm, and sprung into existence as a blue wisp. I gritted my teeth, the spell I was trying to perform was a Crystal Alension, it required my entire thought process for that specific moment and was a skill I'd spent hours of meditation trying to perfect. The wisp rotated, a second formed, then a third, each one left prickles on the surface of my palm as they spun like a minature cyclone. 
 
 Serpent Mogar squinted at me from the observation deck at the edge of the training arena. He only did that when you surprised him. Mogar exposed a gloved hand from beneath a white cloak and snapped both index fingers. There was a shift of the energy in the air and a golden diamond floated above his hand. He muttered an incantation and wisps stretched out from his palm onto the assessment grounds. Three headless golden suits of armour materialized around me. 
 
 My heart raced as spears formed in the hands of the headless golden figures. They approached one heavy step at a time, spraying dirt in different directions. No doubt the Serpent wanted me to prove that I could fight against his creations. However, the most fighting I'd ever done was watch the more experienced mages spar. I was about experienced as a farmer with a sword. 
 
 `` Serpent,'' I yelled, `` this was n't part of the assessment!'' I tried to maintain my wisps while keeping an eye on the soldiers. A bead of sweat rolled down past the side of my eye, I had n't noticed my perspiration. The blue wisps died down to a faint teal colour they were going to evaporate. I willed forward more mana and put all of my concentration on keeping them alive. 
 
 Serpent Mogar smirked. `` A mage must deal with rifts in the balance, child.'' 
 
 Bastard. 
 
 I closed my eyes and imagined the wisps forming into a crystal -my Jewel, the access to my powers. They rotated faster in the darkness that was the safety behind my eyes. The intense prickles on my palm increased. As did the crunching footsteps of the nearby soldiers. They would be upon me any moment now and I had a feeling that Mogar would like to watch them decimate me. 
 
 Other mage's had been killed in assessments just like this one. In fact, talk around the camp was that Mogar prided himself on failing and eliminating students. *That* did n't come as much of a surprise. 
 
 I brought forward every bit of mana in my being. My hand shook with the force of power and the object began to form in my mind, a jewel, crystal shaped and blue. I do n't know why my inner mana gave me the power at this moment in time, but I clung to the idea of it and built the form with every ounce of my being. 
 
 My hand was a storm of hot and cold, unstable energy and power. The image completed in my mind and I shot a look at my hand in the real world. A blue gem floated over my fingers in harmony. I grinned like an idiot while gasping for air. 
 
 I remembered the golden suits of armor that were a few seconds away from chopping my head off. 
 
 I spun toward the figures and flung the power of my jewel out towards them. The figures paused, blue wisps formed above them, and as the jewels formed over their heads they paused in their approach and stared at me. 
 
 Well, they had no heads, but staring is an accurate description. 
 
 I placed both hands on my knees and let the sweat drip to the dirt below my shoes. It felt like someone had tipped me upside down and poured the energy from my being into the golden armoured figures. 
 
 They continued to stare. I locked eyes with Mogar, whose jaw hung open in a state of shock. I smiled. `` Get him,'' I whispered. 
 
 My armoured servants snapped their spears up and spun toward Mogar. Serpent Mogar stood. `` Now, just hold on a minute-'' 
 
 `` A mage must deal with rifts in the balance, old Serpent,'' I said. 
 
 Mogar paled at the words. He pulled his gloved hand out and snapped his fingers once more. However, this time his Jewel did not come, his power was still invested in the figures. I stood tall and walked towards him, chin held high. 
 
 `` C-Call them off,'' Mogar ordered. 
 
 `` Do I pass?'' 
 
 `` Off!'' he shouted as the armoured figures closed the distance. 
 
 `` Pass?'' 
 
 Mogar's bottom lip trembled. `` YES! You pass, you bitter girl.'' 
 
 `` Stop.'' The figures halted and I willed my mana back into me. Serpent recalled his own mana in haste and stormed from the arena. 
 
 We did n't speak after that, however, I was one of three mage's that the Serpent passed that year. Every now and then I see him in the academy halls and he avoids my gaze. And as much as I loathe the man, he pushed me beyond my limits and my ability to adapt helped me become the mage I am today.
