It truly was an honor sitting around this fire. I knew I did n't belong here but no one seemed to notice or care that I was. So far I had heard some tales from Walt Disney, Homer, and a few others. Bruce Springsteen is weirdly here, from the whispers of others apparently he's pretty damn good. I could sit here and listen to these people forever. That was until Shakespeare had finished telling the story of Macbeth, then all eyes turned towards me. I thought to myself, `` Oh god, they expect me to tell a story now!'' My face started turning red. I have nothing in terms of stories that could compare to theirs! 
 
 `` Ummm... uhh... Dang Shakespeare, you stole mine! Haha.'' 
 
 They did n't seem to be amused. I tried to get up but was immediately pulled back down by Steve Jobs. Collectively they said 
 
 `` WE DEMAND A STORY.'' 
 
 `` Fine fine!'' I yelled back at them. `` I do know one that's pretty good. Its goes a little something like this... Now, this is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down and I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there, 
 I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air.''
