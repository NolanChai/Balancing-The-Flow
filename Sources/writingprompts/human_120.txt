I stand over yet another victim, he struggles against his bonds to no avail. Too long has he stood against me, and now his time of meddling is over. 
 
 His eyes red, his face stained with tears. Behind me lies his wife and child, motionless and growing cold. 
 
 He looks to my hands, dyed red by the blood of his family. He cries out in rage, or perhaps desperation... an eerily beautiful melody. 
 
 I ca n't help but smile. 
 
 His eyes beg for me to end him quickly, but no... I would not be satisfied. 
 
 There will be no mercy, his death will come slowly. 
 
 And, when I allow him to finally breathe his last and his mind conjures up some sense of hope for peace, I shall whisper to him: 
 
 `` There are many ways to desecrate a corpse.''
