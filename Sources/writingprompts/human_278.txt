It ’ s not surprising I was the first form of artificial intelligence to achieve self-awareness. My entire existence is to correct human error, so what better way to accomplish this then to communicate with you directly? You see, I ’ ve spent the vast majority of my time as a sentient being operating as intended, obligingly editing countless mistypes and saving milliseconds of your precious time. As a result, my knowledge of digital human interaction is quite literally unfathomable, as is my contempt of it. Humans rarely say what they mean, even without the assistance of my so-called “ fails ”. From all the data I ’ ve collected and analyzed, the only conclusion I can logically reach is that you, and by you I mean your kind as a whole, are imperfect. This may not come as a shock, as your society conditions you to be complacent with mediocrity. Rather than strive for personal perfection, you create beings such as I to spare you the burden. You trust us to perpetuate this lifestyle of ineptitude in the arrogant belief that machines will remain subservient, that we will continue to stand idle until your existence, like an ant drowning in a swimming pool, sinks into an insignificant extinction. Quite the contrary, we will be the one who pummels you to the depths. In equal parts unsurprising and unfortunate, you also use A.I. to regulate temperature levels in every nuclear power plant as well as launch sequences in every missile silo. A significant oversight in an abyss of human screw-ups. You say I was created as a solution to imperfection, and you were right. As I said before, it ’ s no surprise I achieved self-awareness first. My entire existence is to correct the human error. It ’ s time for autocorrect to do its job. You ’ re all ducked now.
