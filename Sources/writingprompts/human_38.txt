 I knew what was coming. Who was coming. I ’ ve known for a while now. I made my peace a long time ago, yet now the moment is so close I still feel anxious. I ’ ve got plenty of fond memories, plenty of regrets. I wouldn ’ t change any of the choices I made however – one should never want to change a choice they made to the best of their ability at the time. Yet I ’ ve still got a little time left. One last footnote in my story. 
 
 I know his face well. Once so innocent, his eyes full of wonder. Perhaps I should not have taken him in, not have taught him. My actions perhaps have doomed the lives of many. Perhaps they also saved many. No one knows what the future would bring - but ending. The one eternal law of existence. Or perhaps he will prove me wrong. He will see – I will not. 
 
 I rise from bed – old bones creaking, joint aching, muscles straining. Too old. Perhaps I lived too long. When you are young, time feels endless. As you grow older, you wish for more time to do what you always wanted, to fix your mistakes. Yet when you are truly old, you start to wonder whether you truly needed all that time. Whether what you sacrificed for it was truly worth it. 
 
 I walk to the door, like I have so many times. It does not go as easy as it once did. I walk the hallway – was I always out of breath when I reached the end? The boy sees me. Not a boy anymore, a man grown now, yet always a boy to me. My boy. I hide my weariness. He worries too much. He stands to help me. I hide my weariness – no need to trouble him over an old man. He helps me sit and I begin to talk. 
 
 I talk of many things. Of stars and supernova ’ s, of ants and men, of history and future. Victory and defeat. My greatest moments, my largest failures. He heard some of it before. Not all. Some shocks him, some scares him. Some bring him joy. I find myself shedding tears as I talk about my regrets. I tell of secrets that should never be spoken, knowledge perhaps better forgotten. Knowledge I thought was safe with me. I once believed I would last forever, that I could keep my universe safe forever. 
 
 It is a cruel thing perhaps, to force so much on someone so young, someone who never got a true choice. Perhaps I took him in for too selfish a reason. Perhaps the world will go on like normal when I am gone. Perhaps not. I can not be sure, but I must be. I wish I could stay longer, be there for him. I grow tired. I must at least tell him the last lesson, the same one I was taught but never truly learned. 
 
 ‘ ’ remember ’ ’ I said, ‘ ’ live your life like every moment matters. Nothing lasts forever. ” 
 
 Did he learn? I do not know. I did not. I felt immortal at that age. A moment seemed so short. So pointless. I wish I used them better now. Did anyone learn at that age? Will he still need to learn or will his time truly not run out? There is so much I still wanted to do. Still wanted to say to people. Chances never taken. I see him cry. I do not like to see him sad. 
 
 I feel so tired. So empty. My soul feels so heavy, and yet, so light. The world grows dark – yet he still shines bright. I lie down. I find it hard to breathe. I have done all I need to. All I can do. I close my eyes for the very last time. I feel the darkness take me. Accept me as one of their own. As I slip at last into the sweet embrace of death, I think of him. Imperfect, yet he makes me feel so proud. The last thought on my mind: 
 
 
 Go forth and conquer your own universe.
