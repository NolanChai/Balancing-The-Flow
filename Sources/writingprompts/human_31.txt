I looked over my shoulders while quickly wiping the pint glass. I pulled out my stopwatch and quickly put it away. 
 
 2.5 seconds early. 
 
 I flipped over the gate and briskly walked to the door, my thumb rubbing over the timepieces crystal window. My chest was thumping so hard I could feel it in my ears. I glanced sidways, over to Dr. Hawking, who apparently had not noticed me skirting my duties. I looked through the peephole, and held up my timepiece to the visitor. He in turn did the same, his watch late by 2.5 seconds. I turned away from the door. 
 
 `` Dr. Hawkings, there is someone here to see you!'' I called, while opening the door for our visitor. 
 
 `` You are late'', Dr. Hawkings announced, his humour still obvious through the dictation. 
 
 A man entered, his pea coat dripping wet, despite the cloudless night sky. `` Apologies, I came as soon as I heard.''
