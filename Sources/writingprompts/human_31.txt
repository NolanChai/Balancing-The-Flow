We were quite pleased with the result. 
 We followed various instructions with great precision for it to be perfect. Months of preparation, food intake control, pills, blood tests,... 
 Finally it happened, I brought her to the hospital this morning and everything was done by 9pm. It went very well. 
 It was sunday and as the last step of the process came to an end, the nurses went on their business saving lives and left the napkins on the bed. 
 - Enjoy yourselves, they said. 
 Some filth leaked from my mouth and was dripping on my wife's lap. She smiled. 
 I wiped my face with the napkins. Who would have guessed our newborn to be so tasty? 
 ^^Sorry
