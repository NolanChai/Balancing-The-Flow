Lisa, I want you to know I am infinitely proud of you. Every step you make, every dream you have, it's because of me. I did n't ask for this, but you make me believe you are worth anything! Your little eyes never changed from that light grey color you had when born and your beautiful tiny nose is the only thing you have of your mother, and so it's the last thing I have to remember her. 
 
 Today you said your first words. You said `` I love you''. The most beautiful thing any father can hear. I cry `` I love you too'' softly on your little soft ear, also the last thing I said to your mother before she left us the same day she had you, Lisa. You have so much in common with her, being so young, being her daughter. She chose your name, and I think it's the most beautiful name a girl can have, and you deserve it. 
 
 I never wanted to lose my wife. I never asked for a daughter. But I am grateful to have a new love of my life. I love you and I will protect you, my daughter and I hope you truly love me too.
