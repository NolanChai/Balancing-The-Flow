Kishua never asked to be taken from his village. It was the first time his village had ever had a Samurai of it's own, and now he was gone. And all because no one in the entire history of the future could match his skills. He was in the future only long enough to learn what he must do, and why, and trained him in the skills necessary before they sent him back to the past. But not so far back as the time he came from, and so to him he was still in the future. Only, his presence changed the future they had sent him from, and any help they could send him disappeared, because the future was now a different one, and the ones who had trained and sent him now gone, the future he had come from was now the past. And so he would forever remain, the samurai from the future of what once was, part of his past intact, part of it gone, and a present he had never asked for
