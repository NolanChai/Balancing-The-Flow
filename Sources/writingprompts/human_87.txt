`` Daddy, there's something under my bed''. 
 I adapt a stoic, manly face. I do n't want my daughter to be scared. 
 `` Oh, my sweet, Daddy'll scare the monsters away.'' 
 I look under her bed and see my daughter, again, saying: 
 `` Daddy, there's something on my bed...'' 
 
 I gasped. How could this be? I only had one daughter... She did n't have a twin. I stared at the girl under the bed. 
 Then I looked at the girl on the bed- Which one was my daughter? Was I going crazy? Was this some kind of weird, nightmare? 
 
 The girl crawled out from under the bed, revealing that she had red eyes- That was definitely *not* my daughter. 
 And now that she was standing up, I could see quite a few differences between this girl and my real daughter. 
 
 This girl had black hair, my daughter's hair was dark brown. This girl's clothes were ripped, and she had scars all over her body. 
 My daughter's clothes were brand new and she had no scars. 
 
 This girl's eyes were red. 
 My daughter's were sky blue. 
 
 And my daughter did n't have a huge blade....
