`` I do n't know. I picked it from a whole bunch of boxes because it had one of these... men with four legs and four arms on it. You know, in a circle? Like on that biology book of yours.'' 
 
 She stares at me for a moment, a strange mix of irritation and amusement on her face. 
 
 `` I mean, who would've thought anyone would send us anything back at all? It's all just modern kid's toys and wannabe science and stuff.'' 
 
 -'' Frank, it's not about the science or the test. Remember what I told you about Mr. Gall and his... experiments. It does n't work, never has... it's about the people behind it, the motivations.'' 
 
 -'' What?'' 
 
 She sighed, looked down, glanced at the letter on the table. 
 
 -'' Look, Frank, it does not matter what the test did, if it is accurate or if there was even a test in the first place. I mean, it does n't look like they put a lot of effort into making it believable. Here,'unknown and unidentifiable', what is that supposed to mean? If I were to create such a test, I sure as hell would not put anything on the result sheet that would make it look even more like a pseudo-science that does n't have its methods straight.'' 
 
 -'' You're not making any sense. And why are you so upset about the whole thing at all?'' 
 
 -'' We're at war, Frank. People are killing each other just because someone thinks some people are better than others because some of their physical features have different measurements.'' 
 
 The sudden knock at the door makes her flinch. 
 
 -'' Who the hell...'', I murmur, getting up. Three gentlemen in suits are standing in the doorway. I take a look past them and notice three dark Fords parked across the street. 
 
 -'' Good evening. Is this the Andrews residence?'' 
 
 -'' Yes, but --'' 
 
 -'' Police, Sir. It has been brought to our attention that a certain Margot KÃ¤chele is living here. Under the US Justice Department's Enemy Alien Control Program, we have been ordered to detain persons of German ancestry until further notice. Comply and you shall not be harmed.'' 
 
 Confused, I turn around. She is standing at the far side of the room, pale and shaking. 
 
 -'' I love you'', she says, quietly.
