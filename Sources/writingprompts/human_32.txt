I say I was born this way, but that is a lie. 
 
 I say that I was always meant to be, but that is also a lie. 
 
 I sleep by day, and walk by night, and the moonlight keeps me fair, but that too is a lie. 
 
 As I lie awake, I dream of being more than what I have achieved, but yet, that is also a lie. 
 
 A world where truth disfigures and falsehoods improve you, is that world a lie? 
 
 I wish it were, because when everyone tells me that I am the most gorgeous in existence, that too, is a lie.
