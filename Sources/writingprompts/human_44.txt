August was a nerd, by many definitions of the word. He had a master degrees in physics, although being unemployed for some time now; a passion for science fiction and space adventures graphic novels, a rubik cube he'd scramble and solve repeatedly, each cycle in about 15 seconds while he waited for the comunicator to scan for lower frequencies, and a notebook ( a paper one ) where he'd scratch frequencies, doodles, and math games. Hell, he even did so with a pen he'd tuck to his white shirt's pocket. Unemployed, a lot of free time, but with money from his premature retirement. Some friends that would call him, and he'd even grab a few beers with them too, but he preferred to stay alone. This was reinforced by the fact that he moved to a rural area and his only link was the line phone that sporadically went mute. The phone and the radio. 
 
 The radio was his most ardent hobby. He'd talk with transatlantic freight operators, hermits, nerds, and all the technique of operating the transmiter felt like doing something important, almost classified. He even helped a tug boat that flipped over during a storm to get rescue. He was very proud of the radio. For such pride, when the thing started to receive very strange noises from almost every frequency he'd try, he had the stupid idea of getting up the roof to adjust the antena. He grabbed an extra aluminum rod and a ladder and went there. Of course, in his condition, he tripped, lost balance and felt, thankfully just after putting the new rod in place. After a few minutes grunting in the ground, he went back in, turned on the thing and same old, the noises, now even stronger. But then he realised something that only a nerd like him could realise. It was n't random noises. It was!! --!!! --!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!!!. and then!! again. Now why this was in every frequency he tried was out of his grasp. As he did n't know the frequency to answer, he just broadcasted it back, backwards,!!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!! --!!! -!!, put it on loop, and deemed solving another round of Rubik's cube. 
 
 Meanwhile, a Trinotian, bored after inspecting all the inventory of plebotinum decided to check the communication room. Hopefully he'd be already in the Australis-8 gravitational field, and he'd be able to talk with his family. A 100 years trip was n't easy to stand away from family, even for a species that lives up to seventy thousand years. A hundred is still a long time. He checked his current position and tried to transmit to a frequency he'd know by heart now. Not even a beep. Sad, he looked at the void through a window and asked `` So, so many stars! and I'm here decades away from the only one to have someone to talk.''. As a sad joke, he broadcasted to a random frequency just a bunch of beeps!! --!!! --!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!!!, and at the same time he released the `` transmit'' button, a huge electrical noise echoed inside the ship, the lights went to pane, and he swear he could felt the wall below him accelerating against his floating body just for a moment. After the lights went back on, and he inspected the cargo bay for structural damage, he went back to the communication room and realised the transmiter was behaving oddly. Beeping his same last message over and over while the frequency adjustment rotated randomly on the screen. He mashed every button he could, and just when he was giving up, the frequency locked into a number and the message stopped beeping. But who knows why, with his eyes dead on the number locked in the frequency adjuster, he typed again, one last time!! --!!! --!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!!!. After a few seconds staring at the screen, the speakers of the cabin non-chalantly announced `` Receiving Message... Message received... Playing Message:!!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!!!!!! --!!!!!!! --!!!!! --!!! -!!... Message Over''.
