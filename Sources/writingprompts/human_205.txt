I can not really go back to a first. Victims one through eight were all at the same time. 
 
 I was 16 years old, in High School. I had been put in human anatomy. I always wanted to be a doctor, so this interested me. 
 
 But the class was boring. We did next to nothing all day. I decided I could learn this myself. That night, it happened. Eight victims, one night. I drove around in my pickup truck, with the cover on, of course. I'm not an idiot. Through the night, I found 8 people who fit my goals. 
 
 One infant male, and one female. One child male, and one female. One teenager male, and one female. And finally, one adult male, and one adult female. 
 
 I did n't want to damage the bodies, so I killed them all with a homemade garotte, made of piano wire. I took the bodies in, and took them down to the crawl space. 
 
 I proceeded to cut them open, and study the bodies. I found large differences in each. 
 
 I spent about 17 hours on this, and threw away my results. The bodies were too varied, so my results would n't matter in the long run. 
 
 The sand in the crawl space went down 12 feet, so I made eight makeshift coffins, and buried them. 
 
 How'd I do? My first writing prompt ever. I also have n't really ever written anything before. Please leave some criticism if you would.
