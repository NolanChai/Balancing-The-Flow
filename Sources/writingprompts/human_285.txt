I ca n't remember the first time that I died. 
 
 Hi, my name is Jacob Black. Or has been for as long as I can remember. I have a superpower, namely, when I die - suicide or murder or death by old age - I wind up in my baby body, and start over again. Not surprisingly, I remember details from my previous lives. I know everything about my parents, Jillian- the girl next door and my wife in many of my lives, and the rest of the people living in the small town of Jacksonville. 
 
 I tried to make my life better, but there is only so much you can do. I have found that my life follows on some broad lines. For example, I never make it past the normal jobs, have the same people from the neighborhood, love the same woman. I tried to cheat by saving my money and burying it under plank-boards, but I never find it. I also read the latest technological developments and also latest discoveries in science, but I never remember them. So basically, I live the same life and lose the all mine loved ones over and over again - my mother mostly dies from cancer, my children never survive long, Jillian is never the same after. I have killed myself numerous times to escape this fate of my loved ones, but I always end up back here..... I always come back. 
 
 So if you are reading this, please do not try to resuscitate me. I have enough power for my cryogenic suspension and my **happy'' `` normal'' Earth simulation** to last an eternity. I just hope not to be born again. *I do n't want to go back. *
