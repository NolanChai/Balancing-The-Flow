I firmly smacked the butt of my cigarette with whatever was left of my forefingers. I tipped the hat off, something I had been doing to pay my heeds to the ghosts of the unrested ever since Ana died, or was rather killed, but then again, ghosts do n't kill do they? They just take away whatever they want, and only a chosen few of us.. The unfortunates, are left to live with the actualisation of what had happened. 
 
 *Oh sweet sweet Ana* cried Martio, or rather the remains of him, as I stoked his heart with another chunk of whatever these darts were made of, seemingly not caring but noticing enough to realise what was coming was his rest. 
 
 *So Martio. Its been 25 years, has n't it? * Said I, trying to maintain my calm while stroking my cigarette again, as if to hide whatever miserable look I had that day on me, for it felt just like yesterday. It felt just like today. It felt just like now. Every moment. Every existence. Every little stroke of the clock felt like that time. When my beautiful Ana.. Brutally murdered.. By someone she had loved before he had even realised what love was. 
 
 *For it has* 
 
 *Tell me, again, Martio. Why did you ever kill her? * 
 
 *It is n't killing, is it now? But I'll still answer your question. * 
 
 I gulped on my anxiety. It has come. The time. I had waited 25yrs for this. To know why she had to go. He then whispered.. 
 
 *Because she was never there for me. I do n't need people who are n't there for me. * 
 
 *She loved you more than anyone she's ever loved. Why did you ever do that? * 
 
 *Maybe because she never smiled thinking about me. There were always tears. Nothing but tears when she heard my name. So.. I had a Glasgow engraved on her. At least she was smiling at the end* 
 
 The cigarette that had already burnt off and was now lighting up the flesh of my skin seemed too unimportant to even give a thought about as I realised he'd never understand what her tears ever meant and that I had spent the bitter 25 years of my life chasing finding a reason to a dog chasing a car. 
 
 I took out the specially assigned gun and the only darts to have these miserable vagabonds of the purgatory rest as I said one last one word.. 
 
 *Goodbye* 
 
..to Martio, My unborn child.
