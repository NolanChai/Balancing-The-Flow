To: Ship's Commanding Officer 
 
 Subject: [ Urgent ] Revised Mission Orders 
 
 The only situation in which you will read this message is one in which our nation has completely and irrevocably fallen. Our military has been defeated, our capital lies in ruins and our government has been captured. We shall join our former allies in the annals of history as those who were willing to fight the Enemy with their dying breath. With us, all hope of resistance has perished. 
 
 I wish to thank you and your crew for faithfully doing your duty. You are hereby released from your vows of service. My last instructions come not as an order but as a request: seek not revenge but an opportunity for a new life. Instead of returning to the continent and using your ship's weapons in a final act of resistance, go to the neutral port named in the enclosed file. Contact the ambassador there. A message similar to this one will have been sent to all embassies and consulates, detailing the creation of sanctuaries. Our citizens may not be able to successfully defy their new oppressors, but they might endure long enough to consider escape. I urge you to help build a place of refuge for those who would risk such desperate measures. May the rebirth of our culture be your swan song. 
 
 Yours faithfully, 
 
 President Andreus Abbagnano
