`` What the hell are you looking at?'' I raged. 
 
 It was my last day, I had stopped caring a long time ago. I had always wanted to screw with the people I hated most in the office: James from sales, Katie from accounts receivable, and Leah, the VP of this pathetic business. 
 
 For James: the above sentence was uttered as I stumbled out of the stall in the men's bathroom, completely drunk. 
 `` You say a word, I'll accuse you of sexual harassment, James.'' 
 
 `` Are you drunk?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, what of it?'' 
 
 `` Why are you in the men's bathroom?'' 
 
 `` Because why not?'' 
 
 
 I was n't intending on this being my revenge, but alcohol is a helluva drug.
