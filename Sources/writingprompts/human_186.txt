Carson leant on the edge of an unmarked warehouse in his black, Prada sports jacket - a little extra for the job he knew was coming next. He took a drag of his cigarette. It would n't be easy. He knew he had to be careful and discrete but, after all, there was a reason he was the one chosen to do it. 
 
 The silhouetted figure approached, and loomed over him. 6'5''. Black. Holy shit, this guy was intimidating. `` You got it?'' Carson queried casually. `` All here. All ready.'' Smiled the newcomer, showing teeth that could crush his forearm with one bite. `` Then let's do it.'' 
 
 They calmly strolled into the warehouse and were greeted by a man who was much less intimidating than Carson's new accomplice. Average height. Shabby beard. Black trench coat. The kind of guy you warn you kids not to take candy from. `` Gentlemen! So nice to see you! And perfectly punctual too. I'm impressed.'' Grinned the inhabitant of the building. 
 `` Fuck off with your small talk and let's get this over with.'' was the growled response. 
 `` Fair enough then,'' Trench coat replied, `` do you have my client's orders?'' 
 A grunt as the giant reached into his pocket and pulled out a small package the size of smartphone. Carson watched in anticipation and he threw this object to the shabby man who caught it easily. His grin widened as he observed the wrapped-up device. 
 `` My my, you boys certainly are resourceful. Do you mind telling me where you acquired such a thing?'' 
 `` What's it to you?'' Spat the giant. 
 `` Well, quite a lot actually.'' replied Trench Coat as he reached into his pockets and replaced the newly acquired item with a pistol and a badge. `` FBI! You're both under arrest.'' 
 The giant responded with a confused look and muttered, `` Wait, this is n't right...'' as he withdrew his standard issue badge and his expression was returned. 
 The two men turned to look at the third man as if expecting to see another badge. What they were greeted with, however, was a swinging door. 
 Carson sprinted to a nearby place he knew was hidden and safe before retrieving his cellphone and pressing speed dial number 1. `` Boss, you were right about those two. Blow the place.''
