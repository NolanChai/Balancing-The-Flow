If I could describe my life in one word, it would be mediocre. It was a simple, typical life, you know, the clich√© wife and two kids, minimum wage cubicle job kind of life. 
 
 One night I went to sleep, same as normal, but I had an odd dream. I saw in front of me a huge staircase leading up into the clouds. I climbed and climbed for what seemed to be an eternity to find two huge golden gates. I immediately thought, `` These must be the gates to heaven!'' I walk through and the landscape is black. The doors closed and slowly faded away into the deep, pulsing black now completely surrounding me. I rush back and try to escape to no avail. The doors are gone. So I think, `` Hey, it's just a dream.'' So the only real way to escape a dream is to harm yourself, right? I pinched myself. I slapped myself. I cut myself with my nails. But there was no pain, and it was clear: this was no dream. 
 
 I keep walking into the darkness, and suddenly, I lose control of myself. I am forcibly walking along and I ca n't stop myself. Then, in huge letters I see the words `` Level 1 Complete!'' Then it adds 8300 XP to a counter above me. `` Weird,'' I thought, `` it's kinda like those video-majigger things my grandsons play on their NES thing. Then it says, `` Level 2.'' Huge blue gates appear in front of me. 
 
 It's been 20 years since that day, and I've spent half of them trying to contact those of you in Level 1. I published this here, hoping my sons and grandchildren see this. Hopefully I'll see you in the next level! 
 
 P.S. If you think life is hard now, just wait. Level 2 is a lot harder.
