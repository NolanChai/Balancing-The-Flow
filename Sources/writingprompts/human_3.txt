I heard a thump, and then Wealthy screamed his little heart out. I rushed down the hallway and into his room, and Bites People was already kneeling by him, his leg in her hands. 
 
 `` You. Off.'' I shouted at her, and she swiftly sulked back toward the closet. I knelt down to look at his scraped-up knee. His cries had slowed to whimpers as I asked him what happened. 
 
 `` We... \**sniff*\* were playing... \**sniff*\* an' I tripped over the castle... \**sniff*\* an' I landed on a lego... \**sniff*\* and the carpet burned my knee!'' 
 
 I scooped him up in my arms and headed for the medicine cabinet. `` Oh, sweet baby boy, Mom'll fix it.'' I said. His face lit up and he shouted `` Bitey's a doctor! She can fix it!'' I glanced back at Bites People, still sulking in the corner. *God, I hate when I snap at her. * 
 
 `` What do you say, Doctor Bites People? Can he be saved?'' She bit her lip and grinned. `` I need a band-aid and a sucker, stat!'' she shouted, running past me into the bathroom. I set Wealthy up on the counter and she immediately went to work alternately dabbing his knee with a wet cloth and blowing on it. We did n't have any suckers left so I grabbed a popsicle for each of us, orange green and red. When I returned the bandage was on and she was just bending down to kiss it better. I stifled the urge to pull her away. *He's five, after all. * I thought. *If she was going to bite him, she'd have done it already. * She'd never bitten anyone, not in all of her eight years on this earth so far. Maybe it was the precautions we put in place to stop her doing it, or... maybe she had no intention of biting anyone in the first place. 
 
 Could Oracle have been wrong? Having an off day? When she named me Worrier, did she *predict* I'd be a worrier, or did she doom me to be one by naming me such? Maybe we're all just self-fulfilling prophesies. Maybe President would still be President if he were named Reads Books. Then there's that! I knew a Reads Books in high school and he did n't really read *that* many books. I never outpaced him, but others did- Precocious, Scientist... even Cheerleader! 
 
 `` I'm sorry I snapped at you. I know you were trying to help.'' I told her, and she paused her slurping on her popsicle to say `` It's okay, I know.'' I gave her a cautious hug, then pulled away - just in case. 
 
 We decided to watch a movie after that, but I could n't shake these thoughts. Wealthy simply adores her, and she's a wonderful big sister. I should n't be so scared of her, but what if Oracle was right? I wish I did n't worry so much.
