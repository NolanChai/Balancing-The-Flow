As I synced my smart house to the phone the Bluetooth symbol started to grow on my screen, everything in my home began to shake violently.he promised the new smart home would go off without a hitch. As it stopped abruptly the doorbell rings. I open the door to find a a baby. And a note.the note reads you have been selected to raise the reincarnte of the thunder God Thor, flipping to the back of the card the Bluetooth symbol..As I inspect the being i notice he has a tattoo with the word Mjnoir written on his bicep and on his chest something written in strange language. thinking to myself it's illegal to give babies tattoo's right. The baby giggles and as I cautiously go to pick it up it shocked me mercilessly, I started violently shaking realizing this just might be a immortal being or a really good prank.I go back to the door and notice the baby has grown noticeably into a young toddler. I escort him inside.my girlfriend is coming over for dinner Thor I guess. The little boy nods his head.as I check my phone I notice it's filled with strange symbols. Later I'll figure this out later
