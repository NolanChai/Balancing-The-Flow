My favorite instrument is the pipe organ- I could play it all day long and never feel underwhelmed. The sound it emits is just so magnanimous and exhilarating, and to think that it's nothing more than the passage of air through tubes... I am ceaselessly amazed by it. 
 
 I do admit, though, that it takes a true artist to extract and utilize the potential from such a finicky instrument. You need precise control over your fingers, a strong mind for music and sharp ears. I would say it's much different than typical wind instruments. 
 
 Oh, and the pipes. They are the core, since all produced sound is their work. I breathe life into them and they sing for me, at my whim. It's an intense feeling of control, knowing that the music is simply a physical extension of my mind; a sonogram of my thoughts. I get a rush of adrenaline and sweat as I play, my dancing fingers orchestrating a magnificent choir. 
 
 Most people do n't even know that if you pull someone's trachea out through their throat, you can hear the air whistle in and out... in and out... with every strained breath. A little pinching and you can control the pitch ever so slightly, and every person's is different- you have to learn how to play each one. My dream is to make an symphony using several different people, one day. 
 
 Of course, only a true artist could manage such a thing. If there is one, it's me.
