`` Mom, get down from there'', my son sighed with a tired voice, folding his arms as he looked up to the roof of the house in which he was raising my grandchildren. Too stoned to listen, I deliberately dropped the empty beer can from my hand and let it rattle down the roof tiles into his nice rose bushes. `` The view is too pretty, dear'', I announce loudly enough for him to hear, though no longer looking at him. Alexander was a handsome man, an interesting combination of his father and my brother, though I never saw either of them with grey in their hair or crow's feet at the corners of their eyes. 
 
 `` Mom'', little Alex started again, sounding increasingly irritated, `` the view has been the same for the last five years. Yes, the future is beautiful, Japan won the third world war, there's a blowjob machine in every street corner and you do n't have cancer anymore. I know, it is great, but you get down from there right now.'' Defiantly, in part purely to spite him, I cracked open a second beer. Third, I guess. Down below, Alexander sighed, shaking his head. 
 
 `` Do you want me to have Edward carry you down from there again?'' Why did he have to give my grandson such a stupid name? I shook my head. `` I like it here. Ca n't I at least finish watching the sun set? I'll come back in as soon as it's dark, promise.'' I did n't need to see Alexander's glare from the garden as I felt it drilling to my head. `` No, mom, you're coming down right now.'' He had his father's voice. A voice of a man used to commanding, and having his command obeyed. 
 
 `` But ca n't I just-'' I started before he cut me off. `` No. My house, my rules, and you are coming down *right now* young woman.'' Grumbling to myself, I gathered the last three unopened beers, leaving the remains of the blunt on the roof tiles. Would he find it, there would be no end of it.
