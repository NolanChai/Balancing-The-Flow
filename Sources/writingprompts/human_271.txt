I ca n't sleep. I've tried. After the first two weeks of sleepless nights, I finally resorted to taking up hobbies. Basket weaving. Pie baking. Snail shell gold flaking, which was a hobby when I woke up, I found out. Nothing helped. 
 
 I was like the walking dead for the longest time; I may have been a sleeping beauty, but I was now a waking terror. The servants would go to Charming for their requests, because I would send them off to do more work. I was awake, after all.. why should n't they be? 
 
 Speaking of Charming, he was n't of much help. Sure, he kept the servants at ease, but ruled out all attempts of sleeping next to him with his snoring. But, that was back when I was optimistic about getting sleep. Now, that's just a memory of a daydream. 
 
 I finally have found my one true calling. Weaving thread. It's an obsession, now. It's all I can do. I use the money I make from my'royal threads' threads line to buy every single spindle I can get my hands on. And I do put my hands on them. 
 
 I prick every single finger on every single spindle in hopes that I can be put to sleep for even just an hour. Before my century sleep, there were no spindles in the kingdom for fear of me. Now, there are no spindles in the kingdom because I own them all. 
 
 I feel that it must be my destiny to find a black spindle that will ease my insomnia. But, my destiny has not yet come, so I wait. And wait.
