Blinking, Carlos narrowed his eyes. Celsius? 98.6 degrees Celsius!? That's enough to boil the water in his body, he was about to fry alive! 
 
 Then he thought about it. Would n't he have already if he was going to? I mean 98 degrees is a lot in the metric system. Maybe something was wrong with the thermometer? 
 
 As he thought this, he realized there was something wrong with the thermometer, as in it was on fire in his hand. A hand that was now glowing red like super-heated metal. 
 
 Panickedly, he dropped the thermometer and screamed as the carpet caught fire from his blazing shoes and the melted goo that splattered on it. Rapidly, flames rose around him, and he screamed again. Then he stopped. He was n't burning. He did n't feel all that hot. His clothes had burned off, but he was unbothered by the heat. 
 
 Then Carlos remembered that he lived on the bottom floor of the complex. 
 
 `` **Shit. **''
