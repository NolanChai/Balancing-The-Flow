-10,000 karma. Impressive. I had built up as much as I could. I stayed on the straight and narrow. Original content. Sharing things my friends have done. Useful or amusing discussion in the comments. What did I do wrong? There was no time. I had so little time to fix this. I would be lying if I said I was worried, though. In a world such as this it is useful to have a contingency plan. 
 
 I open up my YouTube app and copy a link. A pit in my stomach forms. Is this the right thing to do? What if this backfires? Well, that does n't matter. Sink or swim, I must. I share the link on the Videos board and test the post to see if it worked. My YouTube app opens and the video begins to play. I lie in bed, listening to Toto's `` Africa,'' and pray.
