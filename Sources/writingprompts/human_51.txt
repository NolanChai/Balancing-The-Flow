I had just put my 4 year old son to bed when I heard three faint taps on the window in his room. I disregarded it and started to leave when I heard it again. Out of curiosity I checked to the window to see what was causing it. To my dismay, I saw my little son standing out on the fire escape, eyes wide in terror. 
 
 I did n't look back. I had seen enough horror movies to know not to turn around. Instead I quickly opened the window, grabbed my son, and went down the fire escape as fast as I could. I do n't know what I tucked in to my son's bed, and I sure as hell had no intentions of finding out.
