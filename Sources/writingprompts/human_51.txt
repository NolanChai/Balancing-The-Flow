The log truck rumbled to a stop. Its diesel engine had been running hot the last hour, and it clicked and clanked now in the cool winter air. Dexter Morgan pulled a toque over his head and climbed down from the cab. 
 
 `` You Brian?'' A dark haired man walked his way, his black vest shining in the moonlight. He offered Dexter his hand. `` I'm Tig. That's a nice rig you got here man, what's wrong with her?'' 
 
 The red and yellow Morrow-Teller sign illuminated the dark lot. Several trucks and bikes were lined up out front. 
 
 `` Yeah, she's a beaut.'' Dexter spoke in a southern accent. `` That fifth gear has really been giving me issues though.'' 
 
 `` Yeah, no problem, no problem.'' Tig placed his hand on the truck's hood. He pulled it away quickly. `` Damn, she's burning up. When is she due?'' 
 
 `` Excuse me?'' 
 
 `` The logs, how long until you're supposed to deliver?'' Tig watched the road over Dexter's shoulder, his eyes scanning the shadows. 
 
 `` Oh, no rush.'' Dexter looked over his shoulder. `` You expecting someone?'' 
 
 `` No, we're just about to close up though,'' Tig said. As he spoke the Teller-Morrow sign went dark. `` See? You're the last job of the day. I'm just wondering if we need to get started on her tonight, or can it wait for the morning?'' 
 
 `` I'm at your mercy,'' Dexter said. He pointed to a row of nearby motorcycles. `` One of those yours?'' 
 
 `` Oh yeah, this one here. This is my beaut.'' Tig walked to the side of his black ride, patting her lovingly. 
 
 `` Nice,'' Dexter said tracing a hand along the handlebars. `` I'm a crotch rocket man myself.'' 
 
 `` Hey, to each their own right?'' 
 
 A soft rumble came from the east. Tig's head twitched in that direction. The noise grew louder and louder turning from a hum into individual roars. A convoy of bikes turned onto the road a block away. Tig took a few steps towards the gate before stopping and turning back. Dexter was still looking the bike over. 
 
 `` Uh, hey... Brian? I got ta close up here. Can I get those keys?'' 
 
 `` Oh, you betcha.'' Dexter walked over, placing a set of keys in his hand. The bikes came rumbling into the lot, one by one backing up to join the rows of bikes. 
 
 `` We've got your number right? We'll give you a call tomorrow and tell you what the damage will be.'' 
 
 `` Perfect,'' Dexter said. He began walking to the exit as the bikers dismounted their rides. A blonde man watched him wearily. Dexter nodded to him as he passed by, but the man just stared. 
 
 `` Who was that?'' Jax asked when the man walked passed. 
 
 `` Just a customer man.'' 
 
 `` He looks familiar.'' 
 
 Dexter reached the street and disappeared into the shadows. He look his hand out of his pocket, and held it in front of his face. A single hair was there, plucked from Tig's helmet. Dexter carefully put it into a plastic bag and continued walking. He had a feeling he'd enjoy his stay in Charming.
