The wind tugged at his hair almost playfully as he stood quietly surveying the battlefield. There was, in truth, not much left to survey. His victory had been complete, his force overwhelming, his fury absolute. Electricity still crackled through the air, earthing itself in the bodies of the warriors that lay broken before him. 
 
 They had sought to oppress the people of this last, great human city through the cybernetic implants they so desperately needed to survive. He had broken them. They had sought to halt the civil uprising that swelled up on a wave of economic freedom. He had broken them. Finally, they had sought to stop *him*. To stop his scourging of their corrupt Order, his imposition of a new ideological doctrine. He had broken them one last time. This time, completely. The war had lasted years, it had ravaged the city, cost millions of lives. The war that ended the world as we knew it was supposed to be the last one. Humanity was supposed to have learnt its lesson. We had to change, to co-operate, if we were to survive the harsh world the nuclear fallout left to us. How quickly we forgot, he thought. All because we thought cybernetics made us gods. He laughed, loudly, startling several of his aides and allies who stood nearby. 
 
 All the same, the war was won, the city was his. But he did not want it. He never had.
