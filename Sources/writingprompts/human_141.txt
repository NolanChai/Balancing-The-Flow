He stood, as every man would, with the palms of his hands sweaty as ever. This is what it feels like to be two minutes away from a definite answer to something that's been troubling him for as long as he can remember. His rib cage tightened and his heart started to beat quickly - not because he's in danger, like his outdated brain thinks - but because if he gets the 10th questions correct, he will have nothing else to live for. He will be satisfied and that scared him. 
 
 The host looks to him and says `` well, here's the moment of truth. After this commercial break.'' This is a tactic used to keep viewers interested but it also serves as a torture technique to the player of the game. 
 Ten minutes later when his adrenaline levels have finally settled, he is prompted to answer the last question of all. `` Why would you like a glimpse of God?'' 
 
 As simple as it sounds, the three letter word of `` why'' is the hardest question on earth to answer. Not many men on earth have had the guts to ever ask themselves this question and the gameshow host knows that. 
 
 “ Because I want to know what he looks like.'' As soon as the word “ like ” left his mouth, the red light lit up the room and he heard the buzzer sound. 
 
 “ I ’ m sorry to say that is not the correct answer. ” 
 
 He tried to fight it “ but… it ’ s a subjective question. ” 
 
 “ It was the wrong answer. ” Said the host. 
 
 Before he could get the opposite of his glimpse, he looked around and realised he was in a mental institute and this game had taken place 11 years ago. He ran through it one last time in his head. How was his answer wrong? And then he realised “ my premise was wrong. First, I said ‘ I want to ’ and they knew that was a lie. I, like everyone else, knew nothing about what I wanted. Secondly, you called God “ he. ” God has no gender. ‘ He ’ was made in man ’ s image, not the other way around. ‘ He ’ is a product of our imagination. ” 
 
 “ According to logic ” the man thought “ the opposite of a glimpse of God is a clear view of the devil. Why haven ’ t I seen the devil? If God was made in man ’ s image, so should the Devil be? ” And then he realised where he was. He was locked up like an animal for the past 132 months. Man is the Devil and he saw a very clear image of this in his time here. He saw the nurses abuse people and give them more drugs than they needed. His mind raced off again and he thought “ I need to tell this to someone ” and then his logical mind kicked in “ They ’ ll just think I ’ m crazy. ” 
 
 As he thought this, the nurse walked in and said “ it ’ s time to go pray. ”
