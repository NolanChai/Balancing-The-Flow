She had n't been home for a week now. By itself, that was n't unusual. That, coupled with the fact that I had n't heard her drunken and/or drugged-up voice begging me to cover up her excursion to some frat boy's rape party, was strange. She always called by the next day, and often returned by the fourth. 
 
 *'' Do you know where Odette is? `` * 
 
 *'' Of course, Mrs. Pane. She just called me from her room. `` * 
 
 They'd believe anything I told them. This was the way things were here, and it always was and always would be. I'd used it against everyone in town except Odette. 
 
 Which was why I needed her back here - I needed her to tell me what was real and what was n't. Everyone believed what I told them, to a fault. Until now, my mom still believed I would die if I did n't get enough skittles. Oh, how the things I did haunt me. 
 
 Only Odette was real. She was untouched, her mind virgin and innocent reality. I needed to figure out where she was, but how? I'd told everyone in town she was just `` skipping class in the library,'' or, `` in the woods behind the park,'' or, of course, `` sick at home.'' 
 
 *'' Where's Odette? `` * 
 
 *'' I saw her by the store, Micah. She looked like she was waiting for someone. You know, I know you're trying to help her, but boys like you should stay away from girls like those. Some people look like they need saving, but just want to drag you down with them. `` * 
 
 Odette was n't by the store, but I had n't told him she was by the store. Did I just miss her? 
 
 Why'd I pick someone as unreliable as Odette as my anchor anyway? I could have picked boring old Suzanne from down the block, or even my cheery younger sister, who lived on the other end of town with Dad. Maybe it was her long limbs and the languorous grace with which she moved. 
 
 Maybe. I could have her, if I wanted to. I could make her want me, if I wanted to. But I wanted her to want me of her own accord ever since she spat on my face the day she moved here ten years ago. 
 
 I used to dream about us leaving this hellhole town together. Now I had nightmares where we went to the woods and I would fall asleep, only to wake up all alone in the darkness of the night, realizing that Odette was n't there for me anymore and I was stuck in a land of people who would eat their hands if I told them to. 
 
 *'' Where's Odette? `` * 
 
 *'' Oh Micah, it's okay. I know. I heard her voice from your room. Remember to use protection if... you know? All right? I wish you'd find a nicer girl, though. She's damaged, that one. You're on your way to a great college, possibly an ivy, even. Be careful. `` * 
 
 My room was empty, my bed cold and perfectly made. A dozen unopened skittles packs lay on the bedside table. Was Odette fucking with me, hiding from me? I opened my bathroom door quietly, half-expecting her to jump out and crash into me, tumbling onto me in that boyish way of hers, unmindful of how hard she pressed every inch of her body into mine. 
 
 Nothing. No one. 
 
 The bath tub was full of water. Did I save that, or did Odette? I have n't taken a long bath in a while, instead preferring to shower. Something about a bathtub full of water, something about pools, made me anxious now. Funny, because before Odette disappeared, I was never afraid of them. 
 
 The day of her disappearance was blurred from my memory. Was it so uneventful? I usually kept a detailed journal so I could keep track of exactly what I said to who, but I lost my journal too. 
 
 Come to think of it, I lost it around the time Odette left. Did she take it? 
 
 *'' They found a body, or what is left of one anyway, by the river. It's fallen apart, you know, so they think it's been a while since it was dumped there. `` * 
 
 *'' What makes you think it was dumped in the river? `` * 
 
 *'' That's dumb, Micah. Who the fuck would jump into that river? Even a kid would know better - not that they found a kid. They think it was a teenage girl. `` * 
 
 *Odette? `` Have they moved the body yet? `` * 
 
 The river was in the woods behind the park. Parents have been lobbying for increased patrol in the area, but there was never enough money in the budget for it. 
 
 People had seen Odette sneak into the forest ( or so they tell me - or did I tell them? Fuck. ) I hoped in my heart she was n't... 
 
 I found my journal, maroon, lying under a blanket of yellowed leaves and dirt. At least now I would know what I was doing the day she disappeared. It was getting late, so I had to wait until I got home to read it. For now, it would n't hurt to check the river. Odette liked sitting by the river and making vaguely suicidal threats to jump in. We used to stay here all the time. 
 
 Maybe she'd ambush me as I approached the river. 
 
 *'' Hey Micah, do you think I'd make it if I jumped into this river? That'd be some kinda rush, huh, jumping in here and making it out alive? `` * 
 
 My knees felt weak when I heard the river gurgling in the distance. Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out. It was okay Micah. It was okay. What the hell was wrong with me? 
 
 *'' Micah, you told me you'd make sure I always turned out okay, right?'' She smiled at me, a big grin, showing me all her white teeth. She blew me a kiss. `` Come on, I wan na try something. `` * 
 
 *'' Detta, what are you - Are you thinking of -? Jesus Christ-'' * 
 
 *She ran, and oh how she could run, with her skinny boyish frame and sinewy limbs. * 
 
 I promised her we'd always stay together. I promised her we'd be okay as long as we had each other. She did n't have me, not now. She was n't okay, not now. Maybe that was why they all saw her around town. 
 
 She could n't be at peace, not until I was with her.
