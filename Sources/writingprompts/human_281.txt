Inspired by another story here 
 Teddy was a gentle soul, the kind of person that would n't harm a fly. 
 Teddy worked in IT and sat his desk from 9-5 Monday to Friday. He liked his job, the pay was good, his coworkers were nice, everything was perfect... except his boss. His boss was a manipulative uncaring monster who would degrade and disrespect him for every tiny mistake. But Teddy recently became a father, he had to support his wife and his new son. So he clocked in and clocked out, avoiding his boss as much as possible. 
 One day, his boss took it too far and publicly berated him in front of all his coworkers. Teddy was angry and left work early without telling his boss. The next day he came in early and waited, he was n't gon na hurt his boss, just yell at him. But his head was buzzing with rage, when his boss arrived the verbal battle began. Teddy was getting angrier and angrier his head was buzzing with rage. The buzzing would n't stop and he reached out and grabbed something off the wall. He smashed it down with all his might. Killing the buzzing fly. 
 See teddy was a good and gentle man, but a brutal fly murderer
