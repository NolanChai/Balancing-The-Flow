I'm gon na change the rules a little bit so the procedure was permanent.

 Oh I was fourteen. Yeah, it was at a bad time for me. For Mike especially, he was just seven then. 
 
 You know, I dreamt of being a doctor then. I'd have a beautiful, cozy apartment in Manhattan, I'd vacation out in the Hamptons, and my husband would play the cello, write short stories, and play tennis. We'd run together, and he'd love science fiction movies and we'll watch them all night, and the kids should be sleeping, but they'll sneak downstairs and watch it anyway. Haha, that was the dream. 
 
 I went to college at seventeen. I had n't heard from my dad after that. When Mike got sick, you know, I had to drop out. Who else was gon na take care of him. 
 
 So you know, after he passed, I went off and fought in Venezuela. I just did n't what else to do, what was worth doing. 
 
 I mean, there are worse things to lose than your leg. It's just, I do n't know people treat you differently. I guess that's why I'm here today. I just want someone who'll treat me like everyone else. You know, it's just a leg. 
 
 **Joel** 
 
 Oh, I wanted to be a doctor. Absolutely. But that was never going to happen. 
 
 I played some tennis. Coached a little it too. I joined the String Quartet up at at Potsdam, but that did n't work out. 
 
 I ran for a little bit, I was actually running when he hit me. Yeah, training for the Triathlon. I guess I did n't really have a shot. 
 
 I'm just tired you know. Sometimes you just give up, and surrender to nature. What's her name again? Julia?
