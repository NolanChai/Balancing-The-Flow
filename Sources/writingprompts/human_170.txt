The time had come. It all lead to this. Jim knew what he had to do. 
 
 When he got this job, he had no idea it would fulfill his lifelong fantasies. He did n't even know the real name of the company he was working for at first. 
 
 Jim's commitment to living off the grid made him an unlikely candidate for contact from Google; an unlikely candidate for an invitation to be a CEO at that company. That is, unless you understood the purpose. 
 
 Larry was dead. Serge was dead. But their plans would go through anyway. They had made sure of this. In a little cabin in the woods with no electricity, no running water. Jim came inside after taking his morning constitutional in the frozen cold of an outdoor compost pile filled with human waste, egg-shells, and moldy humus. 
 
 There was one wire running to the cabin, but no lights, no phone, no toasters. jim was feeling good after splitting enough wood the night before to keep his wood-stove burning hotly every night for the rest of winter. 
 
 They hated technology. They hated everything about it. They could see where things were going, and it had to be stopped. Electronic Medical Records would eventually become legislated requirements, and of course they would be obtainable by the government; authority structures; hell, even large corporations and organized crime syndicates. Larry knew this. He was a revolutionary, a genius. So did Serge. They both saw it coming like Christmas, and it had to be stopped. But how. Too many stages remained before anyone would notice the negative effects. Like a creeping disease, once it was accomplished it would be too late. 
 
 Larry and Serge decided to take on this evil; to take on Bill Gates and SONY, and all of it. But how? 
 
 There was too much left to do. Our sins were not yet complete. How to fight the disease before anyone knew it even was a disease. Before we all gave up the right to have private thoughts and secret associations. Freedom depended on fighting this battle, on making sure history did n't unfold that way, but how? Even the human spirit seemed at stake. 
 
 Be the best at it, Serge said one day. Larry listened up. What did you say? 
 
 We'll be the best at it. They were both geniuses. Larry understood right away. Within a week they were at work. 
 
 Algorithms; They both knew that was the key. Algorithms. We'll hold the largest market share in all this wickedness, and when we are too big a part of it, we'll use our power against the system. 
 
 That was the plan. It worked better than they ever thought it would. 
 
 `` If we just get, say, a 20 % share in the market of all this technology, we can infiltrate the rest, and `` blow it all up.'' Larry knew what Serge was after... but neither thought that it would work out so well. 
 
 They had fail-safes. They never talked about there plans to anyone, but the powers that were trying to be would rightly be suspicious of their abilities. The more power the more insecurity, they both knew this from reading Plato. So they set about making backup plans. And Jim was one of them. 
 
 He never met them. either of them. He did n't get the news that they were dead. Knew nothing of the conspiracy theories, or the drama, or any of it. Jim lived alone. Unplugged. And soon, all the rest of the world would be unplugged as well. 
 
 Google owned over 90 % of what mattered. Much higher than the 20 % they originally aimed for. Their work would be far easier than they thought it would be. They had more than infiltrated everything. They were going to reset humanity to a time where people had to read, where questions were important, where man could breath, and think, and conquer. 
 
 It was just another normal day for Jim. He flipped the switch, as he knew he was going to for the last week. The world went dark. It was over. A new chapter in human history had begun. tearing out chapter 5, we were to reread chapters 2 and 3 with our new-found understanding. Nothing would ever be the same again.
