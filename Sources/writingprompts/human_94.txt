It was terrible. Armed with only poutine, niceness, and Tim Horton's coffee, Canada had converted most of the US to Canada. The Midwest was the first to go. It was tired of the other regions calling it `` flyover country'', and peacefully seceded to join Canada. Alaska, followed, by the West coast, then Montana. Eventually, only the South was left except for Texas and Hawai'i, who took advantage of this opportunity and became independent. Finally, It was only Old hill, Mississippi. Even the most rednecky parts of the country had shifted to a healthy, tolerating Canadian lifestyle. Excpet for Old Hill, the fattest, incesctous, stupidest, and hatred-fueled town in the whole Us. Population:29. Armed with rotten teeth and old shotguns, the Old Hill 2nd Amendment brothers charged, only to smell a primal, tasty smell. There was a large barrel full of syrup and whisky. They drank from it. The leader, Jebediah Ezekiel Bubbah Buttah, said, `` THis'ere is fine good fine!'' THe Canadian who made it smiled and said, `` Want some more?'' 
 And that's how Canada is now most of North America.
