I have always thought that life, and humanity in particular, has been about divisions. You divide yourselves constantly, not only in a metaphorical but also a very literal sense. Your cells divide as often as your thoughts, rejuvenating your world with new ideas and forms. And at the heart of all these divides lies the greatest divide. That between you and I. Life, and Death. One coin, two sides, as you say. 
 
 The one thing I've liked about your species in particular is that no matter how much your divisions change you, you somehow always try to come together. You would protect each other, seek one another even after death. Sometimes, I think that's how I came to be. You kept asking about your friends and relatives; someone had to keep track of it all. You even gather together to die in large masses, in strange rituals I can not comprehend. It is enough to make me wonder if you are not as fascinated by me as I am by you. 
 
 But that was in the past, our youth. We've grown more distant, you and I. You've grown at an incredible pace, doubling, then tripling your lives. Your knowledge has expanded rapidly, the things I have learned from you! A glimpse into the wonder of your world, and I understand now why you try so hard to remain, and I can not begrudge you for it. As my conversations became more interesting, they grew farther apart, until, finally, the last. I know he was the last, because he told me so. We had a good conversation, he and I. You had finally done it. Found a way to defeat your old nemesis, Death. 
 
 No, I was n't surprised. You forget; I have been with you your whole lives. I have grown along with you, and I always knew this moment would come. You have divided the most ancient of forces. Life and Death, no longer. Two sides of the coin, split. Life, and life. Death... and Death. In a way, I find it comforting. Always, I have felt apart from you, never able to take that final journey. I suppose it was here, waiting for me, all along. Now I understand why you were always so surprised. 
 
 As I am faced with my fate, I find myself most concerned with yours. I do not know what goes beyond death, just as you do not know beyond life. I hope we will not meet again, for it will mean something has gone wrong for you. Perhaps we will all meet again at last at whatever final fate awaits the universe. For now, all I wanted to say was, thank you. It has been an interesting journey.
