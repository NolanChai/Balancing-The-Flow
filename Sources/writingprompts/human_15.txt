The bullet had gone through his lungs and it hurt to breathe. The hot blood pooling on the stretcher swished up his lower back as he was set on the operating table in a room many miles from the frontline. The fluorescent bulb in its wire cage rattled with the explosion of an artillery shell and more terror filled the dying man as he looked up at the surgeon, and his assistant who placed a mask over his mouth and nose and though it caused his chest to burn with the fire of an erupting star he inhaled. The concrete in between the green tiles on the walls began to move, the smell of his own self oozing from the bullet hole vanished, the sound of the doctor and of his assistant fell away like the war. He could see the surgeons face, his eye fixed in a gaze of unshakable concentration, sticking the man with metal instruments as he craned his head to watch, seeing the assistant scurry into the darkness and returning with new instruments. That was when a door bust open. The surgeon did n't budge, but the soldier yelled something and through the window in the hallway the man saw a great fire. The assistant was unsure, the soldier beckoned to the surgeon but he did n't move. The man looked up and saw the surgeon smile at him. 
 
 “ Everything is going to be alright. ” 
 
 The assistant fled. The soldier had left the door open and the flames danced with the shadows and the surgeon became a giant, fighting death which the man felt slowly occupy his very being, driving out his soul in a final offensive. He was crying, and the surgeon was crying, and death was laughing, and the universe which had become the mans world played before him. The surgeon was pleading with the man, to help him fight death, but the man had not the strength, and the wound had been to great.
