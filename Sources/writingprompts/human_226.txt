We had been out here for months, but in truth it felt like years. Living close to other people was never something i liked. Here on the mining ship *Stars Bounty* space was limited and privacy was even less so. I was not trained to be a spacer i am a paramedic i trained for four years in the trauma capital of the world. I was not the best student back then but i knew what i was doing, and now here i am in deep space. 
 
 The drive to mine out here was not a new thing but it was not possible until the invention of the RED drive. invented by Ray `` Edge'' Dalton, it was one of those pleasant coincidences that the universe sometimes give us, that the drive emitted a red glow. 
 
 Now I am here treating miners in deep space daily I deal with cuts from tools crushed arms and cold burns. Its easy work not a patch on the stabbings and shootings i dealt with back on Earth. I normally pull my 24hr shift alone in the shuttle but not today. Today is different, sitting opposite me on the medical bunk is my pilot. This is unusual as she is always in the pilots mess hall with the others, now she invades my small island of privacy. 
 
 She is not an unpleasant person to look, very short standing only shoulder high to my 1.56m with a short low maintenance cut to her deep black hair. She is smart you need to be to get a pilots seat out here and i find her conversation pleasantly distracting. Our conversation in uninterrupted by the alert siren, I listen intently as the intercom gives us the details of the call. A miner has been attacked on the moon below, he is in critical condition, a case red or P1 as we call it. 
 
 My pilot jumps to her seat and starts flipping switches and talking to flight control I am strapping into my seat facing the bunk, i have a great view from here i can see the large screen she uses to fly, currently it shows the interior of the hanger but i know as soon as we drop ill see the depths of space. I know all my kit is ready i check it often, we drop. 
 
 Space extends out forever, deep and black with the pinpoints of light that are stars. This is my pre-call ritual i look out at space reminding myself that its beauty is matched by its indifference to us, it really dose not give a fuck. This time however i am distracted by her, this time is different she did n't put her flight helmet on and that short black hair is now floating out like some deep sea plant. I find it strangely attractive, we hit atmosphere. 
 
 Its not breathable but its enough to make this fast drop very bumpy, but soon enough we are down. as i have said she is good and we are only a short walk from the site of the attack. I grab my jump bag and my ECG, habit i guess, and run to the inflatable tent, inside is my patient, i have seen the worst people can do to each other i have seen genitals cut off and gunshots to the face that you can see right through, this is different. 
 
 He is a mess skin all cut up, one leg missing and a huge wound to his face. I put up an IV and attempt to stop the bleeding, allergies medical history past surgeries? all questions i ask his buddies but they just stare at me. His BP is dropping, heart rate slowing. I yell for the stretcher. We load him and move to the shuttle. My pilot has kept it warm she sees him and looks at me, the message plain on her face, He is dead? I shake my head in a brief negative. His BP still dropping i cant stop the bleeding, he needs to get to the ship now but even then i dont know if they can save him. 
 
 He begins to scream about monsters and aliens and......... I sedate him. We arrive at the ship and hand over to the waiting doctors, they ask what happened i cant tell them what I dont know. his buddies follow him to the med bay, i ask if they are ok they all seem to have some swelling on the arm. They dont reply and walk off. Strange 
 
 My first response guys hope you like it
