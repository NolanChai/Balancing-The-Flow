My trip across the country was going rather well, until a few feet slowed me down in Colorado. The mountain passes on either side of town closed for the time being. Meaning the hotels were double booked with tourists, I had the ( un ) fortunate luck to be booked with Mickey and Elmo. Both themselves making their way west. After another fifth, Elmo stumbled from the bathroom. Tossing the bottle in Mickeys direction, who sat smoking his cigarette while he eyed the world outside the window. The mouse turned toward the cotton fluffed ginger, taking a long drag on his smoke, now intently gazing upon the drunkard. `` I swear I'll set you on fire, you worthless bag of flammable fluff,'' Mickey's voice was much deeper off camera... Elmo began pulling the drawers from the cabinets and smashing them to pieces, laughing his high pitched, laugh, the whole time. Mickey shook his head, flicking his cigarette in the dolls direction. `` Elmo says- says, fuck you bitch. Hahaha!'' the red doll said. Now turning his attention to the pillow stuffing. Taking his knife to it as he rolled around in the cotton. Again Mickey rubbed his forehead, popping nor of his pills.
