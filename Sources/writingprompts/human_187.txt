`` He's bitten them. There is nothing we can do, he's going to turn.'' 
 
 `` Shit. I thought I'd thrown out those carrots.'' 
 
 `` Obviously you did n't.'' 
 
 It had been three week since the outbreak first began. It had all happened so quickly. The health conscious were the first to go. It really was irony. After all of these years of zombie movies, comics, and television shows we finally had an outbreak. Funny thing is we were n't being bitten. We were doing the bitting. 
 
 Now my brother Donnie was going to turn. 
 
 He had always loved carrots. He was a little slow and he simply did not understand he was not supposed to eat the carrots. 
 
 I ca n't blame him, it was my job to watch him. He was just hungry. 
 
 I bit into a chocolate bar and tried to clear my head. This was n't my first loss. 
 
 My girlfriend was gone. My freaking hot, health conscious girlfriend. She had turned early. 
 
 She was now a salad. 
 
 A green leafy salad. 
 
 Over the past three weeks anyone that had bitten a vegetable had become a salad. It was some sort of virus. The best we could figure was that the virus fed off of sugars In the body through some kind of parasitic photosynthesis. 
 
 Damn this was bad. Donnie's face had already sprouted leaves. He was turning and fast. 
 
 `` It wo n't be long now.'' Said my buddy Dave. 
 
 It was n't. Within three minutes Donnie was gone. A pile of fresh garden salad lay where he once stood. 
 
 `` You got ta do it.'' Said Dave. 
 
 `` I know. Just give me a minute.'' I looked at the pile of salad as a tear rolled down my cheek. `` I'll miss you Donnie'' I said, as I swept him into a dust pan. 
 
 I pushed the salad into the garbage disposal. After turning on the water I flipped the switch. 
 
 Whrrrrrrrrr....and Donnie was gone. 
 
 `` Alright I'm heading to bed.'' Said Dave. `` You sure we do n't have anymore vegetables in this house?'' 
 
 `` Yes.'' 
 
 Dave headed off to bed. 
 
 I opened the fridge. Deep in the back was a container labeled `` butter.'' I opened it. My fears were realized. There was a carrot missing. Other than that the salad was intact. 
 
 Even as a salad she was beautiful. `` How the hell is that even possible?'' I thought. 
 
 `` Do n't worry Samantha we'll find a cure.'' 
 
 `` We'll find a cure.'' 
 
 I sealed the lid and closed the door.
