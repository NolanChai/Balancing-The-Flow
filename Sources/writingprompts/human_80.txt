Sammy, 
 
 I know that I've been away from home for a long time now, and I'm sorry. My, you must be big now! You were just starting to crawl when I went away. I'm writing this letter so that you'll remember who I am once we are re-united. You make sure that your mom has a picture of me right over your bed so that you see me every night before bed time. 
 
 I'm deployed here in France, fighting against those Germans. They're bad men, Sammy, and you should know that your old Dad is doing important work over here. They're sending us up to liberate the Dutch next. Probably should n't be telling you that in a letter, but the battle will be over by the time I send this. I'll make sure to get you some tulip bulbs and a Luger as a souvenir. They'll never know what hit'em. 
 
 The morale here is pretty low, as are the supplies. Having plenty of good food is one of the things I miss most about home. And having a nice warm bed. We are all very miserable in the cold, wet weather of Northern France. It is also very hard to have the threat of attack hanging over our heads at every moment, knowing that the Panzers would overrun our defenses in a moment. I only wish I could come back home to America to be with you and forget all of this senseless violence. We really have no reason to be in this war at all; it seems that we are simply the lapdogs of the French and the British. Our real war is with the Japanese; they are the ones who attacked the United States. 
 
 Frankly, I think we should be *allied* with the Third Reich. It is really the Communist threat that we should fear. I only wish that we could somehow make our leaders see this. Son, you must certainly tell your mother all of these things and ensure that she talks to her neighbors and friends and family. We must all contact our politicians and tell them that this misguided war must end as soon as possible! 
 
 I hope to see you soon, son. 
 
 Signed, 
 
 Your Father.
