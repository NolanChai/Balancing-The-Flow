June 1998. 
 
 I'm sitting in the bed, with her at my side, eating popcorn in bed while watching The Empire Strikes back. But, really, in June, we were watching Return of The Jedi. I just wrote it down wrong. 
 
 It was 1999 when I died. And I found myself back... here. 
 
 And now here I am. 
 
 She is supper nice, just the way I described her, but not the way I truly remember her. She is hyperactive, never subdued. She never argues with me, like all those times I did n't write about. Her hair is jet black, not the musty of before. I guess maybe I was worried about her finding the diary. She was always describing herself as jet black online. 
 
 I'd already checked the DVD case. It is full of the Disney movies that I wrote about, and not the works of David Lynch that she had really liked. 
 
 I curl up into her arms, crying. She does n't know what's wrong, she's kind unlike the aggressive of before. She's understanding, even though she does n't know why. 
 
 Maybe she wo n't kill me this time.
