Trey sat before a grizzled old demon, quite literally twiddling his thumbs in an effort to stave off his boredom. The room he was in happened to be a boring shade of red, the chair he sat upon was only just slightly uncomfortable, and a rather unpleasant odor drifted about the room. 
 
 *This must be what Hell is like*, the man thought. He saw no mass beheadings, pitchforks, or pits of boiling lava and tormented souls. Only discomfort, boredom, and a smell that was reminiscent of a dentist's waiting room. 
 
 `` Ah, here it is,'' the demon said. An older-looking thing, she had green skin and looked vaguely like a goblin. `` Let me just see here...'' 
 
 `` To be honest, I'm not really sure why I'm here,'' Trey suddenly said, `` I felt like I had a pretty good life. I was n't really mean to people, so-'' 
 
 `` Great blue *flames of hell*,'' the demon muttered, going wide-eyed and slack-jawed as she stared at the computer before her. It, too, was an archaic piece of technology, the monitor having a large appendage on its rear, and the drives within whirring noisily. `` You must be one of the worst sinners of all time. Just *how* did you do this, human?'' She shook her head, reaching to pick up a desk phone, which she tapped a few numbers on before holding it to her ear. `` No, not *human*. *Lord*.'' 
 
 `` Lord? What?'' Trey asked, `` Are you sure there was n't some sort of mix-up? I really do n't recall ever-'' 
 
 The demon put a finger to her lips, uttering a harsh'*shhhhh*'. She swiveled her chair away from him, and whispered into the phone's mouthpiece in an almost conspiratorial way. Not long after that did the door burst open, as two burly demons entered the room. Trey was unceremoniously dragged away, after that, despite his claims of innocence. 
 
 A short while later, Trey abruptly landed before a massive throne, ringed by nearly-nude seductresses, flames, and obsidian. Upon the throne sat a grand and proud-looking male specimen, with two large horns upon his ashen-skinned forehead. 
 
 `` Damn, guys, do n't just throw him to the ground,'' the demon shouted, standing up from the throne. He made his way down the steps, hauled Trey to his feet, and dusted the man off. `` You're among nobility, here. From what I was told, this guy's a bona-fide sociopath.'' 
 
 `` Wh-What? No, now I'm really confused,'' Trey said, taking a step back in some attempt to put distance between himself and the overbearing demon. `` I stole once, sure, but that was when I was a kid. I seriously did n't ever do anything bad- not on *purpose*...'' 
 
 `` That's just it, Trey. Not on **purpose**,'' the demon said. He offered his hand forward. `` I'm Satan. We're gon na get to know each other pretty well in the coming eternity.'' 
 
 Trey's skin went pale. What could he have done, to deserve this fate? To shake hands with the devil, of all beings. Resigning himself, he slowly reached forward and took Satan's hand. `` S-Sure...'' 
 
 `` So, man, you got ta tell me what your secret was,'' Satan said. He stepped around to Trey's side, to put an arm over the man's shoulders in an oddly brotherly way. `` Not many guys like you in *history*, let alone the past thousand years.'' 
 
 `` I do n't even know why I'm here,'' Trey admitted. Still, he was clueless. He lived his life in a pure way, did well in school, got a well-paying job, a beautiful wife whom he cherished... 
 
 `` They did n't tell you?'' Satan asked. `` The fuck do I employ'em for... Anyway, it was about your wife. You treated her like *garbage*, man.'' 
 
 `` What? No, I did not,'' Trey said. His face went pale once more. `` I treated her like a goddess. We were married for over sixty years. She-'' 
 
 `` You hid all sorts of stuff from her, though,'' said Satan, shrugging with one arm. `` Teabags, and cutlery... you left the toilet seat up, and put shit on the floor. Really, man, you're almost as evil as I am. And I'm *Satan*!'' 
 
 It was around that time that it finally dawned upon Trey. `` Oh, Lord...'' he cursed under his breath. 
 
 `` My wife was blind.''
