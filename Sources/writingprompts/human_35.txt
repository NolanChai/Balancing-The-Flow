Most of the instruments stopped working hours ago. I never thought I ’ d see a mercury thermometer explode. It just went pop, splattering across the heat-shielded window. Maybe I should consider myself lucky enough to have woken up early enough to see that. My one saving grace is the long range communicator was picking up signals, thousands of them. It could see life all across the universe. 
 
 I ripped the headset from its stand and threw it on. “ Mayday, mayday, this is Commander Trite of Project Glacier. The sun is hours away from blowing up the earth and we still have people on it! Please- “ 
 
 A robotic voice interrupted me. “ The number you have reached is unavailable, please ” - 
 
 I tuned into a different signal. “ Mayday, mayday, I ’ m on Earth and we need rescue. ” 
 
 “ The number you have reached ” - 
 
 Next signal. “ Mayday, mayd ” - 
 
 “ The number you ” - 
 
 The communicator could see life, but not the kind I wanted to see. For the past year, I made countless similar calls. I keep getting the same prerecorded message. It ’ s always the same computerized voice that talks to me. Some nights, I would just talk to it, as if it was real. 
 
 From behind me, I hear a dripping sound. I don ’ t remember the last time I heard dripping. It can ’ t be a leak, all our water is dehydrated. But it ’ s not water. It ’ s the roof. The roof is dripping. 
 
 Red hot globs of molten metal drip from the roof. The Earth may only have a few hours left, but the base wouldn ’ t hold that long. If a rescue team was on its way, now would be a good time to make its appearance. 
 
 “ Mayday, mayday, my base is melting! We need immediate evac now! ” 
 
 “ The number you have reached is unavailable, please ” -
