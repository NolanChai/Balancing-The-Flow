Clocks. 
 The ticking. 
 It drones on. 
 The monotony is endless. 
 You hope for a change. 
 Perhaps the next will be different. 
 However, clocks never do such a thing. 
 Clocks are programmed to go against erraticism permanently. 
 Minutes are always to be sixty seconds in length. 
 You will never encounter a minute that is any longer. 
 However, what if clocks were to behave in an inconsistent way. 
 If such a thing were to happen, would the result be chaotic? 
 Could a meticulously crafted piece of machinery go against a function it has adopted? 
 Could the ticking of a clock beat to a different drum than usual? 
 I would like to think that a clock such as this would be simply extraordinary.
