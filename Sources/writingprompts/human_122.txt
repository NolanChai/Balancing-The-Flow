Growing up as the first mortal child in generations should have been difficult, but it was not. I was given the best teachers, the best doctors, the best care any child could have been given. All sponsored by a government who felt the need to treasure and preserve the last mortal there ever would be. They threw parades for me and sponsored philosophers and scientists to discuss the implications of my existence on global television. When I was young, before I knew death, I thought I was the luckiest person alive. I had every object of desire a young person could ever want and every need was cared for before I was aware there was a need. 
 
 
 
 But that was before I saw him. 
 
 
 
 He was like nothing I had ever seen before. Whereas before I had only ever seen the perfect suppleness of young flesh and muscle before me now was an antithesis; a simultaneous tautness and looseness of flesh stapled across a frame vacant of even a flicker of light. He was not like the corpse of an eternally young vessel; preserved for all time, an embodiment of both life and death. What I saw that day was a mockery of both; life prolonged but not preserved, death â€™ s smile visible behind ancient flesh.
