After hours of screaming and writhing on the floor of the Sarasam laboratory, Charles McSorley fell into a deep coma. He began awakening today.

 `` Charlie, can you hear me? Its Laurie, your wife, can you hear me?'' 
 
 His eyes were barely open, but it seemed clear he was regaining consciousness. After several hours he was awake and somewhat lucid, everyone wanted to ask him what happened when he teleported but was afraid to mention the incident. Everyone just talked about how happy they were that he was now awake, safe and sound. 
 
 Everything seemed wrong to Charlie, however. Everyone looked wrong, everyone sounded wrong. When he finally realized he had been in a coma he asked `` How long was I out for?'' 
 
 `` Well, Charlie, its been eight years.'' 
 
 He could n't process it. 
 
 `` I've been in coma for eight years? How is that possible, I look exactly the same.'' 
 
 `` No, Charlie, you were gone for eight years. You came out of the teleporter last week. We do n't know where you have been.'' 
 
 And then, Charlie remembered what he had experienced after the teleporter activated. He was calm at first. 
 
 `` There... there was screaming. And there was everyone that ever lived. Everyone, and every thing. Aliens, demons, angels, anything that has died was there... without bodies...'' 
 
 Charlie went silent. His breathing slowly increased and his gaze turned towards a thousand yard stare. He began mumbling incomprehensible sounds, then began screaming, louder and louder. It seemed like it would never end, then suddenly he screamed `` THEY ARE COMING, THEY ARE COMING NOW! ALL OF THEM, YOU CA N'T STOP THEM!''

 Confusion filled the room. Everyone looked at eachother without daring to say what they wanted to eachother. `` Who is coming?'' everyone said half silently, to themselves. Charlie was now unconscious again. 
 
 Suddenly a gentle sway began in the floor, and the entire building began heaving...
