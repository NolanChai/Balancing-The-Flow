They say that what you think about in your last moment is the most important thing in your life. I hope that ’ s not true because as I lay here dying, my insides intermingled with the machinery that has kept me alive for weeks, I ’ m not thinking about my kids, my ex-wife, or my legacy but only about her. Even though it was years and years ago, I can still conjure up a crystal clear image of her face but slowly it begins to slip away. Her features began to dim and seem to melt into one senseless blob and then I blink and she ’ s no longer there. 
 
 I blink again. 
 
 My hospital bed is gone and I can only see blank whiteness stretching as far as I can see. I wondered if this was heaven, hell or something in between. Then, emerging from the whiteness, I see a man walking towards me. He ’ s dressed in a crisp black suit with slicked back hair the way I used to wear it back in the day... 
 
 It takes a few minutes for the realization to sink in that I ’ m walking towards myself. Whatever that means. It feels almost as if your mirror image was suddenly no longer bound by certain physical laws of his dimension but just started to get up and walk straight out of the mirror and towards you. 
 
 I approach him warily and hear myself speak. 
 
 “ Well, it doesn ’ t seem appropriate to ask'who are you?' so I ’ ll start with'what are you?' “ 
 
 “ I ’ m what would have happened if you stayed with her. ” 
 
 “ And…what is that supposed to be? ” 
 
 “ Happy. ” 
 
 ~~~~I actually wrote a lot more but decided just to post this intro just to gauge interest and/or see if anyone cares and/or so I do n't feel like a loser writing a huge post no one cares about: (
