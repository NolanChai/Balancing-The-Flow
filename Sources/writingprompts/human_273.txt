Mama always said I ’ d be a good child, that I ’ d go on to do good things in my life. I suppose I just didn ’ t know that she meant something like this. I don ’ t think she did too. Took me forever and two suicide attempts to figure out what was going on. 
 
 * ‘ You suck. ’ * I pull in a sharp breath, burying my face further into my scarf, trying to focus on the fleeing happy thoughts. Jojo called it some kinda ‘ negativity magnet ’ that I had going on. I go home at night from walking the city just to cry into his arms. At least his thoughts aren ’ t as negative as they used to be. 
 
 Jojo ’ s my handler. He stays home and does research for the gov ’ ment about what I do. The happiness rates in the city are higher than they ’ ve ever been. He says I ’ m doing good work. Sometimes I have to fight to see it. He ’ s already caught me popping too many pills more than once. He was upset about that, blamed himself. And of course I knew all about it. 
 
 * ‘ You can ’ t even take care of your child right, what kind of mother are you? ’ * It had been a thought like that which told me that they weren ’ t my thoughts. I don ’ t have any children. My eyes scan the crowd but without a child hanging around a woman, there was no way to tell which woman the thought had come from. It doesn ’ t matter though. Her thought is gone, snatched into the ‘ magnet ’ that is me. 
 
 I basically suck up the negativity. Like a magnet. I pull the thoughts with a simple walk through the city and everyone ’ s happier. I suffer under the weight of all those thoughts though. Every single one hits me like someone spitting in my face. They hurt, I cry, and I get up and do it again. Cos it ’ s all for the better good, right? 
 
 * ‘ You don ’ t deserve to live. ’ * I stop, looking for the person. Looking hard. I need to stay close. Just close for a little while. * ‘ Go jump you fucking son of a bitch. ’ * I shiver, biting at my tongue and trying hard not to let my eyes tear up. I ’ d never see them leave if I started crying. * ‘ Jump… jump… ’ * The thoughts fade away slowly, falling to a distant whisper before they ’ re gone. A man standing outside the McDonalds looks up at the sky and I see a familiar expression on his face. The words echo still in my mind however but I bury my face again and continue walking. 
 
 Better good? No. I don ’ t want anyone else to suffer like me. I know what they ’ re going through because I go through the merits of killing myself on a daily basis. I also go through all the reasons why I shouldn ’ t. Some days it ’ s tough not to off myself. Some days, I don ’ t want to get out of bed and face the world. 
 
 * ‘ You ’ re a monster. ’ * I continue walking, face buried in my scarf and ears stinging with the promise of tears. I know that what I ’ m doing is good though. I save lives. Not as many as I ’ d like but I save lives. Jojo ’ s looking to see if there ’ s more like me, so that maybe, just maybe, my burden can be lifted. So I don ’ t have to walk out here every day. Because he and I both know that eventually I ’ m going to break and he won ’ t be able to put me back together.
