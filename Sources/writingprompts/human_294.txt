We must break down the fourth wall 
 
 But to break it, we must use both brain and brawl 
 
 It lies inside a cave, whose enterance is small 
 
 And it can be approarched only in nightfall 
 
 Ignore the beautiful woman, listen not to her catcall 
 
 And once inside, you will find a cannonball 
 
 But to put it inside the cannon, you must prove yourself above all 
 
 There lies a question on the cannon, the answer out loud you must call 
 
 And afterwards, no longer must you forestall 
 
 For now you are almost done with the official protocol, 
 
 Head towards the marking which appear on the southwall 
 
 Touch them and duck, for now it is over, overall 
 
 The cannon will shoot, and now the wall shall fall 
 
 And behind it will lie a huge-ass shopping mall
