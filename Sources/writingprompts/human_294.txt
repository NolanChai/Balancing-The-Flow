You look around, trying to focus on the sea of people around you. What happened last night? You try to remember but the last thing you remember is going to the party. What happened? 
 
 Without warning, you spit a pool of blood onto the floor. You reach a finger into your mouth and realise that your tongue has been cut out. The pain starts rising and you try to cry out `` help!'' at the same time that you realise you are unable to speak. The hundreds of other people all around you start moaning and screaming in the same way, blood oozing from their mouths. A young woman grabs your leg, her eyes pleading for help. You shake her off with a shudder. 
 
 The moaning starts getting louder, and you notice that people are starting to fall down, back down into the ground. Blood is everywhere now. You can smell the metal in the air. More people fall. You keep watching, unanle to look away, not knowing what will follow until every single person has fallen to the ground, leaving only you standing. Then you hear the voice again. 
 
 `` YOU''
