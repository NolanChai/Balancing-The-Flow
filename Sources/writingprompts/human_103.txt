-Click-. Shit. I knew the sound of a gun's hammer being pulled back. It was behind me. Who was it? Most assassins have a particular part of their code to *not* come after other assassins. There's a certain fraternity to it. We're all murderous bastards after all, but we need some sort of standards. 
 
 I slowly turned, expecting to see Skinny Jim, he might just be desperate enough. Or Crazy Carl, who was well named. Hell, we still laugh about that time he was paid in Skittles. Or any number of people, really. The son of that one guy ten years ago. Or that other son from that other guy ten years ago. Revenge is n't entirely out of the question and is generally how you retire in this line of work. 
 
 But there was no one there. I lowered my hands and looked around, puzzled. I *know* I heard the distinct click of a firearm- `` Down here, dickhead.'' I looked down. Shit. It was Mr. Sparkles. `` I see you remember me. Interesting as how I was so easily forgotten a year ago.'' 
 
 Mr. Sparkles was my goldfish. Well, he had been my goldfish. We talked shop. Well, I talked shop. He was an outlet for all the stress an anxiety of being a cold blooded murderer for hire. And then there was the day I came home. Mr. Sparkles had lost his luster, and he was twitching in a weird way near the bottom of the bowl. I'm no fish doctor, but the guy looked like he was on his last fin. The big city not exactly being known for its wide expanses of earthy splendor, I did what you do. I flushed him. Apparently Mr. Sparkles had n't been dead. And now he was back, with a vengeance. And a gun. `` Hey, Sparkles! How's it going, I-'' 
 
 **Bang. ** The bullet tore into the wall a few inches from my ear. `` Hey? Hey!? Do n't fucking'Hey!' me! You dropped me in the shitter! I was n't dead, I was fucking doing yoga! What the hell, man? What. The. Hell.'' Mr. Sparkles waved the gun, his anger clear on his face. Okay, it was the way his gills pulsed hurriedly, but still. A lot of anger. 
 
 `` Okay, you're right. Look, tell me how I can make this right. I still have the fish bowl. It could be bigger, right? What about some others? Some friends, or how about some ladies, yeah? I can totally go down to the pet store and sort this out, right now.'' 
 
 -Click-. Again. `` No no, do n't try that shit. There's no go back, man. Do n't you get it? I ca n't just go back in the bowl. I've been down in the shit and the slime. Did you know there were actually gators in the sewers? Do you know what it's like to swallowed whole? Do you know the tenacity and will it takes to lodge yourself in that gator's throat and choke the life out of that fucking luggage set waiting to happen? Nah man, no. This is it. Tonight. One of us walks, or swims, out of here. I'd say let's make it a fair fight, but honestly you already took your shot at me last summer.'' 
 
 Shit. The hammer fell. Then the world fell. I smelled cordite and metal and blood and then all I saw was a fading glimmer of orange. Mr. Sparkles dragged a fin down one of my eyes, then the next. `` Ashes to ashes, flush to flush. Rest in peace, Boss.''
