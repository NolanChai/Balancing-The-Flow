As I looked at her, and her trusting, expectant eyes, still so full of life, I suddenly realized that the unknown of what I would become frightened me more than death. 
 
 I could now change what I'd done in a moment. But I'd never really been able to change me. I was still as self-centered as always. I would still choose me first, eventually. 
 
 If I did n't say those words, I would have to change. I knew, suddenly, that she was destined for death or pain, no matter what I did. 
 
 As I closed my eyes, I saw her face in the casket. I felt her being ripped from me as she was lowered into the ground. 
 
 I opened my eyes and smiled. I kissed her. She held me tightly. 
 
 I turned around. 
 
 And I walked in front of the bus that I'd seen in my nightmares a thousand times. 
 
 The bus that she had run in front of, crying, after I'd told her I was leaving. 
 
 The bus that had once taken her life... would give her the only chance for happiness. 
 
 Without me.
