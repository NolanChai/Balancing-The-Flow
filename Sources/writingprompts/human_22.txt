 
 I quickly awoke as I heard my phone alarm vibrating anxiously. Every morning brought the same panic for me as it did for the other 63 million people waiting to see how the distribution would be done today. 
 
 I was used to the typical $ 5, some days $ 10 if something special was coming... or even someone. Worst case scenario was $ 0, a once a month occurrence at this point in my life. I was quite lucky seeing as there was only so much to be spread around. 
 
 Today was different. 
 
 Seven zeroes, lead up by a seven. It made no sense to me. I had just received $ 70,000,000 and 24 hours before it was back to zero. 
 
 This was it. The entire pool of money. And it was in my account. Was it a mistake? My heart began to beat extremely fast as I ran through all the scenarios in my head. 
 
 Do I call them? Say it's a mistake. Do I take my card and run? Surely that would be no good. They'd find me. 
 
 I've heard of these huge lump sum payments in the past. But as with most, there was a fatal mistake made by the end of the day. 
 
 I decided I would be different. I locked all my doors and began planning. Pension plans, retirement accounts, IRAs, 401ks, houses for my parents, until every dollar was accounted for. 
 
 I called my mom. There was no answer so I eagerly left a voicemail. 
 
 `` Mom. I need to tell you something. When I went to my ATM this morning, I was dispensed.. well let's just say it was enough money to get us out of here for good. I'll be over as quickly as I can. Start packing. We need to go.'' 
 
 I had a plan. Soldman Gachs was the place to go with an income like this. I'd play it off as it was accumulated wealth and they'd be sure to be none the wiser, as long as I was willing to relinquish a quarterly 3 % fee. 
 
 I quickly packed up the essentials and was off to my mother's home, thirty minutes away. 
 
 
 I got to my mom's door and began to fantasize. 
 
 I had been waiting for this moment my entire life. To tell my mother our troubles were over. We would now live a life not determined by the money in our accounts, but the character in our hearts. 
 
 My father had died from the immense pressure and stress surrounding his account. He was always falling short amongst his own expectations and feared. He killed himself, as did so many others, to try and stabilize matters for his own family, leaving behind his estimated remaining worth, $ 2,487. 
 
 Unfortunately he did not succeed. But I did and I was ready to end all the sorrow. 
 
 
 I took out my keys, unlocked my family home and skipped inside. 
 
 My heart stopped, I stopped. 
 
 My mother lay there, in a pool of blood beside her ATM. I ran up to her and craddled her broken body. I loudly weeped. 
 
 I was not soon enough. I knew I should of never left her once my father died. I had failed as a son and there was nothing the money could do now to fill this void. 
 
 I looked up at her blinking ATM screen. 
 `` Please take your receipt'' it read. 
 
 I grabbed the receipt. $ 0 ( 1,677 entries ) 
 
 `` Thank you for your entries into this month's lump sum drawing. Please stand in front of your ATM and if your child is chosen as our lump sum winner, you will be immediately executed by a bullet to the brain. Thanks and have a great day!''
