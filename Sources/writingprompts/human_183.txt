When the Outsiders came, I was already knee deep in the blood of my brethren. I would have killed them all too, for what they had done, but they had better guns than my army did. And I did n't win a Civil War just to die in the hands of strangers. 
 
 They detained me immediately. They had questioned about what had happened inside the `` Reserve,'' as they called it. To me, it was home. And I did what I had to do to survive. To see my people flourish. 
 
 Of course, I had told them that. But they did n't care. They wanted more. It was odd they were asking me so many questions about how the war broke out, since they were `` monitoring'' us throughout the whole bloody process. 
 
 But I told them anyway. I told them all the stories of everyone I had killed. Of how I had gathered my armies to rise against the Factions. Of how I had immolated each Faction leader personally, and made their families watch. 
 
 I regretted none of it. 
 
 The Faction leaders had been depriving the people of resources for years. I was born into starvation. And I finally had enough. 
 
 The Outsiders were scared of me. They did n't expect *this* to happen. They were only `` experimenting'' with apocalyptic conditions. They were only `` preparing.'' 
 
 I laughed at their faces. 
 
 All of the pain I had suffered. All of the loved ones I had lost. All of the times I wanted to put a gun to my head and end it all... they were all an *experiment*. 
 
 I hope they have all their data. I hope they have all the information they need. Because nothing could prepare them for me, for what I had in mind. I would show them what an apocalypse would truly look like.
