Most people don ’ t realize that all the myths and legends are true, or at least they will be. The hall collects the stories of its weapons and scatters them back through time so that everyone knows of their might. 
 
 Some of the weapons united kingdoms, like that shining blade embedded in stone. Others taught a lesson, like that sword on the far wall, still hanging by a single hair. 
 
 That hammer of lightning on a central pedestal won ’ t be used for another ten thousand years. The story of the genetically enhanced super human that will wield it, so far-fetched that we attribute it to an ancient god. 
 
 They all have one thing in common though, stories. Stories both big and small, from whenever in time that they finally see use. All of them except for one. One small orb, black as night and speckled with stardust, has no history. No past, present or future to be told, except for this. 
 
 This one tiny story is all anyone will even know of the small stone that will change the world, and it had chosen me to be its wielder. I will not be a hero, I will not be remembered, but I will save you all.
