*'' It's all hopeless. Why should I stay? No one else was able to. `` * 
 
 He thought to himself as he glared at the dust ridden cement floor. Almost finding himself tracing the small cracks that seemed to make the floor only more real. 
 
 *'' It's different than I thought It would be. While this all seems fairly more familiar and remembering I really do n't want to, I ca n't trace back my steps now. `` * 
 
 The room surrounding the man would make anyone invisible. Is that why the mirror in the corner showed nothing? Maybe the would-be reflection was ashamed of the man, ashamed of the many he had lost. The many things that he had lost for them both. 
 
 *'' Do n't look at me like that. `` * He spoke. The rasp of his voice had sounded cracked, just as the floor. Just as the only part of himself that had ever supported him. While he swayed back and forth, holding on to the last part of the life that was hanging before him, He could n't seem to grasp onto it hard enough to hold on. 
 
 *'' But why do n't I want to? This is what I'm supposed to do. `` * Said the man, shivering from his now-heavy body. The feeling of being light-headed complimented the shivers, and was making it hard to think deeper than he would have hoped to in his final moments. He could see the last quick breath floating from him now. 
 
 *'' It's cold. `` * The thought echoed throughout his mind. *'' That jacket looks warm. `` * Was the second echoed thought that came as he looked into the mirror once more. But with his feeling still escaping him, how was it that he still wanted to feel something to give him warmth? And what he wanted was there right before him. 
 
 *'' But there was nothing in the mirror before just now. It was n't even worth looking at. `` * As the thoughts would blur into nothing soon, he might as well keep thinking. Or maybe it was because he started to want to? He wanted to keep thinking. 
 
 The Jacket was the only object that appeared from the mirror. Though, how could he acquire it? Maybe just one more chance. A chance to get out of this dark room. But the man knew that no one else was ever able to have that chance. Why would he be the only one to make it through? 
 
 As the last swallow developed from the supported area, the man made his seemingly final twitch. The mirror would n't be able to show him the crash that had just been made clear in the frame and reflection of the mirror. The force of the crash shoved the jacket from the mirror. And as it fell, the event that had happened in the reflection of the mirror had been mimicked. 
 
 The ceiling's condition in the room was not all that much different from the floor of the room that the man had been glaring at just moments ago, tracing at the cracks of it. The weight of it all was too much for the part of the ceiling which was supporting him to take, it had crashed down, releasing him from the bind... 
 
 *Jared brushed off his jacket, Shaking, and staring at the scene. He had escaped the fate of his mistake and was given one more chance. However, he would still have to clean up this mess that laid in front of him. And Jared knew it. With another deep breath with many more to come, Jared walked up the stairs and through the open door. * 
 
 The man let out a slight sigh and smirk at his returning ability to think clearly again. And knew, without even looking into the mirror again, that he had been successful after so many mimicked attempts. Jared had finally escaped his fate and would be able to think clearly. Walking through many newly-opened doors.
