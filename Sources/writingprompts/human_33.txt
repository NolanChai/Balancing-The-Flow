There were two lectures I always got from my Dad growing up; one was how to finance a bank loan for a house or a car, but the other was much more ambiguous. One oddly social night, he pulled me outside for a commiserative smoke and told me, `` Nelo... if you ever kill anyone, do n't tell anyone about it, and bury their body in the desert. That's how you get away with murder.'' Oddly enough to this day, all I remember is his equivalent to date somebody who does n't treat you like shit, talk- which apparently went through one ear and out the other, much like his hereditary and the financing talks. My mother was always considered the crazy one among'st our deranged quartet of disfunctionality. I can still remember the day I broke two of my mom'' s ribs in a black-out fear; a feeling I have never felt besides that day. Two fractured ribs, two split lips, and one court ordered restraining order later I was in far deeper than I could have ever thought for a family matter... To bring one's family baggage to court is a sacred taboo, but in a second; a phone call, helpless in my own custody trial at seventeen while a judge surveyed the circumstances and left me to fight somewhere in the middle of it all, there was still no glimmer of hope for me. My boat was sinking in my teens. In the meanwhile waiting on reprisal and confirmation for some'adult' legally defined responsible enough to rescue me of the adoptive catastrophe that surrounded me, any adult legally fit in my adoptive family, to set me free. But with the court system banning my testimony, the ground I found in between was that of quicksand. At my back, was the emotional and egregious acousations of an adoptive mom with boderline personality disorder and an alcohol addiction- my savior... an emotionally distant Dad with a blonde complex. On the last trial of my custody, my Mom told the judge that I was an actor, and that she had, `` taught me to be sad,'' while I cried- asking the judge for some kind of reprieve against the onslaught of my mother. He eventually found that I was defending myself and granted custody to my Dad and step mom; A year away from being a full adult.
