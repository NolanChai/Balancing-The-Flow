`` Hey, kiddo, it's ok, they're yummy anyway'' he reassured her, smiling, tousling her hair. Her, looking up, smiling back. 
 
 The little bits of flour and chocolate dusting the counter, the heat from the oven fogging the kitchen window while the rain fell outside, fall's last gasps clinging to the trees yellow and brown, a scene frozen. 
 
 You reach back and stretch and yearn, and it's so *there*... it's right there... but all the tides in all the seas and echoes of the footsteps and the harmonies ringing in your ears ring hollow. A mosaic of things once real, *still real if only you hold on tight enough*. A picture you beheld now dulled, drifting... parts and pieces now, you try to hold them together, a mantra to chant. But they fade nonetheless.
