`` I've told you before, and ( sigh ) I'll tell you again, this birthmark just LOOKS a bit like a dragon, it's not special, its not magical, it's not some sign that I'm destined to defeat evil or anything at all. And to be honest I'm tired of saying this over and over.'' 
 
 I pulled on my coat, checking my pocket for my keys, security pass for work and my phone. All there. I locked the door and made my way down the driveway to my car and climbed inside. 
 
 `` But If your not special and have no destiny, then whats the point of it all? ``, said my birthmark in a voice like a whiny child ( not for the first nor the last time ). 
 
 I sighed again and pulled the car onto the road and headed to Mcdonalds to start my shift.
