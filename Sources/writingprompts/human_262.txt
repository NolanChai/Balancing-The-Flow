`` Now class. One must realize that the first step to recovery is through recognizing you have a problem. And that is why you are all here today.'' The teacher spoke. 
 
 `` No, it's because of that damn court order,'' Rock murmured. The classroom roared with laughter. 
 
 The teacher, oblivious to the fact that he was being mocked, smiled. `` Well, it's good that you can all laugh and joke around, especially on your first day here!'' 
 
 `` And hopefully the last.'' Scissor snickered. Again, the class found that quite amusing. 
 
 The teacher reluctantly smiled. `` Okay class. I'm going to call attendance. Rick?'' 
 
 `` Here.'' 
 
 `` Jessica?'' 
 
 `` Here.'' 
 
 `` Scissor?'' 
 
 `` I do n't mind doing that with Jessica over there.'' Scissor yelled. 
 
 The teacher cringed. However, everyone began laughing again. However, someone did share his sentiment. 
 
 `` Damn it, Scissor! Why do you always have to inappropriate? Ca n't you just stop for once?'' Paper complained. 
 
 `` Shut up, Paper. Do n't act all saintly just because you're white.'' Rock spat. 
 
 `` Oh is this a race issue now?'' Paper questioned. 
 
 The teacher, sensing something sinister brewing, rushed over to the bickering trio. 
 
 `` Rock! Paper! Scissor! Do n't fight! Do what I do. Stop and take a breath.'' The teacher proceeded to take a huge breath as if to demonstrate, hoping that would distract the trio from fighting. 
 
 It worked. The trio took breaths and stopped fighting. The teacher, pleased, deemed it to be a success. He continued with attendance and proceeded to lecture for the next hour on anger management strategies.

 After class ended, the trio walked over to Mario's Pizza Place. 
 
 `` Man, that class was boring!'' Rock complained. 
 
 `` Agreed,'' Scissor said as they entered the restaurant and proceeded to seat themselves. 
 
 The trio opened up their menus. 
 
 `` So guys, what do you wan na eat?'' Paper asked. 
 
 `` Cheese.'' Rock said. 
 
 `` Veggie.'' Scissor said. 
 
 `` Hmm, but I want pepperoni,'' replied Paper. 
 
 `` And we only have enough money for one box of pizza,'' said Rock. 
 
 `` So how do we decide?'' Scissor asked. 
 
 Silence descended upon the restaurant. 
 
 `` Shit.'' someone murmured. 
 
 The tension was palpable. The trio looked at each other nervously. 
 
 `` Breathe in, breathe out.'' Paper repeated. 
 
 `` Well, it's okay guys. We do n't have to get veggie pizza.'' Scissors laughed nervously. 
 
 `` No, do n't sacrifice your choice! I'll take my choice of cheese out!'' Rock insisted. 
 
 `` No, I'l take pepperoni out, guys!'' Paper said. You could hear a pin drop in the restaurant. 
 
 `` No. I WILL TAKE MY CHOICE OUT.'' Rock said furiously. 
 
 `` Okay, screw you, Rock! I said I'll take my choice out and you had to start something again!'' Scissor screamed. 
 
 `` You wan na go, Scissor!?'' Rock shrieked. `` I'll beat you into the ground like every other time!'' 
 
 Paper's white skin turned red in anger. `` Rock, I swear to God if you do n't cut it out, I will destroy you!'' 
 
 `` Stay out of my business, Paper! I'll cut you!'' Scissor screamed, and he snipped off a corner of Paper's sheet head. 
 
 A collective gasp fell over the restaurant. 
 
 Astonished, Paper looked at Scissor. His mouth began to move. 
 
 `` Okay, let's decide on our choice of pizza.'' Paper sneered. 
 
 `` Through what?'' Rock and Scissor smirked. 
 
'Rock, Paper, Scissor, bitches.''
