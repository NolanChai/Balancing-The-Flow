All things considered, I should have been terrified. Whatever they pumped into the room had the most fortunate side effect of numbing me to the entire process. The event, no idea what the even was by the way, or at least how I experienced it had the texture of a high fever. The kind of fever that destroys your sense of heat, when you're too hot to sweat and your skin is burning so much you think it's covered in ice. 
 
 Delirium. 
 
 
 Cattle prods, cattle prods were definitely used. I'd have never known but the marks on my shoulders serve as a nice enough reminder. I remember them wanting me to move, for who I could never say, but given that I was exhausted, damn near naked and breathing in what I could only assume to be bull tranquiize I could n't be bothered to dance for the unseen. If they wanted to hide behind a thick pane of glass and leave me in a dim lit room looking like a stripper then it would have to work for the show. 
 
 
 Eventually they got what they wanted, at least that what I gathered from the stoppage of shocks, and the lights turned off. The whole time I was on a mobile platform and before I could gather anything about where I was or where I was going I was dumped off into a holding pen. 
 
 
 I notice above my area there are some strange symbols, probably letters or what have you. And as it donned on me that I had just been sold the lights went out and the next moment later I'm missing a leg and there's a suture along my side. It was freezing cold, Damp and I was shivering to high hell. 
 
 
 The clothes I had came in with were no place to be found and while I was holding myself trying to stay warm I noticed a lack of ribs. One, two, three, and no more. Both sides, they'd stolen my bones. They'd stolen portions of my body from all over and the dampness underneath seemed just as well to be coming from the poor job of the stitches that were slowly unraveling on my side. I was leaking out, slowlike, with no warmth and no legs. 
 
 They're eating me and I do n't even get to die before they make a meal out of me.
