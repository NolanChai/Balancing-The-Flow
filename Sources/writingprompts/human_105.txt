Todd awoke from an agitated slumber. He ran his hand over the cold side of the bed and he rolled over onto his back. 
 
 -- *He woke up as any morning from his past, yearning for the past that was* 
 
 `` What the hell was that? Who's there? ``, Todd responded, looking around the room, unsure if he is still dreaming or if someone was in his apartment. 
 
 -- *He felt a surge of panic, worried that someone was watching him* 
 
 `` Hello? Who is that?'' 
 
 -- *He calls out to the void, but there is no one there* 
 
 `` I know you're there. I can hear you!'' 
 
 -- *He beckoned for the intruder to show himself* 
 
 `` Well if you're just going to hide, then I'm coming to find you'' 
 
 -- *Too frightened to deal with the problems at hand, he dove back under the covers and hoped this strange nightmare would soon end* 
 
 `` Is that a threat? Well it wo n't work'', Todd shouts as he reaches for the bat he stores at the side of his bed, `` If you do n't leave right this instant, I'll...'' 
 
 -- *He let out a whimper, he always struggled with stressful situations like this. For a moment he wishes his former lover were present. He imagined how he would handle a stranger intruding in his house. He could feel the pressure under his cheeks as the embarrassment of hiding under the blanket like when he heard the sounds of a house settling alone as a child. * 
 
 `` What's going on...'' Todd murmured to himself as his eyes scanned the room for any movement. 
 
 -- *With a shout and the jerk of his arm, he flung the blanket towards the foot of the bed and leapt to his feet. He reached for a weapon side of the bed, but his shaking hands only grabbed air. Hope fleeted from his body as he recalled Todd was the one who was paranoid enough to store a weapon bedside* 
 
 `` David? ``, Todd grabbed his cell phone from the night stand and began dialing David. 
 
 -- *A loud ring pierces his ears and he lets out another yelp. He lunges for the phone and nearly knocks it to the ground, but manages to grab hold. He barely has time to check that it his former lover calling before he answers and starts babbling into the phone* 
 
 `` Todd! There's someone in my house! Come over, send help, anything, I'm...'', David chokes out the words. 
 
 `` Hearing a voice that's announcing your every move?'' 
 
 `` Yes, someone is my room and watching me and... how did you know?'' 
 
 -- *He can feel the pressure in his throat move up to his eyes as anger and confusion sets in. His stammering begins rising into a firmer tone as he talks into the phone. He begins to piece an idea together. * 
 
 `` How would you know that Todd? Are you in my apartment? I ca n't believe you would do something like this.'' 
 
 Todd interrupts, `` Oh suddenly, this is my fault? You know, this is why I left you in the first place. You never'' 
 
 David starts shouting into the phone, `` You left me? Is that the story you're telling people now'' 
 
 -- *And without giving the strange voice a second thought, he dove right back into his old habit of fighting with former lover about anything he could bring up*
