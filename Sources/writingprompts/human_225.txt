It was stupid, so very stupid. I knew not to pick up hitchhikers, but I did it anyways. Now here I am, a five-foot-five girl, with a creepy six-foot stranger riding in my car. 
 
 He's bulky, with a heavy coat and five o'clock shadow. He's also pointing a gun at me with one hand. That is kind of the thing that makes me an idiot. 
 
 I do n't have anything on hand for self defense. 
 
 Instead I've got one hand on the wheel as I navigate the road, my other hand in his lap giving him... well... this night is n't going to be looked on fondly if I get out alive. 
 
 `` Faster, bitch!'' 
 
 He punctuates with a rough tap of the gunpoint against my temple. I fight back tears of fright. I do n't know whether to speed up the car or my hand, so I do both. 
 
 As he groans and laughs, my mind races to try and figure out a solution to my predicament. That's when I see the guardrail coming up and inspiration hits. 
 
 He's not even watching the road. I swerve to the side, momentarily jarring him back to his senses as I pull my hand back. He starts to cuss my out, but the sudden intrusion of the guardrail through his body and face silence him. 
 
 I do n't remember anything else before the sirens approaching. The airbag busted my nose pretty good. I cry, and I'm a blubbering mess when the police and ambulance arrive. 
 
 I give my statement to the police while being patched up. Broken nose, bruised ribs, a dislocated shoulder. A lot of weight lifted off my shoulders. 
 
 Insurance did n't want to cover my car at first. They claimed I was lying. It took a month for the police to locate his gun and prove my story. 
 
 And now I've invested in pepper spray and a taser.
