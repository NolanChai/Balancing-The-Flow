I should never have downloaded that app. I thought it would make my life easier, ya know? It promised `` Personalized Web Search Results''. Well, it does n't get much more personal than tapping directly into your brain-stem and reading your thoughts. I did n't even know my computer could do that! 
 
 Before I knew it, I started seeing copies of myself on television. First as extras, later as stunt-doubles. By the time I had built up the motivation to call a lawyer, I stopped seeing them. Then, all of the sudden, I was a movie star. Well, not me. It was a copy of me, significantly altered to be more attractive and charismatic. 
 
 I was stunned. I searched all over the internet for videos of this handsome doppelganger. He was just like me, down to the same laugh, childhood stories, and hand gestures. But he delivered lines and jokes with a confidence I could only dream of. 
 
 I did n't leave my house for a week. When I finally did, I found myself subjected to constant stares and gushing from the occasional star-struck townie. They quickly realized I was not the movie-star they had seen, noting my lackluster attire and general lack of social graces. They would yell at me, upset that they had not, in fact, found their new favorite celebrity at a grocery store wearing sweatpants and flip-flops. 
 
 It sucked. Everywhere I went, people were pissed that I was n't the same person they saw on TV and in movies. I had tried to call lawyers. None of them would listen past the word `` clone''. Desperate and out of options, I took matters into my own hands. I dyed my hair, grew out a beard, and wore color contacts. Simply put, I became someone else. 
 
 Identity theft has a new meaning, it seems.
