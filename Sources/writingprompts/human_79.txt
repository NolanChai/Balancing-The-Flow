& nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Hi, my name is Captain Obvious, and you can call me Captain Obvious. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I was born on my birthday out of a woman who was also my mother. I am currently still alive, and I will remain alive until death, and I will die on my last day of being alive. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Rather than let others do it, I chose to write my autobiography myself. My life has consisted of a series of events, some connected some not, some significant others pointless. I have met people, all of whom were human beings, and some of these people were significant to me while others had no impact on my life whatsoever. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I fell in love once to a female girl that I loved. She had hair, and eyes, and an epidermis. The girl also had a vagina. At the time of our first encounter at a place in space, she was alive. She breathed using lungs and pumped blood through her body thanks to a heart. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Our marriage was exactly one year before our first anniversary and one day before our only honeymoon. We had sex, which, as it turns out, is how babies are made. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; When our baby was born ( our son was a boy, btw ), we were happy. As he grew older, he changed from a baby to a toddler to a child to a youth to an adult. Even though half of him is like me, the other half is like his mother. There can only be two halves in a whole, a person might have once said at one time or another. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; He joined the army, which is a branch of the military. One day, overseas across the sea, he once died. His first time dying would also be his last. We buried him in the ground, under some dirt. The death of our son made us feel sad. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; My only wife, who was also the only mother of my only son, stopped speaking to everyone ( and anyone! ). Most mornings she rocked in her rocking chair, this chair made to rock back and forth. Right around sunrise, the sun would rise in the morning. She would watch it with her eyes. She did this for 730 sunrises across two years, and then she died until she was dead. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Now that I am by myself, I am alone. Sometimes I visit her grave, which is located at the bottom of a gravestone in a graveyard. The gravestone has her name on it along with her birthday and the day she died. If you subtract the first year from the second one, you can figure out her age, but only up to a certain date. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; I usually sit in the rocking chair now, but if you find that its empty, that means I am not sitting in it. As long as I am alive, I am not dead, and if I am not dead, I am alive. Life has been good. 
 
 & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Obviously.
