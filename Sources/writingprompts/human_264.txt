`` Ow, my head... what the...'' I got up and looked around, it was a beautifully destructive place. There was no sign of anyone, or anything. Just cracks in a red desert that seemed to go on forever. 
 
 `` Welcome!'' I heard a soothing voice reached over me. As I quickly turned around and saw one of the most brilliantly beautiful ladies I had ever seen in my life. Dressed in a lovely strapless dress. `` This way handsome.'' She called me with her fingers and turned her hips to start walking down a stairway I must have somehow missed on the first pass. 
 
 The stairs went on forever, but the view was worth the follow. I got hotter as we got closer to what seemed to be heading to the center of the earth. `` So you're him, Huh? What a lovely addition...'' her words seemed to flow behind her and ease it way into my ears. 
 
 `` I'm who? And where are we going? Honestly, I need to head home, but you are more than welcome to fol-'' I tried to turn around but the path back seemed to just fall apart behind us. 
 
 `` Oh, do n't worry about that Jordan.'' There was an ominous pause, `` I do n't think you will ever be going back, actually I'm quite sure of it.'' She lead the way onto a path that finally leveled out and lead into a large metal room. 
 
 `` You see, you are dead now. And with your abilities I will find great entertainment from you.'' 
 
 `` Abilities, entertainment, DEAD?! Okay, I need to wake up. I got scrims in the morning and -'' 
 
 `` And like everyone else you will soon realize you are in hell, you have killed MANY MANY people, with your own hand no less. Impressive. Very, VERY impressive, it gets me all....'' she slowly started to hug on me a bit, but something was wrong. I mean this is a metal room, and we went pretty far down but she was....like her body temperature was, scorching. `` HOT''. 
 
 I shoved her burning body off of me. She seemed to catch me on fire. I backed away from her as she stepped closer. I tried to find the door but it seems as if it just disappeared. `` Look um, I do n't know who you are or what you want, but I have n't killed anyone. There has been some sort of mistake.'' 
 
 `` Oh, right, because people are sent to hell because of a life without sin. You are quite easily one of the best murder's we've seen down here in quite a few centuries. And you know what gets me REALLY HOT....'' the room heated up again, this time so much it felt like my eyes were going to burn out of my sockets. 
 `` Death.'' 
 
 `` Look miss, you think I'm some sort of murder, yet I seriously do n't think you know what I do... I mean you ca n't jus-'' 
 
 `` SILENCE! As the God of the Underworld, you will please me. And thank whomever finally slayed you, for they sent a formidable opponent to me this time. You will fight the current reigning Champion of my arena for my pleasure, and if you win... you get to continue. But if you lose, you are sent to the pits of hell below, when the pain will be unimaginable for the rest of eternity.'' 
 
 `` But, that's not even... I'm not who you... I PLAYED GAMES FOR A LIVING!!'' I pleaded. 
 
 `` With your record, merely one person should not be enough. Let's start with 5 and see where that goes.'' And with that she disappeared in a burst of flames. The walls fell and in the sand around arose stone bricks. I began to recogonize this area, it looked like... no, it could n't be. 
 
 Seconds later a weapon fell into my hands. A very familiar weapon, something straight out of CoD. But, I now understood what was going on. And almost instantaneously I felt the pain of a bullet going threw my shoulder. I turned and fired on the run. I knew this map better than anyone. A simple map. A small map. I just hope the nuke at the end was a joke.
