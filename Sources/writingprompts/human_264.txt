I have been here for decades. I have lost track of time at this point. Every night is the same, I wait and wait till some brave soul decides to enter this old mansion and try to make contact with them. 
 
 You see, when I died I met a guy named Peter, he told me that I was n't ready to enter the next part of life. It was weird, I thought for sure I was going to heaven, but he told me there was no such thing, just the next part of our lives. 
 
 His instructions were to come here. He said there was something I needed to figure out, there was something I missed. It was here, I could feel it, something important. I just could n't grasp it.
