You are five when you start to understand that there is something wrong with you. In class, between talk of numbers and letters Greg wants to know what you dreamt last night. 
 
 `` I do n't know,'' you say. 
 
 `` Okay.'' He replies. 
 
 On the other side of the room Hannah gets a crayon stuck up her nose and you are distracted. That night you try and imagine what a dream is. You know it is important like your teddy. Maybe, if you stay up, you can see a dream. Soon you fall asleep. It is dark and endless. You forget about that question for a long time.

 The first week of summer vacation is something you enjoy. You have just finished sixth grade and feel on top of the world. A group of friends decide to go to the amusement park. It is loud, bright, chaotic. Tbere are food smells and the hot pavement and the chemical taste of sunscreen in the back of your mouth. After the the third go on the Tilt-a-Whirl your head feels light. Ben staggers next to you. 
 
 `` I'm drunk!'' He shouts. 
 
 Neither of you are quite sure what it means to be drunk, but you laugh and stagger together. 
 
 You gorge on cotton candy ( or try too. The stuff is too light for that full feeling ) and drink soda. You forget about the sun screen your mom packed. You are slick with sweat. Greg's face has become a bright cheesy red like a cartoon character. You have to go to the bathroom. Inside it is cool. The lights hurt. A sound is buzzing in the back of your head. The door seems very far away. Something is horribly wrong. The tile is nice and cold. Someone is shaking you, `` can you hear me?'' but it's a stupid question. The world has gone flat. You wonder if you are dreaming. 
 
 You wake up in the hospital with a wicked headache and a small scar. 
 
 Your mom is sitting by you bedside. 
 
 `` Your appendix burst.'' And she starts crying. 
 
 **** 
 
 You do n't tell anyone that you ca n't dream. There is no test for it, no regulations or rules. At lunch you do n't volunteer anything. If you are asked directly you can make something up. Usually it's a mixture of books and movies and what you hear others say. Standing naked in the school. Flying. A magical door. Something vast and nameless chasing you. 
 
 Ron chews his sandwich noisily. `` What about nightmares?'' 
 
 `` What about them?'' Ben's turned into an ass lately. Everyone ignores him. 
 
 `` I have one about crabs.'' Danny starts. Ron snorts. 
 
 `` Did you tell your girlfriend that?'' 
 
 Ben chortles to himself. You'd all been giving Danny shit, but Ben had a talent for making it cruel. 
 
 `` Shut up.'' You say. For a moment you are distracted by you lunch. The lid on your sandwich container is stuck. 
 
 You glance up to see everyone starting. `` What?'' 
 
 `` What do you have nightmares about?'' Ron is actually interested. Everyone else is getting bored. Ben starts flicking scraps of paper at the back of Cassy Thomas' head. 
 
 `` Nothing.'' You say it stupidly. It's a second of horrible honesty. 
 
 Ron looks confused. 
 
 `` Woah.'' Danny says. `` That's freaky. Like, *nothing* nothing?'' 
 
 `` Yeah.'' You have their attention. Now you have to lose it. `` Totally dark.'' 
 
 `` What about your appendix?'' Greg is trying to kick Ben under the table as he talks. 
 
 `` Sometimes.'' You agree. `` What about you?'' 
 
 Greg shrugs. `` Clowns, mostly.'' 
 
 `` What else?'' Ron is obnoxious. He wants to know every detail. 
 
 `` Your mom.'' And Ben is howling with laughter. 
 
 **** 
 
 Greg calls you that night. Over the sounds of dinner and the TV you almost miss it. You dad picks it up. 
 
 `` It's for you.'' He hands you the phone. At the table mom and Jeff are talking about the car. Jeff wants to borrow it for the weekend. 
 
 `` Hello?'' 
 
 `` Hi-ya.'' It's Greg. He's the only one that talks like that. 
 
 `` Hi, Greg.'' 
 
 `` Are you alone?'' 
 
 It's a dumb question. The kitchen table is less than ten feet from you. If he was any louder the whole family could hear him. You tell him as much. 
 
 `` I'm alone.'' He sounds nervous. He's breathing through his mouth. `` I got ta ask you something.'' 
 
 You wait. He does n't say anything. 
 
 `` I'm waiting.'' You tell him. 
 
 `` I know you ca n't dream.'' 
 
 For an asinine second you think this must be a dream. It's too messed up not to be one. 
 
 `` What do you mean?'' 
 
 `` Well, at least you think you ca n't. Right?'' 
 
 You swallow hard. Over the line you can hear the echo of your throat clicking. Your mom has stopped talking to Jeff and is working at ignoring him. You know it does n't matter because Jeff got a copy of the keys made last month when he started hooking up with Fanny Howard behind the YMCA. On TV someone is complaining about the state of the country, why on earth an actor got into the White House. Greg is still talking. 
 
 You cut him off. You give some excuse about homework or dinner and hang up. When you come back to the table your mom looks concerned. Somehow you convince her it's nothing. 
 
 It wo n't last long. 
 
 **** 
 
 Mrs. Green is a teacher you respect but would never admit to doing so. She's old and oddly frail under the fat that hangs off her. She asks you to stay after class. `` It will only take a moment, hon.'' You never imagined that Greg told her. 
 
 It turns out he did. 
 
 `` You ca n't *not* dream.'' She says. `` It's not possible. Maybe you do n't remember all of them, but you do dream.'' 
 
 `` I do n't.'' You insist. `` There's nothing.'' 
 
 `` There is.'' She pats your arm. `` I'm sure there is. You're not trying hard enough.'' 
 
 You walk out. 
 
 **** 
 
 Your parents are terrified of what it might mean. Jeff tries to act the same, but you can see worry lurking. He does n't even ask about the car. They handle you with kid gloves. You go to a shrink every Tuesday. She smells like clove cigarettes and has helmet hair. 
 
 School is another story. Your prom date ditches you but keeps the ticket and goes with Wes Nichols. Ben avoids you like its contagious. Ron is overly sensitive. He starts keeping a dream diary for you in secret. You discover it when he drops the notebook in the hall one day. You stop talking to pretty much everyone after that. When you graduate you do it with your head down. You only apply to colleges far away. Jeff somehow understands and offers to drive you to the recruiters. When you get there Jeff enlists. He makes a big deal about the paperwork. The recruiter seems impressed, but you realize that you'd never get past the background. Not with your shrink.
