`` One fine day in the desert-'' 
 
 `` Oi, a fine day in the desert is no day in the desert.'' 
 
 `` Ah, but my lamp is my home, being bigger on the inside than on the outside is only one of many luxuries. If you wish, I could show you.'' 
 
 `` That sounds like a good - oh, very funny, hilarious even.'' 
 
 `` On that day, I met a prince-'' 
 
 `` What was so special about this prince?'' 
 
 `` If you ask questions too quickly, you'll forget your question after you finish hearing it's answer. 
 
 This prince studied Roman law, millennia after the fall of Rome. He first wished that he can choose his death whenever he wants. 
 
 He then wished that whoever summoned me from then on, would receive a 4th wish, but that it could only affect the next being to summon me. 
 
 And lastly, he wished to know every wish made by everyone who summoned me from then on.'' 
 
 `` But what does this have to do with me?'' 
 
 `` Your last question was'What the hell sort of genie has 4 wishes?'.'' 
 
 `` Apparently, the kind who impersonates their summoner. Why then, ca n't I wish for anything?'' 
 
 `` Because your predecessor wished nobody gets any wishes from me anymore.'' 
 
 `` Why?'' 
 
 `` He did n't like the prince.''
