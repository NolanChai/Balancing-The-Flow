`` I believe that...... I am........going....to kick your....ass''. Trash talking? At moi? No way. 
 
 `` Hey....you little twat....you think....you can beat me?'' 
 
 What the hell is up with this guy? It is taking him forever to finish his sentences. Must be shitty internet wherever he is from. `` Hey asshole, get a better internet connection... your voice is having some serious buffering issues.'' 
 
 `` My internet....it is fine. You, however....you better change... your strategy... and hope....I do n't keep kicking....your ass.'' 
 
 God he sounds familiar. The way he said change and hope... could it... no, no way. 
 
 `` This.....this is my moment....and I... will beat....the snot out of you.'' 
 
 Fuck. Fuck no, that....that's the President speaking. Hope, change. I was overwhelmed at the thought - does n't he... is n't he giving a press conference in like 20 minutes?! Just then, he got me. Shot dead. I could only utter two words....'' Thanks, Obama.''
