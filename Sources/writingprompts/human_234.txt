Well damn. That's a sad thing to hear. He was an excellent writer, better than excellent. The world's a little less because of it. It's like John Donne's famous line, 
 
 *'' No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend's or of thine own were; any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. `` * 
 
 It's very sad to hear...
