Armor is useful. 
 
 With these crowds, armor leaves the reign of useful though. On this day, of all days, it is imperative. 
 
 Even with the obvious benefit provided by the armor most of the'shopper' horde came with nothing. Just fleshy meatsacks that wandered at random looking for a good deal. 
 
 Every once in a while the rich people behind the'hunters' got bored and decided that they wanted to see some carrion. So, they dropped a super deal. 
 
 
 `` 50 % off!'' the speakers blare. The lumbering behemoths of the crowd glanced over and discerned that it was a mostly useless deal. 
 
 In my suit, I could see everything around me in the dim lighting. Every edge I could see was polarized and defined to a point of glaring light. The fleshy hordes bounded over one another and fought over the smallest deals. 
 
 Not I though. This suit was one of the best in it's price bracket. With a full arsenal of nonlethal weaponry, as well as a few select products designed to be utterly lethal, I am outfitted for the apocalypse... Or just the seasonal Black Friday Bash. 
 
 Some of this fleshy horde might argue that it was too expensive but they just missed the finer points. 
 
 `` 99 % Off!'' my radar bleeped and read off the deal into my ear. 
 
 `` Now that's a good deal.'' I said as I tromped through the crowd towards the approaching deal. This suit had paid itself off in savings quite a while ago.
