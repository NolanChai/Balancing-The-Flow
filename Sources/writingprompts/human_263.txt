I laid in my bed staring at the ceiling. *What to do... * I wondered as I observed my eye floaters glide across my field of vision. This continued for a few minutes until I decided to turn over and try to nap even though it was three in the afternoon. 
 
 I started to have a half dream. You know, the kind of dream that's a mix between a day dream and a real dream. I napped for about ten minutes and when I woke up I was a little thirsty, so I got out of my bed, walked over the dirty clothes on the floor, and opened my door. 
 
 On my way to the kitchen I got the sudden urge to talk to someone. My phone had died earlier and I left my charger at work, so I was alone. *Maybe I should talk to myself, * I thought. Then I had one of those moments where you say `` You know what? I'm alone, so fuck it.'' and do something weird. 
 
 `` What's... up, me?'' I croaked nervously. *This feels weird... * 
 
 `` Nothing much, just getting some water.'' *I think I'm getting the hang of it. * 
 
 I opened a cabinet and got a glass out. 
 
 `` I remember when I got these glasses.'' 
 
 `` Yep, Mom bought them for me when I moved out.'' 
 
 I pressed the glass against the button under the ice maker on freezer door and when a couple cubes came out I switched to water. 
 
 `` It's weird, I do n't really miss Mom since I moved out, and I've been doing fine on my own despite how my friends said it usually goes.'' 
 
 `` Maybe it's because she always neglected me for her asshole boyfriends while I was growing up, and I had to learn to take care of myself at a young age...'' 
 
 I started walking back to my room. 
 
 ``... So I'm used to her not being around and I'm used to living like an adult because I never really had a childhood.'' 
 
 I stopped short in front of my door. 
 
 *Holy shit, that's fucked up... * 
 
 *I know, right? *
