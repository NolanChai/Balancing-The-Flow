 I Hunger. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I smell... 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 FOOD! 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I attack! 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I eat. 
 
 *** 
 
 I Hunger. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I see... something. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I approach. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 FOOD! 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I attack. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I eat 
 
 *** 
 
 I am driven by Hunger. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I search for food. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I see prey. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I pursue my prey. 
 
 & nbsp; 
 
 I eat. 
 
 *** 
 
 I am again driven by the Hunger. 
 
 I roam the streets, searching for food. 
 
 I spot a small group of uninfected. 
 
 They flee as I approach. 
 
 I lunge, and grab the slowest one. 
 
 I eat. 
 
 *** 
 
 
 I have joined a pack. Most of the pack simply follows the Hunger. Our leader is different. He is cunning. He is wise. He speaks. 
 
 He leads us to a settlement of uninfected. We attack together. A brave few dare to fight us, the rest run. As we consume the ones who tried to stop us, our leader looks over to us. 
 
 `` Can you speak?'' 
 
 
 *** 
 
 Another day, another hunt. I stand with four other from our pack in the woods behind a camp of uninfected. Most of the pack attacks the settlement, while we wait here for any that flee. Although a few uninfected manage to escape, today we feast. 
 
 As we finish, satisfying the Hunger, our leader approaches. 
 
 `` Can you speak?'' he asks 
 
 And this time, I can.
