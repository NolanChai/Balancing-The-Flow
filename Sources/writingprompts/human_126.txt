The board, it's very impressive. Lots of people are staring at it. There's an audience. 
 
 It's weird to see a life summarized like this. It's fascinating. The system required to track all these variables for every living thing must be amazing. 
 
 Then I notice some movement. I'm dead so my leaderboard should be static right? 
 
 It's one of the small-print numbers and it's cranking up steadily. 
 
 As I lean in I hear the familiar braying laugh of my old college roommate Paul. I heard he died some years back, but you never forget that laugh. 
 
 I practically have to press my nose to the panel to read the label text. `` Gullibility''. 
 
 `` Fuck you Paul!'' I laugh as I turn into his friendly hug; the afterlife is going to be a blast!
