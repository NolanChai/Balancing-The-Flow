I woke up covered in sweat. I have had to change the sheets every night for the past week. The smell of bacon, eggs, and waffles lingers in the air. 
 
 “ Good morning, sweetie! Would you like some syrup for your waffles?, ” my mother asks way too bubbly for this time of day. 
 
 “ Yeah! Is that even question?!, ” I hastily reply, more chipper than usual. 
 
 My dad lowers the newspaper and looks over at mom, “ Honey… did you hear about the Jones ’? Danny ended up just like Tammy Clements the other day. Completely comatose. The doctors don ’ t know what ’ s happening, but I suspect it ’ s the Alchemist Alliance poisoning people. Just like the Madhatter gas attack in 97… Wasn ’ t that in China? ” 
 
 “ Japan, dear. It was Tokyo. Those poor people are still crazy, ” she replied with a distressed tone. 
 
 I stand up from the dining table, my heart pounding out of my chest. 
 “ I don ’ t feel so good…, ” as the darkness closes in on my vision. I start falling backwards, but my mom catches me with her telekinesis. 
 
 “ …Where am I?, ” I ask, confused from my surroundings. 
 
 “ It looks like puberty finally hit, my boy! Your powers have finally arrived. I told you you ’ d be a late bloomer! Haha! We ran the genetic testing and it seems like your body was a little overwhelmed… You have two sequences of powers. We haven ’ t seen this before, and it may be a little unstable, but we ’ re not surprised. With powers being around for the last 200 years, it was bound to be a mutation sooner or later, ” the doctor spouted as if it wasn ’ t the best thing since sliced bread. 
 
 “ I finally have powers?! Can I test them?!, ” I asked in a hurry. I was so worried that I would never get them. 
 
 “ Let ’ s go to the testing room, just in case they ’ re still unstable. Your vitals are fine. No more passing out on us, okay?, ” the doctor said sternly. 
 
 Upon arriving at the room, I excitedly raised my hands and looked at a book on the table. It disappeared in an instance, appeared floating in the center of the room, turned to ice, hit the floor, shattered, and each fragment exploded into a void sucking in the floor. The fragments exploding were the last thing I saw before passing out again. 
 
 “ Son…. Son…. Are you okay?, ” my dad said worriedly, holding my hand with a tear rolling down his cheek. 
 
 “ Why do…….Why do I keep passing out? ”, I asked, nearly swimming in a bed of water from sweat. 
 
 The doctor comes over and puts a hand on each of my parents ’ shoulders. “ Tim… Julia… it has been three days, ” he says, pressing a red button hooked up to the IV in my arm. I start feeling immediately relaxed. “ We have to make sure that he calms down, ” he says with teeth nearly chattering. “ They ’ re here. ” 
 
 My ears suddenly hear the news from the other room, as if the speaker is in my head. 
 
 “ Breaking news… fifty two more comatose victims in the last 3 days. Doctors are still unsure of the cause, but after genetic testing, they have found that their powers in their genes are degrading at a rapid rate. We ’ re asking everyone to please wear masks at this time to ensure that it is not an airborne sickness. Make sure you do not contact anyone out of the ordinary. Schools have been canceled this week to ensure the potential contamination is dealt with. Do not panic. Doctor John Stapleton from University Hospital has told News 5 that this is probably nothing more than the 20th Anniversary of the Alchemist Alliance. ” 
 
 My eyes squint at the doctor ’ s lab coat and I notice the same name – *John Stapleton*. 
 
 Doctor Stapleton sighs and says the unthinkable, “ The comatose victims are not due to the Alchemist Alliance… The Legion has guards posted outside right now, ” he remarks as he suddenly grabs another controller with a different button. As he presses it, I feel as if I never have to sleep again. “ We have to keep him awake. The Legion has verified what I have feared due to him passing out. They registered his unique power in the database… ” 
 
 “ …Oh my god, doctor… What is it?, ” my mother says, her hand over her mouth as she ’ s fighting back tears. I levitate off the bed, not controlling any of my own movements, eyes rolling into the back of my head. The whites of my eyes showing, and turning vantablack. I look over at the Doctor and my parents, as the guards are trying to break into the steel door of the room which I melted to the frame. 
 
 “ Dream Eater, ” I whisper, as I pass out again.
