`` Aw jeez,'' I thought to myself, `` Which one is it?'' 
 
 I jingled through the mass of keys attached to the Keymaster's Ring: a ring about 6 inches in diameter crowded with master keys to most of the planet's prisons. 
 
 `` I should probably organize this thing, huh?'' I nervously laughed, a bit flustered and hoping The Cryomaniac would n't immediately freeze me once I set him free from his cell. Some supervillain I was, always afraid of the guy I'm trying to set free.

 `` Just one request.'' I answered slowly, in a voice of newfound weight that can be heard in the voice of one speaking directly from the mouth of their maker. 
 
 `` Yes, anything.'' He sounded a bit taken aback.
