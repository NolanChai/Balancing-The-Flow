When the world's AI first initiated its P.E.A.C.E program ( the Protection of Earth's Ape and Chimpanzee Evolutiant ) a lot of people's noses were put out of joint. Figuratively. When Mike stood in the carpark and took a wild swing at Jim's nose, both men were surprised when, at the moment preceding impact, an overflying drone dropped 5mg of AbsorboGel between fist and probiscus. 
 
 
 They would have been more surprised to learn that this particular drone had been brought on station almost 20 minutes earlier. Sensor arrays in the bar area, embedded in the ceiling and walls, in stools and glasses, had immediately picked up heightened vocal stresses and neurochemical releases. Within a trillionth of a second, the AI had determined likely scenarios and had deployed a safety drone accordingly. 
 
 
 The AI deployed over 80 million drones that hour. And not one person on the entire planet was hurt because of another's careless neglect or wilful harm. 
 
 
 What the AI did not anticipate or predict was the large number of people who were very, very pissed at all this. Not just those intent on fracturing emotions and bones, but entire armies were rendered worthless. Entire countries. Liberals and conservatives united, deploring the castration of mankind and all that it meant to be human. 
 
 
 The AI absorbed information quickly. The next hour, drone-released airborne drugs rendered all passionate emotion obsolete. The world was, finally, calm.
