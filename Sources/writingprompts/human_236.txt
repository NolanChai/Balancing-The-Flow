I have the ability to fly... but at walking speed. It was exciting at first, I got studied by scientists ( who could n't figure out how it worked ), got invited to universities, gave a TED talk and even got to meet the president! Fighting crime was actually suggested by our mayor but after a few months, it became obvious I was not very useful. In fact, I was a bigger hassle to protect than it was worth. Eventually I got cut and had a short stint as a Vegas performer, but even that did n't pan out. I do n't know magic tricks or any other stage performance. Reviews for my show were terrible. I mean, how interesting is someone just floating there? The ridicule hurt the most. After going through depression and really falling apart, I have found a semblance of usefulness in my new profession of outside window washer for high rises. Not the fastest worker but it pays $ 30/hr, which is n't bad considering I still need the platform to keep the equipment on. I heard my coworkers say I'm only kept on because of the insurance discount to the company, but hey it pays the bills.
