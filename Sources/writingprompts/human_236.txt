Millions of humans slowly emerged from their dark, cold cavernous asylums into the day. Realizing the day was bright and warm and it was n't to be shared with anyone, happiness soon followed. Facebook is gone. Their lives were their own to rule and control; all their own to live in peace. 
 
 It took longer than expected for anyone to really figure out what happened. Rumors circulated the internet, no one could establish the truth. A small news site in California posted a story about Mark and Priscilla breaking up. A few months later, Men's Health ran an article on Mark's body building transformation after the Fall. Reddit sleuths started to put two and two together. When someone finally found a small snippet of code buried deep in the salvaged FB source code, the final peace of the puzzle fell into place. 
 
 No one blamed him. Charges were filed, but no jury could be found that was willing to admit their lives were better with Facebook. Other social media sites started to disappear as users migrated away from ubiquitous online presences for a more simple lifestyle. 
 
 The Social Media Era dissolved by the year 2023. The fallout was profound. Society began to return to in-presence communication lifestyle. Texting and email faded to the background. Technology continued to advance, but it became more focused on allowing people to communicate through audio and video. Eventually, the advances led to the holonet we now know today. No one could have predicted that the social media experiment would be viewed as hampering progress. 
 
 The knowledge we gain from studying that time has given us incredible insight into humanity's social development. Now, self-reflection, awareness, consciousness, and happiness are at the focus of all aspects of life. We continuously strive to better understand ourselves and those around us in order to avoid the mistakes of the past while reaching toward the future.
