The face you friend. The face of your enemy. The face of your lover. The face of your mistake. The face of all that you hold dear. The face of all you reject with fiery passion. It does not care 
 
 The ultimate killing machine has none of these faces. It is silent, fast, and lethal. It does not care 
 
 One day, you are celebrating your life's biggest moment. The birth of your child. Your biggest promotion. Your inauguration speech. It does not care. 
 
 One day, you are working at your job just like any other day. You type reports, grin through the customers incompetence, accept that the manager position is not too far away. It does not care 
 
 One day, you are at your darkest hour, you can hear the hounds of Hades barking your name. You struggle with the urge to just end it all, the death of your best friend, the revelation that you will never fly so high. It does not care. 
 
 No matter what you do, you can not escape death. It is ever present, and will follow you right on your heels, or will lurk in the shadows. One can never be sure when death will come knocking, but it does not matter. It does not care.
