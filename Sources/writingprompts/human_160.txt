I am alone, but I am happy. 
 I turn to the wall in beside me and it changes to an image of her. Her long golden hair was parted just between her bright blue right eye. The image swirled again and she had just the slightest impression of a laugh. I close my eyes and try not to let the feelings rush back in. I opened my eyes and dried my eyes off. Her image was gone; this was not an unpleasant change. 
 
 I am alone, but I Am happy. 
 
 The wall kept changing. She showed up more than once. Change. It kept changing. Why couldn ’ t it stay on her. Why couldn ’ t it stay off her. Anybody would be better than her. It changed off of her image yet again. It needs to stop changing so I can focus. Focus on what I came here to do. What did I come here to do? The wall was white. Was it always white? As if that simple thought was the most important command, the wall transformed into a glittering array of colors. I once again lost track of myself and floated into the abyss of comfort. I snapped awake when the wall disappeared. I fell through, not realizing I had been leaning on the wall. Had I always been leaning against the wall, or did I somehow move positions. If I didn ’ t move, did somebody else move me? That is impossible. 
 
 I Am Alone. But am I happy? 
 
 Falling. I was still falling. Was there an end to this feeling? The shimmer in the air next to me grew. I looked down at my hands and they were holding onto an invisible something. I stood up, still falling. I reached out, falling faster. I grabbed on to Her hands, and then She was falling with me. I glanced at Her and She was looking at me. She laughed, and it made Her throw Her head back, and Her golden hair, bounced in the wind I felt from us falling. Falling. Falling in love. 
 
 I am no longer alone, and I am happy.
