In the beginning some idiots tried to harvest physical pain by torture, then they tried to cause horrible mental pain, and they succeed. However in most cases they did damage their resources to the point nothing could be done, it was such a waste. Then politicians and regulators decided to step in and every `` pain factory'' ( what kind of moron names his product `` pain factory'', is n't there some fancy greek word or something? ) had to be closed and whole process is now forbidden. 
 
 However I still continue, secretly, in disguise. I found a way how to obtain resources and repeatedly use them. They even come to me voluntarily and call me Samaritan. At first, they were homeless, old, poor people arriving every day multiple times. Single mothers with their kids, students, people that are tight on money were next. Then I opened my doors to anybody. 
 
 I prefer Mexicans, they are the best resource, providing the largest yield. No one can sustain so much pain for so long as them. Their love for spicy food is endless. I wish I could harvest their pain while they are experiencing the heat from my food second time, while they are shitting. 
 
 However, today I will not cook dinner, my staff do it for me. Today, I have different plan, I will be the resource for my `` competition''. Madame Beatrix with her whip will always get the best of me.
