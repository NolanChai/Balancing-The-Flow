`` Captain, Knight Ronalde reporting. I've brought the information as you requested.'' Saluting as the address began, the man who entered the room took up the tense position of one awaiting interrogation, straightening as he began his report. `` Another rift and another entry, this time Southern town Forles, just North of the Redstone territories.'' 
 
 `` Alive?'' At the desk, a bespectacled man set down the parchment he'd been eyeing, noble-style reading glasses removed with a rough sigh. `` I'm guessing that's a *no, * is n't it?'' 
 
 `` Unfortunately, Captain.'' Still at attention, Ronalde tried not to stare as his superior reached for the flask of amber, taking a hefty sip before standing with a gruff hiss of displeasure. It took little for him to notice that the room smelled strongly of spirits, or the second- much more empty flask sitting unattended on the floor. `` If I may, Sir-'' 
 
 `` Fine, take me to it. Gods only know the Queen wo n't want us bringing the corpse in here.'' The Captain retrieved a rough looking contraption of wood and metal from beside the desk, slinging it over his shoulder to match the regal sword at his waist. `` Do you know the cause of death?'' 
 
 `` Captain, reports say it was simply a bad landing. No fowl play suspected. The rift opened up thirty feet above the cobblestone... the results were... unpleasant.'' 
 
 `` The poor bastard never had a chance.'' 
 
 `` No sir. Likely dead on impact.'' 
 
 `` Any other disturbances? Ripple effects?'' Objects of interest?'' 
 
 `` Sir, some artifacts were recovered. Metal tools of some kind, and another mana-housing.'' Checking the parchment in hand, Ronalde took the lead lead, confirming. `` A small amount of water as well, reportedly. The Church Officials of the town were attempting to take the scene when we arrived, but the Royal crest backed them down.'' 
 
 `` Did you recover everything?'' A rough gesture from the Captain signaled a post of armored guards waiting in the hall, an entourage began to form. Knights fell into step with rough clatter of plates and steel as the Captain continued down towards the heavy-set wooden doors. `` I want every object found, in all likelihood we're going to need them at some point.'' 
 
 `` For the most part they've been recovered, although it's hard to say. The Church might have hidden some of them.'' Keeping pace, the Soldier fell back as the Captain slammed the doors open, going on ahead as two panicked attendants jumped back from the wide-swing. `` We were n't the first on scene.'' 
 
 `` You'd really think the Church might lack the spine for that sort of thing nowadays.'' An angry growl sounded with the faintest hint of liquor as the Captain's pace increased, growing gaggle of Guards struggled to follow without forming to a trot in the hallways. `` After that god-damned bloody Sunday, you'd expect them to consider a bit more before trying anything.'' 
 
 `` Aye Sir, you're right Sir! We'd all think it.'' The brisk reply came with a halt of movement, as the Captain zeroed in on the first room in the hall. `` But it's in the realm of possibilities, so-'' 
 
 `` Hold on a moment- ROB!'' The Captain's shout echoed through the rafters as he knocked loudly on the smaller set of doors. `` Rob, get up!'' The knocking continued, relentlessly. `` I need you to lead a team, ASAP. If I have to come back here with a bucket of ice water, so help me god- I'll do it!'' 
 
 *'' It's late! * A muffled voice replied, obviously irritated. *'' You had me running Body-guard for the Queen with that damn Elf of yours all day! Joe has the other set of keys, make him go! `` * 
 
 `` Rob, if the ice water does n't do it for you I'll go down the hall and get Sandra to open the door.'' 
 
 *'' You would n't! `` * 
 
 `` I might...'' The Captain let his tone settle for a moment, considering. `` Rob, I though Adventuring was your deal. Was n't that the reason you came here?'' 
 
 *'' Oh... for fuck's sake, I'm coming! Do n't you dare sick that crazy Mage-woman on me. `` * a rough shuffle and the clatter of wood sounded before the door was opened to reveal a bedraggled man of slightly plump build. `` From threats to guilt-tripping, I see how you do things.'' 
 
 `` I would n't if I could help it, but I've got a Mission for you.'' The Captain eyed the man, almost uneasy. `` Twenty miles south, urgent: I'd recommend taking the Jeep.'' 
 
 `` *Another* mission, Captain?'' 
 
 `` Quest than, if that sounds better to you.'' The Captain peeked past the door with a grimace at the unorganized mess within the room. `` It's a retrieval. A portal opened to the South.'' 
 
 `` Hooo, anything interesting come out of them?'' 
 
 `` One person, now deceased.'' 
 
 `` Nothing else?'' 
 
 `` No, but where there's one, there's a good chance of more. Queen's scouts have reported as much, we saw that happen last month too with what might have been an aircraft.'' The Captain pulled the parchment from Ronadle's waiting hand beside him, scanning it over before giving a gruff nod. `` *Poor bastard might have been a plumber*... Listen, I want you down there with a team. Any more people come out, bring them here if you can.'' 
 
 `` If this is a longterm thing I'm requesting Eron. Guns are great an all, but I'm not going back out there without some solid firepower.'' From the doorway, the man's arms crossed over a stained t-shirt and a slight beer-gut. `` I want a mage.'' 
 
 `` Fine, and I'll throw in six knights while you're at it- but if you get Eron, you get Sandra.'' 
 
 `` Sandra-'' The man choked on the name, coughing with a flustered anger. `` Since when was that a rule?'' 
 
 `` Since they put rings on each other's fingers.'' 
 
 `` Oh for fuck's sake- Fine then! But I want Joe too.'' Puffing up, the man eyed the Captain. `` My car, my rules. I'm not going anywhere with Sandra unless Joe is there to watch my back. I do n't want to wind up dead.'' 
 
 `` No Rob, I ca n't do it.'' The Captain dismissed the suggestion, `` I might need Joe if another Portal opens somewhere else. If not him, then I'll likely need to leave the Capital myself, and there's a still a Church mark on my neck. That's a disaster waiting to happen.'' 
 
 `` Then you can send your Crazy Elf, or the Werewolf- I want Joe on my team.'' 
 
 `` We both know that Queen Aurum's very fond of that werewolf,'' The Captain let a sly smile creep over his beard, `` and the *Crazy* Elf wo n't leave even if I order her to.'' 
 
 `` Seriously?'' 
 
 `` I'm afraid so.'' 
 
 `` You're not budging?'' 
 
 `` No, I ca n't give you all of them Rob, I'm sorry.'' The Captain confirmed, `` There have been too many assassination attempts recently anyways, at least one of them is needed here for now.'' 
 
 `` Fine, keep the Mages, just send me with Joe- and knock that down to four knights so we can fit without that shit trailer you've got. We'll get it done.'' 
 
 `` Deal.''
