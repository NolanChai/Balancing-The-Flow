**Kind of NSFW* 
 Bright lights bore down upon me, unable to stand them I squinted my eyes tightly, trying to get a view of my immediate surroundings. 
 
 `` Where am I'' I called out, remembering only a sliver of last night, I felt something immediately wrong as I realized that the creaking sound coming from underneath me was not my bed, but rather my arm. 
 
 At first is appeared as a think grey line crossing just over my elbow, upon closer inspection I realized that it split my forearm from my shoulder. 
 
 Falling out of the iron bed I had been placed on the horror of my situation was finally revealed. Small metal nails stuck out from every joint and each limb looked barely attached. What was even weirder, was that I was able to *move* them. Somehow finding the will to stand, I stood shakily, gripping the bed to keep myself stable. Bring the seemingly prosthetic hand close to my face I could see each individual finger as I clenched them into a fist and back again. 
 
 Only when I realized that I was naked did something strike fear deep into my heart, looking down I realized that I was lacking a very important *member* of my body. 
 
 *Please no* I whispered to myself, an odd mechanical tone aiding my natural voice. Reaching my hand down below I noticed a small hatch implanted in the center, reaching my finger inside I found a switch. Hesitantly flicking it up I could feel something growing. 
 
 A metallic rod slid out silently from its holding, like a snake ready to strike. I let out a sigh of relief, releasing the switch. 
 
 The rod had other ideas however, 
 
 It just kept extending, and extending, and extending.
