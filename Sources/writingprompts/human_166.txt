`` So, what are you supposed to be?'' Zeus asked the newest god. 
 
 `` Well..umm..you see... they called me the RNG. Short for Random Number God'' replied the RNG, who took to calling him self Matthew. 
 
 The other gods boomed with laughter as they feasted on ambrosia and nectar. The hall was majestic, with great pillars of stone rising at least a hundred feet and chairs, no, thrones in the hundreds filled with gods ranging from prehistoric deities to the Old Man himself. 
 
 RNG was born due to video games in the early 1990s in which random numbers mattered a lot in video games. Popular sites like Reddit and their communities like PCMR popularized the use of the term, `` RNG''. 
 
 Matthew did n't feel that special. When he was in a bad mood, people had bad luck with numbers, and vice versa. He did n't have any special powers like the other gods. 
 
 He had a fun time messing with games of Civilization or Pacman, sometimes even messing with the lottery or casinos. Eventually, however, games moved away from random numbers. Matthew had less and less to do, until one day, the legend became true. They say when a god is forgotten, he fades off slowly. That same day, he started looking pale. Over the course of a feel weeks, he became paler and paler until he disappeared altogether.
