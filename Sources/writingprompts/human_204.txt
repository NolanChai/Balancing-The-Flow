I live in a world when you lie you get a scar. The bigger the scar, the worse the lie. I apparently was in an accident a year ago and now I ca n't remember things that well. So there I am at the store and I see this girl with one extremely large and deep looking scar. I figured I should go ask her what she said because it seems interesting there was only one lie. So I asked her and she said she used to be my wife. She could n't look me in the eye and she said it was `` I love you.'' 
 
 Edit: Yes I know someone else did something similar to this. Just saying before downvotes happen.
