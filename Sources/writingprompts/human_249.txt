They were all crowding around me. All with devices in their hands: phones, tablets, phablets, laptops - even a couple of dudes at the back with desktop computers. And, unbelievably, someone had brought their toilet to sit on while he scrolled his phone. I was wondering how the bloody hell he'd got it here before, for the umpteenth time, someone asked me, `` What's the password?'' 
 
 `` For fuck's sake,'' I said, `` For the last bloody time, it's 1234.'' 
 
 I'd narrowed in on the teenager who asked just as he was opening his mouth for the next statement. 
 
 `` You know that's a low-strength password, right?'' he asked, oblivious to the fact that my rage was about to overflow. 
 
 As soon as I saw red the crowd suddenly let out a huge collective groan. 
 
 `` WiFi's not working,'' said the kid, tapping away. 
 
 `` Well sooorry,'' I replied, laying on the sarcasm thick. `` It's not my fault. I still do n't know why I'm a WiFi hotspot.'' 
 
 The collective grumbling and mumbling slowly built to a loud roar. People were pissed. A few had obviously had their porn videos stopped premature of the climax, while others had websites cut out mid-load. There were a few that were smart and had spent their time being connected to *download* what they wanted - but they were few and far between. 
 
 People started shouting in angst, but one voice sounded over them all. 
 
 It was that fucking kid. 
 
 `` What if we turn him off and turn him on again?'' He'd finally looked up from his tablet. His most striking feature, funnily enough, was a bowl cut. 
 
 `` You really are an idiot - I'm a fucking human being,'' I said. 
 
 `` It's worth a shot,'' he replied. 
 
 That, funnily enough, seemed to strike a chord with the crowd. 
 
 `` Yeah!'' someone said. `` Turn him off and turn him on again!'' 
 
 `` Yeah right guys,'' I laughed, `` Good luck with that.'' 
 
 The crowd seemed to digest these words and it simmered with them for thirty second. 
 
 Then the kid - that fucking kid - let out a war cry I though was incapable for his weedy body and the mob followed suit. The roar was raised; the crowd rushed forward. Bodies pushed in on me from all sides. Oxygen seemed to leave me. I gasped and screamed and screamed but soon enough someone clubbed me on the head and all I saw next was black.
