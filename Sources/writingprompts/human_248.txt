`` I found him.'' the officer said, his eyes fixed firmly on mine. 
 
 I shuddered at the implications of those three words. To think that the police could be looking for me for any reason sent a shiver of fear up my spine and a spasm of terror into my bladder. 
 
 The dispatcher responded with something incomprehensible, and the officer nodded with a response in the affirmative. He leaned down into the window of my red sedan, the scent of black coffee and cigarettes strong on his breath. 
 
 `` I'm going to need you to follow me back to the station..'' he growled in a tone half authoritative, half threatening. 
 
 Unspoken but forcefully implied, the idea of running was obviously a bad one and I acquiesced, lowering my head for a moment as the officer returned to his vehicle and pulled out around me only to stop and blare the horn impatiently. I steered my own car back onto the street behind him, sweat beading on my brow and the steering wheel quickly growing slick beneath my whitened knuckles. 
 
 When we arrived at the station, I saw the Chief of Police himself waiting for us. He stormed furiously up to my passenger window, the officer who had detained me falling into step behind him. He gestured for me to roll it down, with which I complied quickly, and he leaned into the car with a growl rumbling in his throat. 
 
 `` You were supposed to be here ten minutes ago.'' he said in the most mortifying whisper I've ever heard. 
 
 He reached down toward his hip, concealed behind the frame of my car door thanks to his posture, and then with a speed I'd have not thought possible from someone of his age, snapped his hand back through the window and toward me. My fear-addled mind could not process the object he now held until it fluttered into my lap. 
 
 `` You're lucky I'm even paying for this.'' he said, pointing at the twenty dollar bill that now lay on my thigh. 
 
 He snatched his pizza from the passenger seat of my car, cursing me as he turned and walked back into the station.
