`` Can I play?'' I ask the man on the couch. From his waist length blond hair, hipster scarf, thin frame and extremely feminine features, he's every yaoi fan's wet-dream. He's also my wet-dream, but that is a different story. He's sitting in a standard looking lounge in a standard looking college playing a knock off of a really retro video game. Mario, I think, was the original title. 
 
 `` Oh sure. What's your name again? Sorry, I know you live in the dorm just terrible with names. `` He says, with a very bright smile. A smile that makes my knees weak! Fuck! I grab a controller and get comfortable maybe a little close to him to it be natural. He smells amazing too like happiness. He's not my soulmates for so many reasons, not the least of which is that he's name is Xavier and on my foot there is a name that no linguistic can identify the origin from! 
 
 `` Greyson, but almost everyone calls me Grey. Now to get the boring get-to-know-you questions out of way. Whats are you planning to major in and, where are you from?'' I say. He hits the start button, before answering. 
 
 
 `` English - linguistics double with a technology studies minor for funzies and bumfuck nowhere Tennessee. We got dressed up to go to Applebees. Yourself?'' He says, jumping a koopa-wannbee. Its been a long ass time since this game company even existed, and I'm more of a next-big-thing type gamer. I laugh way too much for the statement, but he does n't seem to notice. Thank god! 
 
 `` Computer Science-art double, I want to make videogames. I know, stupid dream. I'm from equally as bumfuck tiny town in Mississippi. We did n't even have an Applebees, much too classy. Also I did n't even know our college offered a linguistic major.'' I say, dying and shaking my wii to bubble myself over to him. 
 `` Independent major, I'm interested in language creation. Want to see my made-up language? That made me sound 5.'' He asks, just humming with excitement and pausing the game. His eyes shine, and the massive smiles on his face. I do n't think Hitler could say no to seeing his made up language. 
 
 `` I'd love to.'' I say. He rips his phone out of his pocket, and quickly scrolls his pictures. 
 
 `` Its my name.'' He says, flipping his phone around. My jaw drops, my heart pounds, and my eyes go wide. Fuck, just fuck. 
 
 I feel like I'm falling backward into thin air. I throw my hand out to catch myself but just ram my hand right into a hard metal thing. I'm back in the real world again. 
 I take off the VR headset and place it on my messy desk. My dirty coffee cups, take-out wrappers and cat fur just cover any flat surface. Is it narcissism to fall for your own creation? But my AI mod seems to be working, so there is always a silver lining. 
 
 Did that make sense?
