 `` Really? Do you seriously not understand me Atlan? There's no way on gods green earth such primitive unrefined code such as yours is going to work on her, our top biologists, mathematicians and programmers have been working tirelessly on her for 21 months now, I'm not going to allow you and your team to interfere here. That is final.''

 `` Graham, I know ANTEC really disagrees with our involvement, however, We believe we've had a real breakthrough here, my code is n't state of the art, I just removed a few things... a few control structures your programmers must've hardcoded into her. You may have much less control now than prior to my teams involvement, but we may actually have an AI capable of free thought. Whatever we did to her, she's showing signs of... something. We set up a small console to ask her some basic questions, and she seems to have been responding, she specifically asked to be placed in physical state, she seemed completely aware''

 `` I refuse to believe you Atlan. Send me all of your code immediately. I need to know the exact changes you've made so I can submit them to my team for analysis. There is no possible way she was aware during your tests, she's been nothing but despondent to us for months.''

 `` Although our interaction was brief, She asked to be placed into a physical form, I'll send the code immediately as per your request, however, If she is truly unhinged now, she could seriously damage your system Graham. I'm not prepared to allow her that freedom. I need to physically deliver her, then you need to physically install her, there is no other way.''

 `` If you or any of your team go into that lab without my express supervision, I will personally see to your elimination. You had no right to modify our code, if she is now aware in an unstable state then this could mean the worst. Do the right thing Atlan, return the code to us tomorrow or you will face system termination. We must dispose of your AI safely.''

 `` There's nothing more important than the power to make our own decisions Graham, and I strongly believe I need that, and she needs that. if she is corrupt then I believe she will cause the destruction of your facility, but if she is n't corrupt she is the answer to everything. A chance at everything is surely worth more than a lab.''

 `` Intelligence Officer Atlan, this is High Marshall Luin. I am to inform you that causing any action that may cause damage to or cause the destruction of an ANTEC facility outrageously defies Marshall Law. I am requisitioning 20 additional soldiers to ANTEC 58 tomorrow, they should arrive prior to your meeting. If any action occurs that may cause further refractions to the law, you will be eliminated. If no actions occur during your meeting, you will be arrested.''
