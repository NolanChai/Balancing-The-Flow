I've been on this journey for a few hundred years, and I'm starting to grow tired of it. It's hard when you meet a person you love, a person you care for more than anything in the world, and you know that you'll live through their aging, death, and the breaking down of their body. That's the price of being immortal: you are utterly alone. 
 
 Having lived for thousands of years, I have the appearance of a quite elderly man. My long gray beard almost drags along the floor, and my folds of skin show my age. But my body is still quite strong, and my heart functions well. My mind is still as sharp as ever. I have learned to live with looking old. After living for thousands of years, you learn that being attractive is one of the least important things in life. 
 
 I obviously ca n't share my secret of immortality with anyone; I'd be branded as a freak, or a demon. They'd all band against me, slaughter me. As I said, I am utterly alone. A short time spent with a woman, maybe a few decades, is enjoyable, yes, but knowing that soon I will never see her again... well, it wears on you. I've mated several hundreds of women, fathered thousands of children, and they're all long gone now. 
 
 It's a strenuous task, keeping my secret from everyone on this ship. But the way things are set up on this journey across the universe, things work in my favor. Every 100 years, all the people are allowed to reproduce. Dozens of children are born at this time, and they grow up to repeat the same process. The Reproduction Ceremony is today, in fact. 
 
 I sit down at the long table, looking down at all the adults on the ship. They are all celebrating the fact that this century's children are now born. The babies are all in the nursing room, being cared for by intricately designed machines so the parents can enjoy a hearty meal. I had been there when all the food was being prepared in the kitchen. At every Reproduction Feast of the Century, I like to add a special little ingredient. 
 
 After everyone had been eating for a few minutes, I suspect it will happen soon. I look up at all the adults on the voyage, and I see the first one. A man starts coughing violently, pounding his chest and flailing about until he simply slumps to the floor. Another person does the same, then another, until everyone in the room is lying on the floor, dead. 
 
 My thoughts turn to the newborn babies in the nursing room. Time to begin raising this century's children. Ca n't have the machines do it all.
