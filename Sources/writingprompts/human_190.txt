`` And here,'' I said, showing Meg the shelf of mirrors, `` are where we keep the mirrors that only reflect a person's inner beauty.'' 
 
 `` Nice,'' she said, reaching to pick one up. I gently took hold of her wrist and steered her away. 
 
 `` I would n't recommend that,'' I said. `` You wan na work up to it. Not everybody's really ready to know who they really are. Start small -- see those mood rings? They change color depending on how decent a person you are. That's a good way to get used to it.'' 
 
 Meg nodded. I was hopeful -- you always have reservations about new hires, but I really felt like Meg was catching on quick. She looked around the shop, past the baseball cards that actually showed a photo of a person's greatest memory of a loved one, by the fishing poles that you could actually catch a soul mate with, and past the pitted and rusted pocketwatches that would let you show up on time, no matter what. She pointed at the beaded curtain near the back. `` So how about that?'' 
 
 `` Ah, yeah. About that. That's where we keep the cursed items for karmically appropriate punishments.'' At her raised eyebrow, I hurried to explain. `` Like if a guy abuses animals, he gets a teddy bear that gives him nightmares -- like, severe. We've got some needlepoint hangings for the religiously intolerant. A really nice cookware set that makes everything taste like baby wipes.'' 
 
 `` Who's that for?'' 
 
 `` Aggressive drivers.'' 
 
 `` Get outta town.'' 
 
 `` No, seriously. So it's pretty easy -- people come in here, they're looking for the'one perfect thing,' right? Now, you do n't have to do a thing. The store'll guide them to whatever it is they deserve, and it always looks like what they think they need, okay? So really, all you got ta do is be able to work a POS. Sound good?'' 
 
 She nodded. The little bell over the door clanged, and we turned to see a well-dressed man shouting about `` climate change hoaxes.'' He held up a finger to us and kept shouting into the phone. I turned to Meg. 
 
 `` Show time, kid.''
