 I was so excited, this was my first inter-galactic jump! What would have took millions and millions of U-Years would only take half an U-Hour! I loved it, so much more exciting than a Maglev! It was also my first time inside a Photon Boom, which is when our craft hits other light particles and makes a layer of photons. 
 
 So, the journey from Andromeda to Milkia only took a short amount of time. But, we soon arrived to Terra. It was a small world, but damn it was important. The first space-faring civilisation started here, aswell it was quarter my home from my grandfather's side. 
 
 Did I mention I was a Homo-Orchio-sapien-discusuip-jarodoid? Basically, i am a quarter Terran, Snek, BiDrie and Android. 
 
 We landed at Luna, Terra's moon. The Terrans artificially put other moons in orbit from Saturn and Jupiter, such as Titan, Encaledus and Europa, but Luna was it's only natural one. We was about to witness the first ever Photoreactor, and man it was going to be a great show.....
