God: I do n't know'Shrugs shoulders' 
 
 Man: What do you mean you do n't know? You created us. You created everything that existed, exists now and will exist. So how do you not know what happens when we die. 
 
 God: Honestly... I kinda forgot that part of the system before I flipped the switch and all that. The system did n't crash and death seemed to be doing it's thing. Ive kinda been trying to find out where you guys went after since. 
 
 Black Plague, earthquake, tsunamis and all that. I was running experiments see. Number of deaths, method of dying, they were some of the variables I was using. Sorry about the dinosaurs though.'Smiles sheepishly' that test went abit too far. 
 
 Man: Have you at least had some success? 
 
 God:'Stares at Man. Stunned' Define success...
