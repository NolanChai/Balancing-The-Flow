Groggy, I opened my eyes. I must have fallen down a flight of stairs at school, because my right knee is all busted up, and bleeding. 
 
 `` Jack!'' yelled a boy with blonde hair, and brown eyes, and large glasses from the'90s. `` What are you doing? How did you fall down the stairs? Are n't you coming to the lunch room?'' 
 
 What the fuck? Where am I? Why the hell am I holding a R.I Stine lunch bag? I push myself to knees and suddenly it hit me. My eyesight was... *normal*. My knee was bleeding but I did n't feel that gnawing pain in back that had been there for nearly a decade. 
 
 `` Holy SHIT!'' I yelled. The boy took a step back and pointed his paint-smeared finger at me. `` Wh... why did you say that!?! I'm gon na tell on you!!'' He ran down the hall into the lunch room and pulled a lunch monitor to the side and was whispering furiously to her. Time to make myself scarce. If I remember correctly, there was a bathroom right around the corn... 
 
 `` Jack!'' says a feminine voice that had lost itself in the etched memories of my hippocampus. `` Umm... Ms... I can explain, I was running down the stairs and I tripped and fell. I did n't mean to, I promise!'' I hastily backed up into the wall. 
 
 `` Honey, your knee is bleeding all over the place! Let's get you to the nurses office.'' She kindly led me by the hand down the sloped white concrete hallway filled with kids posters, Christmas decorations and large block letters that denoted every teacher's classroom in 72 point font. 
 
 After having my knee wrapped up, I look at my Shark-brand kids watch and realized it had a date - December 17th. Ok... if I am in Brissilion Elementary, that makes this... 1996. Oh crap. Is this really happening? You mean I have to go through another nine years of school? Well, at least I seem to remember everything from the... *future*. I shudder, this ca n't be happening. I can not be going through this period of my life again.
