MICHAEL: `` So last night, I saw this show called `` Undercover Boss'' where bosses go undercover in their companies to see what's wrong with the company. Well I tried looking up how to get on the show, but I got tired and fell asleep. But, this morning when I woke up, I decided to be the `` Undercover Boss'' and make my own episode.'' 
 
 MICHAEL turns around and hunches over, then spins back around with a doo-rag on his head. 
 
 MICHAEL: `` My name's Prison Mike, and I'm really thankful for Dunder Mifflin giving me a second chance since I got out of the pen.''
