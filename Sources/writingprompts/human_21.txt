During his final day on Earth, as his wife, family, relatives and close friends all hurdled around the bed that had been his companion for a month, the dying man sighed a breath of relief. He had no regrets in life and was content with the way life treated him. In that space of ten seconds, ten thousand thought processes went through his head. He had given his final words to everyone in the crowd and there was nothing left to say. Of course he had his moment of ups and downs, feelings of insecurity and depression, but `` look at me now!'' he thought, `` few can brag about being surrounded by many close people on their deathbed''. And as he prepared himself for what is about to come next, his wife suddenly broke the silence. 
 
 `` Yes, it's true.'' 
 
 The old man weakly turned to look to his wife and asked: `` What's true?'' 
 
 `` Your suspicion. Your suspicion you have had all through your life time. Your-'' 
 
 `` Stop it mum, do n't say anything else further,'' warned one of their sons. 
 
 `` No, I ca n't keep holding it any longer. He's about to die for god's sake! It's the least I can do, to tell him the truth!'' 
 
 `` Oh yeah, because telling him the truth when he is about to die is better than telling him earlier, last year, decades ago, 50 years ago,'' said their son. 
 
 `` Yeah mum, just let it rest,'' said their daughter in a melancholy tone. The rest of the crowd murmured their agreement. 
 
 `` No, I have to tell him the truth,'' she said firmly. `` Listen honey, that thought you were just thinking of, briefly, just one minute ago, it's true, it's all true!'' she cried out. 
 
 But it was too late. He never did get to hear her final words. In fact, he did n't want to hear what she has to say, because ignorant is bliss, which is one of his favourite motto in life. And as he drifted into the abyss, the crowd joined his wife in tears as they hear his very last words.
