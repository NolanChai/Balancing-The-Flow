`` It's for her own good...'' the man with cold eyes said. 
 
 `` You're a monster!'' I replied. I was with children protective services, my agency had heard a rumor of a local psych ward'rehabilitating' an abused child. 
 
 `` You do n't understand,'' the cold eye'd man replied, `` the orphanage we saved her from was... sick.'' 
 
 I stared at him, waiting for him to say something that could possibly justify what he was doing do this poor little girl. 
 
 The man sighed and closed his eyes, when he opened them they were glazed. A tear began to roll down his cheek. `` When the kids were bad... they put them in timeout by making them sit in a corner... timeout was the only time they were safe from the abuse so they eventually began to see corners as a safe haven. They would sit in the corner to pretend to be in time out, sleep in the corner.. anything they could..'' 
 
 I looked at the small girl through the one way glass. She was frantically dashing around her circular confines, wailing like a banshee.
