Dear Diary, 
 
 I sigh and look around this pigsty of a room and an all too familiar thought crosses my mind, I was n't bad enough to deserve this... I mean, yea it's better than that lake of fire I saw while I was down there but the Devil must have been having a bout of inspiration when he decided on my punishment. Hell truly is other people it seems and my new twin Mick is my own personal hell. 
 
 Let me back up a moment. I have decided to being keeping this diary to try and maintain what little sanity I have left so let's start with the beginning, ny name is Nick and I'm 7 years old. Well, 7 in this retelling of my life. You see I died 7 years ago and found my soul hellbound for my sins in life. I was n't a horrible person, in fact I did n't even really think I bothered much of anyone while I was alive which is why I rejected it when I was sent to hell. It was Sloth that did me in if you're wondering. No grand sin to damn me, just a million tiny greivances gained over a lifetime that added up to a one way ticket down below ( Well two way in my case... kinda ). In retrospect I kind of get it. I never recycled, bothered to call to cancel appointments, I would drive the speed limit in the passing lane and procrastinated like I was getting paid for it. Hell, even putting my story to page now I ca n't be bothered to fix any of the typos or grammatical mistaked that might pop up ( SOrry grammar nazis ). Although I would say for a 7 year old I'm doing allright. 
 
 Anyways back to Mick, my `` new'' twin, or more accurately the embodiment of **MY** slothful nature. You see, I did n't accept that I belonged in hell for my petty crimes. I could n't imagine my tiny thoughtless slights of people over the years could possibly add up to an eternity of hellfire but ho-LY **FUCK** was I wrong! It's only been about a year since my mind has resurfaced from that pre-child sludge from which we all must crawl and I'm already considering killing one of us. This fucker... Mick... he's just so... UGH I do n't even have words for how insufferable he is. The little monster manages to shit all over the toilet seat and leave it for someone else to clean up and the task has now fallen to me because my parents ca n't tell us apart so I've got 50-50 odds for catching an ass whopping on his behalf if I do n't clean up after him. 
 
 And it's only been getting worse. He eats everything, he never puts anything away, and he copies over my save files on the ~~n~~ Nintendo. He even steals my friends instead of going out and making his own. It's like I spend every waking hour of my life cleaning up after this little monster and for what? Supposedly if I can drag this freak through life with grace and dignity I can absolve my sins and go to heaven but there's one little hangup in that it was Lucifer who made this promise. Yea, prince of lies and all that. Ugh and knowing how things are going now I am NOT looking forward to puberty... cleaning up his... ugh... 
 
 I know I'll never escape him and seeing how successful this torture is I'm sure a suicide will only warrant a reset of this hell. Give me strength diary, I'm going to go and eat the easter egg I stashed under my mattress. So help me god it had better still be there.
