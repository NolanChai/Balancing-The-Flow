Marge walked from one and of the hallway to the other. Step. Step. The sound echoed. Nearer and nearer the other side of the hallway got. Her eyes were fixated on what was on the other side. Closer and closer the other side of the hallway came. It invited her in, like a tongue inviting a fly to come into a beak. She could hear her own breath, as she could feel the blood rushing to her ears. One by one she passed the windows on either side, the light of day hurting her eyes as it came rushing in. Step. Step. The sound changed, growing louder as she picked up pace. The windows came floating by. One by one. There were no noises, all lay quiet, the city hold its breath during these unusually hot summer's days. As she neared the end of the hallway, shadows drew up on her. Again the sound of her footsteps changed, being muffled by the architecture of the old building around her. 
 
 Then she finally reached the end of the hallway. 
 
 She opened the door. 
 
 And left this part of the building behind her...
