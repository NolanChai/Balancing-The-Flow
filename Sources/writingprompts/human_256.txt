He had followed me for months. I'd watched him follow me. He thought he was sneaky. He was n't. 
 
 He was average height, nothing exciting. He was below average in looks, too. His dull green eyes drooped slightly, his nose hooked heavily. He had ears too small for his head, and he had a weak jawline that was contributed by the fat that enveloped his body. 
 
 I had been able to keep an eye on him. His mannerisms, his treatment of others. He was so kind to people, I had watched him buy a poor little kid a new ice cream after he dropped his. Of course he bought himself one, and he ate it messily. He always ate messily. I do n't think it was intentional though. 
 
 As I started to watch him, watch me, I dressed more risque, hoping he would come to me sooner. I knew he lusted after me. And god did I lust after him. 
 
 He had been watching me for months, and I had been watching him.
