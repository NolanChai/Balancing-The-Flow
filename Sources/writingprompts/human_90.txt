It happened a year ago, shortly after I was appointed Chief Operating Officer at Boyle & Virgilio, which was, at the time, the second-most prestigious market research firm in the Upper Midwest. I was a hotshot young executive eager to make my mark, so I came up with the novel idea of, rather than conducting short, perfunctory interviews with thousands of people, paying extremely close attention to five people. We lost millions. The rest of the Board of Directors saw it as a catastrophe, but hey, life goes on. Sorry, did you want the combo meal or just the burger?
