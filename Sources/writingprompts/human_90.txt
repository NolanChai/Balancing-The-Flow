`` It's insane,'' the security guard said. `` People should n't live that long. It goes against the natural order of things.'' 
 
 I looked at the asshole. I was to be sentenced for execution in two days, and here he is telling me he does n't want to live too long. 
 
 Of course, I knew what he was talking about. The pill was incredibly potent; even consuming a tenth of the powder could extend your lifespan by eighty years. Ten of those blasted things were in my pocket - but it did n't work for executions. Completely useless. 
 
 The guard brought me for dinner early, and I sat down in front of my usual wall, without the least bit appetite. I took out the pills and observed them, making sure there was n't anyone around. Nope. It would be five minutes before the first wave of people came in, but it was alright with me. I lost count of the times I was beaten up in this cookhouse for looking at someone wrong. This dinner was like a pity thing for people slated for execution. Maybe if I took all of them, I could defy death completely, but I did n't fancy living that long in jail. Then again, it probably would n't happen. I sighed. 
 
 I watched the cookhouse server head to the kitchens to get more food. I swirled my cup of water around, spit in it and walked over to the unattended soup bowl, pouring everything in. The cook never knew a thing. I went back to my cell as the cookhouse doors opened, prisoners moving to get food. On my way, I made sure to discard the emptied capsules.
