*Did he not wash off this plate? No, of course not. The ketchup is dried and stuck to the damn plate, and whatever bread-covered thing he ate is seemingly glued to the porcelain as well. * 
 
 *And, oh look, wonderful, great! He drank milk and did n't wash it out, love the look of sour solidified dairy in the bottom of a cup. I ca n't even reach the bottom. * The dull white ring looked up like an O from the bottom of the glass. *It's Hell, alright, not even providing something that can reach down tall glasses. * 
 
 *And here's another mac and cheese crusted pot, not set in hot water to soak. For fuck's sake... He's Lucifer and all, but damn dude, all you have to do is fill it with warm soapy water. Would make my life helluva easier! * 
 
 *Sucha' lazy piece of shit, he is. No wonder God casted him ou—* 
 
 `` Oh, hello Lord, how are you?'' I said to the towering, cloven-hoofed giant looking over my shoulder. 
 
 `` Did you finish yet? We're outta' plates, and I just invited everyone over for pizza.'' He asked sternly. 
 
 `` No, not yet, sorry, I'm so very sorry. I'll do some plates now and have them out on the drying rack here soon.'' 
 
 `` Good.'' He turned and left, leaving charred rings in the marble floor. 
 
 *I'd love to ram his damn plates down his throat and watch him die slowly. And his stupid friends, other demons from dumb places that no one even know existed. In'Pher? That's not even a damn planet. Oblivion? Does anyone even go there, ever? And what about Limbo? A middle-man, just a middle-man, why even have a ruler there, really? * 
 
 *Another bowl covered in dried out oatmeal! GOD DAMMIT! Fuck this place, fuck him, fuck everything! I'm done! I'm quitting! I rather be pronged and raped by a dozen demons that have to grind away at a bowl for the next hour because he could n't just wash it out before setting it in the sink! I'm ou—* 
 
 `` Those plates washed yet?'' He said from the door, his head leaning in, his massive ebony horns scrapping the yellowing tiled ceiling. 
 
 `` Almost done, Lord. Just a minute or two!'' 
 
 I looked back down at the murky soapy water that reached up to my elbows and let out a seething sigh. 
 
 *God, I hate this place. *
