As a successful business man many keep asking me how i did it. I tell them what they want to hear and who can really blame me? Ive got to keep up appearances after all. It would n't do to drop the ball after this long. I had to push my way through the crowd to stand out and rise above. To say it just takes a bunch of hard work is only half of the story. My father was a silly and simple man, i see why mother left him. The trick was to not let anything phase me. Dont get complacent and let people drag you down. I had to start young too. I did everything i had to get where i am. It was just best to use anyone that would readily use me. Everyone tried to use me. It was easy.
