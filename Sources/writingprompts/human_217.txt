`` Xandi you may speak your case'' Shrl of the High Council spoke in a booming voice. 
 `` Your hounours, the Earthlings are not worth destroying, they could prove useful to our cause, they have found a way to detect our gravitational wave cannon, if we could figure out how, we would have less of a resistance'' Xandi spoke confidently, though it was a losing battle. `` The abuse their resources, we could harvest the planet more efficiently than they every could'' the High Council objected. `` I suppose but they learn quickly, we might be able to teach them something to get them to follow us'' Xandi's reasoning was slowly running dry. `` Why do you continue to protect these futile beings?'' The Council spoke in unison. `` I do not believe in galactic conquest but obliterating the competition, we should attempt to reason with them'' Xandi played his final, hopeless card. `` We appreciate your efforts but they were fruitless, we will destroy the earthlings.'' The High Council adjourned the meeting, and Xandi left in disgrace. He was walking through the Grand Halls as he ran across his colleague Qualque. `` No luck?'' Qualque asked. `` No, send the signal, let's hope the Earthlings can understand it''
