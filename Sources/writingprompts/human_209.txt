I checked the doors, the windows, the crawlspace. Everything sealed shut. The door was locked. BANG. BANG. BANG. The killer was desperately trying to get in. I pushed against an entertainment center, inching against the door. As it slid to become a barrier, I felt a horrible, nagging feeling that something was off as the banging suddenly stopped. I redoubled my efforts and finally the heavy furniture was blocking the door. He would n't be able to open it! That is what I thought anyway, until i realized he found my spare key under the welcome mat and the lock turned. Even worse, my front door swung outward instead of in and the entertainment center was only three feet tall.
