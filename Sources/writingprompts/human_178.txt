`` Father, what have you done?'' 
 
 The old man lay half asleep on the royal bed. He turned toward his son, heir to the throne and gave a small smile. 
 
 `` It's always been like this.'' 
 
 `` The wild men are in open rebellion! The hunter's guild is falling apart due to lack of support! Beasts slay our people wherever they go! The bandits you once kept under check now run rampant! The forbidden arts have been rediscovered! The magic academy has declared independence from the kingdom! I've found three of my cousins plotting to take the throne for themselves!'' 
 
 `` Yes, as it always has been.'' 
 
 `` Since when? What happened to the era of peace and prosperity I grew up in? My brothers and sisters, once happy are now scattered across the kingdom working their hardest despite this to keep peace. And you're here sleeping the day away!'' 
 
 `` I'm dying, boy. This land has always had rebellions and chaos. I'd united the kingdom for the first time in centuries, and rightly been hailed a hero. But with my ailing health I ca n't protect this peace anymore. Now it falls to you boy. Take up my sword, gather those loyal to the kingdom and reunite this land.'' 
 
 `` Since when does an heir need to conquer his own kingdom?'' 
 
 `` A prince does n't, but a hero fights evil, and you've got a lot of evil to deal with. Starting with the one before you. I may be in failing health, but even the most neglectful king would n't have given you the challenge you deserve.'' 
 
 `` Father?'' 
 
 `` I drained money from the hunter's guild and road patrols to allow the brigands and beasts to return. I implemented laws treating the barbarians and magi as an underclass to inspire rebellion. I forbid necromancy and ensured the kingdom would not be prepared for its return. I have done all this to ensure your kingdom is your own, united by your own hand and not simply given to you.'' 
 
 `` You've gone mad!'' 
 
 `` I've always been mad, only a madman would try to unite this land. The question it whether you're mad enough to do it again. But first, put me out of my misery boy. I would rather die to a blade than to this wretched illness.'' 
 
 The prince took the enchanted sword from the wall, and looked at the figure prone in the bed. The man had indirectly destroyed his entire world, taken all that was good from his life save for the wealth of the capital city, and isolated him from all the family he knew. But he was still his father. The prince could n't bring himself to slay the crazy old man, even at his own request. He set out to reunite the kingdom, whether it wanted to be whole or not.
