In this very undeveloped populated village that is rich with traditions and rituals, at birth everyone is given a clay cup. It's possibility the only thing that is not made out of soft animal skin. If your cup breaks or get lost, it's as if a significant other has passed away. 
 
 Just today my cup has broke into many unrecoverable pieces. I panicked. How am I going to ever drink in public again? I am pretty much dead to my family. This cup may have been around for hundreds of years. How could I let everyone down? Nobody knows how to make clay, except for the well respected Makers of Cups who of course keeps this a secret. I have no choice, I have to steal someone's cup. I am sorry, so very sorry, but my happiness comes first. I picked up the sharpest piece of clay, hid it on me, then I buried the rest of my shame. 
 
 I am outside of a funeral that's taken place inside, I know a child has died but I have no relation to him. I do know that when someone gets buried their cherished cup gets taken away to be given to the next generation except when the blood line ends. It is favorable for me that a child who has a living father passed away. At the end of the funeral, everyone but the father leaves to their homes. The father morns the son's early death by being the last person to see the cup before he drops it in with his son. Before that happens I need to steal the cup. 
 
 After I killed the father and stole the cup, I felt relieved. A weight has been taken off of me. I folded the adult sized body so it can fit in a deep hand made hole in the ground made for a child. I buried the shard that has been with me in life until now deeper into the body, I buried the bodies with dirt then I escaped. I have no regrets. I took good care of my very own hard earned cup, had some very fond memories with it until I died happy with friends and family by my side.
