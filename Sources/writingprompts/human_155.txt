`` It was only one picture Donna! Plus I do n't even know where it came from!'' I tried to justify the picture that covered her computer screen. She was n't buying it. I was n't even at the party. 
 `` Fuck you John,'' her voice began to tremble, and a single year fell from her eye, `` you said you loved me.'' She was gone. Where did this awful image come from? It was me grabbing that woman's breast, but I had a look on my face as if I did n't know any better. I knew the woman in the picture though. I felt like I could run to her house faster than I could drive. As if my effort to accelerate was futile. 
 Laptop in hand, I brushed past the door, into the pictured woman's house. 
 `` What the hell is this? Where the fuck did this come from?'' I asked. 
 My mouth grew numb and my brain did n't register what was going on. She simply grabbed my arm and insisted that I sat down. 
 `` There's something I need to show you John...'' She spoke as she left the room. She brought back a box of baby pictures, each one was of me. Thirty three years ago. 
 `` Where are these from mom?'' I stammered 
 `` They're your baby pictures honey.''
