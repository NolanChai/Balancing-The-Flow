Mark's head cocked back, snapping the bones in his neck back into place. Jessica hit him pretty hard, but not nearly hard enough to kill an immortal. 
 
 `` So, Jess, what... uh... what was that for?'' 
 
 A look of shock came over Jessica. *But... that would have killed you... * she thought. 
 
 Mark grinned, as if reading her mind. `` It would've killed a *normal person*.'' 
 
 Jessica's awe became anger, as she began to repeatedly strike Mark with a lead pipe, each hit harder than the last. She screamed as his blood splattered all over him. 
 
 `` Why! Wo n't! You! Die!'' 
 
 Mark snatched the pipe from her and bent it in half. 
 
 `` My question is, why, Jess? I thought you loved me?'' 
 
 `` I never loved you! I hate you! I just want your money!'' 
 
 Mark looked hurt. All he wanted was love. 
 
 `` Is that why you took out the insurance policy? You wanted to kill me?'' 
 
 `` Exactly, Mark! There's two million dollars in it for me!'' 
 
 Sighing, Mark sat down and hung his head. 
 
 `` You know, you're not the first to try this. To be exact, you're the twenty third.'' 
 
 `` Twenty third?'' 
 
 `` Yep. Every time I fall in love, murderous intent. In fact, you're the second person to use a lead pipe. A for effort, I suppose.'' 
 
 Jessica stood, mouth agape. `` How did the others do it?'' 
 
 `` Everything. Knives, guns, ramming me with a car, keeping me locked in a basement without food or water for twenty years, sarin gas, lighting me on fire and pouring gas on me for a whole hour, you name it. My life is a joke.'' 
 
 Tears began rolling down Mark's face. He stood and went to his bag, and pulled out an ornate box. Inside, a neon red dagger. 
 
 `` This dagger is the only thing that can end my life. I was saving it for the end of the world.'' 
 
 Mark hands Jessica the dagger, his tears coating the red blade. 
 
 `` If you resent me enough to kill me, here's your chance. If my life is meaningless to you, end it.'' 
 
 Jessica clutched the silken handle, unsure of what to do. The seconds felt like centuries. 
 
 `` Well?'' 
 
 She dropped the dagger, and stared down at it. 
 
 `` No. I do n't want to be like everyone else. You deserve a good life, with someone other than me.'' 
 
 Mark nodded, and a soft smile crept across his face. 
 
 `` Thank you.'' 
 
 With that, Mark turned to leave. He pondered his decisions, and thought about what to do next. 
 
 **shik** 
 
 Blood poured from the gaping hole in his chest. Before he blacked out, he turned to see Jessica with the dagger. In his dying breath, one word escaped his mouth. 
 
 `` *Why? *''

 A sad end for our humble protagonist. Do n't worry, an alternate ending is in the works. As always, you can find more of my work at /r/Picklestasteg00d.
