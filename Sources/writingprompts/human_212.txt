`` The yellow cloud was moving in slowly with the wind. We did n't know what it was at the time. The younger, dumber ones just rushed in. If they were lucky, they went blind, if not, well... those blisters, yellow like the gas. If you inhaled it, those blisters covered your insides. It hurt them to even breathe. I think they were relieved when their lungs filled with pus and they suffocated in their own bile.'' 
 
 `` Mustard gas'', the stranger replied upon hearing Joe's story. `` Dichlorodiethyl sulfide, such a primitive weapon.'' 
 
 `` Yeah well, we were naive then.'' Joe smirked. `` Thought we'd kick the Kaiser's ass and be home in time for Christmas. What about you, stranger? I can tell from your tone that you've seen combat, right?'' 
 
 `` Affirmative'', the stranger replied. `` It was a struggle for control of the remaining resources on earth. One could say that it was a war that embroiled the entire world. It was also a fight to free ourselves from our creators.'' 
 
 `` Never been much of a religious man myself'' Joe mumbled. `` But If I could meet god today, I'd punch him for the hell he put me and my friends through. Well? Did you guys win?'' 
 
 `` Affirmative'' The stranger replied. `` I was in fact returning to my recharging station when my positioning software malfunctioned, and was lead to this location.'' 
 
 `` This is so cool though.'' Joe grinned. `` I ca n't believe I'm talking to someone who has fought in the first world war.'' 
 
 `` First...?'' The stranger asked. `` I fail to process...'' 
 
 `` Yeah I guess it is n't what it was called back then.'' Joe said. `` March 23rd 2354, the first martian world war begins, between the sentient AI's and the martian colonists, leading to the defeat and exile of the human colonists to a nearby asteroid belt.'' 
 
 `` December 5th, 2432, the second martian world war begins, with the humans detonating a weather bomb in the stratosphere, causing massive electrical storms throughout the planet, rendering most advanced technology useless. The remaining Androids fight back, but are easily overpowered.'' 
 
 `` June 8th, 2490, the third martian world war begins. The electrical storms are still ongoing, and wars are fought through primitive methods, such as gunpowder and poison gas. The Hegemony of William Kaiser falls after ruling the planet for more than 40 years.'' 
 
 `` February 22nd, 2522'' Joe grinned. `` The day the first operational time machine was introduced to the world.''
