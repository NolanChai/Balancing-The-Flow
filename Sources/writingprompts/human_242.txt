she is mine and I am hers 
 I said aloud in rythym'd verse 
 the question though my thoughts addressed 
 is how could I of this forget? 
 
 you live in a sea of distraction 
 came the answer, the roar of the world 
 asserts itself in the silence of your mind 
 **and you are ours** 
 
 I drift. 
 grey matter and guts hooked in 
 to a rapids of reaction 
 it rushes me away 
 
 my arm reaches out 
 in the middle of noise I find flesh 
 grasping chain to anchor 
 we held on 
 
 safe for now 
 
 she is mine and I am hers 
 I said aloud in rythym'd verse 
 the question though my thoughts addressed... 
 
 remember that 
 please, please 
 remember that
