Hmm... this is still on my front page ten hours later... Should I post something on it? Eh probably, I'll just close reddit. *closes reddit, puts phone down* I wonder what's on reddit. *open reddit up* damn it this prompt is sticking around like herpes. You know what? Fuck it. You really want to know what I'm thinking about writing on this prompt? 
 It's a clear yet unique way to Karam whore... u/sn0wd0wzer I both commend you for this and hate you for keeping such a boring prompt on my front page for so long. 
 
 Not often I reply... wonder what I should do know, maybe play solitaire... na I'll get back on reddit. FUCK IT'S STILL THERE.
