It was early, no sound over the radio as the alarm woke me. Strange I thought until I seen it. I glanced over at where the light would usually sit. It was red today. I do n't think I ever remember it being red. With the indication of the light I opened the cupboard and got dressed into my suit for the occasion and left my room to go down the corridor. There was no one else awake and the hallway was colder than normal which made me shiver. At the end of the hallway I opened the outer door and proceded into the 2 way lock. Finally getting outside I could see the Earth below me.I knew it was finally over. I could go home.
