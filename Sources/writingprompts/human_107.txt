John is a simple man. 
 
 He wakes up at 6:00. It's early, but it's okay. John does n't mind. 
 
 John brushes his teeth, drinks his coffee, and puts on his clothes. He prepares himself a slice of toast, and butters it. John likes toast. 
 
 He eats his toast, and kisses his wife ( who has now come out from their room, yawning ) goodbye before heading out the door. 
 
 John gets to work and starts working immediately. Being a construction worker is hard, but John does n't mind. It pays the bills. 
 
 John works until noon, when he goes for lunch at a diner. The diner is owned by a man named Tom. John likes Tom, and Tom likes John. They talk, and laugh. 
 
 John goes back to work at 12:45 and works until eight. As he walks back, he decides to get a flower for his wife. John thinks his wife will like the flower. 
 
 John comes home, and gives the flower to his wife. She loves it. They prepare and eat dinner together. The food used for it is n't good, but it's okay because they're together. 
 
 John brushes his teeth, takes a shower and puts on his pajamas. He tells his wife that he loves her and goes to sleep. 
 
 John was a simple man. 
 
 I wish he was still here.
