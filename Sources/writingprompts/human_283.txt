Today was awesome! There was a storm while we were sleeping and a lightning hit right outside the house! The BOOM woke me up, and in the morning there was a long silvery pole, and it was stuck in the ground! I wanted to go play with it, but Daddy would n't let me. About lunchtime, some people in matching clothes came and took it away. I asked Daddy why they took my lightning, he said that the lightning got lost and they were taking it where it was supposed to go. I do n't care, I want it back!

 I went looking for the lightning today. There were a lot of people like the ones who took my lightning, so I asked one where the lightning was. He said that lightning was in the sky. I said I was n't looking for any old lightning, I was looking for MY lightning. He made me take him back to Daddy, and Daddy made me go to my room while they talked. Afterwards Daddy said I could n't bother the men with funny clothes, they were busy. That's mean, I just want my lightning!

 Today, there was one of the men in my school, they were telling all of us to stay inside when we were n't at school and to come tell one of them if we saw anything weird. I asked him if it was weird for lightning to get stuck in the ground, he just smiled at me and said it was n't, but I should n't touch it. I've never seen lightning get stuck before though, so it must be weird, the grown-ups just do n't want me to play with lightning!

 Today was scary. A lot of houses burnt down, and all in a line too. My little sister saw it, and she said that there was a red light that set fire to everything and went in a line from the sky. I asked Daddy what that was and he said it was a star that got too low and brushed against the sky. I'm scared now, what if another star falls and lands on our house?

 There were a lot more of the funny men in weird clothes today, they were going everywhere. I asked one of them if he was looking for lightning, he said no. He said he was looking for a Soulless. He asked me if I'd seen one. I gave him a rock and said it did n't have a soul, and he hit me! He said I'd wasted his time and he made me take him to Daddy and Daddy made me go to my room again and then Daddy told me I ca n't go outside because I was bothering the men, but I helped him! I asked Daddy what a Soulless was, and he said it was a monster that goes around in the night looking for people to eat, but that if I stay inside after dark I'm safe. He said the funny men are like police for monsters and they lock them up so they do n't eat people. Police are nicer though.

 There was a lot more lightning last night, I did n't sleep at all! In the morning, there were lightning bolts scattered all over the town, one totally smashed the house next to us! I tried to go out and get one, but Daddy caught me and would n't let me go outside. I asked my little sister to get some, but one of the funny men brought her back crying. Daddy was mad at both of us, he made us go to our rooms for hours! But the funny men did n't get all the lightning, they missed the one that landed far off behind the backyard. Tonight, when Daddy's asleep, I'm going to go get it!

 I hurt all over, but I have a lightning! When Daddy went to bed, I snuck out the back door he never closes all the way and ran to where the lightning was. It was a long way, but I made it. There was n't a lightning though, just a hole in the ground. I guess the funny men found it after all. I was going to go back home but I ran into a man in a costume! He was wearing these black spiky clothes so you could barely see him in the dark, and he looked like a giant sort of. I asked him why he was dressed like that, he said it was so he could be sneaky because he was playing hide-and-seek. He asked me if I wanted to meet his friends and I asked him if he knew where I could find a lightning and he said he did! He said if I went with him we could go to where the lightning comes from and I could get all the lightning I wanted! Now I'm in a big city and he gave me a lightning and it hurt but he said that the lightning bonded to me and now it's mine forever! Tomorrow he's going to bring my little sister and Daddy here and they can get lightning's too and the food is great and the beds are really soft and I'm tired so I'm going to sleep now.
