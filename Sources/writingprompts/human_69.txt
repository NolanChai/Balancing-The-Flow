My daughter is a creative little bugger, no doubt about it. She gets it from her mom, definitely not me. Her room is filled with pages from her favorite coloring books, and her pre-school art projects. She loves her cartoons, and that's where a majority of my bonding time with her comes on. We both love watching cartoons. Anything funny, anything sad, we both share the same favorite shows, which is a rarity for a father and daughter. 
 
 One night before we went to bed, we decided to watch Pokemon: The First Movie on television. One of my favorites, as its something I grew up with and know plenty about. She loves listening to my long-winded explanations, which is great, because my wife does n't. Now, I've never looked at that movie as a horror film before, but in the eyes of a 4 year old little girl, Mewtwo is horrifying. She shifted uncomfortably through the whole movie, and cried her little eyes out when Ash was turned to stone. She spent most of the movie with her face buried in my chest, but when I offered to change it, she would n't let me. `` No, daddy, I'm having fun, its just scaaaary.'' I knew from that point that getting her to bed that night would n't be fun. 
 
 `` Daddy! Come quick!'' There was plenty of alarm in her voice. `` I think I hear something under my bed!'' I rush into the room, knowing that she's probably still a bit frightened from the movie. 
 
 `` Everything will be fine, I'm sure there's nothing there.'' I reach under the bed and reach around, searching for anything under the bed that might be making a noise to frighten her, when suddenly I find a jacket. She stifles a giggle, but not quite well enough, because I notice. `` What're you laughing at?'' 
 
 `` Daddy, look in the pocket!'' I reach my hand into the old jacket, and pull out a small action figure, of Mew, the Pokemon from the movie. `` Its a Pocket Monster!'' She laughs maniacally and points at me. `` I GOT YOU GOOD!'' She's a genius in her own mind. 
 
 `` Goodnight, sweety.'' I kiss her on the forehead and leave her alone to her laughter, and eventual sleep.
