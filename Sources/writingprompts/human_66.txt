 It was the morning of September the 2nd 2014, I was sitting across from him as he had his mind troubled about the out of town meeting he had later on that night. His thoughts got interrupted with her tender slow kiss on the back of his neck and on his cheek as she smiled and prepared breakfast for the kids. There he is I thought to myself, my job for the day, there's his family and here's everything that he has and everything that he wakes up to every morning. 
 
 Proud as he was from what happened from the meeting and how managed to get in the new clients for the company as that was the big foot in the door he desperately needed with his new boss he went out for drinks in the hotel bar with his co-workers and Aurelia. Before I knew it while I was sunk in my thoughts about Emelia, how she always tugged his tie to spend half a minute with him for one last kiss. Suddenly, I looked up and I here it was, Aurelia in the hallway with her black tight dress exposing her shoulders and neck with him standing in-front of her. He was a loyal old-fashioned man, but I knew what should be done as I whispered in his ear to steal the quickest glance of her bare smooth neck and shoulders as he was exchanging some small senseless tipsy talk about the bar setting and there it was Aurelia with her desire for him as she started rhythmically breathing harder for him to fill her emotional void and her attention need for him. He started slowing down the pace and slurring the words as he looked in her eyes and read that the desire being thrown at him, I slowly stood behind him and I knew I could n't use any of my cliches with him, but rather highlight how her shoulders and neck changed their size and shape whenever she took a breath for him and I whirled him in the simple fantasy of her sweet scent on his mouth and lips in the room behind the door she was leaning on. They both went silent and he stared for what seemed like forever even to me, as I saw him still and not backing away when she approached his face with hers, I knew I no longer did n't need to be there. 
 
 I never wanted to see Emelia like this, she was his home for 5 years. There she was back at her sister's apartment on the ground alone, silently shivering and tearing up on how her life would never be the same after what he did, I watched as I repeated in my head `` it was his choice it was his choice it was his choice''.
