His mouth was agape. `` This should n't be possible...'' The charts on the screen seemed nearly miraculous. The experiment had been repeated. Sure it turned all of neuroscience on it's ear, but it worked, every time. But Dr. Kindshauer sat there awed at the prospect of a cure. He rose to his feet and walked closer to the screen, as if the data might change if he changed his perspective. `` But the losses, are they permanent,'' He asked, fully realizing the answer to the come. 
 
 `` Selective Neurological Triage Therapy causesâ€”,'' One of the researchers started. 
 
 `` Is the memory loss permanent,'' he adamantly interrupted. 
 
 The lead researcher, Dr. Woods, understood the question and sheepishly replied, `` Yes.'' 
 
 For a moment the air seemed thick with tension. The certainty of a cure for Alzheimer's was all at once as gratifying as it was abhorrent. The conference room at the CDC was deathly quiet. The holy grail of neuroscience was within the grasp of doctors and scientists everywhere, but the victory was the most pyrrhic of all. Complete loss of affected memory. There was no therapy, there was no recovery, just a portion of the brain so lost it was as if it never existed. 
 
 Kindshauer walked slowly walked back to his seat at the head of the conference table and slumped into his seat, the implications of the discovery weighing down his normally larger than life presence. He thought of all the review his teams had done. It was safe, effective, and repeatable. It had all the hallmarks of a miracle cure. One simple injection of a synthesized protein into the base of the skull could halt all progress of the disease within the week. 
 
 `` How soon can the treatment be mass produced,'' Kindshauer slowly asked, realizing the implicit approval in the words. 
 
 `` Given the FDAs involvement along all stages due to the testing requirements, we could have approval in two months and be at full scale production in six,'' a pharmaceutical executive replied, nearly wringing his hands at the prospect of the profits to be had. 
 
 Kindshauer knew the facts were too conclusive, and the costs to great not to move forward. He spoke his next words slowly. `` You have my approval.'' His thoughts briefly flashed to his wife at home; her being unable to remember him or their two daughters on her worst days. `` You have my complete approval.''
