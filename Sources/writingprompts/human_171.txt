I remember the first time the sight of another person's tears excited me. I was 8 years old, and my father was leaving my mother for another woman. I watched through a crack in the living room door as he berated her, telling her it was her own fault. She'd failed to lose the baby weight, she was no longer attractive, she was the reason they had n't had sex in a year. 
 
 
 I should have felt bad for my mother, but her tears made me feel like I was at the top of the world. Whenever I heard her crying in her bedroom, I would stand in the doorway and watch. When she noticed me, she would pull me into a hug which would kill my high, so I'd push her away and tell her I wanted to live with Dad and Sarah to make her cry harder. Eventually it was n't enough just to see her cry. 
 
 
 At the age of 14 I came home from school one day and found her in the bathtub, pills scattered on the floor. She was still alive, and I had the choice to save her. I chose not to. Instead I waited for my younger brother to come home and find her. Watching him scream and beg for her to wake up gave me my biggest buzz yet. My second biggest buzz was at her funeral, where I watched the distraught faces of my grandmother, aunts and uncles. It was hell for them. I was on Cloud 9. 
 
 
 I started to look into situations where I could maintain that same high. Sad films did n't cut it, and it was rare to find people in distress out on the street. I started attending the funerals of strangers, enjoying the thrill I got from their distressed family and friends. I even got a shiver down my spine for the funerals that no one attended, imagining the lonely death of the person whose final resting place would be a pauper's grave. 
 
 
 It was then that I realised what I wanted to do with my life. I trained and found employment as an undertaker. I spent every day feeling that familiar buzz as I'd watch people break down, or stare at a corpse that had been mangled beyond all recognition. 
 
 
 Eventually the tingle dulled, and eventually disappeared. I tried everything to get it back. I `` unintentionally'' insulted grieving customers or tried to have something `` go wrong'' at the funeral to make them feel worse. Nothing. 
 
 
 I eventually gave up. I got married, and my wife gave birth to two beautiful children. 
 
 
 Yesterday, I made a passing comment about my wife's stretch marks. I did n't mean to, and I was about to apologise until I noticed that I had made her cry, and that familiar tingle came back again. I told her she could stand to lose some weight, that it was her fault we never had sex anymore and I should find someone new. 
 
 
 I've never felt so good.
