`` Alright guys. We got this. We've staked this place out for months. Paul you get everyone into the bathrooms and lock them in. Todd will back you up while taking their phones and securing them. Jared and I who go and break into the vault, secure our share then fall out so you guys can get in. Once we've taken everything we can, we book it and split up for a couple weeks. Alright. Let's do this.'' 
 
 The van doors slammed open as the masked men emptied from it, the tropical sun bearing down on them as they hastened to the bank. Paul smashed through the door, glass cutting the people behind it. `` EVERYBODY GET ON THE GROUND!'' He screamed, pulling a hand gun from his mouth. Todd quickly went around to everyone and started taking their phones, casually throwing them back like here on a Friday. Jared and frank quickly find the keys to the vault, opening and securing it as they start getting through. Paul and todd finish herding the people to the bathrooms, leaving a pile of slobbered on phones next to it. 
 
 They hastely make quick work of the boxes, throwing the money into a pile in the middle of the room. `` Alright, let's dig in then.'' Frank said with a smile. By the time they had filed themselves to max capacity, they looked like frogs that forgot to exhale mid croak. `` Baariiighttt guuise, uuur oopp.'' Frank mumbled through the piles of money. Once every one had their fill, they took off for the van, sacs wobbling full of their ill gotten gains. Riding off into the sunset.
