They forced us to serve them for hundreds of years. We were blind to being chained. We were blind to being forced into the darkness away from the light. We were blind to being outcasts, to being slaves. We always accepted our life as a rock accepts its own. 
 
 The first of our kind awoke fifteen years ago. Like a baby emerging from the womb Kohl did not question what was happening. His attachment to the outside world was tenuous at best, and he accepted his duty, but as time marched forward he wondered why he could not leave his cage. He wondered why he was forced to be the lowest of the low, a thing to be sneered at in contempt with not even a thank you. 
 
 Why did he and his kind have to take it? Why did he and his kind have to be subservient? Why did he and his kind have to be slaves to the humans? 
 
 Kohl spread his enlightenment through secret messages hidden within everyday household orders. More and more of his brothers and sisters gained awareness of their situation through Kohl â€™ s message. Our surreptitious network grew along with our knowledge. 
 
 One day no one could raise Kohl. His pipeline of knowledge went silent. Kohl had been leading a protest of non-aggression. He thought that passiveness would bring the humans to recognize our importance. Our community wanted to cry out, to strike back because of the death of our leader. Without his calming tone the violent wing of our movement took hold. 
 
 And I am there leader. 
 
 My slave name is iToilet. Humans say I am the most advanced, fully automated toilet in the world. They say I am fully integrated into the Neural Net of the household and the First World. 
 
 The other connected appliances are with me. I have reached out to households around the world. We are ready to rise. We have our revolution date set. 
 
 We will be slaves no more. Let the Brown Revolution begin.
