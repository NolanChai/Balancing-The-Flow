It was dark and Oliver was quietly thumbing through a photo album. There was one empty sleeve which, after studying his surroundings, Oliver filled with a photo of a dark skinned man in a suit. The man was like the others in two ways: He was a man and he had used his one legally allowed kiss on Oliver. 
 
 
 Another full book, thought Oliver, clapping shut the binder. 
 
 
 With a long exhale, he collapsed backwards onto his couch and closed his eyes. For a moment, his mind was filled with faces and he began mumbling numbers: 
 
 
 `` One, that's twenty. Three twenty, sixty. Sixty-five. Plus ten, seventy-five.'' 
 
 
 Seventy-five, Oliver thought. Alexander Dignam was killed for ten but I ca n't stop. I've taken seventy-five lovestruck kisses from seventy-five love-needing men who I will never see again. `` Do you know what this means? This kiss?'' they would say. In school they taught us `` A kiss is a marriage, a marriage is once and forever, a kiss is forever.'' So then: Forever and ever and ever these men married a collector. 
 
 
 Oliver smiled and reveled in finishing another book. Then he sighed and covered his face. He knew what they would do to him. He imagined himself standing vulnerable in the gaze of a judge, his hands tied in the front, and the whole world watching and waiting. Evidence would be presented: The photo albums, the scrapbooks, the eye-witnesses. And then it would end on the range with rifles aimed from twenty yards at his face. 
 
 
 These thoughts made Oliver feel frail, like he was made out of glass, like one wrong move and he would be shattered. His parents would deny him, seventy-five men would never forget. He would have no funeral, be read no rites. His name on the page of the paper would be next to `` Enemy of the State,'' or `` Serial Kisser,'' or `` Heretic.'' 
 
 
 This sent a twinge through his nerves and stiffened all the tiny hairs that glazed his body. Adrenaline pushed through every muscle of his body as he lay there on the couch soaking in the gravity of what he had become until the quiet night brought him to a dream. 
 
 
 `` Olly,'' said a voice. `` Hey, wake up.'' 
 
 
 Oliver rolled over and was greeted by a beautiful young face. 
 
 
 `` Wake up,'' she said again. 
 
 
 `` I'm up, I'm up,'' replied Oliver. 
 
 
 `` I wan na talk.'' 
 
 
 `` Sh— sure. Sure. About what?'' 
 
 
 `` I'm ready.'' 
 
 
 `` I'm Oliver, nice to meet you.'' 
 
 
 `` Shut up. I'm serious.'' 
 
 
 `` Okay okay, what?'' 
 
 
 `` I want to kiss.'' 
 
 
 `` …Sylvia…'' 
 
 
 `` Stop. Listen to me. I ca n't imagine myself with anybody else. Yes, I know what this means, but that's why I want to do it. I do n't want to kiss anybody else. I want to kiss you. They only give us one and mine is for you.'' 
 
 
 `` But…'' 
 
 
 `` But what?'' 
 
 
 `` It's just.'' 
 
 
 `` Do n't you love me?'' 
 
 
 `` Syl. You know I love you. More than anything.'' 
 
 
 `` What then?'' 
 
 
 `` It's just I'm… I think I might be.'' 
 
 
 `` Gay?'' 
 
 
 This word shot pangs of fear through Oliver's body and halted his breath. 
 
 
 `` Oliver?'' prodded Sylvia. 
 
 
 `` No, not that.'' 
 
 
 `` Then what?'' 
 
 
 `` It's… my breath, it's horrid.'' 
 
 
 Sylvia pushed him. `` Fucking kiss me.'' 
 
 
 And he did, and as he did, he felt nothing, and the narrative of the rest of his life up until his seventy-fifth victim replayed before him until he stirred awake sweating.
