It was a dark, stormy night, the house was dimly lit, and the phone was ringing. With a quiet sigh, a figure rose from the shadows and- 
 
 `` No.'' 
 
... *Rude*? 
 
 `` No, I'll tell you what's rude. What's my name?'' 
 
 Why is this relevant? 
 
 `` Answer the question. What's my name?'' 
 
... Um. 
 
 `` Oh, is n't that *great*! I do n't *have* a name!'' 
 
 Whoa, hey! Do n't sass me in that tone of voice! 
 
 `` What tone of voice? You did n't write one!'' 
 
 That's besides the point. 
 
 `` Are my age, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, height, weight, occupation also all besides the point? Because you failed to write any of those, yet you had the common courtesy to give me great weather. Props.'' 
 
 Look, I'm *sorry*, but we're not there yet. 
 
 `` Not there? Not *where*? Because so far you've managed to establish that it's storming outside and that I'm in a dimly lit house with a ringing phone.'' 
 
 It's called pacing. You would n't understand. You ca n't just dump a bunch of details on the audience when they have n't even gotten two sentences into the st- 
 
 `` Oh, so now you think I'm stupid!'' 
 
 I never said that, but you jump to conclusions way too qui- 
 
 `` No! It's okay. Really. I mean, just because you're the one with the *keyboard*...'' 
 
 Now I remember why I do n't like using writing prompts. Forget it. I'm gon na go make lunch. 
 
 `` Maybe the food will be lucky enough to get some decent description! *Hah*!'' 
 
 *Sigh*.
