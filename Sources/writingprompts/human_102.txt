I stood there with a dollar in my hand, waiting for the cashier to take my money for the potato chips I so badly wanted. It was about two in the afternoon, and the impatience I had was increasing. The dark, blonde musky cashier took my money. His movements pushed a dank smell of cigar smoke my way, and I held my breathe after the first hint of his particles. 
 
 `` Mother fucker, you forgot my fucking chips'', Earl yelled like a child from across the store. I quickly turned around, and regretted ever meeting him. 
 
 `` Bitch, you got no fucking money.'' Immediately, a number popped up above his head. I proceeded to eat him out. Turned out my luck was about to change. A number popped above my head way beyond my own understanding of numbers. I was worth $ 50Tn. `` Holy shit, keep going baby boy. ``, he said grabbing at my head as I ate him out. The cashier clerk began to weep as he noticed what was going on in his store. I turned to him and began to lick the insides of my mouth after eating out my friend. 
 
 `` Yo, dude, you next. ``, I said as I pointed at him with his hard docking dick. We made eye contact. This my friends, is how I became the richest mean girl ever. I watched that movie mean girls, like, three times. I'm the best. I'm the best mean girl ever. I'm the best $ 50Tn mean girl dude ever. Fuck yeah, amen.
