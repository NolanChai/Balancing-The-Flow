`` What the hell is this?'' 
 
 My wife turned her head and looked. `` Chicken souls, looks like.'' She turned back to the frozen nuggets she was examining. 
 
 `` Why the fuck is it glowing?'' 
 
 My wife looked back again. `` I do n't know, babe. It's not in the budget.'' 
 
 `` I'll buy it. I've never had chicken souls before. Is it... actual souls? The literal spirits of chickens?'' 
 
 She looked at me like I was an idiot. `` Okay, get it. What would you even use them for?'' She put two packs of chicken nuggets in the cart and started walking away. 
 
 `` I do n't know. Do you know any recipes with chicken souls?'' I grabbed the bottle and started following her down the aisle while reading the label. The instructions read `` boil 10-15 minutes or until souls stop clucking. Let simmer for 30 minutes.'' 
 
 She stopped, sighed, and turned to face me. Dammit, this was going to be a scene. There was an old lady looking at soup a few feet away who kept glancing at us. 
 
 `` Derek, I've been working 12 hour shifts for the past five days and when I get home I can barely bring myself to cook hamburger fucking helper before I pass out. Then in a few hours I wake up and start the whole fucking thing over again. Please, just forget the chicken souls.'' 
 
 My face started to get red. `` *Sammy*.'' I started. I slowly pushed the chicken souls back on the shelf next to some canned vegetables. `` I know you've been working hard lately. So have I. I was just suggesting something new. There's no reason to --'' 
 
 `` *Derek*.'' She said back, mockingly. `` If you're so sick of my dinners then grow a pair and start making your own food. I do n't have to make anything for you, you know. That's my choice because I know you'd fucking starve yourself if I did n't heat up macaroni and cheese for you like a six year old. I'm not your 1950s trophy wife.'' 
 
 Oh my god, seriously? `` What?'' I said. 
 
 The old woman scurried away past us with her tiny basket of groceries in hand. My wife's eyes followed her. 
 
 `` 1950s trophy wife? Where the hell did that come from?'' 
 
 My wife rolled her eyes and turned away. `` Let's just buy this.'' 
 
 We rolled up to the checkout counter, swiped her credit card, and drove home wordlessly.

 The next day I woke up feeling shitty as I'd ever woken up. My wife left for work earlier than I did, so the bed was already empty. I glanced at her closet and saw everything in disarray. There was a suit jacket hanging off of one end of a hanger and a peacoat crumpled on the ground. I got up and hung them both up straight. 
 
 I sighed and glanced at her jewelry box. It was open, with necklaces hanging out. I noticed a lace bra draped over the table and several earrings missing their partner. She must be wearing the gold chain I got her for her birthday last month. She really liked that necklace. She said she felt `` regal'' wearing it, and that made me smile. 
 
 I picked up her bra and put it into her drawer but there was no way in hell i would mess with her jewelry. 
 
 At work I found myself on edge. When I was nervous like that, though, I was often more productive. I lost myself in the equations and it was n't until 3pm that I realized that I had skipped lunch to finish a project. I saw a flash of long, blonde hair out of the corner of my eye. My boss Jill knocked on my office door. `` Derek?'' 
 
 `` Yo.'' We're casual like that there. 
 
 `` Did you get my email?'' 
 
 I paused and quickly opened a gmail tab on my laptop. `` Oh, there it is. Sorry Jill, I was just finishing the report for this weekend and got a call about an audit around nine so I was focusing and making up for lost time. Did n't mean to ignore you.'' 
 
 `` No it's okay. You seem pissed, though, is everything okay?'' 
 
 I chuckled. `` I seem pissed? A little busy, maybe, but pissed?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, I mean, not on the surface, but you're tense for sure.'' Jill looked concerned. Really, actually concerned. 
 
 Feeling that was refreshing. I could n't remember the last time somebody had actually asked me if I was `` okay.'' Tears welled up in my eyes. 
 
 `` I'm sorry, I just...'' now my arms were shaking. God, I needed to calm down. 
 
 `` Hey. Hey. It's alright, man. Just tell me what's up.'' Jill walked in and closed the door behind her. 
 
 I breathed in deeply. Stopped shaking. `` Sammy is unhappy.'' 
 
 Jill frowned and nodded. She sat down in the chair in front of my desk. 
 
 `` We hardly see each other anymore since she got promoted. She told me the first few weeks would be killer, but I ca n't even go to the grocery store with her without her blowing up about how stressed she is.'' I felt new tears rolling down my cheeks. `` And the reason I even went shopping with her in the first place was to get a little bit more time with her than I would staying at home. But then she was pissed that I was n't able to stay home and clean the place.'' 
 
 Jill nodded again. `` That sucks that she's taking it out on you.'' 
 
 I laughed. `` Yeah.'' 
 
 `` But I mean, it sounds like she knows this is a temporary thing and is just having a hard time getting used to it. It does n't have anything to do with you.'' Jill crossed her legs and leaned forward. 
 
 I breathed deeply and closed my laptop. `` I'm just another burden to her, lately. Everything I do seems to annoy her. That's not what I want. I want to be a respite. I want her to come home and look forward to it. Yesterday she told me she felt like a 1950s trophy wife.'' 
 
 `` Oh, wow.'' 
 
 I shrugged. `` She does make dinners every night. I know that's playing into gender roles and all that but honestly I never eat unless someone reminds me to.'' 
 
 `` Yeah, that's not healthy man.'' 
 
 `` I know.'' 
 
 `` Look, you say that you want to be a respite for your wife. But honestly, do you look forward to going home and being with her? Is she *your* respite?'' 
 
 I opened my mouth but said nothing. She had a point. 
 
 Jill uncrossed her legs and sat up. `` But that does n't mean you're not'happy' with her. That does n't mean you're about to leave her. It just means that you need to work at it. Both of you.'' 
 
 I nodded. 
 
 `` Since you're the one bitching about it, why do n't you make the first step. Stop forcing her to make you dinners. Make your own damn casseroles from now on, and do her grocery shopping for her. If she's doing all the housework then it's not too off-base to feel a little like a housewife.'' Jill paused. `` I know you'd do anything for her. You just need to communicate that.'' 
 
 I nodded again. Gears started turning in my head. A plan developed. `` Jill, I think I'm going to head home a little early today.'' 
 
 **** 
 
 On my way home from the grocery store I examined the bottle of chicken souls at a red light. There was a recipe for Spectral Cajun stir-fry on the label. It did n't look too difficult. 
 
 As I pulled into the driveway, my heart dropped. My wife's chevy cavalier was already there. In spite of myself, I began looking around for another car. A man's car. 
 
 *Okay, just stop. * I told myself. But I could n't think of any reason for her to be home early. She got off at six. We usually walked in the door ten minutes apart from each other. I started thinking back to the last few days. Did she seem to always be home before me lately? 
 
 Okay, even if bringing some asshole home and fucking him in our house was her plan, there was nobody in her life that she would be interested in that way. She told me all about her days at work. Her coworkers are very bland and married. She's only good friends with the 19 year old girl interning at the office. Where would she even have time to meet people? 
 
 Why was I even thinking about this? I trusted my wife. I loved her. I was so confused, though. I got out of my car and sprinted up the steps, pulled out my key and opened the door in one fluid movement. 
 
 I stepped in and closed the door behind me quickly. Then I listened. Nothing except for the crackling of the stove and chickens clucking. Clucking? 
 
 `` Shit.'' I heard from the other room. `` Shit shit shit.'' Sammy veered around the corner. She was in an apron. She gave me a big, sheepish smile. `` Shit! Why are you back so early, babe?'' 
 
 I could n't say anything. She walked up to me and hugged me close. 
 
 `` I'm such a bitch.'' She said. `` I'm such a bitch I'm such a bitch I'm such a bitch.'' 
 
 It really hurt me to hear her say that. Especially now. I held her tighter. `` I love you, Sammy. I bought some more chicken souls if you ran out.'' 
 
 She laughed. `` Oh god! More souls is the last thing we need. I misread the recipe and bought three times as much as I needed. Hope you like spectral stir-fry.'' She let go of me and walked back into the kitchen. `` Oh, and I love you too.'' 
 
 I watched her walk. `` Do n't you have work?'' I followed her to the stove. 
 
 `` You were more important today.'' The stove clicked as she turned the heat down. `` Wait, do n't *you* have work?'' 
 
 `` I was planning to be your 1950s trophy husband tonight. You beat me to it.'' I hugged her from behind. 
 
 `` Your turn tomorrow for sure.''
