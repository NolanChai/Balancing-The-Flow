His fingers grazed her thigh tracing the outline of her birthmark over and over again. 
 “ Anna I never see you wear shorts, it ’ s the first time I ’ ve noticed this mark on your leg, ” Jacob stated. Anna ’ s hand subconsciously moved to where he was touching and staring. 
 “ It ’ s just an ugly birthmark, had it since I was born ” Anna said grateful that Jacob was no longer staring at it. 
 “ I think it looks pretty cool, it looks like a dragon. Almost thought it was a tattoo for a second ” 
 “ Why would anyone purposefully put something so hideous and huge on their leg like that? ” Anna said quietly as she got up from the couch. She knew she should ’ ve worn jeans today she hated any attention her birthmark gave her. “ I think I ’ m going to head home, it ’ s getting late. ” 
 “ Alright, I ’ ll see you tomorrow, ” Jacob shifted uncomfortably; afraid he had said something to offend her. With a swift peck on his cheek Anna left. 
 
 The walk home usually wasn ’ t too long but she took the long way home today she needed to think. Jacob mentioning her birthmark had really struck a cord with her. She knew he didn ’ t mean anything by it but any mention of her birthmark always brought up so many mixed feelings in her. She remembered when she was younger her grandma would tell her all these tales and stories about a girl with a dragon mark. She used to call it the mark of power, if the first-born female in the family was born with the mark of power she was destined for great things she ’ d tell her. Story after story her grandma would say of her great aunt, her great grandma, and the women before them. Anna, your destined for great things her Grandma would say after every story. At that time Anna looked at the mark with great pride and love. That mark reminded her of her grandma and strength. That was until her grandma passed away and Anna entered the fifth grade. She was on the chubbier side then, which she ’ d grow out of before high school, but in fifth grade being the fat girl wasn ’ t always fun. Now being the fat girl with a big birthmark was really not fun. With the upmost creativity an eleven year old girl could muster Anna ’ s nickname became cow on the account of she was fat and spotted. The years of bullying she encountered drained all the pride and love she once had for her imperfection. 
 
 “ Hey, do you need help walking home? It ’ s getting pretty late for a pretty girl like you to be walking home ” a voice echoed startling Anna. She hadn ’ t noticed how late it had gotten or how far she was. The source of the voice came from a straggly tall man walking behind her. 
 “ No I ’ m fine, almost there. ” Anna said wearily as she was reaching into her purse to find some pepper spray she kept attached to her keychain. 
 
 But before her hand was able grasp the spray the man had grabbed it. His arms wrapped around her, one around her mouth and the other around her torso. Fear and panic took over she thrashed around and they both thudded to the ground. With one hand on her throat and the other going up her leg Anna felt her world slowly going dim this couldn ’ t be happening to her. As his hand reached a higher and higher closer to her birthmark he started screaming. Anna felt warmth engulf her and was able to push him off. Only to see the body she pushed off her was a scorched dead one. Instinctively her hand touched her birthmark to see it was glowing red.
