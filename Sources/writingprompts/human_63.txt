I have a teleportation device that will instantly take me to wherever on a map a randomly thrown dart hits. Until today this has been great, and this method adds a great sense of adventure to my travels. So far it has taken me to Britain, Hawaii, France, through most of the United States and Canada, but today was different. I decided that I would travel this weekend so I threw the dart at the map with my eyes closed, and I felt the teleportation device transporting me. When the teleportation finished I opened my eyes only to see sand. I looked at my map and found that I ended up in the worst place possible: a war zone, Afghanistan. Then I heard the drone of 4 turbo prop engines. As the plane came closer I saw that it was a C-130 which is a US Air force transport aircraft. Then the ramp at the tail of the C-130 opened, and a large parachute came out, dragging a pointed cylinder. I knew what this was, it was the most powerful non nuclear bomb: a MOAB, the mother of all bombs. I picked up the dart, closed my eyes and threw it. Crap it landed in the same hole, I tried again and again but the dart would not land anywhere on the map but this doomed location. The bomb is getting closer until I decided to cheat the system by going to the map and stabbing the dart into the United States, but it did not work, the location has to be random. The mother of all bombs was less than a quarter mile from the ground, where it would detonate and instantly vaporize me. I then closed my eyes and stabbed the dart into the map randomly, the location was hundreds of miles from my home, but at least I am not being killed by the first usage of that huge bomb.
