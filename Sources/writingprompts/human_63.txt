John walked in the door around midnight and sat down at the kitchen table. The look on his fact was blank and empty. I could see the resemblance between his face and mine and for a reason I did not understand, I started to cry. 
 
 Dad said `` we're glad you're home son. ``, but in a tone that I had never heard from him before. It was a mixture of sadness and something else that I could n't put my finger on. `` You can stay here as long as you like. There is food in the refrigerator and we've made a bed for you in the den.'' 
 
 Then, looking at us all, John said `` I ca n't stay. I have to report back to base. Do n't leave your house tomorrow and you will remain safe.''
