`` Level up!'' The screen pinged as Dr. Gahmstahp killed his 100th troll. In the movies, it never ended humanity, but it at least killed some people. Initially, he created the murder system in the game to kill whomever spawn camps or uses hacking. He rationalized that odds are that whoever he killed would be an urban legend, and that most people were rational human beings who thought that murder in games were impossible. Sadly, he neglected to factor in that most people on the internet were idiots willing to believe in idiotic things like vaccines causing autism or that Kim Kardashian was talented. With a frown, he closed his game, depressed that his new invention would never be used to its full potential.
