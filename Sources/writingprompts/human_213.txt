`` Daddy, is Santa real?'' 
 
 `` No. Santa was just a marketing ploy thought up by Coca-Cola to sell sodas. Ever since then, people have been making up stories egging the myth of Santa on and on. Only stupid people believe in Santa, and we are n't stupid, are we?'' Her father asked, repeating the lie again. 
 
 `` That's what I told Jeffory Cooten at school, but he keeps telling me Santa is real.'' Sally replied, smiling sweetly up at her father. 
 
 `` See. You're not stupid at all.'' He told her, adjusting his gun out of habit. `` It's bed time. Come on. I'll tuck you in before I go back to the precinct.'' The detective said, scooping up his daughter and carrying her back to bed. It took him just a few moments to tuck her in. Afterwards, he kissed his wife and hit the road, motoring down Main street on his way to his office. The parking lot was nearly full, forcing the detective to park in the very back row, furthest from the building. 
 
 `` Hey, Steve. You're early.'' His partner called from the next row over. `` Back row again?'' 
 
 `` Yeah. My luck right?'' He laughed, locking his doors. 
 
 `` You're own damn fault. You come in to early. Second Shift has n't had a chance to clear out yet.'' Detective Miller admitted. `` What's so damn urgent, you feel the need to come in early?'' 
 
 `` Warehouse killings.'' Detective Schwitz answered. `` I've been finding more killings like this. All of them on Christmas Eve. All of them involving children in some way.'' 
 
 `` Jesus,'' Miller exclaimed. `` Someone's killing children?'' 
 
 `` No. Some vigilante out there has been out there killing people who've made a living out of hurting children. These,'' he said, tapping his briefcase, `` were human trafficers. Found one over on Vicar's Boulevard with a peppermint stick shoved through his eye and into his brain. It's a sick fuck does something like that.'' 
 
 `` I hear you, man. But, on the bright side, they deserved it most likely.'' Miller pointed out sagely. 
 
 `` Probably, but does n't change my job one bit. Worse, I know who killed them.'' He said. Miller waited patiently for the reveal. `` Santa.'' 
 
 `` Santa? He does n't even deliver anymore. Everyone knows Mrs. Claus has taken over doing the deliveries. She's been doing the Christmas Eve runs for almost five years now. Santa's a drunk.'' Miller pointed out. 
 
 `` He is n't a drunk yet. He just stares at that bourbon every night. I've had him under surveillance ever since the he killed those men in the warehouse. I'd love to nail the son-of-a-bitch, but we ca n't touch him.'' Schwitz said, shaking his head as if to deny the fact. 
 
 `` Wait. You have him dead to rights on these murders, but you ca n't bring him in? Why the fuck not?'' Miller asked. `` I saw the pictures from that warehouse. He fucking hung half of the men with Christmas lights from the rafters. That's barbaric.'' He said, clapping his hands for emphasis. 
 
 `` Diplomatic immunity.'' Schwitz explained. `` Santa has diplomatic immunity when he comes to the States. He has a postal address at the North Pole. It's a technicality. The post office has been accepting letters to Santa. The U.S. government has been backing that play by admitting that Santa is real. They've been doing all these little niceties for over a century asserting that Santa was real, but believing that they were talking about a made up holiday figure. As strange as it sounds, we've spent so much time creating actual statutes to reinforce our fantasy, that we've managed to provide Santa with a foreign dignitaries status and all the benefits that go with it including Diplomatic Immunity. Santa could walk out of that bar with a shotgun and gun down everyone on the street and we'd have to let him go.'' 
 
 `` That's fucked up. How's Sophie doing? She adjusting okay to being Mrs. Clause?'' Miller asked. Schwitz shrugged. 
 
 `` Bout what you'd expect. She keeps trying to lure Santa back to the North Pole to take back up his mantle, but he's wallowing in self pity and refuses to go. His daughter being diagnosed with cancer has n't helped their situation much. He wo n't leave her bed side. I feel for the man, but at the same time he's a serial killer vigilante who deserves to be locked up.'' Detective Schwitz confessed, holding the door open for his partner. 
 
 `` I feel for the guy. Fuck those slavers. They deserved to die. You know and I know it.'' Miller told him, reacing out to squeeze his partners shoulder. `` Hang in there. You'll get your justice someday, most likely.'' Miller said it, but he did n't believe it. 
 
 `` I know. I've talked to Sophie and surveillance has picked up on conversations between him and that elf that comes to see him. The longer Santa's away, the weaker his magic grows. Kids do n't believe in him as much. I've tried to help things along. I started a campaign online, explaining the situation with these killings. The purpose of the campaign is to convince our children Santa does n't exist.'' 
 
 Miller gave him a quizzical look. `` What does that matter?'' 
 
 `` In two years, Santa will qualify to be a U.S. citizen. When that happens, his diplomatic immunity will expire and I'll be able to arrest his ass finally. I need his magic to be gone by then, so when I lock him up, he ca n't escape.'' Schwitz said. 
 
 `` Kind of low, buddy.'' Miller told him. 
 
 `` Yeah. Well, I do n't like murderers regardless of their reasons. You want to help us out? We can always use another to spread the word.'' Detective Schwitz told him. `` The more the merrier.'' 
 
 `` That's cold,'' Miller pointed out. `` You forget the hundreds of years he has n't been a killer or are you just pissed because he never brought you anything for Christmas. Fuck it. Happy hunting. Get him, do n't get him, whatever you do, just wait until after his daughter has passed on so she does n't have to see what he's become. 
 
 `` Fine. That day is as far away as you thing.'' Schwitz told him, taking a seat at his desk and opening yesterday's survellance packet. He skipped through it and located the intel on Santa's daughter. He looked through the paperwork and found what he was looking for. The little girl's health was failing. Tonight might be her last day. `` About time.'' He whispered. `` About time.''
