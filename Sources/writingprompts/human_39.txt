*'' Detective Henry, we found 3 more bodies, all with the same Ipod playing the same song. `` * 
 
 Henry picks up the Ipod and puts a headphone next to his ear. 
 
 *Butterfly in the sky, I can go twice as high. Take a look, it's in a book'' * 
 
 Detective Henry puts the Ipod and Headphone down. 
 
 *'' Who would play such a God forsaken song? `` * 
 
 *'' Ha, my daughter listens to this song all the time'' * 
 
 *'' You do n't think it could..'' * 
 
 *'' Yeah, it's my daughter'' * 
 
 Detective Henry goes home, he checks in on his daughter, and she is sleeping like an angel. He thinks to himself, `` How ironic'' and drags himself into his bed. 
 
 **3 hours later** 
 
 Henry is restless, he is tossing and turning. 
 
 *'' Take a look, it's in a book, Reading Rainbow! `` * 
 
 Detective Henry immediately wakes up. *'' What the heck? `` * he whispers to himself. He hears giggling from the other room. Like his daughter is awake and sleep walking again. He gets up to go find his daughter and put her back to bed. As he looks around the house, he sees plastic curtains draped up around his kitchen door. 
 
 He hears his daughter giggling 
 
 `` *I can be anything. Take a look, it's in a book. A reading Rainbow. *'' 
 
 Frightened, Henry opens the plastic drape and sees his daughter standing their with some disfigured object on the counter. 
 
 *'' Samantha? `` * 
 
 Samantha quickly turns her head 
 
 *'' Ahhhhh'' * 
 
 she screams at the top of her lungs. 
 
 *'' Daddy, DADDY'' * 
 
 Detective Henry wakes up. 
 
 He has a throbbing headache, Samantha is screaming. 
 
 *'' Daddy stop! `` * 
 
 He looks at his daughter standing in the plastic curtains looking into the kitchen. He's in the kitchen holding a scalpel and hears 
 
 *'' Friends to know and ways to grow. `` * 
 
 playing in the background. 
 He looks down and sees LeVar Burton duct taped and unable to move.
