The door smashed open, knocking the old widow Agatha over with a sickening crack, there was a collective gasp, and just as some of the customers went over to help her up, a man strode in. He was clad in shining armour, with a brash smirk on his face. I stood up to have a word with him, but before I could start, he had driven his sickeningly clean sword and had chopped a chair clean in twain. The men and women pulled themselves to their feet hastily, and backed away from the still-smiling man, who's photogenic hair was staying firmly in place as he 
 moved on to a fine oaken table. Something had to be done, I made my way carefully over to him, avoiding the splinters of wood flying out at all angles, and the ghastly blade, doing is poltergeistic duty 
 
 `` Now listen'ere!'' I started. The man ignored me. I gulped, pulled myself together and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around in an instant, causing another gasp. His eyes stared happily at me, like a child with a gun. 
 
 `` It's a fine day, is n't it.'' No other expression passed his face bar that terrible smile. 
 
 `` Er, yes'' I started, taken aback ``, but-'' 
 
 `` Do you have a quest for me innkeeper.'' He cut in, a statement rather than a question, just daring me to say no. 
 
 `` Do you want a herb from he mountains?'' He continued, as I stared blankly. Then, a jolt of realization came over me. 
 
 `` Why yes!'' I rubbed my hands together. 
 
 `` There has infact been a supcorn of a dilemma that we denizens of R-'' 
 
 `` Skip.'' He said, boorishness tinging in his voice. *the audacity*! I stopped myself from yelling at him, and continued, it would be better this way... 
 
 `` Ah yes. The trolls 10,000 days north have been bothering us! I could reward you handsomely if you could bring me 12 dozen head- Sorry, *toenails*.''
