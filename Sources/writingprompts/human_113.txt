My heart felt pressurized. Like a heavy weight had been set upon it. I had been standing alone, gazing at the deepness of the stars. Focused on something not of this earth. I did n't even hear him come up beside me. He wrapped his hand with mine, and I jumped slightly. Glancing to the right of me I saw who it was and calmed. Questions begged to flow from my mouth, but I held them back. For I could ask a million questions and I would be wanting more. 
 
 I've always been alone. The outcast, the isolated. I accepted that. Staring at the stars helped me accept that. Helped me to accept that we are all so imperfect. And yet we still strive to be. That's why I stopped trying to be perfect. I stopped trying to force myself to fit in, and did my best with what I had. 
 
 Right now as we stand, hand in hand, there is a wordless symphony rising between us. We've talked little before this. Being only distant friends. But there always was something else. When we did talk it was common ground. When we connected, it was tough to sever. We were isolated together. As phony as it sounds, but I'd stand here for ages. I'd stand and watch creation come undone in silence with him. I'd stand and know that we are both imperfect, and that we have the courage to say so. 
 
 We'll stand.
