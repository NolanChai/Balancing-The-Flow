Alright Sarah, I'm coming after you. Just wait for me a little longer... 
 I jumped. I was n't scared though. To be fair, I was only 6 feet off the ground, and the rope wrapped around my neck kept me from falling and hurting myself. 
 
 In fact, I did n't feel anything. Was n't strangulation supposed to be just a little bit painful? After hanging there for a solid 12 minutes, I gave up, freed myself and gently floated down from the tree branch onto the forest floor. I start floating today of all days. This was why jumping off a building was a no-go. 
 
 No pills either. For some reason they go right through me, not like cheap beer or bad Mexican. It just phases through. And I could n't buy anything from the hardware store either. The cashier just ignored me and other people just walked right through me. Talk about rude. 
 
 `` Wow, denial is strong with this one'' I turned to see a small girl wearing a winged helmet. 
 
 `` Are you lost, little girl?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Repeat yourself much?'' she scoffed. `` I'm Val, the guide for the dead and a hundred times older than you.'' 
 
 `` What, who died?'' I was puzzled. 
 
 `` You did.'' 
 
 `` What? Sarah, where is she? We promised...'' 
 
 `` You still do n't remember'' The little girl then waved her hand in front of my eyes. `` Let me help, again'' 
 
 *Look, I'm leaving you, Jamie. You need help. Until then, do n't even think about contacting me. What are you doing with that? Put the damn gun down. You think you scare me? Put the -- You actually shot me, bravo. I ca n't believe I still love you, you ass. Now you have nobody and that makes me want to cry... * 
 
 *Do n't worry, Sarah, I'll follow you soon. This will be a lovers suicide. Like Romeo and Juliet. How Romantic. * 
 
 I grabbed a rock and bashed in the little girl's head. 
 
 `` NO'' I screamed. `` THAT DIDN'' T HAPPEN, YOU'RE A LIAR.'' But she did n't bleed, and I felt drowsy when she waved her hand again, whispering *forget* 
 
 I awoke feeling refreshed and full of energy. How am I gon na off myself? I could jump in front of a car. Alright Sara, I'm coming for you... 
 
 `` Wow, Do n't you get tired of doing this after 12 years?'' I turned to see a little girl with a winged Helmet. 
 
 `` Are you lost, little girl?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Maybe you'll be more accepting tomorrow'' She turned to walk away, while I struggled to figure out why she looked so familiar.
