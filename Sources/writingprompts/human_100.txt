The lightning blinds me for a quick second as it flashes quickly across the dark grey sky. Strange weather for the past few weeks now. I got the call from Lloyd back at H.Q about a car accident, this one was a little different to your average crash, though. 
 
 
 
 I turn on the radio to call in that I'm nearing the scene when I hear an unidentified voice discussing gun control in the U.S before static returns to silence. 
 
 
 
 I park up and enter the site on foot. Toyota Corolla, 2016 model, the hell. The light once again flashes. I'm blinded for a second. 
 
 
 
 No body. No trace. No identification. No leads. Only thing I find is a small rectangular box made of glass with a few slight cracks in it and an emblem of a silver apple with a bite taken out of it on the back. No idea what it is. 
 
 
 
 Lightning strikes. I go blind for a second. 
 
 
 
 I find a CD case as well.'Katy Perry'. No idea who that is. 
 
 
 
 Lightning strikes. I go blind again. I open my eyes to find I'm in the same place, but it's day time and there's no car or officers. Just me. The small box I'm holding buzzes. I look at it,'mom' is shown on the screen with numbers. And the date, 31/01/2016. I drop the box and look around to see my world and this one merge together. 
 
 
 
 This is what it's like when worlds collide.
