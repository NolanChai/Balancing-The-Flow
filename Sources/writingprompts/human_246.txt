George was a good man. I'd decided this over the course of a 2 hour long meal with the raggedy bearded man sitting across from me. A wife who passed too soon, a sudden layoff happening while he was grieving, the house fire that took the life of one of his sons, the others being put into foster care due to him being placed on suicide watch. All of this happening within the span of six months. I paid the bill, wrote an address and handed him a key 
 `` Go to this address, the house is now yours, I no longer need it''. 
 
 I left the restaurant leaving a slack jawed George wondering if I was even real or not. 
 
 A few hours later George Powell stared into the mansion's front hall, key still in the doorknob and broke down crying at the first good thing that had happened this year.
