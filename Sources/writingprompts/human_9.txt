`` The final prospect in need of a Guiding Species today,'' the Chairman of the Elevation Committee took a deep breath before continuing, `` is Humanity.'' Chaos ensued. 
 
 
 `` Are you *kidding* me?!'' 
 
 
 `` They do not deserve the opportunity!'' 
 
 
 `` Humans would usher in a new dark age for the galaxy!'' 
 
 
 Civility had been completely thrown to the wayside. The Chairman knew this would be the reaction from the representative species, but rules were rules and every sentient species of the required technological advancement were to be given the chance. Still, he had saved Humanity as the final prospect for the day on purpose. 
 
 
 `` Please, please calm down. I understand all of your objections, I may even agree with most of them, but you are all familiar with how we operate.'' The angered voices quickly went quiet to hear the Chairman's voice of reason. `` If no Guiding Species steps forward to lead a new prospect, they will be left to themselves. Isolated from the galaxy under punishment of law. They could go extinct before they ever become a Type II civilization.'' 
 
 
 Other than a few scattered whispers and shuffling chairs, the hall was silent. Not a single species was willing to guide Humanity into their next golden age. 
 
 
 `` Well, then. A vote is required before the decision is made final. If there is any representative species who would like to challenge the decision, your chance to step forward to guide the prospect species is now.'' The Chairman reached for his gavel. Not a sound in the room; the species was doomed. `` By order of the Elevation Committee,'' he raised his gavel into the air, `` contact with Humanity is forbiden and they shall be isola-'' 
 
 
 `` We will guide them.'' A bipedal being stood from his chair, pulling back the hood of his robes to show his face. `` It is time for the Centauri to guide a new prospect, we have waited long enough.'' All of the many eyes from the many different beings in the hall were glued to the robed Centauri monk. 
 
 
 `` You are willing to volunteer your people as the Guiding Species for Humanity? You are aware of their... violent nature, yes?'' The Chairman continued to hold his gavel in the air. 
 
 
 `` We are. The Centauri have waited a very long time for the right prospect for us to guide.'' The monk walked towards the council's seats in the front of the hall. `` The Humans are violent. They hurt and kill one another seemingly without end. They destroy their world and the non-sentient beings that inhabit it with them. They are corrupt. They also have potential for greatness - just like all of our species did - and my people have a gift suited, I think, just for them.'' 
 
 
 `` Ah, I think I understand,'' the Chairman smiled. `` Your empathy.'' 
 
 
 `` Yes. The Centauri are born with complete and absolute empathy. We can not harm another being without feeling it's pain. Even being near another creature allows us to feel as it feels. We can pass this gift on to Humanity, for better or for worse. The Humans will ascend or they will be consumed by the suffering they cause.'' 
 
 
 And the gavel crashed downwards.
