Christopher shivered awake as the cryogenic fluid drained below his ears. Eight months in transit took a tole on the body, even for the explorer subspecies of human *Homo magellanus. * His muscles jerked online and he pushed himself out of the upright coffin. 
 
 As he bee lined for the food packets, Christopher took a moment to appreciate the benefits of his lineage. He alone in the crew of eight had the physical fortitude to keep fine motor control after a cryo sleep. In addition, his skeleton was adapted to a zero gravity environment, his body resisted radiation poisoning, and his lungs could withstand a wider variation in atmospheric composition. He was born in a space station and it suited him. 
 
 He sucked on a packet labeled `` macaroni'' as he initialized the computer boot sequence and opened up the windows. Their destination was the star that the planet Veritas orbited, so this would be one of the only opportunities to see it before the light was too much. 
 
 Humanity had spent many years discovering and eventually manufacturing the wormholes that would enable intersystem travel, even for *Homo sapien sapien sapien. * Seven planets had been colonized, with Veritas being the second. This was one of the few purely scientific voyages in years, set to assess the viability of living inside a star. It was that slightly larger dot in the distance. 
 
 Christopher kicked the glass and casually floated back into the cryo room, the food ration hanging from his mouth like a spent Capri Sun packet. The crew was still asleep, and would be for two more days. 
 
 On the very left was the captain. Captain Gibson was a military man, plucked from the Navy in return for the funding that made this journey possible. His intelligence was n't as notable as his acuity, but the details of his selection were omitted from the mission briefing. 
 
 To his side were the engineers. Arty Walen ( mechanical ) and Helena Polk ( electrical ) filled the STSA requirements for staff that could maintain the ship in case of a catastrophic event. Christopher found them unnecessary. The ship's eta fields diverted debris and significant obstacles were detected and avoided by the onboard computer. 
 
 Benjamin Villafuerte was the theoretical physicist that had proposed this mission fifteen years before. Christopher had seen him speak at the University of Veritas and quickly befriended him. The final three were the scientists on his research team. The proposition of living inside a star required absolute experts in materials design, astrophysics, and biology. 
 
 The cabin was silent. Long gone were the days of material propulsion, instead opting for ion thrusters, meaning long gone was the familiar bass note that drowned out minor sounds. 
 
 The computer beeped, and Christopher jerked around, terrified. He grasped two nearby guard rails and flung himself toward the console, where he expected to see a message about a power lapse or a mechanical failure. The engineers were n't set to eject for days, and they would be next to useless if he tried to wake them prematurely. 
 
 But the console simply indicated an incoming message, detected within the noise floor of Veritas's star's radiation. 
 
 `` NOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONENOTALONE.''
