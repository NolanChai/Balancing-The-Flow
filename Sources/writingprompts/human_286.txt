Garth Gatorade smiled at the trap before him. *No hero would ever suspect a trap at the boss level* He thought to himself in a gloating and overly confident matter. Once Zac Rocket, the chosen one of planet Elderidge has been slayed, Garth will finally have nothing to stand in his path as he prepared to conquer the galaxy and make beautiful Zorglings with his kidnapped bride to be, Princess Solara. It was such a brilliant plan that Garth decided to splurge in his self-confidence and unlock the back door of his spaceship for Zac. 
 
 `` You did it wrong.'' 
 
 Garth turned his massive crocodile head and squinted at Solara trapped in his cosmic crystal cube prison. **'' What did you say to me? `` ** He blurted out. 
 
 `` The banana peel is three inches too close to the guard's walkway. In a few minutes, Zac will burst through the lair's door which the first dimwitted guard takes chase but he will trip on the peel as soon as he pulls out and shoots his gun causing the bullets to shatter the ceiling light above him. The sparks from the light will ignite the trail of gasoline and explode the tank of rocket fuel which would conveniently knock out the backup guards who would have arrived after hearing the shooting. The explosion will also send a spark on your cape causing you to dance around in a hilarious matter due to your fear of fire. in an attempt to put out your cape, you will start to stomp on it which would only cause you to trip and fall over the railing and into your own trap. Zac will then rescue me and you will be jailed for being the antagonist.'' Solara said casually. 
 
 Garth Gatorade was unsure what to think of this, **'' Wait, you want to help me? `` ** 
 
 `` It more of helping me by helping you.'' 
 
 Garth moved the banana peel and sure enough Zac Rocket charged in. `` Do n't worry Princess Solara, I'll save you.'' He said with a wink, but his heroic gesture was spoiled as he slipped on the peel and slid directly into the pit of space-sharks. Garth could only gasp as Zac's screams echo through the lair. 
 
 **'' You..... you..... made me kill him'' ** He muttered. 
 
 `` It was the best choice available'' Solara stated, `` Your rivalry with Zac Rocket will only cause further countless deaths and stupid direct to DvD sequels. I removed the root of the problem and now the universe is safe.'' 
 
 **'' But why Zac, why not me? `` ** Garth asked. 
 
 `` Because if the hero triumphs, there will always be villains to rise up and challenge them, there will always been worlds destroyed, civilians dead, and princesses to be robbed from their homes.'' She explained, `` You have won, you can rule the universe. No longer do you need to build traps, conduct monologues, be comically vile and heartless, or kidnapped me any more. Now that the protagonist is dead, we can all be free, free to make our own choices, free to live our own lives, no longer must we be cardboard cutouts of stupid over done movie tropes.'' 
 
 **'' Thank you'' ** Garth said smiling. He released Solara and togehter built an empire of peace and prosperity.
