Disoriented, I open my eyes. I can smell the gunpowder in the air, and taste the acrid tang as the haze of the gunshot starts to drift upon the wind. I see the coward celebrating and waiting for his experience points. Time for me to teach him a lesson about double tapping. 
 
 I stand up as quickly and quietly as I am able, I bite back the pain of the new bruise upon my chest and hope the adrenaline coursing through my body takes the pain away. Fool still has his back to me. Quick, soft steps lead me closer to my prey, the pounding of my heart is so loud I am afraid it will give away that I am still alive. Silently I continue to gain ground. 
 
 I grab my would be killer from behind and spin him around so he knows that he has now become the killed, the shock and terror in his eyes overwhelm his once jubilant face. I smile as my hands knock the gun away from him, and my knife slashes upwards through his jaw and breaking past his sinus cavity. I watch as his eyes start to gloss over and his body starts to become slack, once more I come out with the experience points we all crave. Once more I feel the strength, vitality, charisma, and intelligence of who I am become much more than who I was and my skills becoming sharper, and more focused. 
 
 I will be the victor of this life, and none shall stand in my way.
