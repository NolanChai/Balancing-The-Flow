Sonia scampered along the path. It seemed as if her every step echoed through the City of the Gods, while her fervent prayers were buried in the silence around her. She paused and looked around. The elegant structures around her swayed in the breeze. Sometimes, they moved against the breeze; other times they twisted and bent. Shimmering clothes of all colors danced in harmony with the homes around her, sometimes serving as walls, and other times coyly revealing tastefully decorated guestrooms. The branches of the great tree painted the city in shadow and light, and the thinly woven path revealed a cloud covered, lush, green world below. The path was thin, but none of the faithful had anything to fear from such a fall. It was beautiful, but to Sonia the colors seemed dim, the dancing homes around her were off beat and the city itself was lifeless. 
 
 Everyone was gone. Her ma and the others had probably landed in their new village on the surface. Sonia should have been with them, but she had to see Vreeshwa one last time. 
 
 The temple of Wisdom was large, but otherwise humble by the standards of the City. Vreeshwa cared little for ceremony and worship, but she treasured her people. She had taught Sonia everything Sonia knew. Even if the other Gods had abandoned her, Vreeshwa would still be there. She had to. 
 
 She was not there. The temple was empty; even the bookshelves were gone. But, floating in the center of the teaching chamber was a single book: `` The Book of Sonia.'' The book was empty, but the moment she saw the book, Sonia remembered Vreeshwa's face and her kindness. She received Vreeshwa's Wisdom. It felt as if she suddenly remembered advice from long ago. 
 
 Without hesitating, she grabbed the book and ran to the main square. There she found a small statue of Gohim, God of Fortitude. Once again, Sonia looked at the book and received Vreeshwa's Wisdom. Then she left the temple and walked out into the city that had been her home for 16 years. 
 
 The city died quickly. When it did, Sonia fell with it. She tried praying to Shinwa, God of Spirituality, but she could not remember his face, the sound of his voice nor the feeling of the spirits he had named for her. The prayer failed, and she plummeted through the clouds. As the ground approached, she desperately prayed to Gohim. She remembered Gohim's fearless laugh and the unrestrained strength of his arms. Immediately her limbs grew firm and unyielding. Her mind calmed and she carefully watched the ground, using her clothes and the wind to guide herself into a clearing. 
 
 CRACK 
 
 The pain was mind-numbing, but somehow she was alive. Hugging the figure to her chest, Sonia breathed a prayer of thanks to Gohim. When she touched the book she understood. This pain would define her life, but Vreeshwa would guide her to her fate and Gohim would give her the strength to face it. Not all of the Gods had abandoned her.
