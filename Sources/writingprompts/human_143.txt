I try to cry like I've seen the human girls do around the orphanage, but my programming wo n't let me. The young lady who was in the orphanage looked at me and she walked back to Nayna the nun who took care of us. I walk to the bathroom and practice my expressions more. I had mastered the faces, but the emotions were never really there. No matter how hard I tried I could n't feel this thing that the humans were talking about. I stare into the mirror, my golden hair cascading down to my shoulders. I do n't remember how or who made me, but I know I'm not a normal kid. I step back out of the bathroom to find Nayna with all my clothes. 
 
 `` This young lady would like to be your mother Elise. I packed all of your clothes while you were in the bathroom.'' 
 
 the place where my human heart would be grew warm filling my circuits with this new energy. I smiled with what humans must call joy for the first time ever. Nayna had tears in her eyes as she kneeled down to hug me. 
 
 `` My child. I knew you were more than just another one of my creations! Please live the life you deserve'' 
 
 `` Huh Nayna? 
 
 Nayna put my stuff into the young lady's car. We drive off and I wave my final goodbye to Nayna and start to remember. Nayna had created me, but gave me free will. I remember she took care of everything for me for years. She made brownies when I was good and read me bedtime stories at night! When I became lonely she made me freinds! I ca n't leave her! I turn my head around and tears fill my eyes. My nun, my creator, and the best mother I would ever have. I curl up and stare out the window. 
 
 `` I'll miss you Nayna....''
