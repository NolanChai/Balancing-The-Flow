A few weeks ago when I first realized that I was completely alone here and thought I was gon na start going crazy... I think I might have died then... or maybe this is just a really bad dream that I ca n't seem to wake up from. Whatever it is, it's beyond the worst and most terrifying I could have imagined... 
 
 At first when I realized I was alone here, I was kinda happy. A few days were spent running around enjoying everything I wanted to at a whim. There was gunfire and liquor and very quickly... I began to get serious about how lonely I was here. 
 
 The buildings were all abandoned. All of them the same. Clothes all over the place, and the occasional mysterious pile of hair or weird chunks of metal. There were n't any animals either. It was dead quiet. I thought I was dead... maybe I am. 
 
 A week ago I got so lonesome that I tried to end it. I actually DID end it. I had a shotgun and shot my head off. 
 
 I was quite certain my aim was spot on, but when I woke up the next day, bleeding profusely out of my head with the worst headache imaginable... I was n't so certain I was alive anymore... 
 
 Next to me was a shotgun sitting in a pool of blood. Flesh was scattered everywhere around it... I spent the next few hours traumatized before I tried picking up the shotgun again and aiming it underneath my chin, firmly grasping it so the blowback wo n't change anything... I pulled the trigger once more... 
 
 Again I woke up in a hot, painful, wet panic... I thought it was sweat I was drenched with at first. My hands showed me it was blood rather quickly... 
 
 The pain was intense... but I sat and experienced it in it's entirety. Eventually the pain subsided. I was so, so hungry. So weak... a nearby puddle of water taunted me with it's cool moist promise of life... a promise that was denied as I grew closer... it was actually a very, hot, bright, mirror... 
 
 Even trying to look into the mirror caused the most intense of pains... and so I wandered about the endless landscapes and endured the loneliness once more. 
 
 It was n't all so bad. With no one to judge and everything available, I found drugs in various houses and enjoyed videogames and fine foods everywhere I went. It was the loneliness that got to me the most. 
 
 Eventually I'd fashioned dolls to keep me company with familiar faces. I went out of my way to study technology and eventually created very realistic looking machines... but they always acted withing predicted parameters... even in an ocean of familiar faces it was lonely. 
 
 In due time, I'd learned to restore the entire world... at least... that's how it looked. Nobody was missing. 
 
 As I worked, I found the urge to return to the mirror and try looking in it once more... but my skin ached just thinking about the place where I'd once tried to blow my own head off, twice... 
 
 A sea of familiar faces... every piece in it's place... absolutely no insurrection... no challenge... no opponent. 
 
 I've got an idea to maybe make this hell bearable again. A machine idea that could make me forget who I really am... after I'm done using it I would think I myself am one of my machines... and then at least I wo n't think I'm alone... 
 
 Even if I eventually remember who I am, I can just forget again and have the system improve its methods each time. 
 
 I wo n't have to be the only one anymore. I will be one of us. We will all be one. One of us.
