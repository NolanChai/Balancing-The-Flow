The chains are heavy, digging into my skin, my fingers nearly numb from the weight as I do my best to feel along the wall, doing all I can not to collapse. The air is stale, suffocating, the taste of something foul lingering in it. Why did I think this was the best option? 
 
 No, this was the only option. 
 
 The small path opens up, the ground slipping from under my bare feet suddenly. I feel the stone tear into flesh as I fall, coming to rest at the back of this massive room. The sounds of shuffling hit my ears and I sit up quickly, scurrying backwards as quickly as I can, my back hitting the precipice. Hooded figures suddenly turn, purple eyes fixating on my prone figure, my throat tightening in fear. There are more of them than I can count. I ca n't go back, but I do n't know what's ahead of me. 
 
 They suddenly part, a pathway leading to a throne of black stone, a statue of a white wolf posed over it. Its massive paws curl over the edge of the chair, as if ready to pounce on its prey. The fear rises even more, the visage of the beast was one an unfortunate soul would find in nightmare, but those eyes, blood red, glowing softly, they call to me. 
 
 My feet move on their own, unable to resist the silent call of this monster. My hands reach up, settling on the muzzle of the wolf, the chains slipping free from my tired arms. The glow grows, burning into my own gaze, and I ca n't tear myself away. 
 
 *Home... * 
 
 `` Home.'' The crowd speaks, echoing the voice I hear in my head, the deep rumble rattling my bones. My lips part, dry and cracked, slowly forming a smile, something I thought I had forgotten. 
 
 `` Home.''
