`` All set?'' Cassandra, the love of my life asks me. 
 
 `` Yep, car's all packed sweetheart,'' I tell her. 
 
 `` Good, now let's enjoy this honeymoon of ours,'' she says and kisses me on the lips before heading out to the car. I grab my cellphone off the kitchen counter and make a call. 
 
 `` Hey, I have that package you ordered that was shipped to my house. I'm headed into town, it okay if I bring it by?'' I ask. 
 
 `` Yeah, I'll be waiting,'' the other man replies and hangs up. I put my phone in my pocket and head out to the car. 
 
 `` Hey, if it's okay, I'm going to crash until we get there,'' Cassandra informs me upon me sitting down in the driver's seat. 
 
 `` Okay love,'' I reply and kiss her on the forehead. The ninety minute drive goes by silently, and once again the familiar skyline of New York greets me. It takes another forty five minutes to get into the city proper. Finally, I arrive at a more quaint section and pull the car into an alleyway. A man in a dark suit comes out of the shadows as I park. 
 
 `` Hey, what's going on sweetheart?'' Cassandra asks me worriedly. 
 
 `` Stat here a second,'' I request and get out, meeting the man. 
 
 `` Do you have it?'' he asks me. 
 
 `` Right here,'' I reply and pop the trunk, helping him remove the heroin I transported here. We go back around front where Cassandra gets out of the car. 
 
 `` Alan, what the hell is going on?'' she asks me. 
 
 `` Detective Riley, NYPD,'' the man in the suit flashes his badge. 
 
 `` You son of a bitch, you just sold illegal drugs to a cop on our HONEYMOON?'' Cassandra snaps. 
 
 `` Sweetheart, there's something about me you do n't know,'' I tell her. 
 
 `` I do n't want to hear it,'' she hisses. I dig around in my pocket. 
 
 `` I'm Detective Alan Wheeler, NYPD,'' I state, `` And you just helped me get the evidence into town that will seal a prominent drug ring in jail for a very long time.'' 
 
 `` You've been lying to me the whole time?'' she asks, hurt. 
 
 `` No, you truly are the love of my life, and marrying you while undercover was the hardest decision of my life, but doing so saved my life, it explained my recent nervousness while undercover,'' I explain, `` You saved me.'' Cassandra sighs and runs her hands through her hair. 
 
 `` One last thing Alan,'' Cassandra states. 
 
 `` Yes my dear?'' I ask. 
 
 `` This save was a one time, when you're getting shot at, you're on your own, because I'd probably end up killing you if I was on your side,'' she declares. 
 
 `` By accident or on purpose?'' I ask. 
 
 `` That, my dear boy, remains to be determined.''
