Bang! 
 
 The bullet shot forwards at ridiculous speed. It would hit it's target long before anyone could properly react to the sound and rationalise what had just happened, too late for anyone to stop it, it would now inevitably cause mass panic. 
 
 The bullet flew through the air towards it's target, seemingly unhindered by air resistance or friction. It sailed downwards with gravity, something the shooter had tried to compensate for when they fired. The shooter was up above, several floors above his target. 
 
 The impact was immediate and obvious. The body recoiled from the sheer force the bullet carried, and blood immediately shot out. A second bang had already been heard, but the first bullet had already been enough, slamming right into the side of the skull, sending flesh, hair, blood and brain matter in all directions. 
 
 Instinctively he clutched at his head, but was already feeling faint. His vision began to blur, he vaguely could make out the panic as he fell backwards, his wife desperately clutching at him, while all around him people moved in terror. As he hit the ground he blacked out. 
 
 His wife was distraught. In a moment she had gone from smiling happily to completely overwhelmed with shock. All she could do was tell God that she rejected the notion, that this was not how things were meant to be. She repeatedly called out to Him, hoping He would realise his mistake, to overwhelmed to do anything but shriek out to her Lord in fear. 
 
 She looked at him, his body fighting for breath, blood still seeping out of the open wound. It was too much for her, she had never wanted to see him like this, but she could n't bring herself to look away. She wanted to see he was alright. She neeeded to see he would survive. 
 
 He did n't.
