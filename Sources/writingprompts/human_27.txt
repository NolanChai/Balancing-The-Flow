I opened my eyes and found myself looking at the sky. I had heard Time Travel was painful but nothing was ever said about landing on a rock. I sat up, judging by my clothes and the small village near by I gathered I had been sent back sometime between 1600 and 1700. `` Well then...'' I said out loud. This was a place I could presumably... live in. 
 
 I rubbed my head, it was throbbing. I was trying to think on what the pioneer equivalent to an ice pack would be when I heard the screaming. I stood up and looked towards the sounds, and saw flames erupting from a house hold I could barely see. I ran uphill hoping to find a cliff from where I could see what was happening. It was illegal to send someone to any time of real consequence; so whatever was happening could n't be that bad. 
 
 I found a cliff and almost screamed myself. Dozens of longboats unloading onto shore, Vikings. Of course. I was screwed. I could see white men and natives taking up arms, grabbing pistols and bows and whatever weaponry they had available. But I shook my head, I had never heard about a Viking attack in the US history books. That meant that survivors were going to be few and probably put into slavery. 
 
 `` Well shit.'' I said again out loud, to no one in particular. I had two options. Run into the forest and hope they do n't go too far in mainland. Maybe I could find a nice tribe to settle with. Or two, go down there and meet my maker. I sighed watching the warriors start their raid of the small town. Giant looking men and women swinging their axes and huge swords. I crossed my arms, `` I deserves this. ``, and went down to the village. 
 
 I came down behind a large viking male attempting to break down what I assumed was the blacksmith's door. It was just a guess given that it was one of the better put together houses. I snuck up behind him and grasped the sword he had struck into the ground, I pulled with all my strength and ran the viking through as hard as I could. I had no idea if this blacksmith would be historically important, but I knew I just slew a viking, I almost took pride in that. 
 
 I turned to face a woman, she was n't wearing a helmet but she was clad in armor. Her blue eyes shined through the black line she had painted across her face. She spoke, `` oda goocheck smewupption.'' I was no linguist by any sort of the definition but I assumed that was some form of ancient Norse. `` I do not speak your language.'' I said with as much confident I could muster. I was a pretty tall guy, but not much with muscle. She on the other hand, was just about six feet and appeared to have never skipped a day at the gym. She was wielding an ax, and I must have been wielding a bullseye because she hurled that ax right at my chest. 
 
 it struck hard right where she wanted it, sending me flying back a number of feet. The wind had been knocked out of me, I was swore, i could barely move... but I was n't bleeding. I heard the viking woman approach and it sounded like she was laughing, but she stopped when she saw I was n't dead. It took ALL of my strength to remove the ax from my chest. The tear in my shirt revealed the ax had stopped when it a piece of grey clothing someone had put on me. I tapped my finger on it, it felt like solid steel. But then how could I not feel it's weight? The viking woman lunged at me, picking me up by the collar of my shirt, but I was barely aware of that. Someone had put that... ax proof shirt on me, but why? And then it hit me: Someone wanted me to survive this!
