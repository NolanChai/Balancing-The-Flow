[ Apologies for not following the prompt exactly- I was more than halfway through writing it when I realized I'd missed the section regarding `` standard service.'' I hope people still enjoy this! ] 
 
 I've trained for this day all my life. Not consciously, and not for every waking hour of my life, but, on some level, I've been waiting for this. 
 
 It was three in the afternoon, and I was sitting in the break-room when the call came. Paul lazily opened the door to the break-room with this big shit-eating grin on his face. 
 
 `` Hey, you guys, some crazy fuck says he's got a cockroach problem.'' 
 
 I laugh, and the others do too. `` Paul, you ass, you ca n't just go calling people crazy.'' 
 
 `` No, for real! This guy keeps saying he's got, like, man-sized cockroaches or some shit.'' 
 
 I laughed with the rest of the guys, but deep down I felt my calling reach out to me. 
 
 The owner of the house had boarded up the entrance to his basement. Hell, he was n't even there; he'd just left a blank check, keys and a note, all taped to the front door. The note said to call him back when the job was done- and so I scoped out the degree of the infestation. I made my way through the house ( a rather nice, mid-sized home furnished mostly with beige furniture ) and pried off the multitude of boards blocking the door to the basement. Almost instantly, a mass of insectoid limbs burst out of the holes the boards were covering. I leapt backwards, and grabbed a nearby sofa, and flipped it over to cover the hole. 
 
 I sprinted back to my van, and drove back to Warren's Pest Control. Paul, who was sitting at the front desk, shot me a look, but I ignored him. I had purpose now. Real purpose. The kind that drives a man. 
 
 Storming into the locker room, I locked the door behind me, and stepped into my locker. I removed the back panel of the locker's top shelf, and placed my hand on the now-revealed scanner. With a click and a whirr, the inside of the locker began to descend; the hidden elevators my parents and grandparents had installed came to life. 
 
 The basement of Warren's Pest Control had n't been touched since I was eight, but when I flipped the switch on the wall the room came to life. Striplights illuminated a semicircular room; racks of weapons and armor, blessed by Holy Crusaders of the Order of Extermination of ages past. I might be the only true Exterminator for miles around my hometown, but my grandparents had moved to Mariposa after the Unsung War of 1949, and they brought more than a few relics with them. 
 
 This is how I find myself back in front of the boarded door, the sofa and remaining boards shaking and torn. But I do not fear. I am garbed in the Hazmat Of Vengeance, blessed by Lord Takatora Sengoku, veteran of the Unsung War, with over eight hundred confirmed exterminations; copies of his treatise, *Malleus Hexapoda*, are duct-taped to the shoulders, and a breastplate, gauntlets and boots made from welded cans of Asahi ( what Lord Sengoku referred to as `` the shit'' ) are strapped to the suit. Slung over my shoulder is my grandfather's custom belt-fed bait gun, and a backpack-mounted pesticide sprayer with a blessed spiked hammer attachment is strapped to my back. Ten gas grenades and ten white phosphorus grenades clink on my belt, and my mother's holy necklace, ever-burning flares tied together with surgical tubing filled with the crushed bones of pests of all sort, blessed by Saint Burt Landers, founder of the Order of Extermination, hangs from my neck. 
 
 I take a deep breath. 
 
 I throw the couch aside and kick the door to the basement down, and throw two gas grenades at my feet. The mass of cockroaches begin to swarm me, but are repelled by the gas; I unsling my grandfather's gun and begin to unload into the swarm. I do not think of a battle cry, for the battle chants from the *Compendium Insecta* drilled into my head from youth surface in the glory of battle. 
 
 ***I AM THE HATE THAT THIRSTS. *** 
 
 I empty half my supply of gel-bait into the crowd; the swarm begins to fall back through the small doorway, as the corpses create a perfect choke-point. 
 
 ***I AM THE LIGHT THAT BURNS. *** 
 
 More gas grenades as I begin to advance into the basement. There is no light save that for my necklace, but I do not need more than that. I run out of gel bait, and sling the gun back over my shoulder. Out comes the pesticide sprayer. 
 
 ***I AM THE GAS THAT DROWNS. *** 
 
 The air is filled with the screeches and clicks of the insect swarm, but it does not make me afraid. Actually, for the first time in my life, I am happy. I am alive. Looking around me, I find myself fully in the basement now, no longer on the stairs; the basement is all black and inhuman, dripping with cockroach and eggs and fluid of unknown origin. Any lesser human, any other exterminator would be afraid. 
 
 But I am blessed. I feel at one with my hate. 
 
 ***I AM THE HAMMER THAT CRUSHES. *** 
 
 Pesticide is out; gas grenades are out. I grab my hammer and charge straight into the crowd of insects, wildly smashing and slamming the cockroaches aside. The Runes of Pest Control, carved into the hammer by a Russian blacksmith, glow with the blood of the insects. The foul creatures swipe at me, and in places tear the suit, but the majority of the blows are deflected by the layers of armour I wear over my Hazmat. It seems like only seconds, but soon enough the swarm has thinned, and I face the brood-mother which has spawned these abominations. It clicks and hisses at me, but all I see is its fear. 
 
 Gear check. Just my hammer and the belt of WP grenades. 
 
 It is enough. I charge forward, hammer in one hand and fiery canisters in the other. 
 
 ***I AM EXTERMINATION! YOUR JUDGEMENT HAS COME! *** 
 
 The queen swipes at me, and it tears right through the armour plating and tears a rip in the Hazmat. I smash that limb into the ground, then its legs, then its neck. I ram the belt of grenades down its throat, leap backwards, and watch its corpse hiss and burn, horrible fire illuminating the basement. 
 
 I emerge from the basement and head straight to the backyard. 
 
 I shed my wargear and feel the light on my shoulders. 
 
 Today, I am alive.
