Harold moved slowly across the forest floor, leaves craven in his eastern gait. By the wear of his Rolex and new hiking gear, he imposed a polished and urbane look. From hindsight he stood as an enormous shadow, his tan, healthy skin reflecting an opaque being. 
 
 In his sight was another man, one not too tall -- he was surely a common, middle class work man -- who had on a large hiking pack and some easy-to-miss clothes. He showed a countenance that was enticing, confident, even loving, and was layered with tan, healthy skin, likewise to his unknown counterpart. 
 
 When the man turned around, Harold took none effort to be known, 
 `` Howdy!'' said the man, a wild grin just forming. 
 `` Greetings,'' Harold said as he stepped closer towards the man, the crevices of the canopy illuminating his stolid face.
