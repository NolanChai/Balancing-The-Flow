She raveled a light brown curl round and round her finger, staring out with her dark hazel eyes. 
 
 `` Merci beaucoup, monsieur,'' she smiled sweetly, pulling back her extended hand and placing it gently back in her lap. 
 
 The gentleman who had just kissed her hand sat back down and took off his overcoat, which he placed on the spine of the steel chair. He was an older bachelor, at least, that's how he referred to himself who had lived alone for most of his life. He took long looks at everyone around the room, greeting them with stern almond eyes. 
 
 There was the French woman whom he had just had the pleasure of greeting so sweetly. She was young and foolish, from what he had seen of her, but, of course, looks can be deceiving. She wore a simple white dress that covered only half of her thighs and she would occasionally hide her eyes behind her broad straw sun hat that sat lopsided on her head. 
 
 The next face he met belonged to a young teenage boy, donning a black sweatshirt that was as black as his hair, which fell in front of his reddened eyes that neurotically glanced from side to side. He had n't said a word since they had appeared there, but would occasionally rub his wrists with either hand. 
 
 For the next face, the bachelor had to shift his eyes down. A small child with red hair was crying softly in the seat in front of him, sucking his thumb with rhythmic intensity. 
 
 The last face was hidden behind a veil of darkness. She was wearing a black burka that gave nothing of her away apart from her watchful hazel eyes that scanned the room with a cautious curiosity. 
 
 Then, as if a flash of light had gone off, the five strangers disappeared. With a loud *crack* five more people appeared, all different and all scared. No one had succeeded..... *yet*.
