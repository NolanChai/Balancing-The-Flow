The private entered with a quick salute and Colonel Rosario returned the favor without looking up from his desk. 
 
 `` Sit.'' The colonel said, waving to the chair across from him. 
 
 `` Sir,'' The private barked, only putting his hand down, `` I'd prefer to stand.'' 
 
 Rosario looked up at the private and frowned. He looked young, barely a hair on his chin. Still, there was a gleam in his eyes, a spark of determination. That was always useful. 
 
 `` Suit yourself, private.'' The colonel picked up a file and flipped through. `` Private Wallace. Sergeant Harrison speaks highly of you, says you're one of the finest he's trained.'' The private kept his poker face and Rosario nods, continuing, `` Well, do n't think too much of this interview, Wallace. Whether I like you or not, you'll still be going to CT boot camp. Just a few questions, first.'' Colonel Rosario smiled, `` I wo n't make you swear on the Bible, but try to be truthful, would you?'' 
 
 `` Sir! Of course, sir!'' 
 
 Max volume seemed to be Wallace's default. No surprise considering he came from Harrison's camp. That would need to be ironed out. 
 
 `` What's your family like, private?'' 
 
 `` Uh, excuse me, sir?'' 
 
 Rosario chuckled, `` Your family, Wallace! You have one, right?'' 
 
 `` Yes, sir.'' Wallace nodded, `` Just me and my mother, sir.'' 
 
 `` No father?'' 
 
 `` I've never known him, no sir.'' 
 
 Not that Rosario did n't know that already. Still it was good to hear it from the boy's mouth. 
 
 `` Ever voted before, private?'' 
 
 Wallace kept his compsure this time. `` No, sir.'' 
 
 `` Never, huh? Too stupid to understand or too stupid to care?'' 
 
 The private flushed with embarassment. `` Neither, sir, I've just... I...'' 
 
 `` Fair enough, Wallace. I suppose that was a bit harsh.'' Rosario gave a light laugh and Wallace smiled weakly back. `` We'll move onto the next question. Should be straightforward. Ever had any experience dealing with terrorists?'' 
 
 Wallace paused, wondering if he was going to stumble into a trick question. `` No, sir. Not directly. But that's why I wanted to join this unit, sir. Bring the fight to them, sir.'' 
 
 `` What do you think of them then? The terrorists, that is.'' 
 
 `` They're cowards, sir. Nothing more than criminals gone insane.'' 
 
 Rosario nodded. `` Well, that's a strong attitude to take, Wallace. Can you think of anything redeeming about them?'' 
 
 The private blinked, his lips pressed tight. 
 
 `` You called them cowards, Wallace.'' The colonel smiled grimly, `` There's a truth to that, but at the same time, they have a resolve that most do n't understand. The resolve to die.'' Rosario stared at Wallace, `` I wo n't ask you to throw away your life. But when the time comes, when you face someone prepared to die, do n't hesitate. Oblige them.'' 
 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 
 A dozen voices shouted commands, but one came clearest, `` Put your hands in the air and turn slowly! Do it!'' 
 
 The girl complied, her hands coming apart, a grenade in one hand and the pin in the other. 
 
 But that was n't what Wallace was watching. He saw her eyes instead. There was terror. She did n't want to die, anyone could see that. More than that, though, was despair. There was no coming back from this. She *knew* she was going to die. 
 
 There was even more shouting, but Wallace did n't hear. Wallace squeezed the trigger.
