Grangaflam. 
 What an odd result of translation. They use an archaic means of language, my computer tells me. 
 
 An old'latine' based language? 
 
 `` I have fourth tons of this stuff to sell to these hominids, and I have to call it Grangaflam?!'' 
 
 `` Affirmative captain.'' The computer retorts. 
 
 I print out the summary sheet, as per usual, and glance at the translated form. 
 
 It reads in ugly black and white print, which is the preferred medium of propaganda and advertisement here. 
 `` Try grangaflam! The stimulant/relaxation method to get your race smarter and more compliant! The only way to get your race into the intergalactic alliance within the ( insert relative measurement of time for planet here )'' 
 
 Oh lord. What a mess, this will never sell. 
 I get appropriately dressed, and hail communication channels in order to talk to their leader. It fails. No wonder! They are n't even advanced enough to understand basic radio emissions. 
 
 I'll just leave a weak version on an isolated sector, have them hooked on the weak stuff for a few hundred generationsuntil I can come back. 
 
 
 
 Oh whoops. There's a native here. Translator, what is he saying? 
 
 `` What is that brown thing in your hand?'' She replies. 
 
 Er... `` Its coffee.'' I say, she translates. I do n't know why I called it that, just sounded better. 
 
 `` Sir, you disobeyed the directive. You were intended to discuss the name properly translated.'' She barks at me 
 
 `` It will be okay. It does n't matter what its called. They'll love it.''
