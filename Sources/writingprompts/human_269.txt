Dark blue fire shot out of my hand and consumed the body. The old mans eyes turned black as his body was consumed in blue and purple fire. The man rose up slowly and immediately doubled over in pain. Blood dripped from his lips and neck, wounds on his body made him look like a butchered pig. He looked up with misery and torment in his eyes. 
 
 `` why'' he asked in a choking tone. 
 
 `` it must be perfect'' i said dryly. 
 
 I raised the sword and pierced his heart watching the silver slide out his back. Blood poured out onto my armor and dripped down to the floor. His arms reached out and grabbed the bottom of my chest piece pulling the sword deeper into him. The man thought this would be the last of his killings, but no, not even close. Every aspect had to be orchestrated perfectly for a true closing to this story. The blood had to hit the wall beautifully, the scream had to be ear piercing, the pain in his eyes had to be heart breaking, the ending had to be perfect.
