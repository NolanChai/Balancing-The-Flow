`` Ah, so this is the object I shall use. It is settled. Angels, bring out the object.'' 
 
 The object was a metal rod, given to him by the last batch of servants during one of his projection's visits to Earth. And now, it was time to do the old ritual of naming the object. 
 
 `` I think I'll call it the Rainfall Testament. I shall imbue it with powerful Magitek properties and add it to my vault.'' 
 
 The rod transformed into a powerful Magitek weapon, adding layers upon layers of color into the ever-shifting balance of multilayered constructive/destructive code. Years of perfected Magitek technology oozed into this rod, enabling anyone who used it to wield unparalleled power. But it was not unique, as it was the next object in a line of many powerful objects stored in the vault. 
 
 `` Keep it there until the time is right, then allow intruders to fight over it and cast it into the world. I want to know what would happen if any mortals got their hands on it.'' 
 
 Once the intruders found their way inside the vault, they would begin a short battle where the weapon will be lost. Then the scramble to find such a weapon will begin. 
 
 The coordinates were set: Ellisdon, New Jersey. It was a perfect location for the Gatekeeper's game of strife. Yes, he saw the perfect candidates for the Agnum and the Trigger, as well as who would eventually become the Activator. 
 
 This will be a very interesting game. As tradition has dictated with every Gatekeeper before him, the object called the Rainfall Testament will make its impact on the world.
