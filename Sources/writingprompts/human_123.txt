I heard rumors about the State Farm Hyperverse, but I always brushed those off as nothing more than scary stories usually shared with new agents. They never referred to it by name during training, why would they? It was never a place we would visit, just a place we would pass through on our way to a call, just a fraction of a second. They never got into the science of things, or how it worked, it just did and as far as we knew everything was and has always been safe. State Farm had been using this method of customer interaction since the early 80's, and during that time they became the largest private home, auto and life insurer in the world. Never the less my curiosity was peaked and I asked one of our trainers if anyone had been ever lost on way to a call. He laughed and said `` it's just simply never happened, I do n't know how it could.'' 
 
 I'll tell you how, two customers calling for you at once, that's how. The chances of this happening are astronomical of course. You hear about agents getting transported to another call while in the middle of a call every now and then, but it happens like once a year rare. 13 million worldwide agents each insuring a couple hundred clients a piece, most of who they'll never hear from again after the initial contract signing. But somehow two clients managed to call on me at the same time. 
 
 I still do n't know who summoned me, or why. All I know is I'm here in this white void of space. There's a floor, it's white. There's no walls, or ceilings, just white. I spend days walking in what I think is a straight line, but could've just as easily been a circle. At this point I know death is near. I'm mentally and physically exhausted. I have n't eaten, or drank or slept in god knows how long. I miss my kids, and my wife. I'm waiting for the next breath not to come, and to finally know peace. 
 
 I hear music. Off in the distance, but I can hear it. Likely a hallucination brought on by extreme fatigue, but still I walk towards what I believe the source to be. There in the middle of nowhere, in the white void, was a bar. With the last of my energy I sprinted towards the bar. Best case scenario, it's a bar and they'll have water and food. Worst case scenario, it's a hallucination and I'll die from the exhaustion. 
 
 As I get closer I notice two figures at the bar. One standing behind the bar minding to the glasses, and one sitting at it. `` It ca n't be a hallucination'' I say to myself as the smell of beer and pub cheese fills my nostrils. When I step up to the bar and notice the man sitting at the end of the bar is actually a caveman. `` That's odd'', I thought, when I saw the bartender turn to talk to me. 
 
 `` Can I get you something.'' She asked. She was a pale skinned woman with jet black hair and red lipstick. She wore a white apron over a white blouse and slacks. I leaned in to read her name tag. 
 
 `` Flo, I need help.''
