`` I walked through the darkened woods. Soft moss and dead leaves softened my foot fall. There was a light peering between the willows, dancing around like someone was carrying it. I got closer and it turned to me, the creature. I had n't in all my days seen such a grotesque being, so much a dark caricature of a man. I tried to run but could n't, it came closer to me and I screamed as loud as I could. No sound came, he was about to get me when you woke me.'' The woman curled into the fetal position, burying her face to her bosom. She mentioned willows, which had me hopeful; not vary many places here have them. 
 
 `` Did this forest of willows seem familiar?'' I inquire, squatting down beside her. 
 
 `` I ca n't help but think it was in the Jäger's Wood. My father took me there when I was young. He had n't any sons, needed me to hunt with him.'' She retreats further into her own arms. I stand and grab my blunderbus. The evidence points to a mare. Real enough as beasts go, but they latch onto their victims, often driving them to suicide with visions of horrors. Looks like I need to head to the Jäger's Wood and investigate further. 
 
 `` Do n't go to sleep.'' I warn. `` It lives in your dreams, in three days you should be able to sleep. I will kill it.''

 After the two days ride I came to the wood, the fresh rain makes the air humid, almost dense. I dismount my horse and start into the trees. The hanging branches blanket my view, making it neigh impossible to navigate standing perfectly upright. I walk almost a half mile crouched until I come to a break in the tree line. There is a large fairy circle in the centre, with a black stone in the centre. The carvings give away that this is where our dæmon has been. I see some brush move to my left and spin, raising my weapon to my shoulder setting my sights to the woman in front of me. 
 
 `` Lilith.'' The name escapes my mouth as I cock the hammer back. Her beauty might have fooled less expirienced Ballerophron, but I've seen minions of the Queen of Succubi before; and dispatched all, no matter how beautiful the disguise. 
 
 `` I've expected someone would wander here, I've been hoping for the girl though'' She smirks. I take a sturdier shooting position without saying a word. `` Are n't you wondering why I need her?'' Her patience is short it seems `` Why I go through the trouble of tormenting her, trying to drive her here. Do n't you want to kno-'' her last word is cut short by the blast of rock salt and silver shards. Caught her monologing. 
 
 The body changes as she dies, the cloak she was in turns to leather wings, her face sinks in becoming dark and vile. I burn the remains and sing the sirens song backwards so that she is banished to hell once more.
