I wish I was alive, real, but I am not. 
 
 I am the the one has seen civilizations of you humans come and go, I am here since the beginning of time, and shall stay till the end of it. You curse me, ridicule me, fear me or try to fight me, defeat me, and end me. But you can not destroy something that does n't exist in the first place. 
 
 And of all the creatures, you are the only ones who want me gone, forever. I wish it were different, but I am here, whether you want it or not. Infinite civilizations have never been able to do me any harm, yet you, the'centre of the universe', think that you can do it. 
 
 But it's still painful to see how much you hate me, how much you've despised me all these years, even after everything you say. You are hypocrites, who say that'One should be satisfied with what there is', and yet loathe me beyond measure, already knowing that I am eternal. 
 
 Damn me all you want, cry all you can, but I must always be there, without any emotions that you can ever comprehend. No matter how you seem to act infront of others, you all detest me inside your heart. But I am perfect, and with your help, I can even make you perfect. Try thinking it, a life in pure perfection. But that's something you ca n't even imagine, even after all this time. 
 
 Yet, I must always carry the curse that you humans can never comprehend me, either in life or in death. Only after dying can you understand what death is, because that's what I am. An unconceivable concept, death.
