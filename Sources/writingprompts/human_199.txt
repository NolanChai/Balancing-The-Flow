I had always thought, well assumed, I'd die under the light of this star. Then after the indeterminable wait, I would return. Apparently, that is not to be. Why they chose me, an old man of 98 I can not certainly say, but I have an idea. 
 
 Even now, the once brilliant white of our mother is steadily turning a deeper red; spots, like blackened lesions, stretch across her now marred face. I've tried to remind those who would listen that it is not a zero-sum game. This is a cycle, no matter what agents are behind the rapid hydrogen loss of our sun, and every cycle has a new beginning, no matter how long since its end, life springs anew. But fear is a powerfully persuasive, and it is such a shame that it takes such power fear to finally join hands as children of the earth. 
 
 I felt Sangay before he arrived. He stood at the door, streaming yellow linens, head bowed, another calm point of reflection in an ocean gone mad and foaming. 
 
 `` Your H-'' 
 
 `` I know, it is time.'' I looked again out of the photochromatic window at the sun that now spread horizon to horizon, threatening the orbit of earth itself, and sighed. 
 
 `` Our shuttle to the GeeShip is waiting.'' 
 
 I could n't help another sigh. I would die in that ship, that miles long column of hewn rock. I knew I would die there, that I did n't fear, I only feared j had nothing left to give to the people. We faced a cousin so different from us that attempted communication caused each pain. So different continued existence of one meant the death of the other. Such is life sometimes, I mused. 
 
 Sangay took a hesitant step forward, `` and I took the privilege of gathering your things.'' 
 
 `` You know we are only allowed one. And further, those things are what has kept me anchored to this place for so long.'' 
 
 Sangay nodded without understanding. I laughed, even now, laughter came as easily to me as breath. 
 
 `` We have new worlds,'' I spread my arm over where the horizon would be, `` and new life to find, let us leave what is earth's with her to pass peacefully. Plus, it's just stuff. I can always get more stuff.'' I laughed again, Chodak frowned, I laughed harder. 
 
 Gathering my robes in one hand to ease my walking I pat him on the shoulder, `` You have much to learn Lobsang Sangay.'' 
 
 `` And you have much to teach us, your Holiness.'' 
 
 `` Do not call me that, again.'' 
 
 `` As you wish, but if not thatâ€”'' 
 
 `` Eternal Starlord of the Void between the Hereafter, and One with Everything. Or just Tenzin.'' I laughed so hard I had to hold onto Sangay to keep from falling. He laughs, although I can tell he's deeply confused. We are all confused and there will be more confusion, and pain, before this is done. So we share that laugh, the one thing I'll be taking with me to the stars.
