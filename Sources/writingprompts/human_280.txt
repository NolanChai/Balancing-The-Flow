Eshu. A tiny moon named for a trickster god because of it's eccentric orbit around the gas giant Olodumare. It's a desert moon, the kind of rock no one would bother with, usually. Except for the two factors. 
 
 1. Oludumare passes near a wormhole to Tau Ceti on its orbit, which of course is colonized. 
 
 2. Eshu is the perfect size that ships can land and take off with minimal fuel cost, but it is spinning fast enough to produce artificial gravity. 
 
 In its early history, it was a hide out for criminals and political dissidents. But once the inner planet of Alye was terraformed and colonized, Alye became the jumping off point to Tau Ceti and therefore to the rest of civilized space. Nowadays Eshu has a Federation governor who makes sure the undesirables stay away, the walls stay scrubbed white, and the bottom line balances out. A rather boring place with an interesting past.
