She walks with her head down as if she's afraid the ground might open up beneath her and swallow her. Her short, red colored hair illuminated in the sunlight. She looks up for a second, scans her surroundings then looks back to the ground, avoiding eye contact with anyone at all costs. But those eyes, when she does look at someone, she sees straight into them. They lose their breath, like they are actually drowning in the deep blue. Her expression sad, lonely, like a lost dog searching for a home. She takes short strides dragging her feet. She ca n't be more than five feet and three inches. Hands stuck in her pockets of her half zipped batman jacket, fiddling with something. She pulls out her hand and starts biting her nails. Im assuming its a habit, because once she notices she's ripping and biting off her skin, she quickly puts her hands back into her pockets. 
 Her shoes are an old pair of DCs, laced like running shoes, but with holes near the feet that open and close when she walks, telling a story of where she's been... Although I already know wheres she's been... Usually she's in sweat pants, but today she's wearing dark blue skinny jeans. She moves her hair behind her ears and puts in ear buds to drain out the sounds of the people around her, talking and laughing about the parties, classes, and other people walking by. How can people be so judgmental? She finally makes it to the bus stop. She stands still, with her hip cocked to one side, only looking up to see if the bus is near by. She sits down, hunched over as though she just ca n't muster up the strength to sit upright. Her hands rummaging through her purse to eventually pull pull out her iPhone. A smile starts to form, her thin lips curling upward, causing her eyes to squint a little. God, I love when she smiles. 
 Her body is n't overweight, but she's not skinny, but because she is short, any weight that she does put on is noticeable. But I think she's perfect... Why ca n't I just talk to her? As she moves her hair behind her ear again, I see that she has four earrings in each ear. As I study her more, from her jaw line down to her neck, she has a dermal on her left collarbone and a scar from where the right one used to be. Her black tank top under her jacket making her large breasts noticeable. Men walk by, studying every girl they see. Some look past her, others stop and stare as they pass. Sometimes she notices, and smiles, other times she quickly averts her gaze. Why ca n't she see she's beautiful? What is she so afraid of? She pulls her jacket closer to her as she sees the bus. She paces while waiting for the bus to come closer like she's in some kind of a hurry. She gets up, pulls her jacket down around her hips, and begins to walk towards the bus. Others crowd the bus like a celebrity is about to step foot off of it. She waits patiently, while people push past each other to get a seat. Her round face becoming agitated, her sinister looking eyebrows move as she rolls her eyes. Finally she's shuffled her way to the bus entrance. She grabs the guard rail with her sleeve over her hand, maybe to keep the germs off or to hide her barely bleeding fingers from the picking. She stares out the window of the bus. Her expression still tense, but relaxes and smiles as she sees a woman walking her dog. Why must I always admire her from the sidelines?
