There we stood. The minute we locked eyes, I could feel time stop around us, and it felt for a second there like everything was over. The screaming, the shooting, the bloodshed, the tears. For one moment, it was gone. 
 
 Then it came back harder then ever. I was staring face to face with a boy. He seemed not much older than me, but so much different. He had dark brown eyes, that were full of innocence. I knew, because I had those same eyes. I was told those eyes would get me killed, and as I looked into this boy's gentle, caring eyes, I knew it was me or him. 
 
 He was shaking, pistol aimed directly at my chest. A single bead of sweat dripped down his brown, and as he reached to wipe it off, I drew my pistol up as well. 
 
 The tension had begun to grow stronger. Neither of us had spoken a word. I assumed he knew as well as I did that we were n't going to shoot. We just could n't. 
 
 The stare down continued. There was no time for blinking, or wiping sweat from our eyes, or lowering the pistols to rest our weary arms. It almost felt as if we were going to stand here, face to face, until the entire war was over, and even then we would be found, years later, by some researcher scouring the battlefield. In this moment, we were statues of ourselves. 
 
 Then he lowered his pistol. He knew I could shoot him. He also knew I would n't. This boy, not much older than me, had just shown me mercy, a mysterious force on this battlefield. Few could even fathom such a concept, and yet he showed me it in it's truest form. For that, I am forever in his gratitude. 
 
 I do n't know if I would've spoken to the boy, had I had the chance. I think I would have. I at least would have got his name. 
 
 None of that matters though, because at that moment all I could see was the bullet, exiting the front of his chest, and burying itself in the ground. He fell to the ground, and in the distance I saw another soldier, one of our own men, also about my age, his pistol in hand and facing where the boy once stood. 
 
 The only difference between him and us: the eyes.
