Years before this, I kept a set of tungsten baoding balls on my desk. A gift from my wife when things were better, before our fights about money, misspent time and our dead bedroom. I'd kept them on display, occasionally glancing at them for an easy distraction from work, not quite appreciating their value. 
 
 When things were rough at the office, I'd pull them out, grasping at the cold tungsten with my degrading fine motor skills, feeling my age creep up ever so quickly. Tungsten in hand, I could concentrate solely on the flexing and unflexing of my muscles, in a clumsy attempt to move my aging tendons. At first, it was easy to become distracted by the clutter of unfinished work, the ache in my neck, the hum of fluorescent lights, the whine from my computer and the noise pollution outside my half-hazardly drawn blinds. Over time, I found that I could ignore all that and focus my attention on those barely imperceptible metallic echoes. Leaning back in my chair, eyes closed, tungsten in hand I could find tranquility and with it a little bit of my disappearing sanity. 
 
 A voice draws me from the void: `` Chief, we've got a report of three gobs over at McIllhenny park.'' 
 
 I open my eyes, sitting up, while my hand continues it circular task. Slowly, the noise of the office comes back into my listening range, but for now it stays at the fringe of my hearing. 
 
 `` Thanks for the notification, McCrillis, I'll choose today's squad.'' The officer's dull eyes, light up for a brief moment at my words and then return to their native dullness. 
 
 Doors closed. Blinds drawn. I look around furtively, scanning for any opening. I see none and bring my hand over my desk and quickly open my palm. Tungsten dice clatter onto the metal desk. 2, 5, 6. 
 
 I mutter aloud, speaking to nobody, `` Fortune's Favor''. Reaching down I pick up the first die, and quickly reroll it. 1. 
 
 My heart quickens. As I stand up, I can feel blood rushing to every corner of my body and a familiar warmth takes me. 
 
 Picking up my badge and firearm. I open the door, as my voice cuts through the noise: `` McCrillis, Wall! Let's go. I'm running point.''
