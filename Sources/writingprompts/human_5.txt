The dew laden blades of grass glisten in the light of a new born day as the sun breaks over the horizon once again and illuminates the world. Birds can be heard chirping and frolicking through the dense evergreen forest that lines the still lake. A doe and fawn can be seen slowly picking through the underbrush, stopping occasionally to munch on a berry here and there. I wake from my slumber as the light and warmth of the sun reaches my face. I stretch and yawn wincing as the brisk air fills my lungs for the first time in this cycle of wakefulness. I blink the sleep from my eyes, hesitating to move for fear of disturbing the perfect silence that nature has created.
