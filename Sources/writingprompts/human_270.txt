`` This is it.'' The familiar voice echoed into the dazzling light `` This is the end of our path.'' 
 
 Everything was blurry, and I ca n't see anything. The room we just walked in vanished, and we were both floating somewhere that I did n't even know. But I was sure, we both smiled, like always. We both knew this would come, and we both felt the same way. 
 
 `` There can be only one. For our own sake.'' His voice suddenly filled with sadness. 
 
 `` Do n't worry, I understand.'' I tried to reach my hand toward his blurry image to rub his back, but I guess I did n't even have hands anymore. 
 
 `` I wish I knew how to say goodbye.'' He sighed `` I never had to do that before.'' 
 
 `` Everything has its first time.'' I said `` You'll have to say goodbye many times more.'' 
 
 `` So... are you ready?'' He asked inconsistently 
 
 `` You already had the answer in your head.'' I smiled `` I'm ready.'' 
 
 Without a single warning, it began. I can feel every last bit of my body slowly vanishing away, into the glowing light. It did n't hurt, but rather comfortable. He would never hurt me, because it would hurt him more than what he did to me. 
 
 ``'' Promise me something...'' I muttered with all that left of me. 
 
 `` Anything, my other half.'' I could felt he coming close to me, gently putting his hand on my cheek. I wish I could see him well for one last time. Just one time. 
 
 `` before I close my eyes for the last time, let me see the darkness once more... take me to the black abyss... leave me in the void... Where I belong to.'' 
 
 `` I will.'' He murmured. The light suddenly turned off - his warmth faded away. I closed my eyes, whispered my last words to the void. 
 
 `` Goodbye.''

 Silence covered the room for a moment - that moment felt like an entity for both of the people inside. 
 
 `` I guess you did it, Peter.'' The man in white clothes said. 
 
 `` Yes, doc. I did it.'' Peter said with his eyes closed. He lied on the sofa while the doctor was writing something on his desk. 
 
 `` How do you feel now?'' The doctor turned back to see him. 
 
 `` I feel... strange.'' 
 
 `` You will get on with it soon.'' The doctor smiled. `` For now, you can leave. I'll contact you later if you need.'' 
 
 As the man bewildered, slowly standing up and leaving the room, the doctor took a deep breath of relief, wrote in his notebook: 
 
 `` Patient: Peter Jan 
 
 Diagnose: Multi personalities 
 
 Status: In good condition, probably cured.''
