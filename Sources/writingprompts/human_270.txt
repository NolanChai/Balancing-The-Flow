Lilly borrowed her father's metal detector, which up until then lay rusting in the garden shed after her father failed to find Roman coins from his 28 minutes on the beach. Lilly took the detector far and wide, going beyond her usual play area and into thicker undergrowth. It sounded a beep near the foot of an oak, and Lilly, no more than 4 foot tall, had dug diligently using her plastic spade. 
 
 Lilly had been working her way through the dirt for some weeks now, and she finally hit metal after her strenuous efforts. It took another day to properly excavate what turned out to be a metal box, caked in dirt, for which she stole the egg-wash brush from the kitchen to dust off. 
 
 When the box finally saw daylight, its gold face and rounded platinum edges sparkled slightly in the lazy sun. It was incredibly ornate, and brought a sense of drama and achievement to Lilly's endeavours. Since it was about the size of a Rubik's cube, Lilly picked up the box and gave the extravagant child's toy a small twist. The box gave way, but not wholeheartedly, and after a few more careful tests to see if it would break, Lilly put her strength and twisted the box down the middle, and the two sides rotated to make the box match perfectly once again. 
 
 A slow, but steady, rumble began to roll from the sky, but no black clouds nor rain appeared. As Lilly looked for thunder and lightning, the noise grew to a noticeable dissonance, but sounded too far away for her to care much about. 
 
 After no sign of rain, Lilly turned her attention back to the trinket box, carefully spinning it around, when she saw one word written in Roman letters emblazoned on one of the sides: *Laputa*
