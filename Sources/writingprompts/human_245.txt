I hate you. 
 
 Ever since the first time I heard you take violin lessons in the other side of the wall when you were eight, I have hated you. Do you have an idea of how it's like, to live next to a cat with a chalkboard and nothing to do but sharpen its nails? Because it was just like that for two straight years. 
 
 And no, kid. You did n't actually get less awful with time. The only thing that improved was your teacher's wallet. 
 
 I hated your video game music. I hated your cartoon music. I hated your stupid as hell enlightened phase with a lot of Enya soundalikes whispering over waterfall noises. 
 
 You were even worse once you reached eighteen. I lost count of all the nights your broken bottles and shouts and music kept me awake well after midnight. 
 
 And right when I did n't think it could get worse, you got married and two months later you started the daily jealousy arguments. Who cares about Mike? He's her cousing and you're supposed to be an adult. Stop asking her if she saw, has seen or will see Mike, for chrissake! 
 
 Not to mention the snoring. 
 
 But I'm drawing the line here, kid. I put up with all that, plus your own awful kid watching cartoons and throwing tantrums, but if you make him start taking violin lessons, I'll fucking kill both of you.
