`` God dammit!'' 
 I punched the wall in anger. I saw the mirror shake a bit. I glanced again to see if it was true. 
 The space above my head was empty. Blank. Nothing. no number, no latter, not even a floating dirt stain. 
 `` I ca n't believe this!'' I shouted again. `` You see it too, Bruce?'' 
 `` Yes Adolf, I see that too. The numbers are gone.'' 
 We both stood in silence for a few moments. Or minutes. I could n't even tell the difference. All I could think about was the numbers. 
 `` What now?'' I asked. Honestly, what more could I do? Without the numbers, there was no more meaning. Everything I thought about, it always had the numbers. And now.. 
 `` Well, you could try writing about some Greek gods.. Erm, super powers seems to be popular with the kids those da..'' 
 `` Nein!'' I screamed! He did n't understand. The numbers, they are all that mattered. I could hardly go a few minutes without thinking about them. And now, they are gone. All gone. 
 `` You know, you could write about wishes again...'' 
 `` Wishes? Wieshes? This is n't nineteen bloody ninety five! Nobody writes about wishes! ARGH!'' 
 I looked in the mirror again. I saw tears in my reflection's eyes. 
 Bats did n't say anything for a few minutes. 
 `` I'm sorry Adolf. But we have to move on now''. 
 `` What now? Write another short story about Lucifer? Or do you want to write about some damn aliens again? Blah!'' I spit in disgust. 
 Why would they do it? Why would the mods remove all stories with those rad, beautiful floating numbers above people's heads? 
 My life is ruined, I realized. 
 I took the Chronoport amulet out of my pocket. I glanced behind my back - Bruce was n't looking. 
 Nineteen... Nineteen. 
 If I have to suffer, I will make sure the world suffers with me.
