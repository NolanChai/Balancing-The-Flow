Sarah had been left all alone since the plague, but she had been old enough to read her sister's well hidden books. 
 
 She'd found them before Rabecca had passed, when she was too sick to stop her younger sister from going through her things. They were stashed in a small closet hidden by her more public bookshelf, along with several candles and a pot. 
 
 Sarah immediately began gathering the materials she'd need. She'd seen how fast the disease struck people down and had originally had the intention of keeping her sister alive. Unfortunately, that's not what happened. 
 
 When her sister, who was by that time delirious, saw what Sarah was setting up to do, she found new strength. Sarah had to tie her down with ropes to keep her still. 
 
 Sarah lit the candles and began the spell. Rabecca struggled hard and stopped moving in the middle of it all. The book said once it was started it could n't be stopped, so Sarah continued on. It was worth it to her in the end, as it brought Rabecca back. 
 
 Sarah cut off her bonds and happily told her sister she'd saved her life. She was dead and she, Sarah, had saved her. There was n't even a glimmer of happiness in her sister's eyes, however. At first there was anger, but later it was replaced by what could only be described as a look of ever increasing boredom. 
 
 She was n't the same after the illness. After further reading, Sarah discovered that when the spell was performed over someone already dead, they would only forever after be able to perform tasks given to them by the person who cast the spell. There was quite a warning about what a hell it would be for the person brought back, as they would retain all ability to think. Even so, their performance at any given task would only be as good as it was described by the spell caster. 
 
 Sarah was n't worried, however. She kept her sister very busy. It was even better than before. Since Rabecca had gotten older she hated hanging around with her. She said she had better things to do than hang with little kids. 
 
 `` I know what would be fun!'' Sarah said to her big sister, `` You can comb my hair 100 strokes a day. Then we can have a tea party.'' She bounced over and climbed up on the chair, happily resting her new favorite book on her lap. 
 
 Everything was going to be just fine.
