It was n't always like this. 
 
 The new religion of /r/circlejerk and the cult of GabeN. The girls of /r/gonewild being treated like gods, the men of /r/guns controlling everything, with /r/worldnews being about reddit, /r/AdviceAnimals being more than just a wasteland of karma. 
 
 But then, that's what's it all about, then. Karma. The more karma you have, the better you are. It's hyper-inflationary. What 10k commanded at the beginning, was what 100k commanded now. Wars were fought over comment karma vs link karma. 
 
 Really, the best thing was to huddle in the smaller subreddits, particularly fap subreddits. No one was going to kick you out for posting tits to /r/hucow, but they might for posting something to /r/Gaming4Gamers 
 
 Which by the way, I was in the /r/hucow territory. A little dairy farm set way out in the midwest. Middle of nowhere, next to the slightly bigger /r/farming and /r/kansas 
 
 Really, just off of 35, set in about 15 acres was an old dairy farm, set to be /r/hucows new residence. 
 
 I was the messenger. I knew the roads from /r/kansas down to /r/texas and up to /r/northdakota and west to /r/Colorado 
 
 But mainly, my travels took me to /r/lactation and /r/kansas and back. Just making the usual mail delivery between friends split up between /r/Hucow and /r/lactation and making sure our little farm could continue exists on our hamlet. Which it could, as long as a certain mod got his special milk. But lately, he was asking for more and more. Our girls were wondering if they could keep up with demand. 
 
 Really what we needed was a supply of Domperidone, which increase milk supply. But that was n't going to happen, as /r/lactation was getting antsy. So I was making a trip over to /r/guns to make a purchase from a guy named /u/zaptal_47 who was a mod there and commanded a large supply of guns. Hopefully, we could take on /r/kansas, but who knew? 
 
 Really, it came down to how long the girls could last. We only had so much for trade. Thank god we had some good karma after selling the old tractors to /r/cars. Not much, but some. Hopefully, it would n't start before I got back.
