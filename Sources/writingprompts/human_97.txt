I loved the feeling of the cool night air from my open window. I was leaning against my windowsill, staring up at the stars, softly singing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star. I focused my attention on a certain star, the biggest one that I could see. But as I repeated the song, staring at the star, I realized it was... growing *bigger*. Bigger and bigger, until its light illuminated my entire room. And then the light rapidly dimmed, dulling out to a smooth glow, leaving a humanlike figure in its wake. The figure stood, or floated rather, directly outside my window, and then a gentle voice rang out: `` Hello? Where am I?'' 
 
 I did n't know what to say, how to react, or whether this was a dream. The words had left my mouth nearly before I realized it: `` This is my room.'' 
 
 `` It's nice,'' the voice murmured. The figure edged closer, and its features sharpened until I could make out what it was: a girl. She looked like an ordinary girl, about my age, except she was kind of blueish gray, and glowing. I was hardly confused, just mesmerized. I decided to just speak, discover who this was. Maybe I could make a new friend. `` Who are you? What's your name? How did-'' 
 
 My questions were interrupted by the girl's small giggle. `` You ask a lot of questions. My name's Ella, and I'm an angel. I did n't wan na stay up in the sky,'cause it was boring, so I came down here. What's your name?'' 
 
 `` I'm Devon, and I'm seven. I did n't know angels were real, do a lot of angels leave the sky?'' 
 
 `` Devon?'' Mom's voice came from the other side of the bedroom door. `` Who are you talking to?'' 
 
 I gasped in horror, would Mom like Ella? Would Ella like Mom? I looked to the angel for answers, and she smiled. I wanted to say something, but nothing was coming from my half-open mouth; so I called back, `` Um...'' I wondered if I should tell Mom the truth. She smiled again, broader this time, and nodded gently. I took it as a verification and continued, `` An angel. She's my new friend.'' 
 
 `` What? What are you talking about, honey?'' Mom opened my door while halfway through her inquiry, and looked at me quizzically. 
 
 `` Right here, her name's Ella! She's really pretty, is n't she?'' I looked to the angel, who could have been blushing, but for a lack of skin color only grinned sheepishly. I heard her murmur something like, `` Well thank you...'' 
 
 `` Who?'' My mom's voice reached my ears again. It was my turn to be confused; she saw Ella, did n't she? She had to. Ella was n't invisible. I shrugged it off, excusing my mom's ignorance with her bad hearing. `` Ella,'' I repeated. `` She's an angel, from the sky.'' I added a smile at the end for good measure. 
 
 `` Oh...'' My mom trailed off for a few seconds. `` Well...'' she continued, oddly avoiding my gaze, but also not looking at Ella. `` I-I just wanted to tell you that, er, you have a doctor's appointment tomorrow, so you should get a good night's sleep.'' 
 
 `` Oh, ok!'' I replied cheerily. I was ok with that, even if it was a shorter notice than usual. I turned to Ella. `` Maybe we can talk again tomorrow. Is that ok?'' 
 
 She smiled once again and gave a tiny nod, though the smile looked smaller, not as happy as the previous ones. And as she backed away, out of my window, I could swear I saw a flicker of sadness in her blue-gray eyes.
