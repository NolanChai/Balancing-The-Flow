I can not walk through walls. I can not even open doors if God does not will it so. While studying the knick-knacks of my grandson ’ s dresser, the museum of disassociated memories, someone shut the door, trapping me in the bedroom during their summer holiday. They went to Cape Cod. I am stuck in Providence in the house I grew up in. 
 
 I remember closing my eyes while I laid on a hospital gurney, staring up at a fluorescent light while my daughters wept and sung Sweet Caroline to me. That was their mother ’ s name. I would tease their mother, singing it to her. When she died, I could not listen to the radio since if by some circumstance the song would come on, my productivity ceased for the day with me falling asleep on a couch. My daughter ’ s sung `` Good times never felt so good'' to me as I passed, and I woke up on the couch. I looked around and the house was empty. Boxes were being packed with my belongings. I am not a dense man. When my family came home in their Sunday best, and my son-in-law stared through me while he took off his coat, I knew that I existed on a shared reality, but not on theirs alone. 
 
 I searched for Caroline in the house. She was not here with me. Was there another place she called home that was not where we grew old and raised our babies? I grieved selfishly and asked God every day if I did not have to spend eternity alone. His response was cold and spiteful. I became acutely aware to the menacing noises around my house. Phantoms and ghouls haunting my family. I stopped a malignant spirit from climbing in through a window. He cracked open the window, and with all my might I slammed the windows down on his fingers, snapping them. He howled, causing Eric and Sabrina to awaken and investigate the noise. They found the window slightly open, and their flowerbed trampled. They called the police and had a security system installed. 
 
 The house was my daughter ’ s inheritance, and the ghost of her father is an amenity. I realized that I am not a prisoner, but a warden. God had kept me close to my family so I can be a guardian angel. Within the walls of the house they will stay protected by my constant vigil. I patrolled the hallway, then relaxed across the couch and watch the television that nobody bothered to turn off when everyone went to bed. 
 
 The week of the vacation made me feel stir crazy. I watched the window like a dog hoping they would all return safe. Without responsibility I felt as useless at the toys collecting dust on my grandson ’ s dresser. I started to think abstractly. Wouldn ’ t it be fun to scare my family from time to time? Make them sit up in their beds, their eyes seeking rapidly around their room for the noise that woke them? Grandpa ’ s teasing us again. I shook my head and resolved not to think of such nonsense. I began to sympathize with the ghouls. They were probably just like me at one point until they were abandoned by their families and left in an empty house. The families that moved in afterwards would either have to get used to the eccentric stranger amongst them or move. 
 
 I wondered what would happen if the family moved. Would I travel with them, tethered to my descendents like a kite? Or would my existence cease with my function? I thought about the ghouls again. I wondered if my disassociation would change me. The children of new homeowners searching in the dark with flashlights, looking for the noises that old houses make. Would I transform with their imaginations? Would I grow giant gnarled claws, tusks which sank into my bloodless jowls as my body metamorphosed into a malignant creature, once the proud grandparent of many grandchildren? Disassociation and association. A hoarder's festering trash heep was once their prized possessions. 
 
 I laughed at myself, remembering the days where I only used to worry about what I was feeding my family on the weekends. BBQ mostly. I sat alone on my grandson's bed, which I remember building with Sabrina, and then thought about where I would go if the house was destroyed. Would I pass on too to a second death? Or would I be free to wander the earth? Could I find Caroline? If that were the case, please God let a tornado pass through the neighborhood while my family enjoys the beaches of Cape Cod. If that ’ s not the case, let my family come home safe and let me get on with my life.
