John was hiking through the dense woods, he liked to go off the trail to explore but always was able to find the way back, he knew these woods fairly well. He thought he saw something in the distance that glimmered like a diamond. He went towards the glimmer and soon came across a beautiful crystal, several feet high and wide. The great crystal protruded from the ground vertically. John stopped a moment to admire the crystal and pondered where it had come from and why it was here. 
 
 Suddenly, the crystal spoke in a shrill panicked tone, *'' I sense, I sense a presence, who goes there? Another woodland creature? No, bigger, the soul that lives on even after death, answer! answer! `` * 
 
 John was startled, but soon found the composure to answer, `` It's not an animal, I'm John, who are you?'' 
 
 The Crystal answered him, *'' I am a prisoner, prisoner of this crystal, I need a chosen to release me, release me, I've been here for centuries! `` * 
 
 John cocked his head, `` Chosen?'' 
 
 The Prisoner in the Crystal answered, *'' Yes, yes, chosen, one of God's chosen, bearer of the Holy Spirit, release me! `` * 
 
 John returned his head to an upright position, `` Are you, an angel?'' 
 
 The Prisoner answered, *'' Yes, yes, an angel, one of the highest ranked there are and you must free me, quickly, quickly! `` * 
 
 John questioned further, `` How?'' 
 
 The Prisoner explained, *'' Put your hand on my prison, this is a sign of your acceptance to let me go, do it now, now, now! `` * 
 
 John complied, as he did not know what else to do, and he knew angels were good, right? He put his hand on the crystal, and suddenly it began to glow with a bright light and John felt his hand unable to move and a powerful energy flowed through his body. The feeling faded, and then the crystal dissipated into thin air and the prisoner flew a few feet above and cried out, *'' Free! Free at last, a thousand years of the abyss, the abyss, now I shall wreak my vengeance upon Heaven and Earth! `` * 
 
 And thus, a revelation was fulfilled, and John sat in awe.
