Desire is the impetus of mankind. It is our driving force. But, what if all we want is something simple? Something denied us? I spent the last couple of days battling demons, throwing off shackles, and conquering devils. I had a need, a thirst. One would think it would be a simple conjuration. A slight tug on the elements and BAM, my thirst is quenched. It was n't so easy. Magic in Fae is different, I could n't simply grab a couple of hydrogen atoms from air and slam it together with some oxygen. I am not even sure what I was breathing was oxygen. 
 
 This side of the realm is different, disjointed. Sure, I could try to call up my magic. I could force what I thought was hydrogen and oxygen together. I might form the fires of hell for all I know. That would be rich, I'd throw my magical chemistry set together and BOOM! I get napalm or some other scary as hell shit. 
 
 What does it take for a man to get a fucking drink of water? I mean seriously, I just need a glass of water, hell, I'd settle for a stream.
