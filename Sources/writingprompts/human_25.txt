`` Not again,'' my coworker said. `` You know one of these days the player is going to arrive before you.'' 
 
 `` I know, I know. I'm really sorry I arrived late again.'' I said like it was the first time even though it was probably the hundredth time. `` It's just that you know that I do n't really like this job.'' 
 
 `` You always say that, yet you have n't looked for a solution.'' she said. `` Besides this job is not that bad. We have our own property, we do n't have to mine the gold for coins, we trade for it. There is no chance of the player or another NPC killing us.'' 
 
 `` Yes and that's the problem. We always follow the same routine, even if there is no player at the time. It's really boring being the standard invulnerable shopkeepers. Also you know that we are not invulnerable, it's just that the players here are n't allowed to attack us,'' I answered quickly. To be honest I had been thinking about this for a while. Life like this tends to be boring, especially with only one player going around at the moment. I wish we were n't allocated to a single-player zone. My cousins in the MMORPG zone have it better than me, even though they can sometimes be robbed and mugged. But what's life without some risk? I want to find out. 
 
 `` So what's your solution? You do have the experience to move on to another genre. Maybe you ca n't get a fancy job as an A.I. bot with respawn privileges but I bet you could become minion if you really want that risky life or maybe be part of a tutoria-'' 
 
 `` No, I want more,'' I interrupted her. `` I want to be like the players, who roam around and can have any adventure they want!'' 
 
 `` Hahaha you know that's impossible. Players are born and picked because of their unique qualities. Even if you had those qualities, you would n't know it because they do n't tell the people what are those qualities that make you apt to be a player. If somebody else heard what you said, they would probably think that you are a villain in the making,'' she said somewhat worried. 
 
 `` Trust me, I do n't want to be a villain or a hero for that matter. I just want to be a player so I can go out wherever I want and whenever I want. It's not about the risks and rewards of that live, it's about being able to make your own choic-'' 
 
 Sadly I never finished that sentence since I heard the doorbell ring. Suddenly we went quiet, like our job said we should do and started to recite the same lines we had been saying for the past years every time a player went into our store. As usual the player grunted, dropped a lot of stuff to sell and we traded it for the established amount of money. 
 
 The worst part of it was that the player used to be my friend. We played around as kids until suddenly he was picked to be a player. Since then he does n't really care about me or his family. It's like he remembers but chooses to ignore us, like he was somebody else. My family tells me to be proud of him, because of him we attained the status of secondary characters. All of my family except me, who somehow was designed a tertiary character left to be forgotten. 
 
 After he left, my coworker left looking annoyed since we could have been found out not acting in character by a player no less. That would have been definitely a capital punishment. Now that I was alone, I went through the stuff of the player in order to sending the appropriate materials to the recycling plant so they could be used in creating more items. 
 
 I was so depressed of doing this again until I found something that looked like a machine, very different from the technology of the zone and even different from the genre we were in. It looked like some kind of computer and it was logged in with the profile of my friend. Before I could tell my coworker about my rare discovery, I found two options on the computer: log out and change player. 
 
 Without hesitation I selected change player.
