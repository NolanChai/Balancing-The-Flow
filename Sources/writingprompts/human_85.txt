As I look at my caller ID I ’ m briefly dumbfounded as I try to wrap my head around the idea this number would call *me*. I accept the call and put the earpiece to my ear. 
 
 “ Repeat, this is an emergency broadcast to residents of the suburban northwest area. Find shelter immediately and at all costs do not leave. Find cover in a central area of your home away from any windows, mirrors, or other breakable materials. Repeat, this is an emergency broadcast… ” 
 
 The message continued to repeat as I worked out the possibilities, none of them were good. I ran for the front door and called out to my father who was in the garden. “ Dad, get inside quickly, it ’ s an emergency! ” 
 
 He looked up at me in confusion and as he opened his mouth, I saw it. A bright streak of light moving quickly towards the ground. I only had a second to react and it was already too late. 
 
 The object struck the ground a few miles away and large flash of light momentarily blinded me. A few seconds later a blast of wind sent my dad air born and flying towards a window. Before I could blink I was launched through my house and hit a wall. The nearby window shattered, the shards flying towards me. 
 
 I threw my arms over my face to protect me from the brunt of the glass and felt a shard pierce my shoulder. I heard a large object hit the wall in the next room over. *dad*. 
 
 The house took a beating, part of a wall collapsed after being struck by large piece of debris. I could see part of a tree lodged inside our living room. After a few seconds, I summoned the strength to get up and limped to the next room over where I found my dad unconscious on the ground. I checked him over and did n't see any major injuries so as carefully as I could I woke him up. 
 
 “ What the hell… ” He managed to groan, trying to turn over “ Are you okay? ” 
 
 I pulled a glass shard out of my arm “ I think I ’ ve been better. I ’ ve got a large shard in my shoulder but it ’ s nowhere near any major arteries or veins. Do me a favor and pull it. ” 
 
 “ We need to get you to a hospital ” My dad said urgently, trying to get up. 
 
 “ They ’ re not going to help me, I ’ m not hurt enough to warrant the resources and they ’ re about to be hit with a lot of people that are much worse off than we are right now. Just pull the damned thing, there ’ s work to do. ” 
 
 My dad reached for the glass sticking out of my shoulder and looked at me. 
 
 “ On three ” I said “ one, two, *three* ” I moved backwards while he pulled the glass. A sharp pain burned through my body as the glass departed, but I could finally move my arm again. 
 
 We both got up and looked out the broken window towards the devastation and the giant cloud. 
 
 “ It must be a nuke ” My dad said 
 
 “ No, I ’ m betting meteor, there was a long streak of light and it glowed. Missiles make cloud trails and a dead drop bomb is essentially invisible unless you know where to look. ” 
 
 We stood watching the devastation unfold for a while until I left and grabbed my boots. 
 
 “ What are you doing? ” My dad asked, concerned. 
 
 “ There ’ s folks out there who need help. ” I said as I laced up. “ We have only a short window of time to save as many as possible. Before the ash begins to descend and chokes us to death. Get the car loaded with survival equipment and be ready to go. If the neighbors want to convoy out with us, then help them if you can. I ’ m going to check nearby for collapsed buildings and see if I can get anyone to safety. ” I grabbed my welding gloves, hatchet, some rope, and my only weapon, a revolver. I tore a towel and made a makeshift mask “ I ’ ll be back within 60 minutes ” I said as I walked out the front door.
