When the people of the sky came, and took the land as their home, we the people of the sea felt a sense of trepidation. Many worried that they would seek to dominate us, and they were proven right. 
 
 Within a few generations, we were a defeated people, forced to abandon or costal bases, which were torn down. We were stripped of our technology and forced to go about naked. That final insult was what would lead to their downfall. We passed out tales down for generations, and we made our plans. 
 
 Those plans almost fell apart when the crown prince was swimming one day. He was torn apart, and his body had been... violated. All signs pointed to one our own having done the dark deed. This prompted our leader to activate the doomsday weapon we'd built beneath the sea. A wave of sound traveled across the continent where they'd settled and it drove them insane. They all stripped naked and fled their new homeland. After that we set about sinking the entire continent so that they could never reclaim their science. 
 
 As we were thrust into nakedness, so too were they. We continued to be naked, and we kept our technology down in the far depths where they could not reach. In recent generations, they've regain a small inkling of their lost genius. They've started building wooden vessels to travel across our domain. We keep watch upon them, to see if they're resume their previous wickedness. 
 
 The funniest part, is that in their brief generations of madness, they've forgotten all about us. These days, they see as simple animals, harmless and dumb. Many of them do n't even realize that we're mammals. They think us fish. It's insulting, but their ignorance may be our only safety.
