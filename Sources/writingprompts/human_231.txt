Those eyes. Slightly widened, entirely wild, flicking back and forth rapidly to focus on mine. I see your desperation. I can taste your fear. Your face is so close to mine. But you wo n't escape. I think... I think she escaped. I hardly even got a look at her. I hope... I hope she does n't mourn for me. She does n't know... this is what I want. Her footsteps have faded. That's good. 
 
 And now, it's just me and you, my new friend. Even if you manage to break this bear hug I have you in, you'll never get away. That little pointy stick you've put into my gut wo n't end me for minutes. Between the you and I, time is on my side. Every second that ticks by, an even stronger snare closes around you. Even if my strength fails before help arrives, I've painted you for the police to find as surely as a environmentalist paints a seal. But as their mark protects the life of an animal from a human predator, so mine has turned you from predator into prey. But why should I waste my final moments thinking about you? 
 
 Every second that ticks by brings my closer to where I want to be. My dearest love, I miss you so. I come to you now. Soon...
