Charlie's eyes grew wide as the LED on the ATM flickered to life. Eight digits, and there were n't any decimal points. He would pay off his loans and his credit cards and perhaps still have enough to go into debt once more and pay it off yet again. All those days of living by the dollar had finally paid off. Charlie kissed the ATM, then spat as it shot a one hundred-dollar bill into his mouth. 
 
 He threw himself back on his bed and sighed, listening to the machine crank out his payment. Gears creaked and ground against each other, screeching under the effort, but those sounds were the chorus of paradise for all Charlie cared. He watched each bill flutter from the emission slot, joining the rest in a mess on the floor. This would take a while: 700 thousand bills was... a lot. Charlie yawned and rested his head onto his pillow, the fluttering bills mesmerizing him into sleep. 
 
 Charlie awoke to the largest, greenest Benjamin Franklin memorial pressing down upon him. He struggled to get up, but could n't move. During his sleep, the machine had spit more bills than PBS throughout the'90s, and they'd piled into a humungous ball of money that occupied the entire room. Its full mass was now bearing down on Charlie, slowly choking the air from his lungs. 
 
 He tried to shift his arms and legs, but nothing budged. The money above him refused to yield to the craning of his neck as well. To think that a promise of financial freedom had turned into this green-walled prison so quickly. Charlie forced his lip upwards to scream, but to no avail: bills began to fall into his mouth, prickling his tongue with their leathery surfaces. *At least*, he thought, as his senses began to shut down, *they had n't been quarters*.
