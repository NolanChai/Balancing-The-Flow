 The city, she's a war zone kid. Ya know, I never truly knew how bad it was till the day I got my badge. I guess it's one of those things you got ta see to believe. Ya got all these busy folk living high in their towers, they do n't know how it is on the streets. Their nose's is too high to smell the stink and their eyes are always focused on the future. For the last ten years though I've seen everything, I've smelled it all, and nothing surprises me. 
 
 That is until the day no ones got murdered. Some of the other boys called it a fluke, an easy day, just winding up the rubber band to snap harder tomorrow. I did n't know what to think. No one died? Bull, people is always dyin'. Except they were n't. They sun rose and sank over these grimy streets and not a single hooker, deadbeat, loan shark, gangster, addict, pentecostal, speeder, tourist, cabbie, or trash man died. Remarkable. 
 
 I could n't really sleep that night. Instead I watched as the snow fell in blankets covering the soot and dust of my streets. Behind the steam of my cup of joe I watched millimeters turn ta inches; inches ta feet, feet to... A whole fuckin lotta snow. 
 
 The next day it was the same story. Ya I know, one day's weird and'remarkable,' but two? That's uncanny. Something's fishy and I ai n't talkin about the Hudson. That night there was more snow. For the week that followed we Apple Eaters laid off one anotha. The only fights were the ones armed with snowballs conscripted by yelping kids three feets tall. And well for a minute I'll admit, and I ai n't proud to admit this, but I even relaxed a little. Drank myself some Jameson Irish Whiskey, ate a good steak, hell, I even took out this cute gal I'd been eyein in the office. Things were... Good. A little too good and dammit any blue worth his salt shoulda smelled the shit, but I did n't. 
 
 I do n't know maybe I did n't want to. Ten years of working the beat can really grind ya down. I was tired, so I took a break. Silly me, I shoulda known this city never sleeps or even takes a break for that matter. 
 
 When the snow finally melted we all saw the horror. Even them hootie tootie business types paused for a brief second to see the carnage. 
 
 They were everywhere. A week without bodies ended with the day of the dead. And I ai n't talkin about no fucking zombies. These were frozen, blue stiffs. The rubber band got wound up too tight and snapped right back in our faces. Beneath that blanket of ignorance I found my hookers, and my addicts, even my double-damned penteconstals. 
 
 All there. All dead. Murdered. 
 
 Back to the grind for all us boys in blue. We had a helluva lotta work to do. The trash men shoveled the corpses up and outta the streets, but the cold snow made some bits stick. I'm talking like hands, fingers, some teeth here and there, I even saw a whole foot once, but it did n't matter. Hell, no one cared, no one even noticed. Just more trash that'll wash down the drain and into the Atlantic eventually. Just some more dirt on our town. 
 
 The killin did n't wait for us to clean up or figure out that mess either. Twenty-four homicides the day after. Like a said, city's a fuckin war zone.
