Woke up to my phones alarm. Time to start the day and like any other day, I had to take a leak. I stretched the sleep out of my bones as I got up from my temperpedic mattress. 
 
 I reached for the handle and it would n't twist. 
 
 `` What the hell, Susan?!'' 
 
 I ca n't unlock it. 
 
 `` Honey! This is n't funny! Is this about last night?'' 
 
 I keep trying to open the door, but nothing. My bladder begins to swell and cause me pain as my urge to pee grows with it. I start slamming my body up against the door, but it does n't even budge! 
 
 That's when the shouting started. Strange men yelling from the other side of my door. With it also came the banging. Metal on metal. 
 
 Then it was one voice, loud and clear. I was being lifted up from the collar up my sleep scrubs. 
 
 `` Smith, get the fuck out of bed! You're late for roll call and we do n't take kindly to that here in this fine prison! 
 You'll learn that pretty quick fish.''
