*Della walked home today. Her mum forgot her again. Her mum Alice was married to her job. She rounded the corner and saw a car parked there. * 
 
 *The man sitting in it was her teacher Mr Rawlings. He was her favorite teacher. He never gave her homework. And he always had a special gift for her. He was like a father to her. Mr Rawlings saw Della `` Did your mum forget you again?'' Della had ha this conversation with him before. `` Yeah. She is always so busy with her job'' Mr Rawlings told her to hop in and he would give her a lift home. * 
 
 *As he drove past her street Della started to worry `` That's my street sir'' Mr Rawlings told her not to worry. He was going to take her for ice cream. Della believed him until they hit the outskirts of town. She did n't even know where she was anymore. `` Where are we going sir? `` she asked, she was getting scared now. Mr Rawlings pulled the car over and without a word smacked face. Her eyes welled up with tears. `` Do n't you even think about crying.'' His voice was sinister. He got out of the car, walked around and opened her door and ordered her out. * 
 
 *She did as she was told, afraid for what might happen. She shakily unbuckled the seat belt and was pulled out of the car and onto the ground. Rawlings bound her hands and feet and put a pillowcase over her head. He picked her up and shoved her into the back of the car, got in and kept driving. He knew he had a couple of hours to drive, her workaholic mum would n't even know she was missing until she got home at nearly midnight. * 
 
 Anthony Rawlings finished the chapter and slammed the book shut with a thud. He already knew what happened next. He had lived it. He had been hiding in England for 6 years now. Noone knew who he was or what he had done. He did n't speak to anyone for fear of being caught and yet here was an account of the crime he had committed in great detail. He had to know, was it a coincidence that the author of the book wrote this story? Or was there a witness that day?
