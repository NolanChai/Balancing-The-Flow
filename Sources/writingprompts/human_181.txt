First story on this sub, criticism would be appreciated! 
 I'm fairly certain that you can guess where I was when I got the inspiration for this story. 
 
 I looked around nervously as I sat in the waiting room, oddly similar to that of your standard doctors office. I looked around the room at the other faces, the other people coming to see the priests, to have their tattoos read for them. Oftentimes, they were easy to decipher, other times... well... that's what I was here for. 
 
 `` Alastar Furlan'' I heard called from beyond the dark wooden door. 
 
 A man with a dotted circular pattern spiraling out from the center of his face stood up and walked over to the door. The rest of us continued waiting, looking at each other's tattoos, trying to guess their past. 
 
 I looked to my left, at a bald woman. A pattern of thickly intertwined roots covered her head instead of hair. I can only wonder what that was there for. To my right sat another woman with a full sleeve that made her arm look mechanical, she gave a shy smile when she saw me looking. I smiled back. I'd do anything to brighten up this place. 
 
 `` Ulrik Paternoster'' I heard this time. Everybody looked around to see who was next. I slowly got out of my seat and walked to the door, pausing before opening it and walking through. Never having been in here before, I surveyed the new room before making my way to the wooden chair in the center. One of the priests walked up from my right side and said 
 
 `` Show me, my son'' 
 
 I slowly pulled up my pant legs one at a time to reveal the large and bright red marks on the top of my thighs. The priest sighed, and slowly shook his head. 
 
 `` What is it?'' I asked. 
 
 `` You've been browsing reddit of the toilet, have n't you.''
