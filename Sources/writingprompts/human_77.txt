ANNOUNCER 
 
 Today, like any other day, we have a submission from a person who wants the Trump team to weigh in on a certain topic. We've been doing this show for 3 weeks and I still ca n't get used to live broadcasts. Is it camera one? Are we even rolling? We ca n't do things like this when he's president, folks. We need to get our asses in gear.

 Alright, it looks like we're live on air for Trump TV this afternoon. We'll be looking at a certain prompt from a user of the Writing Prompts subreddit. The prompt reads thus: 
 
 ( Announcer reads the prompt ) 
 
 It sort of reminds you of a Christopher Nolan movie, does n't it? The director who floored a generation and made the word inception synonymous with mindfuck. On that note, I've heard of this prompt before in online mags. It seems its not a radical idea to pack a story chock full of as many twists as possible. For example, we found this story online that attempts to accomplish that exact thing.

 For us, though, the concept is very new. We have our greatest minds on the team thinking now about how they might handle this situation. They've considered using cliche plot twists to signal each new twist, such as a pregnancy surprise or a double-handed backstabbing motive for the character. On the other hand, the twists could be more subtle or singular. There could be a few greater, more interesting twists as well.

 Audience, I have a scene-stealing idea for a plot twist. Imagine this. You're walking in your hotel when you see the sign change, from Trump Tower, it's in the front of the building, so you would notice the change, by the way, to Clinton Mill. Astounding, right? But I suppose the prompt does call for more than one twist. Say the Clinton Mill is full of robots, or something. Then you find out it's all the politicians, the scoundrels, who are the robots. And get this, they've been robots all along! And you're going to be recruited to join their rhyming robot army to change the face of the nation. We could call the broadcast something like Zombie Television. That's all there is in the future anyway, is Zombie TV. Mindless advertising commercials and stories. And then it hits you... You're a zombie. That's a twist right there. I'd hate to find out I was a zombie. Trust me, I would kill myself a second time, if it were possible. I would n't want to be a walking corpse at all. And you know some people have this delusion, the Cotard delusion, I think its called, where they think they're already dead. To me, that sounds terrible. Youve really got it bad if you think you're dead already. The twist is in there, it's great, check it out, we'l have it written in 3 hours. 
 
 ANNOUNCER 
 
 Thank you Mr. President. Your input is of course highly regarded. Will there be any action in the coming script? 
 
 DONALD J TRUMP 
 
 Lots of action, terrifying action, and it will take everyone by surprise. 
 
 ANNOUNCER 
 
 What is the general direction the plot is taking so far, Mr. Trump? 
 
 DONALD J TRUMP 
 
 We're looking at taking two secret service agents through a CIA refuge in Afghanistan. They will meet some kind of mystery woman who will deliver all the twists. First, she's a hobo. Then, she's a billionaire. She orders a helicopter and tells the people she's already killed Osama Bin Ladin. Then, she reveals she's Hillary Clinton in digsuise. The secret agents turn on each other, one having voted for Clinton and the other voting for me. The one who voted for Clinton is majorly fat and falls out of the helicopter. Then, the second agent kills Hillary. It will sell millions. I absolutely can not wait. 
 
 ANNOUNCER 
 
 But why Afghanistan, if I may ask? 
 
 DONALD J TRUMP 
 
 Because that's where the war started. It's topical. It's in the current frame of mind. 
 
 ANNOUNCER 
 
 We are n't planning a war in Afghanistan, are we? Not another one! 
 
 DONALD J TRUMP 
 
 No, were sending Hillary there dressed as a hobo in disguise. Why are n't you paying attention? 
 
 ANNOUNCER 
 
 I didnt realize the prompt was actually going to happen. I suppose I thought we were just writing stories. 
 
 DONALD J TRUMP 
 
 Life imitates art. We're going to flesh it out as a story first, and see if it pans out the way we planned. You know life is but a stage, and we actors upon it. It's a narrative people are after, something they can digest and understand. We want people to be aware, comfortable they know what's going on. 
 
 ANNOUNCER 
 
 Even entertained? 
 
 DONALD J TRUMP 
 
 My presidency wo n't be a reality show, guy. But, I suppos that it may be entertaining. 
 
 ANNOUNCER 
 
 And all of the viewers of Trump TV will be tuning in every week for that kind of story. You'll hear it here first. If you do n't hear it here, it's not happening. We're the ultimate all-action news channel. Thanks for tuning in. That's all the time we have for today.
