`` I WON! I WON!'' 
 
 I still ca n't believe it. $ 326 million. Three-hundred and twenty-six million dollars. 
 
 Well…half of it anyway. Figures that the one time I'm lucky enough to win the jackpot, I'd have to share it with another winner. 
 
 Ha, I ca n't stop grinning, walking down the street to my bank knowing I have a $ 163 million check to my name in my pocket. My whole life is about to change. 
 
 Then, all of a sudden, BAM! Two guys grabbed me, threw me in a moving van, and tied me up. 
 
 `` What?! What is this?! What's going on?!'' I yell. 
 
 `` Nice try, Mr. Smith. We caught you,'' one of them says, while the other takes out what looks like a fancy iPhone I've never seen before. 
 
 `` Wh—what? What are you talking about? Caught me doing what? Who are you guys? Where are we going?'' 
 
 They bring up a hologram projection with their fancy iPhone; I did n't know we had those already! They report to who appears to be their boss: `` Sir, we caught another time traveler here trying to cash his jackpot prize—Jack Smith. He's trying to play dumb like they always do. Ha.'' 
 
 `` Time traveler? Jack Smith? My name's *John* Smith! What is going on here?!'' I shout. 
 
 Silence. They look at each other in shock. One of them knocks me down and grabs my wallet from my back pocket, frantically checking my ID. 
 
 `` Oh, FUCK! SHIT! SHIT! SHIT! We grabbed the wrong guy! SHIT! What do we do now?! Jack Smith got away! He probably cashed in his jackpot check and returned to 2164 by now!'' 
 
 `` Shit. We're too late with that. But we have another problem on our hands now…'' 
 
 They both turn towards me. 
 
 `` Do we…kill him?'' one of them asks. 
 
 `` No. No, we ca n't do that…'' 
 
 `` But he knows to much now!'' 
 
 `` I wo n't say anything, I swear! Please just let me go! No one would even believe me.'' Holy shit. I finally win the lottery, and this is what I get? Some damn luck. 
 
 They both think about it silently for a minute. 
 
 Finally, one of them says, `` There's only one thing we can do.'' He whispers into the driver's ear before he turns back to me, `` Mr. John Smith…you're going to 2164.''
