I was late to work for the third time that week and I had realized on the subway that I'd forgotten to brush my teeth. A normal Thursday for me. 
 
 As I walked hurriedly down the street, I was suddenly stopped by a loud voice screaming, `` Melinda! Melinda Parsons!'' 
 
 I turned to the woman screaming, who was running after me now. She had matted, dirty hair and a face blackened with soot and soil. Her clothes were threadbare and mismatched. When I turned and made eye contact, however, her whole face lit up and she sprung towards me. 
 
 `` You have to understand,'' she was already sputtering, grasping the hems of my suit jacket in earnest, leaving dirty smears across my hands. `` Please believe me!'' 
 
 `` I do,'' I said, smiling a little. 
 
 `` You're Melinda Jones, and I know that, because I'm Paula Jones! I'm you're daughter! From the future! I have to show you something!'' 
 
 Her eyes were pleading. She looked to be in her early thirties, and she had n't yet released my sleeves. 
 
 `` Alright,'' I said agreeably. `` How did you know it was me?'' 
 
 She smiled a frenzied sort of smile and flashed me a grateful look. `` Because we look just alike!'' 
 
 I followed her obediently down a few side streets and along the river for a while. Of course I knew better- my mother had taught me to stay safe- but whatever survival instinct I'd been born with had long disappeared. 
 
 `` Paula,'' I said at last, `` I need to go to work.... So that no one suspects anything. Can I show you a safe place to stay until I'm out?'' 
 
 The intensity of her look startled me. 
 
 `` Are you sure it's safe? They're watching, you know.'' She said matter-of-factly. 
 
 `` I'm absolutely sure!'' I said. I took her by the hand a led her back, not the way we came from but a few streets over. 
 
 A friend greeted me at the door with a bemused smile, and Paula followed her inside while I continued on my way to work. 
 
 Noting the time, I pulled my phone out to call my coworker. 
 
 `` Jenny Michaels! It's nearly 10 and you're not here!'' She said as way of greeting. `` I ca n't cover for you every time!'' 
 
 `` Sorry, sorry, Luz,'' I replied, `` it was just-'' 
 
 `` That woman again? What was it, more aliens coming or another lost dog?'' 
 
 I frowned. 
 
 `` She's sick, Luz. And homeless. Leave her be. It wo n't hurt me to humor her.'' 
 
 `` You do n't even know the woman!'' She blurted out. 
 
 `` I do! I asked the woman at the Baptist women's shelter. Paula- that's the woman- she's been living there for several years. She's... She's not all right, in the head, but she ca n't afford treatment. So I-'' 
 
 `` Do n't tell me you're paying for drugs! Jenny, you can barely pay your own rent!'' 
 
 `` Do n't worry about it, Luz. I just feel bad for her. Can you imagine living a different truth every day?'' 
 
 Luz sighed and hung up on me. 
 
 I could n't imagine it, though. 
 
 So every day, I went along with what Paula said. I talked to her for a while, then took her back to the shelter, which was all I could do. 
 
 I thought about today's story- far more elaborate than the others. Me, her mother? And her, from the future? 
 
 I entertained the notion for a second, and was suddenly grounded with a familiar harsh shock that should have dulled by now. 
 
 I was unable to have children, all the doctors said so. 
 
 But in a way, she was like a daughter. The same age as me, and no relation, but was n't having children all about spending money and humoring them? 
 
 I figured that must be it.
