Strange noises came from the corridor, like the noise of a thousand of rats dancing to a waltz. The walls glowed with a sickly green pallor, strange veins of rust running rampant along its ways. The noise continued, continued, and then stopped, leaving the room silent but for the muffled cough and heavy breathing of our group. 
 
 “ Halt. ” I put my hand back, indicating for the group to stop. Zarkaz heaved his hammer, preparing for a fight. 
 
 “ What do you think it is? ” Mariah pulled her dagger from her belt loop. “ Trouble, like we ’ d seen before? ” 
 
 I raised my finger to my lips, indicating for them to be silent. No one had ever been this far before. At least, not this far and lived to tell the tale of it. Many bones and half rotted bodies laid testament to attempts to reach this point, but nary a one had reached this point. But for us. 
 
 To say that we were lucky was a lie. To say that we were both lucky and *skilled* wouldn ’ t be too far from the truth. But now? I feared our luck may be running out, and what lay ahead would be beyond even our capable hands. 
 
 Silence was still the golden rule in the hallway we inhabited, but for one noise. Metallic thuds were coming… Coming from somewhere. But where? 
 
 ***Screeetch-thump. Screeetch-thump. *** 
 
 A single bit of sweat fell down my cheek. 
 
 ***Screeetch-thump. Screeetch-*** 
 
 The noise stopped. It was close. Too close… Where- 
 
 “ From above! ” I dived to the left, further down the hallway. Mariah followed suit but it was far too late for Zarkaz. With a roar that would make his race proud, the mighty Nordsman swung his hammer in the air at what seemed to be a massive steaming pile of greasy grey fur, mouths, and thousands of tiny claws. 
 
 The mouths suddenly all coalesced into one vacant, black hole and swallowed both hammer and arm, whole. The fight was quick and brutal, leaving the Zarkaz twitching silently on the floor. 
 
 “ Zarkaz! ” Mariah screamed, trying to run back to him but was held back by my hand. 
 
 “ He knew the risks when he signed up for this dungeon, Mariah. ” I turned away, disgusted by the sickening squelching noises of the creature feasting. “ Now c ’ mon. While it ’ s distracted. Let ’ s keep moving. ” 
 
 Mariah ’ s face twisted up at the dishonorable thing we were doing, but if she had any concerns, she didn ’ t voice them. I was glad for that, we needed to get going. 
 
 Who knew what that noise could have attracted? 
 
 I felt around my pack as we walked, searching for the old map that we had traded the old man for back in town. In all likelihood, it was fake. But there was something about it… 
 
 “ We should have gone back. We should have given him a proper warrior ’ s burial. ” Mariah looked back once more, thumbing her knife. Even from the distance we had walked, we could still hear it eating. 
 
 “ If we had, we would be dead. ” I continued to look at the map, trying to discern the ancient writing that indicated what our path was that lied ahead. “ And then where would we be? ” 
 
 I squinted at the writing, trying to form it into words. “ Certainly nowhere near the *s e r v e r* room. Whatever that means. ” 
 
 “ *S e r v e r* room? ” Mariah frowned. “ Maybe it ’ s where the ancient ones housed their servants? ” 
 
 “ Yeah, could be. ” I stopped talking, and listened for a moment. “ You hear that? ” 
 
 “ No. I don ’ t hear anything. ” Mariah twisted in confusion, and then in horror as she realized what I meant. 
 
 “ Exactly. ” I grabbed her hand, pulling her in my wake. “ Run! ” 
 
 A screech emanated from down the passageway, as the creature, now finished devouring Zarkaz ’ s body realized that it ’ s prey was perhaps a bit more clever than it was. The sound of heavy limbs slamming into the metal floor came closer and closer as the creature chased us towards the room that lay ahead. 
 
 “ Quickly! ” I said as I reached the open door. “ Get in! ” 
 
 Mariah reached the door just as the creature turned the corner of the hallway behind us. With a rusty screech from both the door and the creature, the door closed with a sudden clang, it ’ s metallic bolts resisting until the very last moment. With a sound like a hollow log hitting the ground, the creature slammed into the door. Howling in dismay, it tried several more times, and then suddenly stopped, seeming to have given up it ’ s impossible battle against the door. 
 
 “ What is this place...? ” Mariah looked around in awe, awash in a dark, red glow. 
 
 I too, turned around, and took in my surroundings. Thousands upon thousands of strange black boxes sat in rows upon rows, as far as the eye could see. A reddish hue enveloped the place, the light coming from strange *willo-the-whisp*-like structures that adorned the walls. Stark red letters to the sides of them read *E m e r g e n c y*, a word in ancient that I did not know. Below that, in smaller blue letters read *S e r v e r* room. 
 
 “ A Server room but without any servants? ” I picked up one of the black boxes and shook it, strange string coming out the backside as I did so. “ Are these one of the servants? Can I command it? ” 
 
 I set it back on it ’ s place in the stack and put out my hand. With a strong force of will, I spoke with as much power as I could muster. “ Servant of the Ancients! I command thee to do work! ” 
 
 And with a gush of power, my voice echoed throughout the room. And… And..! 
 
 Nothing happened. 
 
 Mariah laughed, despite her otherwise somber mood. “ What did you think would happen, Heracles the Great? ” 
 
 I put out my lower lip. “ Might as well try my luck. ” 
 
 Mariah picked up one of the boxes and tapped it with her knuckle, trying to listen to what was inside it. “ What do you think these things did, once upon a time? ” 
 
 “ I ’ m not sure, but I bet they ’ re long beyond the days when they did work. ” I gestured towards a door I saw at the far end of the room. “ We should get a move on. There ’ s nothing in this room worth taking. ” 
 
 
 ***Screeetch-thump. Screeetch-thump. *** 
 
 I stopped, stock-still in my tracks. 
 
 “ No. ” I whispered. 
 
 One of the ceiling panes dragged back, revealing a grotesque figure still covered by the blood of the once great Nordsman. 
 
 “ You will pay for what you did to Zarkaz, vile creature! ” Mariah pulled out her knife and charged towards where the creature dropped from the ceiling. 
 
 I didn ’ t watch it, but I heard it. Mariah… Mariah… 
 
 “ She ’ s dead. ” I whispered, clambering backwards and under a nearby stack of boxes. “ I ’ m all alone and… And… ” 
 
 The creature sniffed at the air, multiple holes opening and closing at once with sickly ichor. 
 
 ***Screeetch-thump. Screeetch-thump. *** 
 
 It stood before me, all twisted curves and strange twitching mouths and claws. I could have sworn that it smiled at me, that suckering, porous mouth getting closer and closer. 
 
 Well. Pride leaveth before the fall and all that. 
 
 “ Help! Someone help me! Please! ” I screamed into the red fringes of the room, hoping, pleading, praying that someone would come. 
 
 The air vibrated with a strange tenor. The room suddenly came awash in a strange green tone. The boxes whirred and vibrated with newfound power, suddenly awoken from their deep slumber. A deep, mechanical voice sounded, coming seemingly from nowhere. 
 
 “ *Stage three nuclear amalgamate detected. Server integrity and human integrity threatened. Human in stress. Eliminating. * ” 
 
 And with a sudden flash, and a bang, it was gone.
