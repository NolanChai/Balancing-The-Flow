It's a strange thought, up until a few months ago, I had hoped I'd live forever. The inevitable destruction of our earth, of the entire universe had scared me. `` Maybe there's more to it, more than this universe.'' I'd console myself. I knew perfectly well this was silly of course. I'd be long dead before our planet changed in any significant way. But I was wrong; the universe decided differently. 
 
 I do n't even know what the damned thing is called. A `` V'' and then some number. That's not what people are calling it though; they are calling it `` Thanatos''. You have got to give it to us humans, we have a strange sense of humor. Or maybe it was a `` W''? If there were still internet, I'd look it up. 
 
 My days of fearing death are over. Once it was certain that Thanatos was on a collision course with our sun, I had to get over it. Those who did n't are either dead or hiding. Which should be pitied more, I'm not sure. Of course, there is not much I'll be missing out on. No living relatives - none that I care about anyway - and Jamie left me years ago. 
 
 Thanatos will come in from a nice angle; we'll have a side view of the whole event. First, the sun will stretch out as he approaches, then Thanatos will start consuming. Scientists do n't seem to agree on what happens next, some say it will be quick and painless, others say it will be violent and the radiation will cook us to death. I do n't care either way, everyone agrees it will be beautiful. 
 
 It's seven in the evening, the sun will start to set in about an hour. I've got my booze, gun and eclipse glasses ready on my porch. 
 
 I can hardly wait.
