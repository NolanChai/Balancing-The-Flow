I could always feel it. Corner of your eye, presence in the corner type stuff. As a child it was just like a really vivid imaginary friend, but at some point in your childhood you learn to be afraid of things. It was one of the first things that I became afraid of. I'm sure it caused my parents some frustration, as there were days where I would just break down in tears. I learned not to talk about it later. At that point the fear got split, half for The Presence, and half for people looking at me weird for being afraid of, from their perspective, nothing. A few years later i started to resent it. It was just THERE! All the time. It took me 3 tries to lose my virginity cause I swear i could feel it MORE during that time. Hell, once I'm pretty sure it saved my life. Not The Presence so much directly. It was college, and I was getting REALLY drunk. I was young and thought I could keep going. And that's when I realized I DID N'T feel it. I'd been pretty sloshed before and still felt it ( did n't care as much when drunk tho ) but at that moment I did n't. So that was when i stopped drinking for the night. I still wound up in the hospital for alcohol poisoning. 
 Anymore, The Presence is just....part of life. It's just THERE. I try to ignore it and move on with my life. It's affected a few of my decisions though. I went skydiving just to see if it could keep up. Also did a brief desert trek. Still there. Those kind of upset me, but they were also both amazing experiences. 
 That's how things have been for the past few years. Until today. Today, a package showed up from Amazon that I did n't order. Not such a big deal, it could have been a present. It was n't. Inside was a Ouji board, or something like it. This was hand carved and had a different layout. The little letter selector was replaced by a handful of numbers. The shipping label had something in the note section.'We need to talk.' 
 I was a fair bit shocked. Some of the child's fear returned, but the adult mind suppressed it. The thought went that anything that wanted to talk probably did n't mean harm. Besides, the lion share of my mind was taken up by one thing: curiosity. 
 
 I put the board on the coffee table and made sure all the numbers were face up. Then thinking about it I dead-bolted my door. I sat back down at the couch and realized that the numbers had already moved. It said simply: HI. 
 I tried moving the numbers to say hello ( I was gon na put 3 and 4 on L ) but when I reached for them they moved to say YOU TALK 
 `` Um....hello.'' The numbers moved again, spelling out PAPER That seemed pretty reasonable actually so I grabbed a pencil and paper. When i came back all the numbers where in blank sections, but started to move. The clear preference was to spell out whole words or several smaller words. The first thing The Presence asked was not to interrupt while it was `` talking'' which seemed pretty reasonable. I was also more focused on writing it down correctly and then going over it again anyway. Then we got underway. 
 ASK. I KNOW YOU WANT TO 
 `` So....what are you?'' 
 I GET YOUR BODY AFTER YOU DIE. 
 That threw me. Fear got the best of me on that one. `` Are....are you going to kill me?'' I was scared of the answer, cause my whole life this thing had been present and I knew I could n't outrun it or flee or anything. Rationally my best chance was to convince it not to if anything. It's response was quick and almost emotional. 
 NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! I CA N'T HURT YOU AT ALL. 
 Huge amounts of tension slipped out of my shoulders. Then i read the line that triggered the fear and I was back to curiosity. 
 `` So then what do you mean after I die?'' 
 YOU WILL DIE AT SOME POINT BUT YOUR BODY WILL LIVE. I WILL TAKE OVER YOUR BODY AND CONTINUE YOUR LIFE. THAT IS WHY I HAVE FOLLOWED YOU YOUR WHOLE LIFE. SO I KNOW HOW TO BE YOU. 
 That was....unnerving. `` What about my friends and family?'' 
 THEY WO N'T HAVE TO MOURN OR HURT. I WILL BE YOU AS MUCH AS IS POSSIBLE. SOME WILL NOTICE SUBTLE CHANGES BUT WILL BLAME IT ON WHAT THEY VIEW AS A NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE. 
 That was weird but also very comforting. I loved my parents and I knew that if I died before them they would be crushed. `` So, why tho?'' 
 IT IS JUST HOW MY KIND LIVE. THAT IS THE ONLY ANSWER I CAN GIVE YOU FOR THAT. 
 That....seemed pretty reasonable actually. This thing may not even know. I sure did n't know why some things were the way they were. 
 `` Why did n't you just tell me before now then?! I would n't have been so freaked out!'' Some strain came into my voice on that. 
 WE ARE NEVER TO INTERACT WITH YOUR KIND. I AM CLEARLY BREAKING THAT RULE NOW. 
 `` Why are you breaking the rule now after 25 years then? Why is now so special?'' 
 The presence paused for a bit. BECAUSE SOON YOU WILL DIE. 
 I was stunned as soon as I read it. I almost did n't realize It had continued. I KNOW WHEN IT WILL HAPPEN AND HOW AND WANTED TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR TIME REMAINING. 
 Lots of emotions were at war within me at that moment. `` Can... can I avoid it?'' 
 YOU WO N'T. IT and again there was a noticeable pause IT WILL BE A CHOICE YOU MAKE. AT THE MOMENT YOU WILL KNOW IT WILL END YOU AND YOU WILL CHOOSE IT ANYWAY. IT IS A GOOD DEATH. AND IT IS WHY I THOUGHT YOU DESERVED TO KNOW.
