I ’ ve looked forward to this day since things went wrong. 
 
 Ok, yeah. I know. I exist outside of time. But I ’ m just trying to capture the significance of this moment. 
 
 You see, this is like the triumphant crescendo in the symphony of the cosmos which I both wrote and conducted. The chaotic cacophony surges emphatically onward seemingly without end. Then, this final crash of cymbals, this last clap of thunder, my one triumphant trumpet sounds, and a resolved, contented silence settles at last. 
 
 And the people wait with ears ringing and bated breath. 
 
 And my conductor ’ s baton holds steady at its highest point. 
 
 And I descend. 
 
 And the music begins again. Softly. Sweetly. All dissonance has gone and only gentle melody carries my rapturous symphony onward, upward into eternity. 
 
 You see, I ’ ve looked forward to this day since things went wrong. 
 I ’ ve ached for this day. I ’ ve bled for this day. I ’ ve died for this day to come. For the tension to be resolved, for my people to come home, for their home to be restored. 
 
 And yet I am sad. A bitter-sweetness lingers. A foul chord reverberates on my heartstrings as my beautiful symphony continues. 
 I hold this moment of joyful reunion and this painful separation all at once. For not all come home to be restored. Many, too many, will never hear this song of satisfaction and joy and peace. Having become enthralled with the dissonance, they have chosen it as their eternal soundtrack, never capturing the restorative rhythms which I had hoped they would learn. 
 
 I've looked forward to this day since things went wrong. But in sweetness and in sorrow we move forward into eternity. 
 
 
 
 This is my first ever response to a writing prompt. Gave it about 20 minutes. Very novice writer. Any feedback/criticism/critique is definitely welcome!
