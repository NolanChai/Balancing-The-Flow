In the Natural World, no animal can claim to be more successful than the human. Their high intelligence has allowed them to thrive in an urban environment in complex societies. With nourishment being of little concern, males can focus on other matters, like, courtship. 
 
 A long male stands in front of the mirror, grooming himself. He is very young, known as a high school student. He is planning to court a girl. He brushes his hair gently with a brush, making sure every last strand is in the right place. Then, he adjusts his shirt and polishes his shoes. Everything must be perfect. After spending many hours in front of his mirror, he is finally ready. 
 
 Courtship in human society is complicated. To win a mate, the male must first impress the female. Our male approaches with caution. If he fails, not only will he loss his chance with his chosen female, he might be rejected by other females as well. He starts by making small talk. It's the easiest way to get into a girl's good books. If she responds positively, he will start flirting, whispering sweet things in her ear. He will then proceed to ask her out, her agreement being the surest sign that she is interested. 
 
 He starts off well enough. The female laughs at his jokes. She returns his advancements by giving him special looks. She winks at him. Alas, just as he inches forward to perform the last step of the ritual, he gets interrupted by a loud cough. 
 
 It's another human, an adult unlike our couple. He is known as a teacher and he wo n't tolerate a young couple in his presence. The teacher stares down at our male and yells out at him. The teacher is trying to get the male return to class, his own social group. According to the human's hierarchical system, a teacher is of a higher position as compared to a student. Our male has no choice but to retreat. He will have to try his luck another day.
