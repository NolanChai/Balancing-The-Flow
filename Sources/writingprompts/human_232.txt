Bleach the ink from off the page 
 
 Strip the canvas of its paint 
 
 Scratch and warp the morning song 
 
 Cut each kind word with complaint 
 
 Curdle milk before my lips 
 
 Treat my tongue with ash for steak 
 
 The age of beautiful things has ended 
 
 We will be ugly at its wake. 
 
. 
 
 Startle me with things I know 
 
 Dazzle me with what I ’ ve seen 
 
 Weigh my soul by what I own 
 
 Guide my sail by where I ’ ve been 
 
 Stock your shelves with empty boxes 
 
 Charge me twice, I ’ ll buy the store 
 
 The age of beautiful things has ended 
 
 If I can not purchase any more.

 Take a brand and trade your name 
 
 Set a price on recognition 
 
 Let the streets run brown with shame 
 
 Build the world on obsolescence 
 
 And when the message has set in 
 
 The age of beautiful things has ended 
 
 An age of beautiful ideas must begin.
