`` Mercenaries, you say?'' says John Michum, a screenplay filter of sorts for MackBack studios. I began to wonder if presenting this idea to him was a good idea. It's not like I had a choice. The group I work for, the Forgettables, would never let me live through the night if I do n't get a yes out of one of these major studios today. 
 
 `` Yes Mr. Michum.'' I replied. `` The thing is, it's not just the mercs. Our thought is to get some really big names like Vyllestry Allone, Reginald Schwartzkopf, and The Stone to play the lead roles.'' 
 
 `` Ok, but what's the story about Mike.'' said John. `` No one wants to see a movie with old actors running around like Bambo killing people. I do n't think it will make much money.'' John was sitting idly at this point tapping a pencil on his desk. `` And let's be honest, it does n't seem like people are really into this kind of thing anymore.'' 
 
 I thought about it for moment. He was right. Most people do n't care for movies like that anymore. Maybe in the 80's it would have been as popular as neon socks with short shorts on men. But its the year 2014. Most people want substance. Then it hit me... 
 
 `` Ok then Mr. Michum. I get it.'' I was hoping he would n't see through my deception before I even started. `` We will just take this back to NGN Studios with their initial offer. `` They particularly thought the funny side of it was what would sell out. The cheap one liners.'' 
 
 Did he buy it? Time ticked on for a moment and I decided that now was a good time to leave, with him sitting there still tapping his pencil on the desk. 
 
 As I opened the door to his office, he came back with `` How much do you need for the movie? What is our take?''. 
 
 Bingo. 
 
 `` We do n't need any money. And MackBack needs to do nothing...'' I said watching Johns eyes light up at the news to that. ``... except to convince the talent that it may be a great way to either restart their careers or go out with a bang.'' I stood their quietly letting him chew on it. 
 
 `` That's it? Seriously, that is it? Why ca n't you just do that yourself?'' He asked bluntly... and that was a good question. One which I already had the answer to. 
 
 `` We need the legitimacy of a large studio.'' I told him. I already discussed this with the rest of the organization. If the movie was released from a large studio, it would relegate our organization to just being based off a movie should we ever be'discovered' by conspiracy theorists. `` What would people think of a movie released by an indie studio. The best we would get is a spotlight at the Sundance Film Festival. No credibility like that.'' 
 
 And he bought it. I could tell by the look in his eyes. Not like it was a lie either. But the sincerity of the immediate truth to it had him buying it.
