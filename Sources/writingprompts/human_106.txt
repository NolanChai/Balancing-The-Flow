We were once a great species that walked the many plains of North America. Sure we had natural enemies; wolves and other large predators, and even the occasional native. Although it was always distressing to lose one of the heard to these mighty human hunters, they never let a bit of our herd mates go unappreciated. 
 
 But then … they showed up. They walked on their two hind legs much like the natives but they looked nothing alike. Their pale skin and great variety of eye and mane color made them stand out as did their difference in hides they wore. These … men … killed off entire herds of us. Leaving bodies piled in the sun to dry. My herd was one of the strongest and fastest of them all. Although many of us were able to get away, stragglers, usually small calves could not run fast enough to keep up with the heard. 
 
 I watched as our numbers dwindled. The Great Plains that once contained millions of us now seemed barren and empty. The natives of this land that once revered and appreciated the gifts of our death now participated in the great hunts as well. 
 I watched as these new settlers moved into our homes. They laid tracks along the plains and drove great iron beasts. Any of the heard in their way were cut down. They ripped up our grazing areas and planted them to other, tasteless plants. 
 I watched as the last of my heard was wiped out. We were grazing quietly when I heard the shot ring out from one of the humans ’ boom sticks. As my mate fell before me I knew this was the end for my heard. These men would show no mercy and they would not revere us when we were gone. 
 
 Another boom rang out and the mighty Bison fell.
