*The wall next to Thomas exploded, and a Minotaur burst into the room. * 
 
 `` WHHHHAAAAAAAAAAAT THE FUUUCK?!'' 
 
 *Thomas jumped to his feet and ran, no thoughts in his mind. His feet were on autopilot, and they were carrying him away from the mythical beast as quickly as possible. The Minotaur barreled after Thomas its war ax gleaming wickedly. * 
 
 `` WHAT IN THE FUCK IS HAPPENING, HOLY SHIT!!'' 
 
 *Suddenly, a man wearing a sushi chef outfit and a weird mask dropped down in front of him. He swung his katana at Thomas, who ducked and rolled underneath it. Thomas turned a corner and made for the front of the building. * 
 
 `` OH MY GOD OH MY GOD OH MY GOD!!'' 
 
 *The two impossible things were hot on his tail, accompanied now by an anthropomorphic cloud of bees and a tour bus. Thomas could n't comprehend any of this, and he began to go into shock. * 
 
 `` I NEED TO LEAVE I NEED TO GO THIS IS CRAZY!'' 
 
 *Thomas slammed through the double doors and stumbled down the stairs in front of the courthouse. A massive tower stood in the distance, and klaxons were wailing all around the open courtyard. Figures in gasmasks and bulletproof vests were heading in his direction, holding bludgeons that crackled with electricity. * 
 
 `` WH-WHAT?!'' 
 
 *Thomas ran to his right, just before the things from inside the building careened through the doors and into the crowd of masked people. The bus slammed into a statue in the center of the courtyard, knocking down a screen displaying a glass of milk un-spilling itself in slow motion. * 
 
 `` FFFAAAAHHHGLARBNAAAHH!!!'' 
 
 *Thomas's mind had broken past the point of coherence. He ran past open doorways that vomited masked men swinging their stun rods viciously. Thomas vaulted over a fence, just as the Minotaur mowed through the crowd of masked men behind him. He scrambled up a fire escape, then onto the roof of a building. He looked down, and the sushi man was scaling the building quickly. * 
 
 `` Nnnnnnnnnn...!!'' 
 
 *Thomas looked around, and a massive blimp rose from the streets below. A woman was in the cabin of the rigid balloon, holding a grenade launcher. She ululated, then launched explosives at Thomas. * 
 
 `` BWAHHHHHHHHH!!'' 
 
 *Thomas dove off the building, and landed on a big pile of marshmallows. He jumped up and ran down the street, as a Minotaur, a sushi man, an anthropomorphic cloud of bees, a crowd of masked men, and a tour bus slammed through the wall behind him. The woman in the blimp was firing grenades at him, and Thomas was crying. * 
 
 `` AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH -- uh?'' 
 
 *Thomas tripped, and fell forward with all of his momentum. He landed on his head, and broke his neck. He died instantly. * 
 
 *His pursuers stopped, then looked at eachother. They did n't know what to do. This was supposed to end with Thomas going up into space on a missile that would have exploded on the moon, altering its orbit so significantly that it would have crashed into the Earth, ending life and making for an amazing ending. * 
 
 *They milled around for a little while, a few masked men placing Thomas's corpse in a body bag and sending him off to a crematorium. After a couple hours, they were all great friends, and loaded up on the tour bus to go eat together at Chili's. *
