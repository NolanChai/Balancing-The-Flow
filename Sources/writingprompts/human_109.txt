`` Hmm, this ca n't be right, can it?'' I say aloud in surprise. I check the directions carefully. 
 Down the M40, yes. 
 Follow the M25 anticlockwise, done that. 
 Take the M4 west, I'm doing that, are n't I? Well, I was until I took that last turning that looked like a shortcut. 
 I stop the car and get out, yanking out the old map book from the boot. 
 `` Oh, right. I wanted to turn left at the roundabout not right! Right leads to... Oh no, not there!'' I shiver in fear as I realise suddenly where I've ended up. `` Okay, not to panic, what's the quickest way out of Slough?!''
