*One more time. Just to make sure. * 
 
 I blow out the candle on my bedside table. The blackened wick droops over the vanilla-scented wax. I take two deep breaths. In. Then out. Then, I FOCUS. I stare at the wick, straining my eyes, like it's one of those magic eye illusions. ( The ones with the 3D images? You cross your eyes and - never mind. ) 
 
 The wick sparks to life. 
 
 I can barely keep myself from yelping with delight. *Finally! Yes! YES! I can set fires with my MIND! * A grin spreads across my face so quickly that it threatens to split my head in two. Weeks, practically *months* after everyone else got one, I've been bestowed with a Power. I have no idea why I got it, how I got it, or what I should do with it - but I'm one of them now. I'm a hero. 
 
 I fling myself off of my bed with uncharacteristic vigor. I do n't bother gathering supplies for classes today - not like I'm going to attend any of them anyway. I gel back my hair with a few clumsy swipes of a comb and throw on a pair of jeans. I consider my choice of shirt for a few seconds, before deciding on a screen-printed red-and-black T-shirt that my roommate made for his death metal band. I contemplate scratching off the name on the back, but I'll be wearing a coat anyway, so no one will see it. I'll get a proper costume later. My dark red jacket completes the look. I look in the mirror above my bed and I see a *beast* look back. Damn. *This is going to be one hell of a day. * 
 
 The dorm hall is empty this late in the morning. I take the opportunity to test out my heroic swagger. Every hero has to look confident, and the way you walk is the best sign of self-image. A few steps into the unnatural, swingy gait and I reconsider. *Maybe I can just puff out my chest, or laugh a lot, or something. Ah, I'll figure that out later. * I abandon the hallway and race to the second-floor lounge, the only one with a working TV. It's usually filled with procrastinating Lit majors and assorted slackers. They should be a good audience for my heroic debut. 
 
 I slam open the lounge door and step into the room, arms above my head. `` Guess who's a - um. Hey, Jerry.'' 
 
 `` Hey, Dan. Nice shirt.'' 
 
 Jerry is the only one here. He's sitting at a table, shuffling a deck of cards. Ever since he got supernatural luck, he's been shunned by most other students. It turns out that for Jerry to be lucky, someone else has to be unlucky. 
 
 `` Where is everyone? Usually they're milling around here, watching Food Network or something.'' 
 
 Jerry composes his face into a small sneer. `` They're in the third-floor lounge. Kyle built a projector or something, and he set up a fighting games tournament. No reason to stay here, I guess...'' Jerry slowly deals five cards onto the table. Royal flush. 
 
 `` Oh.'' I consider showing him my power, but I want to make an impression on people that *matter*. No offense to Jerry, but... `` I should get up there then. Uh, see you.'' I turn on my heel and run face-first into the closed door. *Jerry. * 
 
 Before I enter the third-floor lounge, I hear pulsating, bass-heavy techno music echo through the hallway. I open the door and am immediately greeted by someone's forehead meeting my gut. My breath vacates the premises of my lungs, and I fall onto the carpet. 
 
 `` THERE'S MORE WHERE THAT CAME FROM, YOU BASTARD! I'LL - Oh, hey Dan. You okay?'' Yasmin looks through the door, past the human projectile that knocked me down, towards me on the floor. She probably threw whoever this is through the door with her mind bullets or whatever she calls it. 
 
 `` Hffffggghhhh... Y-yeah. Fine, great. Doing okay. Not dead.'' I roll onto my side and lever myself into a standing position. `` What did this guy do?'' 
 
 `` What? Nothing. What do you - Oh, you mean, why did I telekinesis him through here?'' She shakes her head. `` I did n't mean to throw him out the door, just *into* it. He's probably fine though.'' 
 
 Human Cannonball gives a weak thumbs-up, then reconsiders and raises his middle finger. 
 
 `` Hang on one second.'' Yasmin turns and faces into the lounge. `` So does that mean I won, or what?'' 
 
 Kyle steps in front of the door with a tablet in hand. `` Uh... I guess? This counts as a ring-out, K.O. number 2... Yep.'' He turns back to the room. `` Yasmin takes another round! Move'er up!'' 
 
 Cheers and hisses ring from inside the lounge. I look inside. Instead of the lounge I know - battered couches, a broken CRT TV, and a single rickety card table - there's a large, empty space in the middle of the room, and a few levels of stadium-style bleachers on one wall. I turn to Kyle. `` What, exactly, is going on here? This is not the lounge.'' 
 
 `` No, it's the lounge,'' Kyle says with a spark in his eye. `` I've just expanded it a little bit. I rigged up a space-projection manifold with my microwave and some binder clips, so we could set this tournament up.'' He blinks at me. `` Did you want to enter? It's really only for people with powers...'' 
 
 My mind snaps back to where it should have been this whole time. I'm ready to blow these people's minds. `` Kyle, my man. *I have powers*.'' I put my hands on my hips and wait for his response. 
 
 `` Oh, cool.'' He turns back to the bleachers. `` You can maybe join the next one then. This bracket's kind of far along.'' He begins to walk off. 
 
 `` Wait, wait wait wait! I have powers! I'm a superhero, Kyle!'' 
 
 `` Great, Dan.'' Kyle waves at me halfheartedly, then steps in front of the bleachers. `` Losers' bracket, round 3! Paul, Ulrich, get up here!'' 
 
 Two guys - I think I recognize them from the lacrosse team - stand up and move to the center of the unnaturally large room. *I ca n't believe this - Kyle does n't even care! * I open my mouth a few times, but ca n't think of anything to say. The situation in which I find myself defies explanation. 
 
 Yasmin taps me on the shoulder. `` We should get out of the way.'' She leads me to an open spot on the bleachers, and I sit down as the lacrosse players begin to fight. One of them is throwing punches, the other is... spitting. Lots of spit. 
 
 `` You got powers?'' Yasmin says with a questioning inflection. `` What kind?'' 
 
 *Finally, someone who cares. * `` You know how you can throw things around with your mind?'' I pause for dramatic effect. `` Well I can set things on fire with my mind!'' 
 
 `` Huh.'' Yasmin scratches her hair. `` What kind of things?'' 
 
 I blink. `` I, uh, do n't really know yet. I lit a candle. Then I came here. To tell people.'' 
 
 `` You know we are n't allowed to have candles in the dorm, right?'' She glances at me with an eyebrow raised. 
 
 `` Wha- Candles are n't allowed, but *this*,'' I say, waving my hands at the apparent fight club, `` is!?'' 
 
 `` I guess so.'' Yasmin stops paying attention to me and focuses on the fight. `` Not many rules on powers, yet. Good for you, though.'' She pats me on the head a few times. `` Now shut up and watch the fight.'' 
 
 I watch the fight.
