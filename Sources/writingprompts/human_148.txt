`` What are you doing here!?'' Johnny demanded. 
 
 `` The same thing as you, Johnny.'' Replied Jake as he closed the door to his car, `` I'm here to see things through to the end.'' Johnny felt some resentment in seeing his longtime friend showing up here on the hill before the bombs dropped. 
 
 “ Idiot ” Johnny smiled and shook his head, “ You should be with the others in Naptown where it ’ s safe. There ’ s nothing to see here but the fiery end of birthplace…..our home. ” 
 
 “ You think you ’ re the only one who is worthy enough to go with our tiny hamlet? ” Jake climbed the hill to be on the same ground as his companion. Johnny started to understand and was at ease that his friend did show up. “ You ’ re not the only one, Johnny. Every citizen of Sanctum fought tooth and bone to avoid this. I was right there next to you as we made our stand! And I ’ ll be damned if some brat as yourself will be the only one that see ’ s their cradle of dreams go up in flames! ” 
 
 Johnny could n't help but feel the emotions behind each word of his dear friend and how they two were one and the same to this struggle. The humdrum of the fighter planes grew louder. The sound of inevitable death shouted beyond the hills. 
 
 “ Jake. Even though they drop the bombs and burn us to bits. ” Johnny smiled, “ I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things.''
