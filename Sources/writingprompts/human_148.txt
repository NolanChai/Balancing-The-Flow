I knew the name, but I had never given them more of a passing glance. I was always too busy concentrating on the road ahead of me. My next goal. My next win. I love being the champion. 
 
 I am competitive, and I lay a string of traps behind me to discourage others in this game from beating me. Nothing personal, that's just how you play the game. They do it too. We all do it. 
 
 I looked down at the name again, wondering which trap had finally met its mark. Well, if I'm being honest, `` Met its mark'' is really over-exaggerating my skill. I did n't have a mark. If anyone was unlucky enough to get hit, it was n't because I was good, it was probably because they were bad. Sometimes traps are laid without any thought other then to get ready the next trap. 
 
 `` Peach''. She was a nice girl. Like I said, nothing personal, as I blindly shot backwards another green turtle shell.
