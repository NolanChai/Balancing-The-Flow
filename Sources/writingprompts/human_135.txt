Lost Levels: World 8-2 
 
 The way to Bowser's castle is clear. You can feel it in your bones. Peace will be paved in the Mushroom Kingdom soon. It's only a matter of not falling into another trap, or another warp pipe sending you back even further than where you are. 
 
 Hopping on a trampoline, you bound across the lake beyond the wall. You've seen too many of these lake-trampoline setups during your travels to save the Princess a second time. 
 
 A nondescript block floats in the air, with a lone Paratroopa blocking your way through. While you think that it would look cool to hop on the Paratroopa as it makes its rounds, it may just be easier just to hop on the block and go on your way. It's a simple block, really. Perhaps it'd be a quicker route to the Princess just to ignore this and go on your way. 
 
 *You make a leap of faith. Show off, or play it safe? * 
 
 **If you can jump on the block, go to A. ** 
 
 **If you can jump on the Paratroopa, go to B. ** 
 
 
 *A* 
 
 
 The way to Bowser's castle is clear. You can feel it in your bones. Peace will be paved in the Mushroom Kingdom soon...
