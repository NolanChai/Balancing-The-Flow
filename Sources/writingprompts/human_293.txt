Luke ran around the house frantically trying to lock all the doors. Every time he successfully managed to lock one door, the other one would re-open. His terror was growing as all the alarms in the house were going off at their highest volume, reading the letters: 666, even after he unplugged them. Tears streamed from his eyes as each door he ran away from burst open like a violent wind was pushing into the house. As Luke collapsed in the middle of his living room floor, all the doors in the house opened and slammed shut back and forth while the stereo system played at full volume and the two televisions in the house launched wildly through channels. Luke felt himself breaking down when his car alarm started off. 
 
 `` Hahaha- look at that stupid human!'' cackled Xijul Nom as he fiddled with the controls inside his flying saucer five hundred feet above Luke's house. 
 
 `` Haaahahaha! I think he's going to have an aneurism!'' laughed his companion, Dursim Zol. They cracked open another two beers and switched on the hallucinagenic drug dispensers in Luke's house. `` You think he'll see demons this time?''
