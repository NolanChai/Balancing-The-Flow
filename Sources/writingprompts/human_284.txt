One hemisphere. Twelve countries. Twelve towns. Twelve people. Each one presented with a simple question: `` Who were you, before the war?'' 
 
 A shy ten year-old boy from Israel said, `` I herded sheep with my father. Now I herd sheep with my younger brother.'' 
 
 A magnificently dressed man from Qatar proclaimed, `` I was a poor farmer. Now I work intimately with an oil tycoon.'' 
 
 A scarred Somalian man in Cape Town shared, `` I was a Somalian pirate. I fled and joined the South African Navy. I work in a naval base.'' 
 
 A Nepalese refugee in southern China responded, `` I owned a tea-shop in Nepal. It was destroyed like everything else when they bombed Patan.'' 
 
 A young Cambodian woman with startling blue eyes answered, `` I was a hair stylist, until the shop was used as a hospital for United Nations soldiers.'' 
 
 A frightened middle-aged North Korean man said, `` I was nothing. Ignorant, neglected. Now I am getting a history degree at the University of Seoul.'' 
 
 A grizzled old man in the countryside of Austria replied, `` I was a tomato farmer. Now, I have no tomatoes, no farm. They burnt it to dust.'' 
 
 A pretty young woman from Aegina Island on the Mediterranean told us, `` I helped my father run boat tours out of our town. Our town is gone.'' 
 
 A weeping elderly woman from Catalonia muttered, `` I was happy. I had a family. Two of my children were killed, and my grandchildren have not come home.'' 
 
 A quiet man from Tunisia said, `` I worked in a textile factory. They came and took over, forcing us to work for them until they blew up the building.'' 
 
 A priest toting a Bible from Italy replied, `` I was a humble servant of God, and that I remain. In times like these, He is most important.'' 
 
 A twelve year-old girl in the ruins of Paris chillingly responded, `` I was just a little girl. Now I'm a mother of two.'' 
 
 World War Three affected everyone in the world, but the Eastern hemisphere was hit harder than the rest. The battles and bombings and brutality took the lives of millions and changed the lives of billions worldwide. This journey was a humbling one, one that reminded us of the horrors man could commit.
