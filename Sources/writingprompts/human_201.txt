It was all so clear now. They were the one's keeping here... lost in the wooods....his friends... but not really. They were never his friends, they just used him. They... did n't exist without him. They must n't....and so he had to get rid of them. The doctors said he wood never get better if he never left the would. Wood... Would? The 100 woulds of the 100 acre wood. 
 
 *kill them, kill them all or you'll never be free* 
 
 Eeyore was easy... He was always so alone. Always so sad. It was better this way anyway. Eeyore like the river... and now Eeyore would stay there forever. 
 
 *another, another* 
 
 Rabbit... rabbit was harder. Hurt more. He had to have his house so tidy... just so. everything in it's place..so he did n't notice when the sugar was n't. Neither was the rat poison. 
 
 *they never liked you anyway....do it do it do itdoitdoitdoit* 
 
 Kanga and Roo went together. They had to... they were always together. I wanted Roo to go first- no child should see their mama go... but she fought me. She had such a kick... but I broke her skinny neck, and Roo's too. I put him back into her pouch. They both would have liked that. 
 
 *NOW DO IT NoW OR You'LL NeVer be FreE oF tHEm* 
 
 Owl was hard....always watching with those big, wide eyes. Always watching me. Truth is, I know he never liked me. No... never. Always sitting all the way up there....I ripped his eyes out, and threw them in the stream with Eeyore. He wo n't watch me anymore. 
 
 *ThEY jUST wanT to eNd YoU... TheY Do N'T CarE* 
 
 The rest were....much harder. I almost could n't do it. Tigger was a friend... a good friend. But he is n't real. I know that....A real person would n't bounce like that. He bounced and bounced until he bounced no more. 
 
 *NOw noW bEFore TheY GeT you FIRST* 
 
 Piglet... Piglet stutttered and begged and stuttered and begged me not to do it. He never trusted me. Never. He squirmed and he fought... but I think he's happier now. He smiled when he stopped fighting. I guess I was n't scary anymore. 
 
 *AlMosT... AlmosT... * 
 
 Pooh bear. Pooh bear was my very best friend. I spent many hours sitting with him, eating honey and just..talking. I could n't bear....bear?....to hurt him. So I mixed some sleepy in his honey, and stroked him fur as he slipped into the night. I closed my eyes... and waited for the hundred acre wood to fall away.

 Detective Charleton surveyed the devastation. One man drowned in a bathtub, with what looked like the remains of a security camera floating nearby... a woman with a broken neck and a twelve year old with the same injuries forced into her scrub trousers... One man poisoned with the rat poison in his sugar, another man thrown out the window, a third strangled and the last was still in the arms of his killer, when the police arrived on scene. 
 
 `` Christopher Robin.'' he read from the file. `` Came to hundred-acre about six months ago for his paranoid schizophrenia. Suffers from near permanent hallucinations, and good at missing his meds. Jesus... I thought these institutions had safeguards against this sort of thing.'' He rubbed his temples wearily, as he put down the file and started taking the crime scene photographs.
