`` I'm not good with this whole obituary thing, so I'll try my best to encompass what Harry meant for every single one of us gathered in this room today. He was an angel in our world filled with demons. He was the one who liberated us from the orphanage and the terrible things that transpired within. To some, he even was their source of food and shelter. But, to be completely blunt, this man was a hero. A hero like no other and he will be remembered as such, so let's all pay our respects to this withered old man and wish him a better future in the next life''
