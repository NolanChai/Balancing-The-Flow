Rose petals shower the floor like blood after a slasher flick. Ah, yes this is just what I need, more shit to clean up. They seem to be leading into my room. I guess she wants to get a little romantic for Valentine's Day. I'm okay with that. I step into the room to see candles line the walls, but not bright enough to light up the area near the bed. Romantic love making in the dark? Mysterious. I like that. It just seems that my so called `` Significant Other'' is asleep. Maybe I'll wake her up with a little licky-licky. As I slide my tongue in and out and all around her baby-gun. I hear her moaning. I think she likes it. She starts to kick and smack me on the head. I guess she is too tired for this. That does n't seem like her regular behavior, but I guess she is mad at me for being late on Valentine's Day. Alright, I guess I'm sleeping on the couch. Valentine's Day night. Fuck this. The couch will have more room for me anyway. I step out and hit the sack on the love seat filled with one lonely individual. 
 
 The next morning I awake to the smell of bacon and pancakes. Ah, yes. She is ready to apologize for last night. I get out of my `` bed'' and step into the kitchen. My beautiful wife is standing there in her robe. `` Morning, sunshine. Did you miss me?'' She asks with her cute little smile. 
 
 `` I just saw you last night.'' I returned with a wink. 
 
 `` Honey, I was n't home last night.'' She says as her mother walks into the kitchen with a yawn and shoots a wink in my direction. What was that about? `` I was gone all week, remember I said we would have to spend Valentine's a day late?'' 
 That's when it hit me. That's when the cold hard truth fucking hit me. 
 
 I looked hard into my wife's eyes and said `` I wanted it to be you. God damn, I really did.''
