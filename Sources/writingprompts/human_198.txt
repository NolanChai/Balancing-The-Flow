Remember remember the fifth of November, my brain fills the rest of the phrase. 
 I know for no reason the last fucking season I could possibly have bought into this craze. 
 
 
 It was dark, it was dreary, it was 2005, the latest flick just came out on big screens, 
 Days where Blockbuster was king, Netflix wasn ’ t a thing, and I had just started living in Queens. 
 
 
 How stupid I was then, with my money to spend, going out to recapture a feeling. 
 With no hesitation and no fear of damnation, my purchase, at the time, was quite healing. 
 
 
 I raced home, tore off plastic, like a child gone bombastic, not yet seeing the depths of my lie. 
 Initial honeymoon aside, my will for viewing subsides, then banished straight into a dark basket. 
 
 
 Like a shady bank deposit, I stashed the goods in my closet, and thought that was the end to this plea. 
 My only regret is the notion that I saw the promotion to buy ‘ V for Vendetta ’ on HD-DVD.
