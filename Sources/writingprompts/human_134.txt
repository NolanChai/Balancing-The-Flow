``'Kill the rats' I said'' I muttered under my breath walking back from the market with a large bag over my shoulder. ``'I'll take care of it' they all said'' a light clanging sounded from the bag as the vile and bottles collided. I kicked open the door to my house rattling the small wooden house as the door collided with the wall. 
 
 I walked over to the table setting the bag on the table, the potions rolling out onto the table. I pulled out the potions from the bag some green, some yellow, some red. I placed them carefully on the table 1 by 1 organizing them by type. 
 
 I finished and admired my work. The sunlight shining though the window and the potions casting a rainbow of colors over the wall and me. It was amazing that the apothecary sold these to anyone, it was perfect. The assortment in front of me was massive: strength, health, poison, poison resistance, growth, invisibility, and the list goes on. `` Now they will see why they should have killed the rats.'' 
 
 I walked to the cupboard and pulled out a large bowl. I walked back with a sinister grin on my face. I set the bowl on my table rattling the potions. Without a care for the type I began grabbing potions and pouring them into the bowl. The colors blended as the potions were all pour into the bowl. what once had been a rainbow of colors was now a sick black soup. 
 
 I took a whiff of the soup my grin widening. I picked up the bowl and walked down into the basement.

 The ravenous noise from the basement was ruining my sleep, 2 weeks had passed since I had made the soup and mutated the rats. Their anger and rage had not ceased since I gave it to them. In those weeks no hero had come to my house to ask for a quest, instead I'd been left with the giant killer rats I had created. 
 
 Needing an escape I left the house and walked over to my neighbor's house. I knocked on the door and she answered with a quizzical look on her face, I never came to see her. `` Sooooo seen any Heros lately?'' 
 
 `` The land is at peace, we do n't need heroes right now. Has been at peace for a few months now. Those last heroes who came through must have done something about the emperor.'' 
 
 My jaw dropped. `` mother fuckers''
