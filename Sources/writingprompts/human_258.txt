He sat most days staring out his tiny window. He was sure, sooner or later, somebody, perhaps the great Minerva Mcgonagall, would send for him. Perhaps if he opened the window with his little finger again... One more time. He could n't ever understand what had occurred that made him this way. Bedridden as long as he could remember. Sweaty, restless, immovable. His mother cried. His father never looked him in the eye. Sometimes when he got angry, he could move things with that little finger on his left hand. His cousin had gotten into one of those schools. The ones that existed only in hushed tones, to those that did n't have `` the ability''. He had seen their funny newspaper in the hospital one time. He tried to ask his mother, `` do you see this shit? That news paper's, photos are moving. As if they were fucking movies. Do you not fucking see this?'' All that came out, was an unintelligible gasp, a rasp, and a growl. 
 The little finger moved. The peculiar newspaper tore in half. He made eye contact with the reader, through the wreckage of the paper they held. The reader grinned at him. Not evil, but not at all honest. They reader raised a black gloved finger to their mouth and shook their head. 
 He could hear a voice in the back of his mind, amidst the faint memories of birthday parties, and fear of spiders. 
 `` they would n't believe you if you could tell them anyway.'' 
 The reader got up, and walked away tucking the newspaper under their arm. 
 He would open the window with that little finger many more times. Never did his letter come for him, but the breeze felt serene.
