`` I do n't know,'' I said, testing the rope that bound my hands. `` I'm just not sure which way to go. Do you go Anecdote? It's a classic. No two ways about that. Or Breakout? Selfish, but it's good for the adrenaline.'' 
 
 The woman next to me implored me to be silent with her eyes. 
 
 `` I did the whole Two-Gun Action Hero once. Went full-on Die Hard. It was... I'm not going to say it was n't *fun*, I'm just... it's kind of morally ambiguous. It's a guilty pleasure kind of thing, you know. Like buying a box of cookies, and then eating all of them, and then looking at the pile of crumbs and -'' 
 
 She was begging me to stop as much as was possible without saying anything. 
 
 `` - feeling totally satisfied, but at the same time, like'shit. I should not have done that.' You know? I try to avoid that kind of thing now. I mean regardless of outcome, you just do n't want that kind of blood on your hands. It's like blowing up Megaton. You know?'' 
 
 She looked at me like I was insane. `` *No, *'' she said. 
 
 `` It might be quite specific,'' I said. `` As references go. I'm going to go with Anecdote.'' 
 
 I heard the footsteps of the terrorist pounding towards me before I saw him. I turned up towards him. 
 
 He put a gun at my head. `` Say another word,'' he said. `` Say another word, and you'll die.'' 
 
 I pulled a name out of my ass. `` Mary,'' I said. 
 
 His eyes widened. 
 
 Yeah. `` My sister,'' I said, trying to put a bit of wistful reverie in the voice. `` Mary was my sister. She was a... nun. Trainee nun. Like a regular nun, but new at it.'' 
 
 He scratched the side of his balaclava. `` What does this -'' 
 
 `` So Mary was doing the whole nun thing. Nun classes, she had a whole nun physical exercise programme - lot of knee exercises, wrist strength, stuff like that - and...'' 
 
 He tilted his head to one side. The barrel of the gun never wavered. 
 
 ``... and that's like, the life of a nun. You know? Anyway. She was in History of Nuns one day, and the teacher said to her,'how do you know if your actions are what God wants?' Like, how do you *know? * You *believe, * sure. People believe a lot of shit, though. A lot of shit. How do you know?'' 
 
 The barrel started to lower. 
 
 `` And Susan -'' 
 
 `` Mary?'' He said. 
 
 *Fuck. * `` Susan was another student in the class.'' 
 
 He looked suspicious. `` Another nun?'' 
 
 `` Total nun. Susan says'belief is all God asks for.' She sits back like she's just put you in checkmate, you know? Ooooh, look at me. I'm Susan and I've got faith and shit. You know?'' 
 
 There was a nod. Slight, but it was there. 
 
 I swallowed. `` So *Mary* - that's my sister - says no.'No, that's not enough,' she says.'Faith by itself is action without cause'. I always remembered that, because it's what she really said in this real life story that actually happened.'The cause', she said,'is...''' 
 
 I have to confess, I floundered a bit here. I tried to pass it off as a profound delivery of a powerful truth. I mentally flipping between'honour','truth', and'love'. 
 
'... conviction.'' I said. `` Sure. We have faith. Our dedication demands faith. But it is *honour* -'' 
 
 `` Conviction,'' he corrected me absently. 
 
 `` Conviction,'' I agreed. `` It is with conviction that we declare our own truth. Faith is in our hearts. Conviction is with our minds. And only with both do we know we are doing the right thing. So if it's with conviction that you pull that trigger, do so with a clean conscience.'' 
 
 He pointed the gun at the floor. 
 
 `` But if it is with only faith,'' then free me to follow my own.'' 
 
 He cut the rope that held me to the pipe. I took his gun from him. 
 
 I weighed it in my hands. 
 
 I let a moment of silent contemplation pass between us. 
 
 `` Do you have another one of these?'' I said, already feeling the sick thrill of guilt. `` I kind of like this next part with two.''
