Manchester United scouts are watching Dnipro winger Yevhen Konoplyanka. The long-time Liverpool target is available for £12.1million this summer and United have joined the throngs watching him lately with Paris Saint-Germain, Tottenham, Arsenal and German club Schalke all represented. Liverpool came close to doing a deal of nearly £20m in January while Tottenham have maintained dialogue with Dnipro ahead of appointing a new manager. Target: Yevhen Konoplyanka is being watched by Manchester United, with the winger available for £12.1million . Battle: Louis van Gaal (left) is looking to steal a march on Liverpool and Brendan Rodgers for the Ukrainian . United were approached about the 24-year-old last year but did not believe he was consistent enough and they will take further reports before making a decision whether to bid in the coming weeks. Louis van Gaal is an admirer but winger is not a priority position and United have other players under consideration.
