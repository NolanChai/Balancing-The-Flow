Hi , who has the remote control ? 

 I do . Why , do you want me to change the channel ? 

 Yes , please . I can't stand watching the channel any more . 

 I think they have pretty good programmes . But I'll change it if you really want . 

 Put it on Channel 5 , OK ? 

 Oh , I hate Channel 5 . I'd rather just listen to the radio . 

 Don't make such a fuss . I'm sure you will like today's programme . 

 What's on today ? 

 A basketball match between Chinese team and American team . 

 Really ? I'm interested in it . 

 It might begin now .
