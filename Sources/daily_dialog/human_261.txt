What do you think of this one ? 

 Eh , so so . 

 And this one ? Too flashy ? 

 Nah , not too flashy . 

 Hug ! And this sweater from my aunt ? Isn ’ t it hideous ? 

 I guess . 

 Are you even listening ? I ’ m trying to have a conversation with you . 

 And I ’ m trying to watch the game , but you ’ re yapping on about your new clothes ! 

 Well I have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when I go to the Boxing Day sales this afternoon ! 

 Well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? It ’ s the third quarter and you ’ Ve been blabbering on since the first ! 

 Oh , your precious game . You watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! 

 Oh no you didn ’ t . You didn ’ t just insult the Sals-bury Seals , did you ? Why don ’ t you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? 

 I might just ! Enjoy your stupid game !
