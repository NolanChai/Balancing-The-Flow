Lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! 

 George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . 

 Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much . 

 Where will we sleep , then ? 

 In the van . 

 What about other expenses ? 

 Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while . We have been working hard , haven ’ t we ? 

 Maybe you ’ re right . When do you plan to go ? 

 The sooner the better ! I can ’ t wait ! 

 Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet . 

 As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments . I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time . 

 Let ’ s go to Chicago.We can have lunch in Chinatown.Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field ! 

 You have such good ideas !
