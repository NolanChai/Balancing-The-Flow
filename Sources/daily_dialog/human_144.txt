Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself . 

 How to do it ? 

 Just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line . 

 How long will it take to reach the buffet ? 

 Not long , because people rush for lunch . 

 The line sure does move fast . 

 Tell the man behind the counter what you want . 

 OK . I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it . 

 Just point to it if you don't know the name . 

 All right .
