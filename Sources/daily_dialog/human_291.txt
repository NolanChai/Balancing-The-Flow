Amelia , could you spare a few minutes ? 

 sure . What do you need ? 

 well , I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice . 

 really ? Why ? 

 it's complicated . But basically it boils down to one thing . This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go . 

 but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! 

 well , to be honest , there's another reason . I've got a better offer . 

 well that's great news ! Congratulations ! Where will you be located ? 

 the head office is in New York , but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . 

 it'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you're found yourself a great opportunity . 

 I have . I feel lucky . I look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use English more . 

 I'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? 

 of course I can . In fact , if there are other job opportunities at this new company , I'll recommend you personally . 

 thanks . I appreciate that .
