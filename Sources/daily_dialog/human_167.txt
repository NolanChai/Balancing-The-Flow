Good afternoon , madam . How can I help you ? 

 Well , I am a bit out of shape . I'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit . 

 Oh , that's good news for us . 

 So what do you provide ? 

 First of all , we'll design a custom-made work-out plan according to your habits . 

 How can you get that done ? 

 Well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . And he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work-out plan for your needs . 

 What else ? 

 Since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal . 

 Sounds pretty good . What about the charge ? 

 That depends . We offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . 

 Maybe one month . Just have a try first . Not too tough at the beginning . 

 Wise decision . You'll find it's totally worth it .
