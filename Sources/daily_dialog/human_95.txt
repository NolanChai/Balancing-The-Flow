Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? 

 Things are going good today . How have you been doing , Mary ? 

 Things are going well for me , Joe . 

 Want to go see a movie tonight ? 

 My parents are taking me to dinner tonight . 

 Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead ? 

 What movie did you want to see ? 

 There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . 

 I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” 

 Oh great ! Sounds like something I need to bring Kleenex to !
