we really were lucky . We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ? 

 yeah , I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long . I'm starving ! 

 let's take a look at the menu so we can order . Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? 

 what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? 

 I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . 

 well , let's get a plate of those then . 

 sounds good . What are you going to have for your main course ? 

 I think I might have a dahl . 

 what's in a dahl ? 

 it's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . 

 that sounds nice . Do you want to share some kebabs as well ? 

 ok . How about some lamb kebabs ? 

 that's my favourite . Do you want to have some wine or beer ? 

 I think I'll have a beer . 

 ok , shall I flag down the waitress ? 

 I wouldn't recommend it . I think we should wait until she comes round . 

 you're right . That might seem a bit rude . It's a good thing I've got you with me ! 

 what would you do without me ?
