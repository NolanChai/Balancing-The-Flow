Are you interested in history ? 

 Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . 

 I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . 

 I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! 

 Some people say that history repeats itself . 

 What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? 

 The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . 

 I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .
