Only one . But I wanted to make sure I'd get it . 

 Yeah , I really wanted that Chanel bag , too . But just in case you should bid low . 

 But there are only two more days until the bidding closes ! 

 I bid on a Chanel watch at the last minute , and got it sixty percent off ! 

 Oh ... I'm such a newbie . But at least I'm sure I'll get that tennis racket . 

 Don't count on it , Babe . eBay is always full of surprises . 

 Well ... guess how low the bidding starts on the tennis racket ?
