Good afternoon , welcome to IBA . How can I be of service ? 

 I'd like to talk to somebody about the Group Account Deposit Service . 

 This refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies . 

 What is it used for ? I mean , why bother to get this special account ? 

 Group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . 

 I see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . Interesting ...
