What can I do for you , young man ? 

 I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning . 

 What sizes do you need ? 

 One pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . One for me , and the other two for two kids . 

 Here you are . And here are three crash helmets . 

 Thanks . Well , those two kids are beginners . What should I do about their safety ? 

 Well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . First , make sure they don't go far from the railings . 

 Oh , yeah , maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings . 

 That's a good idea . And remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings . 

 OK . Anything else ? 

 Never go to the center of the lake . The ice there is too thin to skate on . 

 Got it . Thanks for reminding me . And , are there any intensive training courses ?
