I have learnt how to ride a bicycle . I plan to go to the Water Park by bike this weekend . 

 Well , you know , the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous . Therefore , I have to remind you of something . First , you should obey the traffic rules , don't break in the red light . Second , don't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . Third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . Finally , remember come on the left and go on the right ! 

 Oh , my dear sister , I am no longer a baby !
