Nicole , your Fettucini is very ... unique . 

 But not as good as your mother's , right ? 

 Actually , it's better ... 

 What ? Are you kidding ? 

 No . It was the only dish she wasn't good at . So we could use you as the new head chef ... 

 Oh , Uncle Giovanni . That's wonderful ! Thank you ! Thank you ! 

 OK , OK . Get back to work . There's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ...
