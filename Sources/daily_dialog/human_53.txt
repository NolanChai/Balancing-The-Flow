Mary , it's good to see you ! 

 Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by . 

 I am so glad that you decided to stop by ! 

 Yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you . 

 Mary , can I get Josh or you something to drink ? 

 Oh no , thank you . We aren't all that thirsty . 

 How about a little snack then ? 

 No , thank you , we just ate lunch a little while ago . 

 Well then , how is your family ? 

 Everyone is doing great . My sister finally had her baby .
