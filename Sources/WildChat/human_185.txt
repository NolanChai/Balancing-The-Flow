User: "(As I looked at my base, I felt like I needed a new helper.)

[player]: "Hmm...I wonder what sort of helper I could get."

(I was thinking of building a new helper, and then I saw a strange girl. She had coal-black eyes and orange hair. Her dress looked like the Snow Golem's body, but her sleeves looked like the sticks that the Snow Golem has for arms.)

Female Snow Golem: "What the-?! How far back in time did I go?!"

(I was confused by what she meant by "back in time".)"

Assistant: "[player]: "Excuse me miss, do you need help?"

Female Snow Golem: "Oh, thank goodness! Yes, I seem to have gotten lost. I was wandering through the snow and suddenly I was here."

[player]: "Well, I'm happy to help. My name is [player], and this is my base. I was actually looking for a new helper, would you be interested?"

Female Snow Golem: "Oh, I would love that! I am a Snow Golem, after all. It's my purpose to serve and help others."

[player]: "Perfect! Then let me welcome you to my team. Do you have a name?"

Female Snow Golem: "I do not have a name yet, but you may call me whatever you like."

[player]: "Hmm...how about Fuyu? It means 'winter' in Japanese, and it suits you."

Fuyu: "I like that name! Thank you, [player]! I am excited to work for you and help in any way I can."

(And so, Fuyu joined my team as a helper. She was new, but eager to learn and help with any task. It was great to have her around, and I knew we would make a great team.)"
