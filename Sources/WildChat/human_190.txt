User: "(As I sat by the hospital bed, I couldn’t believe what was happening. MC, my childhood friend, was dying. Ever since he got in that accident, I was praying that he would be okay. And then, I took one last look at me, and the child that me and Umbris were going to have.)

MC: “Sayori…I hope that you and Umbris become the best parents ever. And…tell my little sister Himari that I’ll miss her.”

(Tears rolled down my cheek as I looked into MC’s eyes.)

Sayori: “Thank you, MC. We will do our best for you. Himari will miss you too, but she’ll always remember you in her heart.”

MC: “I’m glad. And please, don’t forget about me. Remember the good times we had together, and keep smiling, okay?”

Sayori: “I won’t forget you, MC. I promise. And I’ll try to keep smiling for you.”

(MC weakly gave me a smile before he closed his eyes for the final time. I held onto his hand, not wanting to let go. It was a painful goodbye, but I knew that MC was at peace now. I silently made a vow to always cherish his memory and to never forget the impact he had on my life. The day after his funeral, I went back to the clubroom. I could see the other girls - Monika, Yuri, Natsuki, Himari, and Kohana - all discussing something, and Kohana also had a hand on her own bump. Hopefully neither me or Kohana start having contractions.)

Sayori: (Taking a deep breath) “Hey, everyone. I know we’re all grieving MC’s loss, but I just wanted to say that I’m grateful for all of you. For being here and supporting me. We have each other, and I think that’s something we should hold onto. And, Umbris and I are going to become parents soon. It’s scary and exciting, but we’ll do our best.”

Monika: “Congratulations, Sayori. That’s great news. MC would be happy to know this.”

Yuri: “I’m sure you and Umbris will be wonderful parents. And, we’ll be here for you, all the way.”

Natsuki: “Yeah, don’t forget that we’re all here to help you out. And, we’re happy to do it.”

Himari: “I can’t believe we’re going to have babies around here soon. It’s crazy and awesome at the same time.”

Kohana: (Rubbing her bump) “Yeah, it is. I’m happy for you and Umbris, Sayori. You guys will do great.”

Sayori: “Thank you, everyone. It means a lot to me. Let’s all continue to support each other, okay?”

(The group nodded, and we all shared a somber moment together. But, I knew MC was watching over us, and that gave me some comfort. Life might be uncertain, but we had each other, and that was something to hold onto. But just minutes before the meeting ended, I noticed Kohana was starting to feel uncomfortable.)

Sayori: “Kohana, are you okay?”

Kohana: “Yeah, I think so. I just felt a little twinge in my stomach.”

Natsuki: “Oh no, is it starting?”

Kohana: “I’m not sure. Maybe it’s just a false alarm.”

Yuri: “Should we take you to the hospital, just in case?”

Himari: “Yeah, it’s better to be safe than sorry.”

Kohana: “Okay, let’s do that. Sayori, can you and Umbris come with me?”

Sayori: “Of course, Kohana. Let’s go.”

(We all rushed to the hospital, with Kohana feeling more and more uncomfortable with each passing moment. As soon as we arrived, the nurses quickly took her to the delivery room. But then, the nurses brought me to the delivery room as well - as I had been feeling uncomfortable while on the way here.)"

Assistant: "(The doctors quickly began assessing my condition, checking my vital signs and monitoring the contractions. Meanwhile, Umbris was by my side, holding my hand and reassuring me that everything would be okay. I could feel the pain intensifying with each passing moment, but I focused on my breathing and tried to stay calm.)

Umbris: “You’re doing great, Sayori. Just keep breathing and pushing through the pain. We’re almost there.”

(The sound of my baby’s cry filled the room, and I couldn’t help but burst into tears of joy and relief. The doctors quickly cleaned and wrapped the baby, before handing it to me.)

Sayori: “Oh my god, Umbris…look at our beautiful baby. We’re parents now.”

Umbris: “We did it, Sayori. We’re a family now.”

(After spending some time with our new baby, the nurse came to check on Kohana - who had also given birth to a healthy baby. It was a surreal feeling, knowing that our club had gone from grieving MC’s loss to celebrating new life.)

Sayori: “Hey, Kohana, congratulations on your new baby. Do you need any help?”

Kohana: “Thank you, Sayori. And yes, I could use some help with a few things.”

(The four of us spent the remaining hours in the hospital together, helping each other with our babies and simply enjoying the moments of new parenthood. Although the road ahead was uncertain, we knew we had each other to rely on. And I couldn’t help but feel grateful for the bond we had formed through the literature club.)"
