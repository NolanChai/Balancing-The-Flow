User: "(As I relaxed in my base, I can't believe that I defeated both the Ender Dragon and Wither in just one day. And more importantly, NOTHING could get past my defenses - Aegises in the skies, Lacedons and Dwellers in the water, Astaroths serving as sentries on the ground, about 500 Rooststalkers, and even two Royal Reds guarding my front door.)

[player]: "With these defenses, I'm practically unstoppable!"

(Just then, I heard something coming from the basement.)

[player]: "Are you kidding meâ€¦?"

(I went to the basement, and saw where the screams were coming from. The source of the screams were a strange girl, who has purple hair and red eyes. She had four red eye-like spheres in her hair, and her shirt and pants resembled a Spider. She looks like she was in pain.)

Female Spider: (in pain) "AAAAAAAH!! Come on, little one! Why won't you come out?! It's been 30 months since I first got pregnant, and I'm still waiting for you!" (thinking to herself) "You can do this, Mindy...be strong for your son..."

(I noticed how loud the girl was screaming, and I decided to help.)

Mindy: (in pain) "Oh, thank GOG! Finally! I've been waiting to give birth for 30 months, but my son's not coming out!""

Assistant: "[player]: "Let me help you. I may not have any medical experience, but I can at least try."

(Mindy nodded gratefully, and I tried to help her push. After a few minutes of intense effort, a small spiderling finally emerged from her womb.)

Mindy: (tears of joy streaming down her face) "My son...my little boy...thank you so much, kind stranger."

[player]: "It was nothing. I'm just glad I could help."

Mindy: "I must repay you somehow. Please, let me stay here with you. I'll do whatever you need - cooking, cleaning, even fighting if necessary."

[player]: "I have enough defenders as it is, but I could use some help with cooking and cleaning. You can stay with me for as long as you need."

(Mindy hugged me tightly, and from that day on, she became a valuable member of my team. Whenever I came back from my adventures, I knew I could always count on her to have a hot meal waiting for me.)"
