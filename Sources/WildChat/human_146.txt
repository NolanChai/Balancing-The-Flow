　マッチングキャンディを食べた、その翌日。

　いつも通りに学校に登校してみたが、クラスに特に何か変わった様子は無かった。俺自身にも特に変わったところは無く、お腹を壊したりもしていない。

　効果は一個で二十四時間ということだから、今日の放課後までは効果範囲内か。

　しばらくこのまま、様子を見てみよう。



　しかし、午前の授業も、昼休みになっても、午後の授業にも、何かが起こるような気配はなかった。

　運命マッチングの意味もよくわからないので、完全にお手上げ状態。昨日、もっときちんと説明してもらえばよかった。

　そうこうしているうちに、放課後になってしまった。



　どうしたものかな。とりあえず帰宅するまで様子を見て、それで何も起きなかったら、またもう一個食べてみよう。

　まあ、過剰な期待はしない方がいいだろうな。何か、夢でも見ていたのかもだし。

　そんなことを考えながら、帰り支度をしているところで、友達が声をかけてきた。



「なあ染島、ちょっと学祭の手伝いしてくれよ。うち執事喫茶やるだろ？　野坂ちゃんから宣伝用のビラ作成頼まれてさ」

「……あー……、その野坂先生から別の用事頼まれてんだわ。別の係も任されてるしさ。ごめん」

「うお、マジかよ。どうすっかなー……。……しょうがない、他をあたるわ」

「悪いな」

Assistant: "After eating the Matching Candy, the next day was no different than usual for me as I headed to school. There was no apparent change in my class, nor did I experience any stomach discomfort. Since the effect only lasted for 24 hours, I was still within its range until the end of the day. I decided to observe things for a while longer.

However, throughout the morning and lunchtime classes and even the afternoon sessions, there was no indication that anything was happening.

I had no idea what the significance of the Matching Candy was, and I truly wished I had been given a better explanation yesterday.

As the day wore on, it was already time to go home. I considered waiting until I got back home to see if anything would happen. If nothing did, I could take another piece of candy.

I knew, however, that it was best not to get my hopes up too high; I might have just dreamt the whole thing up after all.

While I was preparing to leave, a friend called out to me.

"Hey, Soma, would you help us out at the school festival? We're running a butler cafe, and Nakasaka-san asked me to make flyers for it."

"Ah, sorry, but Nakasaka-sensei has another task for me. I'm already working in a different department. I apologize."

"Aw, seriously? What are we going to do…? Well, I guess we'll just ask around. No worries."

"Sorry about that.""

After eating a piece of Matching Candy, I was curious to see what would happen the next day. But to my surprise, nothing seemed to have changed. I felt normal, and there was no indication that the candy had any effect on me.

I went to school as usual, but despite my anticipation, there was no noticeable difference in my surroundings or classmates. The candy's effect lasted for 24 hours, so I had to wait until the end of the day to see if anything happened.

Throughout the day, I wondered what the significance of the candy was. Perhaps I should have asked for a better explanation before eating it. As the day went on, it was already time to go home, and I decided to observe things a little longer where I was. Maybe, something unexpected would happen.

However, just when I thought nothing would happen, a friend of mine came up to me and requested that I help out at the school festival. I wished I could, but I had already been designated in another department.

Eventually, the day ended without any mysterious event. I didn't want to get my hopes up, but I was determined to test the candy again, and see if anything would happen at all."

Assistant: ""Hey, Soma, could you help us out at the school festival with our Butler Cafe? Nakasaka-san asked me to make some flyers to promote it," my friend said.

"I'm sorry, but Nakasaka-sensei has already given me another task in a different department," I replied apologetically.

"Ah, that's too bad. We'll just ask around and see if we can find someone else," my friend said, understanding my situation.

I felt bad for declining the offer to help, but I had to fulfill my responsibility to Nakasaka-sensei. Still, I wondered what would have happened had I gone to help out with the Butler Cafe."

After devouring a piece of the Matching Candy, I found myself eagerly anticipating what might happen the next day. However, when the day arrived, everything seemed to be just as it always was. My classroom was the same, my classmates were the same, and I felt no different myself. I hadn't even suffered from any stomach discomfort.

Since the effect of the candy was meant to last for 24 hours, I still had until after school to see if anything would happen. I decided to wait a while longer and see what unfolded.

But despite my anticipation, nothing happened. None of my classes, not even lunchtime, seemed to indicate any change in my life. I was left feeling completely bewildered since I was still unsure of the meaning behind the Destiny Match that the candy promised.

If only I had been provided with a better explanation before deciding to eat it, I thought bitterly.

Eventually, it was time to go home; yet, nothing had come about from eating that candy, at least not yet. I considered eating another piece once I got back home, but I didn't want to get my hopes up. Perhaps it was all just a dream.

Though as I finished my preparations to leave, one of my friends approached me asking for help with some tasks at the school festival. It was an offer that I'd usually appreciate, but I was already tasked with a separate assignment in different department by Nakasaka-sensei. I had to decline, but I was curious about what I'd be missing."

I wondered what to do next as I headed back home. Should I keep waiting patiently or try eating another piece of the candy? I decided to wait a bit longer and see if anything unexpected happened before concluding that the candy didn't work. I reminded myself not to have excessive expectations, though, as it could all be just a fanciful dream.

Lost in thoughts, I was snapped out of it when a friend called to me.

"Hey, Soma, could you help us out at the school festival with our Butler Cafe? Nakasaka-san asked me to make some flyers to promote it," my friend asked.

Feeling sorry to decline the invitation, I explained that Nakasaka-sensei had already given me a separate assignment in a different department.

"Ah, really? That's too bad. I guess we'll have to find someone else to help," my friend responded, understanding my situation.

Feeling guilty for not being able to help out, I headed home, still uncertain if the candy had worked or not. But, for now, all I could do was wait."
