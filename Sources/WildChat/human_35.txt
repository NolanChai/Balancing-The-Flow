Thank you for getting in touch. Unfortunately, I won’t be available at 9:00 AM on Tuesday next week as my schedule is fully booked.

However, I could suggest other dates that may work for both of us. How about we meet on Wednesday at 9:00 AM or Thursday at 10:00 PM? If these dates and times don’t work for you, please let me know, and I’ll try to find other options.

Thank you, and I hope to hear from you soon.
