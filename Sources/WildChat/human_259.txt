High School. Little do they know, Zack, Raph, Mikey, and Donnie possess immense power and abilities, making them practically invincible.

However, they must also face off against formidable villains such as All For One, Tomura Shigaraki, and Stain. Throughout it all, the unique dynamics and personalities of each character remain intact, creating an exciting and action-packed story."

User: "Make a Part 1 with a talk script scenario about this, and Raph, Mikey, Zack, and Donnie doesn’t talk and speak due to their quiet, calm, steady, stoic, and silent demeanor."

Assistant: "Title: A Crossover Encounter: Part 1

Scenario: Talk Script

(Scene: U.A. High School, class 1-A. The students are gathered for their regular training session. Izuku Midoriya, Ochaco Uraraka, and the rest of the class are present. Suddenly, the doors burst open, revealing four mysterious individuals: Zack Taylor, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello. The room falls silent as everyone turns to look at them.)

Izuku: (whispering) Who are they? They're not from our class.

Ochaco: I've never seen them before. Maybe they're new students?

(Professor Aizawa enters the room, looking slightly annoyed.)

Aizawa: What's going on here? Who are these kids?

Zack: (stands confidently but remains quiet)

Raphael: (crosses his arms, maintaining a stoic expression)

Michelangelo: (gives a playful wave, a mischievous glint in his eyes)

Donatello: (nods in acknowledgment, focused and silent)

Izuku: (whispering) They're not saying anything... How strange.

Ochaco: (whispering) And they have such different personalities. Look at Raphael, he's so... intense.

Aizawa: (narrows his eyes at the newcomers) Introduce yourselves. Why are you here?

(Zack steps forward, holding a note in his hand. He hands it over to Aizawa.)

Zack: (writing on a small notepad) We have transferred here. We are the new students.

Aizawa: (reading the note) New students? This is sudden. Very well, you'll be joining class 1-A.

(Izuku and Ochaco exchange puzzled glances.)

Izuku: (whispering) Did they just write everything down? Why aren't they speaking?

Ochaco: (whispering) I don't know, but they definitely seem different. Look at the way Donatello is observing everything.

(Aizawa addresses the class.)

Aizawa: Class 1-A, these four individuals are our new students. Treat them with respect and show them around. They'll be joining us for training today.

(Everyone starts moving around, preparing for training. Izuku approaches Zack.)

Izuku: Hi, I'm Izuku Midoriya. Welcome to U.A. High School.

(Zack nods and shakes Izuku's hand, a small smile forming on his face.)

Zack: Nice to meet you, Izuku. I'm Zack Taylor. Pleased to be here.

(Izuku looks over at Ochaco, who is assisting Raph with his training gear.)

Izuku: Ochaco, this is Zack Taylor, one of our new classmates.

(Ochaco smiles and extends her hand to shake Zack's.)

Ochaco: Hi, Zack! I'm Ochaco Uraraka. Welcome to U.A. High School, too.

(Zack shakes Ochaco's hand, his smile growing wider. Raphael and Michelangelo observe from a distance.)

Raphael: (whispering) They seem friendly enough.

Michelangelo: (whispering) Yeah, bro. I guess we'll have some new friends here.

(As the training session begins, the four newcomers demonstrate incredible prowess and agility. Their silent demeanor only adds to the intrigue. The class watches in awe as they effortlessly handle the challenges.)

Izuku: (impressed) Whoa, look at their moves! They're incredibly skilled.

Ochaco: (wide-eyed) And they're not even using their voices. It's like they communicate without words.

(After the training session, Raph, Mikey, Zack, and Donnie regroup near Izuku and Ochaco.)

Izuku: You guys were amazing out there! I've never seen anyone move like that.

Zack: (writes on his notepad) We've had a lot of training. But we're eager to learn from all of you too.

(Ochaco smiles at the newcomers, intrigued by their silent strength.)

Ochaco: We'll be happy to help you settle in. Welcome to class 1-A!

(Raphael, Michelangelo, Zack, and Donatello nod in appreciation, ready to embark on their new journey at U.A. High School.)
