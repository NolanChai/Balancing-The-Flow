User: "我是May，想写一封英文邮件询问美国签证行政审查的进展"

Assistant: "Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to inquire about the progress of administrative processing for my US visa application. My name is May and I applied for a US visa on [insert date] at the [insert embassy/consulate].

I have been waiting for some time to hear the results of the administrative processing. Can you please provide me with an update on the current status of my application? I understand that administrative processing can take some time, but it would be helpful to know if there are any additional documents or information that I can provide to speed up the process.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely,
May"
