User: "(Alatreon walks through a corridor, with massive slash marks all over - and these slash marks are massive)

Alatreon: “Phew! Managed to escape from The Jester! Now just gotta find Sheriff Toadster. I’ve seen the family mural before - Nabnab, Queen Bouncelia, Slow Seline, Jumbo Josh, Banbaleena, Banban, Opila Bird, Tarta Bird, Captain Fiddles, Stinger Flynn, Sheriff Toadster, Tamataki & Chamataki, Nabnaleena, The Jester, and even Zolphius! I wonder what other mascots there are.”

(Alatreon notices a mural depicting Miss Luna - a lavender Praying Mantis with a crown on her head. But Miss Luna’s crown is much different than Queen Bouncelia’s crown - Queen Bouncelia’s crown has three pink gems, while Miss Luna’s crown had a dark purple gem. But there were also two more murals. The mural to the left of Miss Luna depicted Silent Steve - a cobra mascot that’s a slightly lighter shade of purple than Queen Bouncelia. The mural to the right of Miss Luna depicted Coach Pickles - a bipedal cyan elephant mascot with short arms. And each mural also has a quote next to it - Silent Steve’s quote reflects what you’d do in a library, Miss Luna’s quote seems to imply she’s a dance teacher, and Coach Pickles’ quote fits his name)

Silent Steve’s quote reads, “Shhhh… Let’s keep it down in here.”

Miss Luna’s quote reads, “Let’s twirl and spin until we reach the stars.”

Coach Pickles’ quote reads, “Come on, let’s get fit and pick up the pace!”"

Assistant: "Alatreon: (curious) It seems like there are even more mascots here than I thought. I wonder if they’re all still around or if some have retired. (pauses and looks at the three murals again) Hmm, Silent Steve seems like he’d be one for quiet places. Miss Luna is definitely a dancer, but I wonder what kind of dance she teaches. And Coach Pickles is all about fitness, that’s for sure.

(Alatreon continues down the corridor, and soon comes across another set of murals. The mural to the left depicted a tall, slender bird with a green and yellow plumage - Opila Bird - and the mural to the right depicted a round, pink bird with a beak that curved upwards - Tarta Bird. And again, there were quotes next to each mural)

Opila Bird’s quote reads, “Up, up, and away!”

Tarta Bird’s quote reads, “Let’s nibble and peck our way through the day!”

Alatreon: (smiling) Opila Bird seems like a bird mascot that would like flying or going up high. And Tarta Bird seems like a fun and easygoing mascot, but also likes to eat.

(As Alatreon walks further, he comes across another mural depicting a dark green crocodile wearing a sheriff's hat - Sheriff Toadster)

Alatreon: (relieved) There he is! Now it’s time to find out what’s been going on with this Jester fellow."
