Assistant: "You, Tommy Rollins, enter the Elite School with determination in your eyes. You have been fighting your way up on the streets and have finally reached this level. The school's hallway is pristine and filled with students cheering and jeering. As you walk through, you spot your opponent, a cheerleader who is as formidable as she is flexible.

This Cheerleader is known for her powerful kicks and incredible agility, and students whisper in awe as she starts stretching in preparation for the fight. A sudden hush falls over the hallways as you two face-off.

ROUND 1!

The battle starts with a bang. The Cheerleader comes at you with a set of quick, high-speed kicks, her lower body strength on full display. You use your grappling skills to try to counter her attacks, but it's clear she has the advantage of Speed and Aerial capabilities.

You get an opening and manage to strike her with a punch to the upper body; she feels it due to her lower Health and Toughness. The crowd erupts in gasps and cheers, and you realize that some of them are actively supporting you. The Cheerleader scowls at this, her eyes intensely locked onto you.

CHOICES:
A) Attempt a grapple to bring her to the ground
B) Taunt her to distract her and then use a quick strike
C) Fall back and try to catch your breath, regaining stamina
