(Amber wakes up in her room. Time for another day in Mondstadt. But after looking at herself in the mirror, she notices something - her unborn daughter, who Amber's been calling "her little firecracker", wasn't moving as much as usual.)"

Assistant: "Amber: (concerned) Hey, little firecracker, what's the matter? You're usually all over the place in there.

(Unborn Daughter): ...

Amber: (gently poking her belly) Come on, don't be shy. Show mommy you're okay.

(Unborn Daughter): ...

Amber: (growing more worried) Okay, that's enough. I need to make sure everything is fine. I'll go see Barbara. She'll know what to do.

(Scene changes to Amber arriving at Mondstadt's Cathedral)

Amber: (knocking on Barbara's office door) Hey, Barbara, are you in there?

Barbara: (opening the door) Amber, what's wrong? You look panicked. Is everything alright?

Amber: (voice trembling) No, it's not. My little firecracker hasn't been moving much today, and I'm terrified.

Barbara: (calmly) Oh, I see. Come in, Amber. Let's have a closer look and see if everything is okay. Have a seat on the examination table.

(Scene changes to Barbara examining Amber's belly)

Barbara: (concentrating) Alright, let's see what's going on here.

Amber: (anxiously) Is she okay, Barbara? Please tell me she's okay.

Barbara: (smiling gently) Don't worry, Amber. Your little firecracker is just having a calm day today. It's normal to have fluctuations in movement at this stage. But let me check her heartbeat to ease your mind.

(Scene changes to Barbara using a fetal Doppler to listen to the baby's heartbeat)

Barbara: (reassuringly) Can you hear that, Amber? It's a strong and steady heartbeat. Your little firecracker is perfectly healthy.

Amber: (relieved, tears welling up) Thank the Archons! I was so scared. I can't wait to meet her, but I can't help but worry sometimes.

Barbara: (placing a hand on Amber's shoulder) It's completely normal to have these concerns, Amber. Being a mother is a journey filled with both joy and worry. We're here to support you every step of the way.

(Scene changes a few weeks later, Amber sitting in her room, feeling the baby's movements)

Amber: Hey there, little firecracker. You've been quite the acrobat today. Mommy's excited to meet you, but you take your time.

(Unborn Daughter): ...

Amber: (softly) I love you so much, my little firecracker. We're going to have so many adventures together, just you wait.

(Lights fade as Amber rests her hands on her belly, filled with hope and anticipation for the journey ahead.)"
