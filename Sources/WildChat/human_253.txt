Write an interesting, groundbreaking, lengthy chapter of a crossover fanfic between Harry Potter and Magika Kenshi, in which Petunia Evans breaks up with her fiancee Vernon after a huge fight with her little sister Lilly, over Lilly putting the fight against Voldemort and her duties in the Order of the Phoenix above her own family. While coping with her loss, she meets Hayashizaki Jinkai, a Japanese noble and samurai visiting England on business. 

Petunia reveals her struggles with her little sister and her suspicions about Lilly's mentor and the headmaster of Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore to Jinkai, but does not tell him about magic. She agrees to follow him back to Japan, as she thinks there is nothing left for her in the UK.

While living in Japan, Petunia falls in love with Jinkai and they get married, in a beautiful ceremony attended by the top of the Japanese social structure. She conceives on her first try, giving birth to a beautiful daughter whom she and Jinkai name Kanae.

Sometime after Kanae's birth, Jinkai and Petunia adopt a three-year-old boy named Kazuki Tachibana from an orphanage known as the Nanoha House.

As the children grow, Kanae sees Kazuki as her true older brother and has no idea he is adopted. She becomes a polite and well-behaved girl, with the grace and class of an heiress of her stature. Kazuki wants to become a samurai to serve the Japanese Empire, and is a quiet but headstrong young man with a heart of gold.

When Kazuki is 15 and Kanae is 12, they become boarding students of the National Samurai Academy, a state sponsored school to train the next generation of samurai and magical summoners to protect the Japanese Empire from external threats.

 Kazuki quickly becomes a star-student, but has to deal with the fact that he has a harem consisting of the hot-headed half-American blonde Mio Tachibana, the calm and steady, black-haired Student Council President Otonashi Kaguya, the blue haired, red eyed elf Hikaru Hoshikaze, who is secretly a clone of disgraced EVA pilot Rei Ayanami and feels guilty about this, his biological younger sister, the reserved but head strong Kaya, the tomboyish swordswoman Kazuha Tsukahara and the shy and reserved loli Karin Katsura. 

Kazuki also has to deal with the fact that he and Kanae both share strong feelings for each other.

Meanwhile, Harry Potter is taken in by the authorities after his parents' assassination by Voldemort and is adopted by a Japanese tourist, Akame Kawakami. Akame returns with Harry to Japan, where she renames him Shinji Kanzaki. 

Due to a series of secret experiments performed upon him just after his birth by NERV, Shinji develops the ability to transform into a superhuman mutant known as ZET. He is kidnapped by Gendo Ikari's thugs and subsequently forced to pilot EVA Unit-01 under the name Shinji Ikari when he is still in middle school, but he escapes after the fall of NERV, becoming a vigilante known as the Black Sweeper. 

Without Harry, Dumbledore shows his true colors and the Order of the Phoenix becomes an evil worse than Voldemort. Neville Longbottom is revealed to be the true Boy-Who-Lived, and defeats Voldemort in a stunning battle that becomes the stuff of legend. Albus dies during the fight, but the Order of the Phoenix tries to seize power before being put down by the international wizarding community."

Assistant: "Chapter 1: A New Life

The sun had just set over the quaint village of Little Whinging, and the Evans sisters were sitting across from each other at the small kitchen table. Each girl's eyes were red and puffy from a long day of crying, the specter of their confrontation earlier still enveloping the room in bitter resentment.

"Do you really think I don't care about you or the family, Petunia?" Lilly Evans shouted, her eyes brimming with tears, her magical ability to control them all but gone.

"This whole bloody Voldemort business is tearing us apart!" Petunia screamed back, her face contorted with grief and anger. "Look at us, Lilly! We're barely speaking to one another! And what about my life? What about Vernon?" The words choked in her throat, and she looked away from her sister to make sure she wouldn't see her cry.

Lilly dropped her gaze to the table, unable to bring herself to meet Petunia's eyes. "Petunia, you must understand, the fight against Voldemort is bigger than any of us. What we do now will decide the fate of the entire magical world. I can't just walk away from everything. I need you to understand that."

In that moment, Petunia knew she couldn't bear to be near her sister any longer. She had resolved to leave Little Whinging behind, to find something, anything, that would replace the aching hole in her heart that had been filled not-so-long-ago with the love of Vernon Dursley and her family.

Without another word, Petunia stormed out of the house and into the drizzle, leaving her sister and what remained of her life so far behind.

It wasn't long before she found herself aimless, desperately trying to make sense of her shattered life. That was when fate intervened in the form of Hayashizaki Jinkai, a handsome Japanese noble and samurai who had come to England on business. He had just left one of those stuffy meetings with the local gentry, and had decided to take a walk in the park when he happened upon a distraught Petunia.

Their fateful meeting was pure kismet. Both seemed to sense that they were meant to find each other in that park, and their love grew quickly over the next few weeks. Petunia confided her deepest thoughts and feelings to him, including her suspicions about her sister's mentor, Albus Dumbledore.

Jinkai gently coaxed her into moving with him to Japan. His calm, soothing demeanor helped her move past the tragic loss of her life in England. They were married in a beautiful ceremony, and Petunia soon found herself pregnant with Jinkai's child. Their daughter, Kanae, was born a healthy, beautiful baby girl.

In the years that followed, the couple adopted a charming, intelligent young boy of three from an orphanage known as the Nanoha House – Kazuki Tachibana. The family seemed to be complete.

As Kanae and Kazuki grew, they loved each other deeply, despite the fact that Kanae was unaware Kazuki was adopted. She thought of Kazuki as her true older brother – a confidante and protector.

Kazuki, driven by his samurai lineage and his adopted father, aspired to protect the Japanese Empire as a samurai. When he turned 15, he and 12-year-old Kanae left home to be

boarding students at the prestigious National Samurai Academy, shaping them into the fierce magical summoners and samurai warriors they aspired to be.

At the academy, Kazuki became a star student, but was burdened by his harem of seven magical summoners competing for his affections: the fiery Mio Tachibana, the meticulous and reserved Kaya, the no-nonsense swordswoman Kazuha Tsukahara, the enigmatic Otonashi Kaguya, the guilt-ridden Hikaru Hoshikaze, and the shy, introverted Karin Katsura. As if that weren't complicated enough, he and Kanae were grappling with the intense, confusing feelings they harbored for each other.

While Kazuki and Kanae navigated the turbulent waters of teenage hormones, an entirely different story was unfolding in their homeland of Japan. Harry Potter, now known as Shinji Kanzaki, had been adopted by a Japanese tourist after his parents' murder by Voldemort. His new mother, Akame Kawakami, had whisked him back to Japan to start a new, peaceful life.

Shinji’s life had been turned upside-down by a series of secret, illegal experiments performed on him by the shady organization NERV. The experiments left him with the ability to transform into a mutated vigilante known as ZET. His chaotic life as ZET eventually led him to cross paths with Kazuki, Kanae, and the other students of the National Samurai Academy.

As the lives of these two extraordinary sets of characters intertwined, they found themselves at the heart of a power vacuum in England. With Neville Longbottom revealed as the true Boy-Who-Lived and the Order of the Phoenix corrupted by the dastardly Albus Dumbledore, our heroes would need to band together to save the magical world from peril and protect their new lives in Japan from the wrath of their enemies.

Thus, the stage was set for an epic journey that would change the lives of Kazuki, Kanae, Shinji, and their friends forever…"
