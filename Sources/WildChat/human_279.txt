INT. MEDICAL STORE - DAY

Heather Schmidt, a beautiful, elegant, and stern 49-year old woman browses the aisles of the medical store. She is confident and assertive as she looks through the catalog of equipment, searching for aids to help her 24-year old daughter Susan, who is recovering at home from an accident.

The store clerk, JASON, a young and slightly nervous man, approaches Heather.

JASON
(awkwardly)
Uh, hi there, can I help you find something?

HEATHER
(sternly)
I'm browsing through your catalog. My daughter was recently in an accident, and I need to buy some aids for her. 

Jason notices how many items Heather has circled in the catalog.

JASON
(opening up)
Wow, that's quite a list. I'm sorry to hear about your daughter. What kind of aids are you looking for?

HEATHER
(beginning to soften)
Well, she's got a large bilateral hip spica cast from the accident. So, I'm thinking a special wheeled bed to make it easier for her to move. What options do you have for that?

JASON
(enlightened)
Oh, I see. Yeah, we've got a few different wheeled beds. Let me show you the options.

Jason leads Heather to a different aisle with a variety of wheeled beds.

HEATHER
(reassured)
These look great. What else do you recommend?

JASON
For a hip spica cast, a hoist could come in handy for lifting your daughter in and out of bed. And maybe an adjustable orthopedic bed as well?

Heather nods, adding the items to her list. Jason's face suddenly lights up.

JASON (CONT'D)
We also just got in these fantastic reaching aids, which could really help your daughter reach things without having to strain herself.

HEATHER
(sincere)
Thanks, I appreciate all your help. What else would you recommend?

Jason hesitates, reluctant to suggest the next item.

JASON
(fidgeting)
Well, I hate to say it, but adult diapers could help too. I'm sure it's not easy getting to the bathroom in her condition…

Heather fights the urge to laugh, trying to maintain her composure.

HEATHER
(teasing)
Well, you're really trying to upsell me here, aren't you, Jason? But I guess you're right. Add those to the list too.

Jason, embarrassed, frantically writes down the items. Heather continues to scan through the other aisles.

HEATHER (CONT'D)
(reveling in Jason's embarrassment)
And throw in a few packs of that scented baby powder. We don't want Susan feeling like she's been left in a diaper all day, do we?

JASON
(blushing)
Of course not, ma'am. I'll make sure you're well stocked.

As Heather gathers her purchases, she starts to chuckle.

HEATHER
(amused)
I can't remember the last time I bought baby products. It's almost as if I'm starting over… except with a full-grown adult baby.

Jason, feeling more at ease, laughs along with her.

JASON
(laughing)
Hey, you never know when parenting skills are going to come in handy, right?

HEATHER
You're right, Jason. Even after 24 years, it never ceases to surprise me.

Assistant: "Patient Name: Susan Schmidt
Age: 24
Sex: Female
Primary Physician: Dr. Katherine Powell
Physician Signature: Katherine Powell, MD

Date of Service: December 12, 2022
Chief Complaint: Immobility and pain management resulting from bilateral hip spica cast. The patient is post-MVA and requires mobility aids, in-home assistance, and a plan for long-term rehabilitation.

MEDICAL HISTORY:
Susan Schmidt is a generally healthy 24-year-old female with no significant past medical history. She is a non-smoker and reports occasional alcohol consumption. Her regular physical activities include jogging, yoga, and pilates. No known drug allergies are present.

RECENT INJURIES:
Susan was involved in a Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) on November 28, 2022, resulting in the following injuries:

1. Bilateral acetabular fractures
2. Left proximal femur fracture
3. Right tibial plateau fracture
4. Mild concussion

SURGICAL INTERVENTION:
On November 29, 2022, Susan underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of bilateral acetabular fractures and left proximal femur fracture, as well as arthroscopic surgery for right tibial plateau fracture. All procedures were performed by Dr. Robert Jennings, an orthopedic surgeon. The postoperative course proceeded without complication.

BILATERAL HIP SPICA CAST:
Following the surgical intervention, Susan was placed in a bilateral hip spica cast, which extends from below her ribcage down to her ankles. The cast is to remain in place for an estimated 12-15 weeks to ensure proper healing of fractures.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Oxycodone (5 mg) - Taken as needed for pain, every four hours (maximum 40mg/day)
2. Celecoxib (200 mg) - Taken daily for inflammation and pain management
3. Tums (500 mg) - Taken as needed for prevention and treatment of heartburn/indigestion, secondary to opioid intake
4. Colace (100 mg) - Taken daily as needed for constipation prevention, secondary to opioid intake

IMMOBILITY AIDS:
The following devices were recommended and purchased for Susan by her mother, Heather Schmidt:

1. An electronically operated wheeled and height-adjustable bed for mobilization, with remote control
2. A hydraulic patient hoist to assist with patient transfers as needed
3. Reaching aids to facilitate independence with daily activities that require reaching or stretching
4. Incontinency pads and diaper supplies

IN-HOME CARE:
Susan will require home health aide services, physical therapy, and occupational therapy interventions to assist with Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), to help prevent further complications during her recovery in a bilateral hip spica cast.

PLANNED REHABILITATION:
Upon the removal of the cast, and as advised by Dr. Katherine Powell, Susan will require a long-term rehabilitation plan consisting of physiotherapy and home exercises to regain her strength, stability, and range of motion. It is projected that her rehabilitation will take an additional 6 to 9 months before she can resume her regular activities, given no complications during her recovery.

Follow-up appointments are scheduled as well, every 4 weeks, to monitor her progress and address any concerns or complications related to her convalesce.

All recommended services and mobility aids are documented in this report for the benefit of the patient, her family, and her care providers. It is important to educate the patient and her support system during this recovery process.
