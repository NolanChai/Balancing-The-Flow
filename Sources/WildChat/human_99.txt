User: "I am using this formula to find the first three words in a sentence '=IFERROR(LEFT(C2, FIND(" ",C2, FIND(" ",C2, FIND(" ",C2)+1)+1)-1),"")' . How can I change it to find the first two words"

Assistant: "To modify the formula to find the first two words in a sentence, you can adjust the formula like this:

```
=IFERROR(LEFT(C2, FIND(" ", C2, FIND(" ", C2) + 1) - 1), "")
```

In the original formula, `FIND(" ", C2, FIND(" ", C2, FIND(" ", C2)+1)+1)-1` was used to find the position of the third space in the sentence. By removing `FIND(" ", C2, FIND(" ", C2, FIND(" ", C2)+1)+1)`, you can update it to find the second space, thus extracting the first two words."

User: "How can I make sure that when text is entered into a cell in a column, it is more than 6 words"

Assistant: "To ensure that the text entered into a cell in a column contains more than six words, you can use the following formula:

`=IF(COUNT(LEN(TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",""))))-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",""))+1>6, "Valid", "Invalid")`

Assuming the text is entered in cell A1, this formula checks if the count of words (separated by spaces) is greater than 6. If the text has more than 6 words, it will display "Valid," otherwise, it will display "Invalid."

Note: If you want to apply this formula to multiple cells in the column, make sure to adjust the cell reference (`A1` in this example) accordingly."

User: "is there any way I can do this with Data Validation"

Assistant: "Yes, you can utilize data validation in Excel to restrict the number of words in a cell. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Select the range of cells where you want to apply the data validation.
2. Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon and click on "Data Validation" in the "Data Tools" group.
3. In the "Data Validation" dialog box, select the "Settings" tab.
4. In the "Allow" dropdown, choose "Custom."
5. In the "Formula" input box, enter the following formula:

   `=COUNT(LEN(TRIM(SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",""))))-LEN(SUBSTITUTE(A1," ",""))+1>6`

   Replace `A1` with the first cell reference of the selected range.

6. Optionally, you can provide an error message and error alert style in the "Error Alert" tab to notify users if they enter fewer than 6 words.
7. Click "OK" to apply the data validation rule.

Now, anyone entering text into the validated cells will only be able to input values with more than 6 words. If they exceed this limit, they will receive an error message according to the settings you specified."
