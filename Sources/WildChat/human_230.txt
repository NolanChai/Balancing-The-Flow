User: "when i try access the value in i18n folder gives me this editor error Property 'header' comes from an index signature, so it must be accessed with ['header']."

Assistant: "This error message is related to accessing properties in an object using square bracket notation instead of dot notation. When using square brackets, you need to provide the property name as a string. 

In the context of the i18n folder, it seems like you are trying to access the `header` property. Instead of using dot notation like `i18n.header`, you should use square bracket notation like `i18n['header']`. 

Here's an example to demonstrate the difference:

```javascript
const i18n = {
  header: 'Hello world',
};

console.log(i18n.header); // Accessing property with dot notation
console.log(i18n['header']); // Accessing property with square bracket notation
```

Both `console.log` statements will print the value of the `header` property, which is "Hello world"."
