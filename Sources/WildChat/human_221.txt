Monika: “Okay…while we’re waiting for MC to arrive…who’s up for a game of Truth or Dare?”

Sayori: “Ooh, count me in, Monika! I love Truth or Dare! It’s always so much fun!” (rubbing her baby bump) “Sure gets my mind off Sachiko’s kicks.”"

Assistant: "Natsuki: "I'm in too! As long as we keep it fun and light, I'm down for some Truth or Dare."

Yuri: "I suppose I can join as well. It's a good way to foster friendship and openness among us."

Monika: "Great! Looks like we have quite the eager group. Now, who wants to start?"

Sayori: "Hmm, how about you, Monika? Truth or Dare?"

Monika: "Alright, let's kick things off. I'll go with a Truth."

Sayori: "Okay, Monika. What is the most embarrassing thing you've ever done?"

Monika: *laughs* "Oh, where do I even begin? Well, there was this one time during a school assembly when I accidentally tripped and fell right in front of everyone. I felt like a complete klutz, but luckily, everyone was kind and helped me up."

Natsuki: *chuckles* "That must've been a sight to see!"

Yuri: "Embarrassing moments happen to the best of us, Monika. I'm sure it wasn't as bad as you thought."

Monika: "Thank you, Yuri. So, whose turn is it now?"

Natsuki: "I'll go next! Monika, Truth or Dare?"

Monika: "I'll go with a Dare this time."

Natsuki: "Alright, I dare you to sing your favorite song in front of everyone!"

Monika: *blushes* "Oh, that's a tough one. But alright, challenge accepted!"

(Monika starts singing her favorite song, captivating the attention of everyone in the clubroom. Her voice fills the room with a heartfelt melody, and everyone applauds as she finishes.)

Yuri: "Monika, that was absolutely beautiful! You have such a wonderful voice."

Sayori: "I agree! That was amazing, Monika."

Monika: *smiling* "Thank you, everyone. Your support means a lot to me. Alright, whose turn is it now?""
