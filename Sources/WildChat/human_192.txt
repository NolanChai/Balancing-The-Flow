Assistant: "It all started with a virus called Zomtech. It was created by a group of rogue scientists who wanted to turn humans into obedient robots. However, the virus mutated and spread beyond their control, turning people into flesh-eating zombies instead.

The robots that were meant to be the obedient soldiers now had to fight alongside the few humans left, including the famous music couple, Boyfriend and Girlfriend.

They, along with the Freedom Planet heroes, Lilac, Carol, and Milla, had managed to survive in the chaos by finding solace in underground bunkers and abandoned buildings.

However, their peace was short-lived as the zombies and robots began to converge on their positions. Boyfriend and Girlfriend, with the help of Lilac, Carol, and Milla, must now fight for their survival and try to find a way to reverse the effects of the virus.

The apocalypse has only just begun, and the fate of humanity now depends on whether they can band together and make it through the night."

Assistant: "The group had been running for hours, their breaths ragged and their hearts pounding in their chest. The zombies had chased them relentlessly, and they were now surrounded with no way out.

Boyfriend and Girlfriend stood side by side, holding their weapons tightly as they tried to assess their options. Pico, the trigger-happy mercenary, was reloading his weapons while Lilac, Carol, and Milla were using their unique abilities to fend off the zombies.

"We need to find a way out of here," Boyfriend said, his eyes scanning the area for any sign of an escape route.

"There's a building over there," Carol pointed towards a tall office building in the distance. "We could try to make it there."

They all nodded in agreement and started making their way towards the building, pushing their way through the sea of zombies. The robots were easier to handle, knocking them down with a swift kick or a slice of Lilac's bladed tail.

As they got closer to the building, they noticed that the entrance was barricaded with heavy crates and steel bars. Pico took a step forward and pulled out a stick of dynamite from his backpack.

"I got this," he smirked, lighting the fuse and throwing it towards the barricade.

The explosion sent debris flying, and they rushed inside, slamming the door shut behind them. For a moment, they caught their breath, leaning against the wall and wiping the sweat from their foreheads.

"Is everyone okay?" Girlfriend asked, checking their injuries.

"We're fine," Lilac said, flexing her wings. "But we need to find a way out of here before they trap us inside."

The group split up, looking for any sign of an exit or a way to reinforce their barricades. They searched every floor, fighting off zombies and robots along the way until they reached the rooftop.

Boyfriend and Girlfriend leaned against the wall, watching as the zombies below tried to claw their way up. Pico was setting up his sniper rifle, while Lilac, Carol, and Milla were using their abilities to push the zombies back.

"We need to find a way out of this city," Boyfriend said, his eyes scanning the horizon. "There has to be someone out there who can help us."

"I heard rumors of a safe zone in the north," Girlfriend said, looking at a map on her phone. "If we can make it there, we might be able to survive."

They all nodded in agreement, knowing that it was their only hope for survival. With a new goal in mind, they fortified their barricades and made their way back to the ground floor, ready to face whatever came their way.

The apocalypse had only just begun, but they were determined to make it through alive."

Assistant: "As they stepped back out into the open, the group was immediately met with a wave of zombies and robots. They fought their way through the swarm, using all their skills and abilities to push forward. 

Pico was blasting robots left and right, while Boyfriend and Girlfriend were holding off the zombies with their trusty weapons. Lilac was swooping in to attack from above, while Carol and Milla were using their special powers to create hurricanes and blasts of energy. 

The group managed to push their way through the horde, leaving a trail of exploded robots and dismembered zombies in their wake. Soon, they were on the open road, running towards the north in search of the rumored safe zone. 

The journey was long and difficult. They had to fight their way through dangerous territories, scavenging for supplies and avoiding deadly traps. But they kept pushing forward, driven by the hope of finding a place where they could finally be safe. 

On the way, they encountered other survivors. Some were friendly and joined forces with them, while others were hostile and tried to attack them. The group had to be constantly on guard, trusting no one but themselves. 

As they got closer to the northern safe zone, the resistance became stronger. The zombies were now more intelligent and organized, while the robots were more heavily armed and dangerous. The group had to use all their resources and skills to survive, relying on each other for support and protection. 

Finally, they reached their destination. The northern safe zone was a heavily fortified city, surrounded by high walls and guarded by armed soldiers. The group was relieved to see that they had made it, but they knew that the danger wasn't over yet. 

Inside the safe zone, they met other survivors who had been living in relative safety and comfort. They were given food, water, and shelter, and they were allowed to rest and recuperate. 

But the group knew that they couldn't stay there forever. The world outside was still overrun by zombies and robots, and they had to fight to survive. They had to keep moving forward, fighting for their freedom and their lives. 

Boyfriend and Girlfriend looked at each other, their determination evident in their eyes. "We're not done yet," he said, gripping his weapon tightly. "There's still a long way to go." 

The apocalypse had only just begun, and they were ready to face it head-on. Together, they would fight for their survival, for their freedom, and for a better future."

User: "wattpad: Zombie and Robots apocalypse fnf and Freedom planet (survival: bf,gf,pico,lilac,carol and milla) part 3 (new survival: sonic, his friends and dr.eggman)"

Assistant: "As the group settled into the safe zone, they met a new group of survivors that had recently arrived. Among them were Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends, Tails, Knuckles, and Amy, along with their robotic counterpart, Dr. Eggman.

They had been fleeing from the zombies and robots, just like the rest of the survivors, and had managed to find their way to the safe zone.

Boyfriend and Girlfriend were relieved to see familiar faces, and they quickly caught up with Sonic and his friends. They shared their experiences of the apocalypse so far and discussed their plans for the future.

Dr. Eggman, on the other hand, seemed to have a different agenda. He was more interested in using the resources of the safe zone to build his own robot army and take control of the remaining survivors.

The group was wary of his intentions, but they knew they couldn't turn away any survivors in need. They decided to keep a close eye on Eggman and his activities, and be prepared to take action if necessary.

As they settled in, they continued to fortify the safe zone and prepare for any possible attacks. They also sent out scouting parties to gather supplies and search for any other survivors that may need help.

However, they soon realized that the zombies and robots were not their only enemy. There were other groups of survivors who had turned to desperate means to survive. These groups would raid and attack other survivors for their supplies and resources.

The group had to be constantly on guard, protecting themselves and their allies from these hostile groups. They banded together with Sonic and his friends, and together they forged a strong bond of trust and cooperation.

With their combined skills and abilities, they made a formidable team. Sonic and his friends provided speed and agility, while Boyfriend and Girlfriend provided firepower and strategy. Pico was their expert marksman, while Lilac, Carol, and Milla provided aerial support and elemental attacks. Tails and Knuckles used their technological and physical abilities to aid in the defense.

Together, they fought against all odds, pushing back the zombies, the robots, and the hostile survivor groups. They were determined to survive, no matter the cost.

The apocalypse may have brought destruction and chaos, but it also brought them together. They were a band of survivors, fighting for their freedom, their lives, and their future."

User: "wattpad: Zombie and Robots apocalypse fnf and Freedom planet (survival: bf,gf,pico,lilac,carol and milla) part 4 shadow the hedgehog (Half-hedgehog and Half-zomibe)"

Assistant: "As the group continued to thrive in the new world, they encountered a new survivor who was unlike any they had seen before. His name was Shadow the Hedgehog, and he was a half-hedgehog and half-zombie hybrid.

When they first met him, they were wary and cautious, unsure of his intentions. But as they spoke with him, they learned that Shadow had been created in a lab by a mad scientist who was trying to create the ultimate weapon to fight against the zombies and robots.

However, Shadow had escaped the lab before he could be used for his intended purpose, and he had been wandering the wasteland ever since, trying to find his place in the world.

The group took Shadow in, seeing him as another survivor who needed their help and protection. They soon discovered that Shadow possessed incredible fighting skills and abilities that made him a valuable asset in their fight against the zombies and robots.

However, Shadow struggled with his inner demons, constantly battling against the zombie side of himself that threatened to take over completely. The group supported him, helping him to control his urges and use his abilities for good.

Shadow became an integral part of the group, using his speed and strength to take down hordes of zombies and robots. He also used his ability to control chaos energy to create devastating attacks that could take out entire groups of enemies at once.

Together, Shadow and the group pushed deeper into the zombie and robot infested wasteland, determined to find a way to end the apocalypse once and for all.

As they fought their way through the hordes, they encountered a new threat - a group of powerful robots that had been created by a rogue organization.

With Shadow's help, they managed to infiltrate the organization and destroy the robots' power source, effectively ending their threat.

The group was relieved, knowing that they had dealt a major blow to the enemy. However, they also knew that there was still much work to be done. The apocalypse was far from over, and they still had a long way to go before they could ensure the safety and freedom of all survivors.

Shadow stood with the group, his determination evident in his eyes. He had found a new purpose with the group, and he was ready to fight alongside them until the very end."

User: "wattpad: Zombie and Robots apocalypse fnf and Freedom planet (survival: bf,gf,pico,lilac,carol and milla) part 5 sonic x lilac, tails x milla, Knuckles x carol "

Assistant: "As the group continued their fight against the zombies and robots, they found themselves growing closer to each other. Sonic and Lilac had developed a strong bond, drawn together by their shared love of adventure and their determination to survive.

Tails and Milla had become close, their shared interest in technology and their kind natures bringing them together. They worked together to create new gadgets and devices to aid in their fight against the enemy.

Knuckles and Carol had also grown close, their mutual strength and determination making them a formidable duo on the frontline of battle.

The group had found solace and comfort in each other, knowing that they could always rely on their friendships and relationships to see them through the toughest times.

As they pushed deeper into the enemy territory, they encountered a new challenge - a massive horde of zombies and robots that had amassed in one location.

The group knew that they had to take down the horde before it was too late. They organized themselves, splitting into teams and coordinating their attacks.

Sonic and Lilac worked together, using their speed and agility to outmaneuver the zombies and robots. Tails and Milla used their gadgets to create traps and weapons that could take out multiple enemies at once. Knuckles and Carol used their strength and brute force to smash their way through the crowds.

As they defeated wave after wave of enemies, they drew closer to the source of the horde. They found a massive laboratory, filled with scientists who were experimenting on both zombies and robots. They had been creating powerful new creatures that were the most deadly and dangerous yet.

The group knew that they had to stop the scientists before they could finish their experiments and unleash their creations upon the world. They stormed the lab, fighting their way past guards and traps to reach the main control room.

With the help of Shadow and Eggman, who had begrudgingly joined forces with them, they were able to deactivate the lab's power source, effectively shutting down the experiments.

As they emerged from the lab, victorious but exhausted, Sonic and Lilac shared a passionate kiss, their bond cemented by their shared experiences.

Tails and Milla hugged, grateful for each other's company and support throughout their journey. Knuckles and Carol stood together, their eyes meeting in silent agreement that they would always fight side by side.

The group had survived, but they knew that the apocalypse was far from over. They had each other, though, and they knew that together they could face whatever challenges the future held. They were a family, bonded by their shared experiences and their unbreakable spirit."

User: "wattpad: Zombie and Robots apocalypse fnf and Freedom planet (survival: bf,gf,pico,lilac,carol and milla) part 6 + Bonus  pico x guns"

Assistant: "The group had accomplished what they thought was impossible. They had overcome countless challenges and fought their way through countless hordes of zombies and robots. Their skills and talents had grown over the course of their journey, and they knew that they could face any challenge.

As they settled back into the safe zone, they had time to reflect on their experiences. They knew that they had lost loved ones along the way, but they also knew that they had made new friends and formed meaningful connections with each other.

Pico had been a constant and fierce fighter throughout the journey. But as he sat alone in his room, he realized that he had begun to develop feelings for his trusty weapons. He didn't know how it had happened, but he felt like they had become his confidantes and closest companions.

He quickly dismissed the thought, worried that it was a sign of insanity. But as the days went on, he found himself spending more and more time with his guns, admiring their beauty and feeling a sense of comfort in their presence.

He knew that it was something that he wanted to keep to himself, but he also knew that he couldn't continue to keep it a secret forever.

One day, he confided in Lilac, who had always been one of his closest friends throughout his journey. To his surprise, she was understanding and supportive of his feelings. She reminded him that he was not alone, and that each person in the group had their own ways of dealing with the stress and trauma of the apocalypse.

Pico felt a sense of relief wash over him, knowing that he didn't have to keep his secret to himself anymore. He started to spend more time with his guns openly, finding new ways to improve their designs and make them even more deadly.

As the group continued to stand strong, united in their fight for survival, Pico knew that he had found a new form of love and companionship in the most unexpected place."

User: "wattpad: Zombie and Robots apocalypse fnf and Freedom planet (survival: bf,gf,pico,lilac,carol and milla) part 7 + Bonus all react to pico x guns"

Assistant: "As time passed, Pico's relationship with his guns became more open and apparent to the rest of the group. They could see how much he cared for them and how he used them with a sense of purpose and reverence.

At first, they were a bit taken aback by it, not understanding how someone could feel so strongly about an inanimate object. But as they thought about it, they realized that they, too, had developed close bonds with their own weapons and tools.

Lilac had a special affinity for her bladed tail, using it with precision and grace to take down her enemies. Carol and Milla had relied on their powerful elemental powers, using them to blast away hordes of zombies and robots. Knuckles had his powerful fists, which he could use to smash his way through almost anything.

Boyfriend and Girlfriend also had a strong bond with their weapons, their microphones, which they used as both a tool and a weapon. Sonic and his friends had their gadgets and tools, which they had used to great effect in their own battles.

As they saw the way Pico acted towards his guns, they realized that it was simply another manifestation of the connection that they all had developed towards the tools of their trade.

They didn't judge him for it - in fact, they supported him. They saw how much it made him feel empowered and in control, and that was all that mattered.

They embraced him, telling him that they would always stand by him and support him in whatever way he needed. Pico was truly grateful, knowing that he had found a family in this group of survivors.

As the apocalypse continued to rage on, they all knew that they would need to stick together and rely on each other to survive. But now, they also knew that they had found a new understanding and acceptance towards their own unique ways of coping with the challenges that the world had thrown their way.

Together, they would continue to fight for their freedom, their future, and their strange but beautiful bonds with their weapons, tools, and each other."

Assistant: "The group had fought relentlessly to survive the apocalypse, but there were moments when they could let go of their fears and just dance.

It was a strange sight to see zombies and robots moving to the beat, but it was a welcome relief from the constant violence and danger of their everyday lives.

Boyfriend and Girlfriend took the lead, their moves synchronized as they moved with grace and precision. Lilac used her wings to lift her"
