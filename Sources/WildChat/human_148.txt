It is a rocky planet with a diverse range of ecosystems and is home to millions of species, including humans. Earth has a complex system of geological processes, an atmosphere that protects and sustains life, and a variety of landforms such as mountains, deserts, oceans, and forests. It is also the only planet known to have liquid water, which is essential for life as we know it. Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in approximately 365 days, causing the changing seasons."
