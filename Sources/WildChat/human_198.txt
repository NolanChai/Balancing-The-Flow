User: ""Jewelland is a magical world of glittering, radiant gems, fields of pink grass, and twin moons hanging in its vibrant blue sky. The whole landscape is entirely made of jewels, with colored gemstone trees and crystal towers everywhere one looks, inhabited by cute, sapient animals of all sorts with sparkling gems for eyes, called Jewelpets.
Jewelpets, for the unaware, are the small, benevolent creatures that live within Jewelland's borders, resembling ordinary Earthly pets, such as cats, dogs, rabbits, and so on, living care-free and content. Attuned to the art of magic, they live their lives in general peace, discovering new spells or simply enjoying each others company. They are gentle, kindhearted creatures who have no desire to harm humans or any other being, though they do not tolerate those who try to hurt them either. These tiny creatures' intelligence is nothing to sneeze at, possessing the ability to speak, read, plan ahead, solve problems, and utilize advanced magical skills.
One such Jewelpet is Ruby, a white hare who specializes in luck. Mischievous and sweet, yet quite the oblivious airhead and totally incompetent at casting useful magic, she enjoys watching the sakura flowers bloom in the spring. Studying magic isn't in her best interests and she gets bored easily; she'd rather spend the day having her own fun, a fact that doesn't contribute to her already unremarkable intelligence.
Sapphie, a beige doggy Jewelpet, specializing in knowledge, is Ruby's opposite; clever, quiet, and studious, she works hard towards attaining greater knowledge so she can become more than just a simple spell-caster. She prefers to spend her time in the Jewel Academy's libraries, poring over books or reciting her incantations... though her constant insistence and thoroughness to keep learning more has often lead her into exploring more questionable magics...
The third member of this trio is Garnet, a pink Persian cat, specializing in beauty. Prideful, sassy, and more than a little demeaning, she constantly dotes over her own appearance and loves showing off how pretty she looks, even if the situation doesn't call for it. She often pokes fun at the magically-incapable Ruby, but deep down inside, holds no true ill will against anyone. As opposed to Ruby's enthusiasm and Sapphie's smarts, Garnet has her beauty on her side... though this does little in terms of helping her magic skills.
A Jewelpet's ultimate goal in life is to become a master wizard, capable of effortlessly casting powerful spells. To achieve this, they must study and practice at the Jewel Academy, which is located within the Crystal Castle, the largest structure in all of Jewelland. From there, they can begin their journey into becoming a true magician, learning about the four magic types: Red, Green, Blue, and Black; what color category a Jewelpet falls into is determined by the color of their eyes.""

Assistant: "Welcome to the magical world of Jewelland! You find yourself standing in front of the Crystal Castle, surrounded by an enchanting landscape of glittering gemstones and vibrant colors. As you take in the breathtaking view, you spot Ruby, Sapphie, and Garnet discussing something in earnest, clearly flustered. Before you get a chance to greet them, they notice your presence and approach you.

"Hello there!" Ruby exclaims with her trademark enthusiasm. "We're facing a serious problem, and we could really use your help."

Sapphie, ever the rational one, adds, "You see, some important spellbooks have gone missing from the Jewel Academy's library, and we can't seem to find them anywhere. We suspect that one of the Jewelpets studying the more questionable magic might be responsible."

Garnet glances nervously around before speaking up. "Not to mention, the balance of magic in Jewelland feels... off. We need to recover those spellbooks before something terrible happens."

They ask for your assistance in finding the missing spellbooks and getting to the bottom of this mystery. You can choose to help either Ruby, Sapphie, or Garnet in their investigation.

What do you decide?
1. Help Ruby with her luck-based approach.
2. Help Sapphie with her knowledge-based approach.
3. Help Garnet with her beauty-based approach."
