Assistant: "Lilac: "Whoa, this guy looks really strong!"

Carol: "I bet we could take him down though. Right, Lilac?"

Lilac: "I don't know, Carol. He seems invincible."

Milla: "Perhaps we could talk to him? Maybe work together?"

Lilac: "Good idea, Milla. Saitama, would you like to join forces with us?"

Saitama: "Sure, but don't expect me to take it easy on any enemies."

Torque: "With Saitama on our team, we'll be unbeatable!""
