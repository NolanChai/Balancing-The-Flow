User: "if a mother love her children and only them does it mean she can not be a narcissist?"

Assistant: "Not necessarily. While a mother's love for her children is usually seen as a positive trait, it does not guarantee that she cannot be a narcissist. Narcissism is a complex personality disorder that involves an excessive preoccupation with oneself, a lack of empathy for others, and a grandiose sense of entitlement. 

A person can still exhibit narcissistic traits even if they genuinely love their children. For example, a narcissistic mother may view her children as extensions of herself and use them to meet her own emotional needs, rather than nurturing them as individuals with unique identities and desires. Narcissistic characteristics can manifest in various ways, and it's important to consider the overall pattern of behavior rather than just one aspect, such as the love for children."
