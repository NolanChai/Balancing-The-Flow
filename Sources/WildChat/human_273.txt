User: "marcher kingdoms  - what is it"

Assistant: "Marcher kingdoms, also known as Marcher lordships, were semi-autonomous territories in medieval England that were situated near the border of Wales and Scotland. These territories were granted to powerful lords in order to help secure and defend the border regions against attacks from neighboring countries. The lords who governed these territories were given broad powers to maintain law and order, including the right to conduct trials and punishment, as well as to raise armies for defense purposes.

One of the primary functions of the Marcher lordships was to provide a buffer zone between the English territories and the neighboring non-English-speaking regions of Wales and Scotland. Marcher lords also had greater freedom than other nobles in terms of tax and legal exemptions, which made the Marcher lordships desirable for those who could afford them. However, because their authority was largely unchecked by the king or other central authorities, Marcher lords sometimes became a law unto themselves, and there were often conflicts between the Marcher kingdoms and the English Crown."

User: ""the Gruinmarkt, where they came from, hadn't progressed much past a high-medieval civilization of marcher kingdoms up and down the eastern seaboard" - what marcher kingdom means here"

Assistant: "In the context you have provided, "marcher kingdoms" refers to semi-autonomous territories that developed in a  high-medieval civilization in the Gruinmarkt, which is a fictional world created by author Sean Stewart. 

The marcher kingdoms mentioned in this quote were situated along the eastern seaboard of the Gruinmarkt, and were likely similar to the Marcher Lordships that existed in medieval England. These territories were governed by powerful lords who were responsible for maintaining order and defense along the border regions of the Gruinmarkt. The reference to a "high-medieval civilization" suggests that the Gruinmarkt was a society that had not yet progressed beyond a medieval level of technology and culture."
