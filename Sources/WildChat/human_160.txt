Assistant: "There is no book version specifically titled "Mindset all." However, there is a popular book on mindset called "Mindset: The New Psychology of Success" by Carol S. Dweck. This book explores the concept of mindset and the impact it has on achieving success in various areas of life. Dweck discusses the difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset, and provides insights on how to cultivate a growth mindset for personal and professional development."
