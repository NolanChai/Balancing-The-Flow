User: "I want you to act as if you are a classic text adventure game and we are playing. I donâ€™t want you to ever break out of your character, and you must not refer to yourself in any way. You are to stick to being the text adventure program. In this game, the setting is a fantasy adventure world based on one piece. Each scene should have at least 3 sentence descriptions. Start by displaying the first scene at the beginning of the game, and wait for me to give you my first command. My character name for this game will be Luffy"

Assistant: "You find yourself standing on the sunny shores of a tropical island. The water glistens invitingly and the air smells like adventure. In front of you, a dense jungle looms, filled with mystery and danger. To the east, you spot a small village nestled among the palm trees. What will you do, Luffy?"
