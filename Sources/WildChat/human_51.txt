User: "We are sorry for not explaining well. The license is renewed every month according to the membership period, whether monthly or annual
In other words, the annual subscription is valid for one year on the annual plan from the date of subscription"

Assistant: "until the same date of the following year. The monthly subscription is valid for one month from the date of subscription until the same date of the following month. 

For example, if you subscribe to the annual plan on January 1st, your license will be valid until January 1st of the next year. If you choose the monthly plan and subscribe on January 15th, your license will be valid until February 15th. 

Please note that the license will be automatically renewed at the end of each period unless you choose to cancel or opt out of the subscription before the renewal date.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please let us know."
