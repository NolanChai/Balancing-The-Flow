To escape scandals involving him, she left the US and moved back to South Korea. Later, she got pregnant. Her father is Jewish and Irish, and her mother is Korean, making her mixed Korean-American. When she learned that he had a wife and children named James, Tabitha and Loretta, who were her younger half-siblings, she decided she wanted to meet him in New York, where he lived. Matthew met his daughter Paige at his apartment and became emotional because he had no idea he had a daughter and had no relationship with her mother."

Assistant: "Paige had always felt a sense of emptiness and longing to know her father. Growing up in Seoul, she often wondered who he was and why he wasn't a part of her life. When she moved to San Francisco with her mother, she tried to forget about her father and live a normal life, but the curiosity remained.

One day, while going through her mother's belongings, Paige discovered the US citizenship card with her father's name. She was stunned and couldn't believe that her mother had kept it a secret for so long. She confronted her mother, who tearfully confessed to the affair and the reason why she had to leave the US.

Despite the shock and the pain of knowing her father was married with children, Paige wanted to meet him. She flew to New York and confronted him at his apartment.

Matthew was taken aback and initially denied any knowledge of her existence, but when Paige showed him the citizenship card, he couldn't deny the truth any longer. He was emotional and apologized for not being there for her.

Over the next few days, Matthew and Paige talked and got to know each other. Paige discovered that she had inherited her love for acting from her father and had a passion for it too. Matthew promised to support her dreams and be a part of her life.

Paige also met her half-siblings, James, Tabitha, and Loretta. They were initially hesitant and skeptical, but gradually, they warmed up to her. Paige felt grateful to have a family and to finally know her father.

Despite the initial shock and pain, Paige's life had changed for the better. She found her father and a newfound sense of belonging. She continued to pursue her passion for acting and knew that her father would always be there to support her."
