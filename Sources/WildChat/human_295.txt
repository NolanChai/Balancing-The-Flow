User: "I would like something that can prevent a UK plug from being used do you know of such a device "

Assistant: "Yes, you can use a "plug lock" or a "safety plug cover" specifically designed for UK plugs. These devices typically cover the plug pins, making it impossible to insert them into a socket, thus preventing the plug from being used. They are readily available online from websites like Amazon or in local hardware stores. Make sure to choose a product that is compatible with UK plugs (BS1363)."
