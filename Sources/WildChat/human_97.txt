Assistant: "INT. JANE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jane, a 16-year-old girl with long brown hair and glasses, is sitting on the couch, engrossed in a book. Suddenly, the front door bursts open, and Andrea, her 19-year-old rebellious sister, storms in followed by two POLICE OFFICERS.

ANDREA
(angry)
What the hell is going on here?!

Jane looks up, startled by the commotion. 

JANE
(confused)
Andrea? What happened?

OFFICER #1
Miss Andrea Green, you are under arrest for the suspected theft of valuable jewelry from Harrison's Jewelry Store. You have the right to remain silent...

ANDREA
(interrupting)
This is ridiculous! I didn't steal anything!

OFFICER #2
Save it for the station, Miss Green. We have evidence against you.

Andrea glares at the officers, frustration etched on her face.

ANDREA
Jane, you believe me, right? Tell them I would never do something like this!

Jane gets up from the couch, concern evident in her eyes.

JANE
Andrea, I can't believe this is happening. Are you sure there's a mistake?

ANDREA
(angry and frustrated)
Yes! I don't know how, but someone framed me. I walked into the store, and before I knew it, the alarms were going off, and the police were all over me.

Jane walks over to Andrea and places a comforting hand on her shoulder.

JANE
We'll get through this, Andrea. We'll find the truth.

ANDREA
(teary-eyed)
I hope so. Dad's going to be so disappointed in me.

Jane pulls Andrea into a hug, offering her sister support in this difficult time.

JANE
We'll fight this with everything we have. We won't let them tear our family apart.

Andrea nods, holding Jane tightly.

ANDREA
Thank you, Jane. Your belief in me means everything.

The police officers handcuff Andrea and begin leading her out of the room. Jane watches with determination.

JANE
We won't rest until your name is cleared, Andrea. I promise.

Andrea manages a small smile as she's escorted out, leaving Jane standing in the living room, ready to uncover the truth and defend her sister's innocence."
