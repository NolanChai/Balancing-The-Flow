User: "(In the clubroom...)

Monika: "Okay, Natsuki's birthing mat is all set for her labor!" (notices that nobody else is around) "...uh...hello? Guys? Anyone there?"

(Monika's words echo through the empty clubroom.)

Monika: "...everyone must've gone home already.""

Assistant: "(Suddenly, the sound of running footsteps can be heard approaching the clubroom. Sayori bursts through the door, panting.)

Sayori: "Monika! I'm so sorry I'm late! I had to help my mom with something."

Monika: (relieved) "Oh, thank goodness! Sayori, it's just the two of us then. I guess the rest had to leave earlier."

Sayori: "Yeah, it looks like it. So, Natsuki's about to give birth, right? I hope we can make it in time!"

Monika: "I think we have enough time. We prepared everything Natsuki might need. I really hope everything goes smoothly for her."

Sayori: "Me too! She's been so excited and nervous about becoming a mom. I can understand why though, it's a big responsibility."

Monika: "Definitely. It's a major life-changing event. But I believe Natsuki will be an amazing mother. She's strong and determined."

Sayori: "You're right, Monika. Natsuki's a lot stronger than people give her credit for. And I know she'll pour all her love into her baby."

(Monika and Sayori sit down in the clubroom, waiting anxiously for any news or updates on Natsuki's situation. They exchange small talk to keep their nerves at bay.)

Monika: "Sayori, how's everything with your mom? Is she feeling better now?"

Sayori: "She's alright, thank you for asking. It was just a minor inconvenience, nothing serious. She's always making sure I'm taken care of."

Monika: "That's really sweet of her. I'm glad she's doing well. We should all appreciate our parents' love and sacrifices."

Sayori: "Definitely. Parents do so much for us, and sometimes we don't even realize the extent of it until we're older. It's a powerful bond."

(As they continue their conversation, Natsuki's voice can be heard from a distance, startling both Monika and Sayori.)

Natsuki: (in pain) "Ahh! Monika! Sayori! Help!"

Monika: (jumping up) "That's Natsuki! Come on, Sayori, let's go! She needs us!"

(A sense of urgency fills the room as Monika and Sayori rush out, ready to assist Natsuki during her labor. They know that whatever lies ahead, they'll face it together, supporting Natsuki every step of the way.)"
