User: "[there would be dialogue in this story, which would include a flashback of Nilou giving birth to Indigo:]

(It was almost the day of the Sabzeruz Festival in Sumeru - the domain of Lesser Lord Kusanali, the Dendro archon and goddess of wisdom. Layla - the only Cryo user in Sumeru - was studying for her exam. It was almost the end of her school year. However, at the Zubayr Theater, something was wrong. Nilou - the dancer and an experienced Hydro user - was nowhere to be seen. Eventually, a team of four experienced Dendro users - Kaveh, Collei, Tighnari, and Alhaitham - were sent to investigate the entire domain of Sumeru. But when they went to investigate the theater, they came across Nilou's newborn daughter - Indigo - on the stage. However, Indigo was crying - as if Nilou had given birth to Indigo prematurely while practicing for the upcoming festival.)"

Assistant: "Kaveh: (rushing to Indigo's side) What in the name of the Seven happened here? Where's Nilou?

Collei: (checking the stage for any signs of Nilou) I don't see her anywhere. Could she have gone into labor during her performance?

Tighnari: (carefully picking up Indigo) Poor thing, she must have been all alone for a while now. Is she okay?

Alhaitham: (examining Indigo) She seems healthy, just a bit premature. We need to find her mother though, she must be worried sick.

Kaveh: Let's split up and search the rest of the theater. We can't leave any stone unturned until we find Nilou.

(As they split up and search through the theater, Kaveh's mind drifts back to a few months ago - when they first discovered Nilou's pregnancy. He remembers how Nilou nervously shared the news, her face filled with both joy and anxiety.)

Flashback:

Nilou: (placing a hand on her belly) Kaveh, Collei, Tighnari, Alhaitham... I have something important to tell you all. I'm going to be a mother.

Collei: (gasping) Nilou! That's incredible news! Are you and the baby alright?

Nilou: (nodding) Yes, everything seems to be going well so far. But I'm worried about how it will affect my dancing, especially with the upcoming Sabzeruz Festival.

Tighnari: Don't worry, Nilou. We'll all be here to support you. Your talent and dedication will shine through, even with motherhood.

Alhaitham: Plus, we'll make sure you have plenty of breaks and take care of you. You and the baby's well-being are our top priority.

Kaveh: (grinning) Congratulations, Nilou. You're going to be an amazing mother. Your baby will be the luckiest to have you.

(After the flashback, Kaveh's heart weighs heavy with concern. He continues searching and eventually finds Nilou backstage, pale and weak.)

Kaveh: (kneeling by Nilou's side) Nilou, thank the Archons we found you. Are you alright?

Nilou: (weakly, she reaches out to Kaveh) Kaveh, Indigo... she came so suddenly. I wasn't ready.

Kaveh: (carefully helping Nilou sit up) It's okay, Nilou. We found Indigo, she's safe now. You did amazing bringing her into this world. Just rest now, we'll take care of everything.

(As Nilou leans against Kaveh for support, a mixture of relief and exhaustion washes over her face. The team gathers around them, ensuring their safety and making arrangements to take care of Nilou and Indigo during the festival. They knew that despite the unexpected journey, the upcoming Sabzeruz Festival would be even more special, celebrating both wisdom and the miracle of new life.)"
