User: "Write a Day 1 script for the Jungle Myrmex Royal.

(Characters: Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex, [player])

(Scene: Jungle Myrmex Hive - day)

(The wing-like structures on Jade’s back are non-functional)

(Jade would start to construct a small den for the Myrmex slowly developing in her belly when the day begins - and Jade’s belly would be massive)

([player] would fall into the Jungle Myrmex Hive, ultimately landing in the throne room)

(Hours after [player] ends up in the throne room, Jade's water breaks suddenly - and she would bring her larva into the world with [player]'s help)"

Assistant: "Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex: (*groaning and clutching her belly*) Oh, this little one is coming soon.

[player]: (*startled*) Your majesty, are you okay?

Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex: (*smiling*) Yes, I'm just giving birth to a new generation of myrmex. It's a special moment for us.

[player]: (*confused*) I wasn't expecting to see this today. Is there anything I can do to help you?

Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex: Actually, yes. My water just broke and I need your assistance. Please help me lay down on this bed.

([player] would help Jade lay down on a specially constructed bed suitable for giving birth)

Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex: (*breathing heavily*) Thank you. Now, I need you to help me push the egg out of me. Be careful, it's fragile.

([player] would assist Jade with the birth, finally bringing the egg into the world)

Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex: (*smiling*) Thank you for your help, [player]. You handled it very well. This little one is important to our Myrmex colony's survival.

[player]: (*amazed*) It's incredible that you can give birth to such an important creature and sustain your colony.

Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex: (*proudly*) It's in our nature. We Jungle Myrmex are resilient and dedicated. Come, let me show you around the hive and teach you more about our ways."
