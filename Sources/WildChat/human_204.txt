User: "I want you to create fictional social media messages for a setting in a work of fiction, providing posts, comments and usernames of various very different, unusual and often random posters, fit for a romantic comedy. Lydia Whittingham is beautiful, elegant, assertive but clumsy and unlucky young woman who has had her share of bizarre accidents over the years. She has been recovering from her latest accident, a very serious one, in which she injured both her hips, ankle, pelvis and lower back, for quite some time already, being stuck in huge and cumbersome bilateral fiberglass hip spica cast that covers more than half of her body from feet to armpits, as she is unable to move on her own due to its extreme immobilization. Lydia's fans have been following diligently following her difficult, painful and slow recovery progress, as she posts frequent updates. Lydia posts a photo of herself, showing her awkwardly lying on her side in her hospital bed. Aside from the cast, she is wearing a striking makeup on her face, extravagant and ostentatious hat in 1910s style and an oversized polka dot bowtie. Her expression is simultaneously pensive and playful. The description to the photo says: "This is my entire formal outfit for now", making fun of the fact she can't wear normal clothes at the moment due to her large cast. Write long, quirky, sympathetic, supportive, interesting, informative, inquisitive, offbeat, amusing, unusual, flirty and sometimes random discussion between Lydia and her fans and followers and other random commenters in the comment section to this post."
