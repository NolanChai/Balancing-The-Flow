User: "summarise this: I conclude by noting that a name based on Hermanubis is attested once outside Egypt in an inscription from Dion in Macedonia dated to the imperial period (22). The form of the name there is Ἑρμα-νούβιοϲ, which is not known from Egypt. The name is probably to be related to the cult of Hermanubis attested by a third-century dedication in Thessalonike (across the Thermaic golf from Dion), which was set up by a cultic association of Hermanubis on behalf of certain individuals. This document and the personal name, along with a statue of the god from the Sarapeum of Carthage (LIMC n. 15), suggest that the cult of Hermanubis enjoyed some popularity outside its original home in the Roman period.[23]"

Assistant: "The name based on Hermanubis is found once outside of Egypt in an inscription from Dion in Macedonia during the imperial period. The name is different from the ones found in Egypt and is likely linked to the cult of Hermanubis, which has been discovered in other areas such as Thessalonike and Carthage. This indicates that the cult of Hermanubis was popular outside of its original home during the Roman period."
