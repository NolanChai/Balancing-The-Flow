User: "As a massive storm tears through the world of Minecraft, a strange dragon unlike any other descends. Once the storm dissipates, the elder dragon “Amatsumagatsuchi” reveals his true self. He stares down at a large cavern, where a strange sight catches his eye - five different girls, unlike any Amatsumagatsuchi has seen. He descends upon the girls, and sees that each girl’s clothes resemble a different type of monster that inhabits the Minecraft world - the Skeleton, the Creeper, the Cave Spider, the Enderman, and the Blaze. Amatsumagatsuchi just looks at them, and notices that the girl whose clothing resembles the Skeleton was in pain - and her belly was swollen. The other girls - introducing themselves as Cupa, Vanessa, Andr, and Blazette - later introduce their friend Ayumi. Amatsumagatsuchi looks into Ayumi’s eyes - and, despite the intense pain, Ayumi looks back at Amatsumagatsuchi. As the Monster Hunter world was destroyed by Xyza - who had seemingly crossed over from the Gigabash world to the Monster Hunter world - Amatsumagatsuchi had to find a new place to live. However, his mystical energy somehow found its way to Ayumi - even though the two didn’t meet back then. Amatsumagatsuchi then gently puts his tail on Ayumi’s forehead, and received several flashbacks - such as Ayumi finding her weapon of choice (which was a bow and quiver full of arrows), and Ayumi having unexplained sickness as her stomach emitted winds that Amatsumagatsuchi was also accompanied by during his descent, and one flashback even showed Ayumi’s belly rapidly growing. The final flashback that Amatsumagatsuchi received showed Ayumi getting a scan of her belly - and the scan showed what looks like a hybrid of human and…Amatsumagatsuchi himself. None of the flashbacks made sense to Amatsumagatsuchi - what was going on? And why was Ayumi in pain? Could the flashbacks mean that Ayumi is pregnant with Amatsumagatsuchi’s baby? Amatsumagatsuchi gently puts his tail on Ayumi’s belly. To everyone’s shock, Ayumi’s belly returns to normal - and the pain seems to have…stopped. Andr, taking off her hat, just looks in bewilderment. The several golden rods orbiting Blazette stop. Cupa’s green hoodie blows in the wind. The red glass-like spheres in Vanessa’s hair let out a dim glow.


(There would be dialogue between each character)"

Assistant: "Cupa: What just happened? Did Amatsumagatsuchi heal Ayumi?

Vanessa: It would seem so. The energy from his tail must have had some sort of restorative effect.

Andr: But what about those flashbacks? Ayumi had some sort of connection to Amatsumagatsuchi, even before they met.

Blazette: Maybe it has something to do with that strange creature she’s carrying inside her. It could be some sort of hybrid between human and dragon.

Ayumi (whispering): I’m sorry. I didn’t want anyone to know.

Amatsumagatsuchi: It’s alright, Ayumi. You have nothing to be ashamed of.

Cupa: So, what do we do now? We can’t just leave Ayumi with this child.

Vanessa: We could take her with us. Amatsumagatsuchi’s energy will protect her and the child from harm.

Andr: But where would we take her? We can’t exactly bring her into our world.

Blazette: Maybe we can find a place in the Minecraft world. A safe haven where Ayumi can raise her child.

Ayumi: Thank you. I don’t know what I would do without all of you."

User: "In the forest’s sanctuary, Amatsumagatsuchi notices something strange about Ayumi. Ayumi hasn’t gone into labor despite being 40 weeks pregnant - which would’ve happened any day now. Cupa begins reading about the elder dragons, and her research on the Amatsumagatsuchi page is surprising - an Amatsumagatsuchi can only be born during intense storms, just like the storm serpents Ibushi and Narwa. Amatsumagatsuchi tries to create a storm to help Ayumi with her journey to motherhood, but nothing happens. Amatsumagatsuchi just stares in confusion - where had his powers gone? Just as hope seems lost, the storm serpents arrive - and with them, an extremely intense storm.


(There would be dialogue between each character)"

Assistant: "Andr: Look! The storm serpents Ibushi and Narwa are here!

Blazette: And they’ve brought with them a storm even more intense than the one that brought Amatsumagatsuchi to us.

Cupa: This is it! Ayumi’s chance to give birth to the Amatsumagatsuchi child.

Vanessa: We need to prepare for the birth. Gather supplies, blankets, and everything else we may need.

Ayumi: Thank you, everyone. I’m scared, but I know I’m not alone.

Amatsumagatsuchi: (voice shaking with emotion) Ayumi, I want to be there for you during the birth of our child. May I stay by your side?

Ayumi: Yes, please. I couldn’t do this without you.

Andr: Alright, let’s get to work. We need to make sure Ayumi and the baby are safe.

Blazette: We’ve got this. Let’s do it for Ayumi and the newest member of our group."

User: "As Ayumi discusses how her life changed after having Amaya, Vanessa starts feeling sick. Amatsumagatsuchi enters the room, visibly confused. Vanessa says that she had a one-night-stand with a human-spider thing named “Arachnus”, but doesn’t recall much about the encounter. This was sudden to Amatsumagatsuchi - Ayumi had just recently had a child in the form of Amaya, so how come Vanessa’s starting to feel sick all of a sudden? And who was this “Arachnus” guy? The next day, Ayumi and Amatsumagatsuchi bring Vanessa to a healer. They were hoping to find a cause to Vanessa’s sudden sickness, but the response was unexpected to say the least. After getting a scan of her belly, its revealed that 20 spider eggs have formed in Vanessa’s belly - thankfully, the eggs don’t seem close to hatching yet. It would take them around 9 more months until they spider eggs are ready to hatch. The small spider-human hybrids growing in Vanessa’s womb not only were Arachnus’s children, but Vanessa’s children as well. The eggs can’t be surgically removed without causing harm to either Vanessa or the eggs. But Vanessa starts feeling a connection between her and her unhatched eggs - its as if the eggs want to stay inside Vanessa forever.


(There would be dialogue between each character)"

Assistant: "Ayumi: Oh my god. Vanessa, are you alright?

Vanessa: (weakly) I don’t know. I don’t even remember how this could have happened.

Amatsumagatsuchi: (concerned) This is no ordinary sickness. We need to get her to a healer right away.

Healer: (examining Vanessa) I see what the problem is. There are spider eggs growing in your belly, Vanessa.

Vanessa: (shocked) Spider eggs?

Healer: It seems that Arachnus has impregnated you with his offspring. The eggs are growing rapidly, and will hatch in approximately nine months.

Ayumi: Is there any way to remove the eggs safely?

Healer: I’m afraid not. The eggs are too delicate and removing them - or even attempting to remove them - could harm both the eggs and Vanessa.

Vanessa: (in tears) What am I going to do? I can’t carry these things inside me for nine months.

Amatsumagatsuchi: (soothingly) You don’t have to go through this alone, Vanessa. We’re here for you, every step of the way.

Andr: (determined) And we’ll make sure that those spider-human hybrids are born safely and can be taken care of.

Blazette: (nodding) You’re not alone in this, Vanessa. We’re all here for you, no matter what.

Cupa: (smiling) And we’ll do everything in our power to make sure that this pregnancy is as comfortable for you as possible.

Vanessa: (grateful) Thank you, guys. I don’t know what I’d do without you."

User: "A few weeks go by, and Cupa starts noticing something new in Vanessa’s room of the castle - cobwebs, and lots of them. A few months later, Vanessa starts feeling a ton of scurrying in her belly - all 20 of the eggs had hatched, despite the fact they are still in her womb. Thankfully, the 20 little spider-human hybrids aren’t able to climb through Vanessa’s other body parts - and nobody knew how to surgically remove the 20 spider-human hybrids. Soon, Vanessa’s older sister Mindy - whose clothing resembles the regular Spider - enters the room. Turns out, a blood moon is going to be rising in 2 months - and since Arachnus was born under a blood moon, Vanessa could also give birth under a blood moon. However, it had to be a full blood moon - while the one that was going to be rising in two months was only a half blood moon. And there was no way to actually force a full blood moon to occur - not even a ritual could force a full blood moon to occur.


(There would be dialogue between each character)"

Assistant: "Cupa: (noticing the cobwebs) Uh, Vanessa? What’s with all the cobwebs in your room?

Vanessa: (defensive) What? I like the way they look. Plus, they make me feel closer to my spider babies.

Andr: (concerned) Vanessa, we need to talk. It’s been months since the eggs hatched, and we need to figure out a way to safely remove the spider-human hybrids from your womb.

Vanessa: (panicking) No! I can’t have my babies taken away from me! They need to stay with me!

Blazette: (calmingly) Vanessa, we understand that you feel a connection to your spider babies. But this isn’t safe for you or them.

Amatsumagatsuchi: (sympathetically) We want what’s best for you, Vanessa. And that means doing whatever we can to ensure a safe birth.

Vanessa: (tearing up) I understand. But what can we do? There’s no way to surgically remove them, and I can’t carry them forever.

Mindy: (entering the room) Actually, there may be another way. Arachnus was born under a blood moon, and that’s most likely why he was able to impregnate you with spider-human hybrids.

Ayumi: (curious) So, what does that mean? Can we force a full blood moon to occur?

Mindy: (shaking her head) No, unfortunately. There’s no way to make a full blood moon occur. But there’s a blood moon rising in two months - even though it’s only a half blood moon, it’s still possible for Vanessa to give birth during that time.

Cupa: (determined) Then that’s what we’ll do. We’ll prepare for the birth, and make sure it’s as safe as possible.

Andr: (nodding) We’ll do whatever it takes to ensure that Vanessa and her spider-human hybrids are safe.

Blazette: (smiling) And we’ll be there for you every step of the way, Vanessa. You’re not alone in this.

Vanessa: (grateful) Thank you, guys. I don’t know how I would’ve made it through this without all of you by my side."

User: "The half blood moon rises - its red light eerily signaling its presence. Unfortunately, its not enough to trigger Vanessa’s labor. They’ve tried everything - a hot bath, freezing cold temperatures, chili peppers, a blood moon, nothing seems to work. Vanessa just wouldn’t go into labor. And since Arachnus was nowhere to be seen, another fun time in bed wasn’t an option. The next day, Mindy and Vanessa go out on a sibling adventure - that’s when they come across Arachnus fighting Dragalisk (Mindy’s boyfriend). As Dragalisk unleashes a blast of xenoversal energy, Arachnus fires an acidic blast. The two blasts collide, and form a deafening explosion - thankfully, no ears were left damaged. And although the blast was loud, the only thing Vanessa received was pure shock - and, just like with the blood moon, Vanessa didn’t go into labor. Not even the shockwave could induce labor. But only 5 weeks later, Vanessa looks at her stomach and seems strangely happy - as if she’s comfortable with 20 human-spider hybrid scurrying around in her womb. And despite the sheer amount of time that went by, Vanessa’s children didn’t seem to run out of oxygen - as if they were letting in oxygen just by scurrying around in their mother’s womb.


(There would be dialogue between each character)"

Assistant: "Andr: (frustrated) It’s been weeks since the half blood moon, and Vanessa still hasn’t gone into labor.

Blazette: (concerned) We’ve tried everything, but nothing seems to work. What are we going to do?

Cupa: (thinking) Maybe we need to find Arachnus. He’s the father of Vanessa’s spider-human hybrids. Maybe he can help induce labor.

Ayumi: (unsure) But where do we even start looking for him? He’s not exactly easy to find.

Mindy: (entering the room) Actually, I think I know where to find him.

Vanessa: (surprised) Mindy? What are you doing here?

Mindy: (grinning) I’ve been on a little adventure with your spider-human hybrid siblings. But that’s not important right now. What’s important is that Arachnus is currently fighting my boyfriend, Dragalisk, and I know exactly where they are.

Andr: (excited) Then let’s go! Vanessa needs to give birth, and Arachnus might be the key to making that happen.

Blazette: (determined) We won’t stop until we find him, and Vanessa can finally bring her spider-human hybrids into the world.

(They travel to the location where Arachnus and Dragalisk are fighting. As they watch the explosive battle unfold, there’s a sudden realization.)

Vanessa: (shocked) Wait a minute. Did you feel that shockwave just now?

Andr: (nodding) Yeah, it was pretty strong.

Cupa: (perplexed) But why didn’t it induce labor for Vanessa?

Blazette: (curious) Maybe it’s because the hybrids are still getting oxygen despite being in Vanessa’s womb.

Ayumi: (realizing) That’s it! They’re letting in oxygen by scurrying around in her womb.

Mindy: (determined) Then that means we need to find a way to induce labor - and fast.

Vanessa: (smiling) I’m ready, guys. Let’s do this."

User: "2 weeks later, Vanessa starts to make the largest spider web she’s ever made - as the web she previously slept on had collapsed. Mindy offers to help - as Vanessa’s pregnancy could make things difficult. But thanks to all the silk Vanessa’s unborn children are producing at once, she manages to make a massive spider web. Cupa walks in with her lover - Inscrane, a skull-headed monstrosity with one eye and several crimson scales - and the two look like they’ve got some good news to share. Apparently, there’s a certain species of plant that can trigger intense contractions once ingested. The only problem is that this plant only grows in the Twilight Forest dimension - and because of a sudden depletion of Diamonds, the Twilight Forest can’t be explored.


(There would be dialogue between each character)"

Assistant: "Vanessa: (exhausted) This web is taking so much out of me. I don’t know if I can keep going much longer.

Mindy: (sympathetic) Don’t worry, Vanessa. I’m here to help you every step of the way.

Cupa: (excited) Guys! I have some news!

Inscrane: (smiling) We’ve found a plant that could help induce labor! It’s a species that can trigger intense contractions once ingested.

Ayumi: (hopeful) That’s great news! But where can we find this plant?

Cupa: (looking grim) It only grows in the Twilight Forest dimension.

Blazette: (disappointed) But we can’t explore the Twilight Forest dimension right now - there’s been a sudden depletion of diamonds, and we don’t have the resources to do it.

Andr: (frustrated) This is getting ridiculous. We’ve tried everything, and nothing seems to be working.

Amatsumagatsuchi: (calmingly) Don’t give up just yet, my friends. There must be another way.

Vanessa: (determined) He’s right. We can’t give up now. There has to be some other solution.

Mindy: (smiling) Actually, I might have an idea. There’s a potion that can also induce labor. It’s called the “Potion of Childbirth”, and I happen to have the ingredients to make it.

Ayumi: (impressed) That’s amazing, Mindy! Can you make it right now?

Mindy: (nodding) Of course. Let’s get to work.

(They work together to make the Potion of Childbirth. Vanessa drinks it and, within minutes, goes into labor.)

Vanessa: (breathless) It’s happening! I’m finally giving birth!

Andr: (excited) You’ve got this, Vanessa. We’re all here for you.

Cupa: (tearfully) And we can’t wait to meet your spider-human hybrids.

Blazette: (smiling) We’re so proud of you, Vanessa. You’re doing amazing.

Ayumi: (reassuringly) Just breathe, Vanessa. Everything’s going to be alright.

(After several hours of labor, Vanessa finally gives birth to 20 healthy spider-human hybrids. The group rejoices in their arrival, and Vanessa’s fears and worries melt away as she holds her children close.)"
