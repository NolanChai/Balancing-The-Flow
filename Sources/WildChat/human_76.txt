Assistant: "INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

Jane, Sam, Aaron, Molly-Rose, and the rest of the student body are seated in the crowded auditorium, excitedly whispering amongst themselves. The lights dim, and all eyes turn towards the stage.

JANE
(whispering to Sam)
I can't believe Julia Fairbanks is actually coming to our school. She's like a local celebrity!

SAM
(nods)
Yeah, she's got it all - popularity, wealth, and looks. I wonder what she's really like.

AARON
(glancing at his sister)
Molly, have you ever been to Fairbanks's? You must have seen Julia Fairbanks, right?

MOLLY-ROSE
(smiling excitedly)
Oh, definitely! Dad takes us there all the time. Julia's always in the commercials and on those huge billboards too.

Jane's eyes widen as the auditorium falls silent, the spotlight illuminating the stage. Julia Fairbanks steps forward, accompanied by her father.

JULIA
(to the audience)
Good afternoon, everyone! As most of you already know, I'm Julia Fairbanks. My daddy and I run the famous Fairbanks's department store in town.

The audience murmurs, reaffirming their familiarity with Julia and her family's store.

JANE
(whispering)
Wow, she's really emphasizing the "daddy" part, huh?

SAM
I guess being a daddy's girl is her thing. But deep down, she must be feeling the pressure of living up to her father's legacy.

Aaron leans in, intrigued by Julia's speech.

AARON
Hm, I wonder if she ever gets tired of being in the spotlight all the time. It can't be easy, you know?

They watch as Julia continues her introduction, her confident demeanor masking her true feelings.

JULIA
(smiling)
As the biggest daddy's girl in the world, I've always been taught the importance of hard work and dedication. It's my goal to make Fairbanks's even more successful than it already is!

The crowd erupts in applause, showing their support for Julia and her ambitious words.

JANE
(side-eyes Sam)
She might have it all, but deep down, I bet she just wants to be seen for who she really is, not just as the owner's daughter.

SAM
(nods in agreement)
It's easy to get caught up in the image others have of you, especially when you're constantly in the public eye. I hope she finds her own identity amidst all of this.

As Julia finishes her speech, the applause thunderous, Jane, Sam, Aaron, and Molly-Rose exchange thoughtful looks, understanding the complexities hidden behind Julia Fairbanks' confident facade.
