User: "Are most cases of infertility caused by male?"

Assistant: "No, infertility can be caused by a variety of factors, both male and female. In about 30-40% of cases, infertility is caused by male factors, while in another 30-40% of cases, infertility is caused by female factors. The remaining cases are caused by a combination of factors, or no specific cause can be identified. It is important for both partners to be evaluated and tested for potential causes of infertility in order to determine the appropriate treatment plan."
