User: "translate to mandarin: Dear Parents,

We hope this newsletter finds you well. October has been a wonderful month in PN Panda class, filled with lots of learning and exciting activities. The children have been making great progress, and we couldn’t be happier with their growth and development.

Our IEYC unit, “This Is Me,” has been a resounding success. Throughout the month, we have focused on various themes such as houses, family, birthday parties, and the importance of taking care of oneself. The children have thoroughly enjoyed exploring these topics through hands-on activities, discussions, and group projects. It has been heartwarming to witness their enthusiasm and engagement.

In line with our commitment to providing a diverse and multicultural environment, we recently held an International Food Week. The children had the opportunity to taste and learn about different cuisines from around the world. The week was not only educational but also a lot of fun, as we incorporated various games and activities to make the experience memorable for our little ones.

In terms of academics, we have been focusing on mathematical concepts. Currently, we are learning to count to 5 in English. The children are thoroughly enjoying this process as we incorporate games, songs, and visual aids to make it interactive and engaging. We are thrilled to witness their progress in this aspect as well.

With the arrival of the fall season, we have also started teaching the children about the changes that occur during this time. Through songs and crafts, the children are not only developing their creativity but also learning about the beauty of nature’s transformations. This has helped instill a sense of wonder and appreciation for the world around them.

We successfully held a month-end assembly performance and birthday celebration. The children worked diligently to prepare a delightful performance, which they performed in front of the entire school. In addition, we also celebrated the birthdays of the children born in October, giving the PN students the opportunity to showcase what they have learned in class: saying Happy Birthday and singing the Birthday song. It was truly incredible to witness the little PN students demonstrate the knowledge they have acquired.

As we move forward into November, we wanted to express our sincere gratitude for your continued support and involvement in your child’s education. We are thrilled to be a part of their journey and look forward to further exciting and educational experiences in the coming month.

Warm regards,
PN Panda Class

Assistant: "亲爱的家长们，

希望这份通讯能够找到您们，一切都好。在PN熊猫班，十月份是一个充满了学习和令人兴奋的活动的美妙月份。孩子们取得了非常大的进步，他们的成长和发展让我们感到非常高兴。

我们的IEYC主题是“这就是我”，非常成功。在这个月里，我们专注于各种主题，如房屋，家庭，生日派对，以及照顾自己的重要性。孩子们通过实践活动，讨论和小组项目，非常享受探索这些主题。看到他们的热情和投入，令人感动。

为了营造多样化和多文化的环境，最近我们举办了国际美食周。孩子们有机会品尝和了解世界各地的不同美食。这一周不仅是教育性的，也非常有趣，我们通过各种游戏和活动让孩子们难以忘怀。

在学术方面，我们一直专注于数学概念。目前，我们正在学习用英语数到5。孩子们非常享受这个过程，我们使用游戏、歌曲和视觉辅助工具使其互动和有趣。我们非常高兴看到他们在这方面的进步。

随着秋天的到来，我们也开始教孩子们有关这个季节发生的变化。通过歌曲和手工艺品，孩子们不仅在发展他们的创造力，还在学习自然变化的美丽之处。这有助于培养他们对周围世界的好奇心和欣赏之情。

我们成功举行了月末的表演和生日庆祝活动。孩子们努力准备了一场愉快的表演，他们在全校师生面前演出。此外，我们还庆祝了十月份出生的孩子们的生日，给PN学生展示他们在课堂上所学到的知识：说生日快乐和唱生日歌。看到小小的PN学生演示他们所掌握的知识真是令人难以置信。

随着我们进入十一月，我们想要对您们在孩子教育上的持续支持和参与表示衷心的感谢。我们很高兴能够参与他们的成长之旅，并期待在未来的一个月里继续有令人兴奋和有教育意义的经历。

衷心问候，
PN熊猫班"

The PN babies have continued to learn about family members and have also started learning about Birthdays and how to celebrate them. We have been practicing singing the birthday song and we made birthday crowns to use during our Friday birthday party dramatic  role play. The PN students have been very excited with the arrival of fall and have  enjoyed all the fall activities we have planned for them. They also did really well with recognizing number 1 and 2. The little pandas are also huge fans of jumping, climbing and riding bikes! Their gross motor skills and strengths continue to improve. "

Assistant: "亲爱的熊猫家长们，这周过得非常充实。PN宝宝们继续学习家庭成员的知识，并开始学习关于生日以及如何庆祝生日的内容。我们一直在练习唱生日歌，并制作了生日皇冠，在周五的生日派对角色扮演中使用。PN学生对秋天的到来非常兴奋，并且享受我们为他们安排的所有秋季活动。他们在认识数字1和2方面也进展良好。小熊猫们还是跳跃、爬行和骑自行车的超级粉丝！他们的大肌肉动作技能和力量继续提高。"
