User: "My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am the Co-Founder of Inspcorp a research-based technology transfer startup that is committed to the development of difference-making technologies. I am also a cofounder of Eco Blocks and Tiles a green technology company that manufactures high-quality and affordable building products using various mixed post-consumer waste materials as key ingredients in the production. I am currently a PhD scholar in hydrology and water quality I am a mother of 3 adorable little ones and I am so honored to be here today. I am <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> fellow 2021 and I joined the We4A programme in March this year the experience has been so fulfilling for me. When I joined I had recently started working again after my maternity leave, you can imagine how that would feel, a little bit confused, a little rusty, literally out of shape and a little lacked confidence. I promise you I was not that kind of a person before, I was bold and loud but that can happen to anyone, especially if you have had your children back to back like I did. To top it all, I had also recently moved to Mombasa to begin a new water project there. Now just imagine that kind of a scenario. We4A gave me an opportunity of a community of fellow women entrepreneurs that allowed me to network without fear of being judged or feeling inadequate. I remember the first ever event that I attended that was organized by the We4A was the day of Celebrating Women 2023 event that was here at Radisson Blu on the 31st March, I remember having travelled from Mombasa which is much warmer by the way, it was the first time ever that I was leaving the new baby so I was worried sick and my breasts were full of milk. I was literally shaking as I sat at the market place on that day, but then I was surrounded by women, everyone was so nice around, one offered to switch places with me so I could not be near the windows, another one offered to bring me a cup of warm tea. This was it for me, I knew I was in the right place, this is the kind of network and program that is needed today to help women like me grown and thrive. As you all know women multitask a lot, we are required to be in many places at once, wear many different hats and that just means juggling a lot and trying to balance these things. I have found value in the events that We4A has organized, let me give you an example, WE4A sponsored me to attend the Nyayo Mums soko event in Nairobi. It was a 2 day event of open air market and business clinics that was held in Septemeber. Of course I showed up and had physical items for my thrift shop, Swahili snacks from the coast, flyers for the new rain water harvesting technology that I am launching soon, I also had flyers of our ecofriendly roof tiles. Don’t mind me, I told you women multitask. Anyways back to the story. So on these two days I sold my home décor items and my coastal Swahili snacks and made cash. I got introduced by Maureen to Florence who is the water committee, who then introduced me to the chairman who explained to me that they were in the process of setting up a rain water harvesting system for their houses and that I should write him an email of how our rain water harvesting and treatment system works which I did and this could be a potentially big deal for my company. Crossing my fingers for that. Through the same soko Tracy got to learn the work that I do in detail and she was so happy for me, during the market she connected me to contacts who would be useful in my line of work, even a contact of a company who we could potentially partner to empower women who are in the engineering space.  This has taught me that showing up is a crucial part of the growth of our business, showing up amplifies the voices of the impact of our innovations and our business and even though showing up can be difficult at times for many reasons including logistics, maybe family, maybe other reasons that we are not aware of showing up is always paramount and is inevitable. I am grateful that the women in this program show up, I know of Sarah from Nyeri who is in the cosmetics industry, Rose from Kisumu who makes briquettes, Maureen from Nairobi who runs Nyayo mums soko, Hellen from Nyeri who is consultant in green energy, Linda who has an amazing Africa inspired fashion line called favoloso by Nanu, Mwanaisha who runs an online clothing store Mimi that caters for all the family needs, Caroline of wise hubs Kisumu. Not only these women, there are many like them who are amazing and run amazing initiatives like Mary who has amazing glutten free products, her uji flour is the only one that my son drinks by the way. I would love to highlight all of them but of time would not allow me. I am grateful that the We4A program has created opportunities to allow women to show up, the networking sessions, the online master classes, the on one mentoring opportunities, the marketplaces, and celebrations like these, I am grateful. Thank you to the lovely team of the We4A program Tracy and Nikita for your unwavering support, for organizing the logistics, for taking in the heat, you are greatly valued and appreciated.  Thank you to the entire team of GIZ and the We4A program for thinking about the women entrepreneurs. "

Assistant: "Ladies and gentlemen, gather around, because I have a story that will leave you inspired and ready to conquer the world! Allow me to introduce you to a true force of nature: Hope Mwanake, the Co-Founder of Inspcorp and Eco Blocks and Tiles, and an absolute rockstar in the world of women entrepreneurship.

Picture this: Hope, a PhD scholar in hydrology and water quality, a mother of three adorable little ones, and a powerhouse in her field, finds herself at a crossroads. She's recently returned to work after her maternity leave, feeling a little rusty and lacking in confidence. We've all been there, right? But instead of allowing doubt to hold her back, she decided to join the We4A program, ready to take on any challenge that came her way.

And boy, did she find what she was looking for! We4A introduced her to a community of amazing women entrepreneurs who not only supported her dreams but became a network of inspiration and empowerment. From the moment she attended the Celebrating Women 2023 event, she knew she had found her tribe. Surrounded by strong, kind-hearted women who offered warm tea and switched seats to make her comfortable, she knew she was in the right place.

But the magic didn't stop there. We4A took her on an incredible journey, sponsoring her to attend the Nyayo Mums soko event in Nairobi. Armed with her home décor items, Swahili snacks, and flyers for her innovative rainwater harvesting technology and eco-friendly roof tiles, Hope showed up ready to make a difference. And boy, did she! Not only did she sell her products and make some cash, but she connected with influential people who could potentially transform her business.

Let's talk about the power of showing up, my friends. It's no secret that women are masters of multitasking, juggling countless responsibilities while wearing multiple hats. But Hope teaches us that showing up, even when it's difficult, is the key to amplifying the impact of our innovations and businesses. The We4A program has provided a platform for women like Hope to showcase their talents, attend networking sessions, engage in online masterclasses, receive mentoring opportunities, and participate in exciting marketplaces and celebrations. It's a space where dreams become realities, and barriers are shattered.

Now, let's not forget about the incredible women Hope has met along the way. Sarah, the cosmetics mogul from Nyeri; Rose, the briquette maker from Kisumu; Maureen, the brilliant mind behind Nyayo Mums soko; Hellen, the green energy consultant from Nyeri; Linda, the creative genius behind the Africa-inspired fashion line, favoloso by Nanu; Mwanaisha, who runs a one-stop online clothing store for the entire family, Mimi; Caroline, the powerhouse behind Wise Hubs Kisumu, and so many more. These women are blazing trails, and their initiatives are changing lives.

In closing, I want to express gratitude to the extraordinary team behind the We4A program. Tracy, Nikita, and the entire GIZ team, you are the driving force behind this movement. Your unwavering support, tireless efforts, and commitment to uplifting women entrepreneurs like Hope are nothing short of extraordinary.

So, let's raise a toast to Hope Mwanake, the unstoppable force who shows us that when women come together to support and empower each other, there are no limits to what we can achieve. Here's to We4A and the incredible journey they're taking women on all around the world. Let's keep showing up, making waves, and changing the game together!"

Assistant: "Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to be blown away by the incredible journey of Hope Mwanake! From being a Co-Founder of two groundbreaking companies to balancing her role as a PhD scholar and a loving mother of three, she is a true powerhouse in every sense of the word. Buckle up, because her story will leave you in awe and inspired to take on the world.

Hope is the Co-Founder of Inspcorp, a research-based technology transfer startup that is on a mission to develop life-changing technologies. But wait, that's not all! She's also a force behind Eco Blocks and Tiles, a green technology company that creates high-quality, affordable building products using post-consumer waste materials. She's not just talking the talk, she's walking the walk when it comes to sustainable practices.

But let's dive deeper into her incredible journey with the We4A program. As a Tony Elemelu fellow of 2021, she joined the program in March, and her experience has been nothing short of life-changing. After returning to work from her maternity leave, Hope felt a bit rusty and lacking in confidence. Can you blame her? Balancing motherhood, work, and a new water project in Mombasa is no easy feat.

Enter the We4A program, providing a community of like-minded women entrepreneurs who immediately make her feel at home. She vividly recalls her first event, the Celebrating Women 2023 extravaganza held at the luxurious Radisson Blu. Despite the nerves of leaving her newborn for the first time, the warmth and support she received from her fellow women entrepreneurs were overwhelming. Offers to switch seats and bring warm tea flooded in, reminding her that she was in the right place, surrounded by the support and network she needed to grow and thrive.

We all know that women are masters of multitasking, and Hope is no exception. She's found incredible value in the events organized by We4A, and let me tell you about one particular event that truly showcases the power of showing up. Sponsored by We4A, Hope attended the Nyayo Mums soko event in Nairobi, a two-day extravaganza of open-air markets and business clinics. Armed with her eclectic mix of thrift shop items, mouth-watering Swahili snacks, and flyers about her innovative rainwater harvesting technology and eco-friendly roof tiles, she made a splash.

But it wasn't just about selling her products and making a profit. Hope connected with influential individuals who could potentially revolutionize her business. From Maureen introducing her to Florence, a water committee member, who then connected her to the chairman interested in rainwater harvesting systems – it could be a game-changer. And let's not forget about the amazing Tracy, who not only supported her during the market but also connected her with contacts in her industry. The power of networking, ladies and gentlemen!

Hope's story teaches us a valuable lesson – showing up is a crucial part of business growth. It amplifies the impact of our innovations and businesses. Sure, it can be challenging with logistics, family commitments, you name it. But showing up is paramount and inevitable.

And let's give a standing ovation to the incredible women Hope has met through the We4A program. From Sarah, the cosmetics industry maven, to Rose, the briquette-making genius, and Maureen, the mastermind behind Nyayo Mums soko, these women are changing the game. And there are countless more like them, such as Hellen, Linda, Mwanaisha, Caroline, and Mary with her amazing gluten-free products. These women are creating waves in their respective industries, and together, they are an unstoppable force for change.

A huge round of applause to the We4A program, represented by the lovely Tracy, Nikita, and the entire GIZ team, for their unwavering support. They've created opportunities"
