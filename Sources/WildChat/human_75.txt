Assistant: "Girl 1: Hey, Jen! How are you doing tonight?

Girl 2: (slurred words) 'Ello! I'm doin' fiiiiiiinnnne. *hiccup* How 'bout you, Sarah?

Girl 1: Oh wow, Jen! You sound a little tipsy. Have you been drinking?

Girl 2: 'Rinking? Nah, jus' a lil' sip-sip-sip here and there. *giggles*

Girl 1: Jen, that doesn't sound like a "lil' sip." You seem absolutely wasted!

Girl 2: (giggles uncontrollably) Wah-what? Me? Nahhh, just havin' shome fun, ya know! *hiccup*

Girl 1: Jen, this is getting serious. You can't even pronounce your words right. Are you sure you're okay?

Girl 2: O'kay? I'm sssuper-ultra-mega... uh... mega okay, Sarah! Can't you sheee... seeee?

Girl 1: No, Jen, I can't. You're slurring so much it's almost impossible.

Girl 2: 'S impossible? No way, Jose! I-I-I think I'm fiiiiiiine. More than fine. Totally spif... spifcalicious!

Girl 1: (concerned) Jen, you're stumbling all over the place. Maybe we should sit you down and get you some water.

Girl 2: (giggles, then mumbles) Water? Psssh, who needs water? I've got... got... some amazing refle-cancel... cancel-ation powers! Woo!

Girl 1: (guiding Jen to a chair) Okay, Jen, let's get you somewhere safe. Just sit here, and I'll bring you some water, okay?

Girl 2: (collapses into the chair) Okaaaay, Sarah! You're my sh-hero. My water-savin' sh-hero!

Girl 1: (returns with a glass of water) Here you go, Jen. Just drink this slowly, it'll help you sober up a bit.

Girl 2: (takes a sip, then looks puzzled) Whooooa, Sarah! Thish water tastesh amazing! It's like... like a rainbosssst... rainbosh... in my mouth!

Girl 1: (chuckles) It's just plain water, Jen. Your taste buds might be a little confused right now.

Girl 2: Confushed taste budds... b-buds! Ha! I knew it! They're MMMM-magical!

Girl 1: (smiling) Sure, Jen. Let's go with that. Just take it easy and drink more water to help you sober up, alright?

Girl 2: (giggles, then nods) A'right, water-slingin' Sarah! You're my savior tonight! 

Girl 1: (laughs) You're too much, Jen. I'm just glad you're safe. Now, let's focus on getting you back to normal, one sip at a time."
