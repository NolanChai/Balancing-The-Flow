User: "However, the overall CO2 conversion efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) of these cascade CO2RR catalytic systems are greatly affected by the CO2 single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) and EE of the upstream CO2RR. While the CO2 SPCE and EE of CO2RR are highly related to the optimization of catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions.句子润色"

Assistant: "Furthermore, the success of these cascade CO2RR catalytic systems ultimately relies on their ability to achieve high levels of CO2 single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the upstream CO2RR process. Achieving optimal SPCE and EE requires careful optimization of catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions in the CO2RR system."
