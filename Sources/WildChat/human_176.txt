User: "Rewrite this text in a polite and logically sound manner: The way I see it, it’s not just people being mad about changes they didn’t agree to; it’s people being moral zealots and acting as if their principles were personally insulted by these changes. Do you know the phrase “it’s the principle of the thing?” It seems that many of the people who are mad about this are using this line of thinking as a justification (the other one is doing the good old fashioned “slippery slope” argument unironically). In a way, it kinda makes sense: they removing/replacing things for a product you purchased, and you never agreed to it, and that is wrong. However, once you get a look at what was actually removed/replaced, you can’t help but feel that people are overreacting to some changes that are, in the grand scheme of things, irrelevant to the overall product. Yet people complain as if its very essence is tarnished beyond recognition. It may be because I’m not as invested in this product as others, but the backlash seems to me very blown out of proportion. My solution? Just like any other time a backlash of this magnitude occurs, the right thing to do is wait and see. If the game does indeed suffer from these changes, then the complaints were right and valid. However, if things stay pretty much the same (or if the game actually gets more popular from this), then the whole situation was a bunch of nothing. Only time will tell."

Assistant: "From my perspective, it appears that some individuals are upset not just about changes they did not agree to, but are rather strongly committed to their moral principles and feel personally insulted by these modifications. You may have heard the expression “it’s the principle of the thing” which seems to be a justification for many of those who are angry (another is making the unironic “slippery slope” argument). While I agree that it is wrong to remove or replace things from a product that you bought without your agreement, looking at what was actually removed or replaced leads me to believe that people may be over-reacting to some changes that in the scheme of things, are relatively minor. However, some people complain that the very essence of the product has been tarnished beyond recognition. Perhaps my opinion is a result of not being as invested in the product as others, but I believe this backlash is disproportionately large. My recommendation is to follow the approach we usually take when faced with a significant uproar like this, which is to wait and see. If the game does indeed suffer as a result of these changes, then the complaints were valid. On the other hand, if things remain roughly the same or even improve in popularity, then the situation was emotional and unnecessary. Ultimately, only time can tell."
