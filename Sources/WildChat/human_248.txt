User: ""We succeed together
We offer our customers a unique breadth of opportunity.

And we can only deliver the full promise of this by being truly connected – across boundaries. With our customers and partners. Together as colleagues and as an organisation.

So, we collaborate across boundaries. We break down silos. We trust and support each other. And, when necessary, get out of each other’s way.

Together, we make possible what we cannot do alone." 1. define the value, 2. discuss how it helps us open up a world of opportunities 3. explore what it means for you on day-to0day basis"
