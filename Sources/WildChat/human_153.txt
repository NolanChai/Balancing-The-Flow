User: "If I measure light point to grey 18% object then I adjust exposure compensation+2. Will the grey 18% become white in the final picture?"

Assistant: "If you adjust the exposure compensation by +2, the result would typically overexpose the image, making the grey 18% object appear brighter than it actually is. However, it would not turn the grey 18% object into pure white. The object would still retain some degree of its original color and would likely appear brighter or lighter, but not completely white."
