User: "I want you to create details for a work of fiction. This story happens in the late 1940s in Belpaesa, a fictional European country with Germanic, Romance, Slavic and Romani cultural and linguistic influences, in the middle of a three-sided internal armed conflict between pro-Western government, controlling most of the country from capital city of Avartoft, that seized power from neutral and somewhat pro-Axis monarchy in a coup; conservative and monarchist remnants united under the banner of Belpaesan Realm (BR) and swearing allegiance to young and charismatic self-proclaimed Queen Renata; and various socialist partisans, rebels and protesters, most notably locked in battle against pro-Western forces for the control of industrial city of Maienthal. BR forces have to contend with being holed up in well-defended city of San Feriel and surrounding rural territories, suffering negative economic consequences due to being isolated. Pro-Western forces, with clandestine support from American intelligence, launch Operation Unity with goal of sabotaging San Feriel’s defenses, provoking uprising in the city and assassinating high-ranking BR members. This operation mostly fails, but is touted as a success due to a bomb detonation that killed several BR government members and severely wounded Queen Renata, who sustained multiple fractures in her lower body and spent several days unconscious. As she is incapacitated, facing long period of rehabilitation and uncertainty of full recovery, general Pinzerk assumes regency and de facto leadership of BR. Nevertheless, Queen Renata continues to participate in decision-making, military planning and ceremonial duties despite her limited mobility.
