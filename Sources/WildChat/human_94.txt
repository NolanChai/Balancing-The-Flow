Scene 1: Lilac and Milla's Quest for Food

[Camera fades in as Lilac and Milla, now the size of ants, scurry through a lush forest in search of food. They are constantly on guard, looking around nervously.]

Lilac: (whispering) Milla, we need to find some food soon. We've been reduced to the size of ants, and our hunger is getting unbearable!

Milla: I know, Lilac, but we have to be careful. We may be immortal, but that doesn't mean we're invincible. Plus, being this tiny makes us even more vulnerable.

[They hear a rustling noise nearby.]

Lilac: Shh, did you hear that? Let's follow the sound and see if there's anything we can scavenge.

[The camera follows them as they cautiously approach the noise.]

Scene 2: Goku's Unexpected Meal

[Meanwhile, Goku, now at his normal size, is sitting by a peaceful river, frying some freshly caught fish over a campfire. He looks content as he cooks.]

Goku: (smiling) Ah, cooking fresh fish like this is the best! Nothing beats a good meal after a tough training session.

[He takes a bite of the cooked fish, savoring the flavor.]

Scene 3: Lilac and Milla's Encounter

[Lilac and Milla finally reach the source of the rustling noise and are surprised to see Goku enjoying his meal.]

Milla: Oh no, Lilac! It's a human! We need to stay hidden; they could pose a serious threat to our tiny selves!

Lilac: (whispering) You're right, Milla. Let's stay hidden behind these blades of grass and observe from a safe distance.

[They peek out from behind the grass, watching Goku eat.]

Scene 4: Lilac and Milla's Reactions

[Moments later, Lilac turns to Milla, her expression uncertain.]

Lilac: Milla, did you notice something peculiar? Goku is eating fish, just like us!

Milla: (confused) Yes, I did, Lilac. But humans eating fish is normal, right? I don't understand why that surprises us.

Lilac: Well, you see, Milla, as Freedom Planet characters, we've always been scared of humans due to their size and unpredictable nature. But seeing Goku here, casually enjoying his meal, reminds us that not every human is a threat.

Milla: (thoughtful) You're right, Lilac. We shouldn't judge all humans the same way. Goku seems kind and peaceful, even if he is big.

[They continue watching Goku, their fear slowly turning into curiosity.]

Scene 1: Lilac's Curiosity

[Camera fades in as Lilac cautiously approaches a group of ants scurrying about, her size still reduced to that of an ant. She observes them with a mix of curiosity and hesitation.]

Lilac: (whispering) These ants are fascinating. They work together so intricately, like a well-oiled machine. But I can't help feeling a bit apprehensive. We've always been scared of humans, yet now we find ourselves in their world.

[She takes a step closer, careful not to disturb the ants.]

Scene 2: Mysterious Powers of the Ants

[Meanwhile, Milla, also the size of an ant, watches Lilac's interaction with the ants from a safe distance.]

Milla: (whispering to herself) Look at Lilac, she's so brave. Those ants seem harmless and are going about their own business. Maybe we've been too quick to judge the humans and everything around us.

[The camera pans back to Lilac, who is now completely engrossed in watching the ants' activities.]

Scene 3: Lilac's Epiphany

[Suddenly, Lilac notices something incredibleâ€”a few of the ants working together to move a fallen leaf several times their size.]

Lilac: (in awe) Woah... Look at them go! These small creatures are so powerful and organized, just like us Freedom Planet characters. Maybe being small isn't so scary after all.

[She continues observing, a newfound respect for the ants shining in her eyes.]

Scene 4: Lilac and Milla's Transformation

[Lilac returns to Milla, excitement bubbling within her.]

Lilac: Milla, I just realized something. These ants, they may be tiny, but they're resilient and capable. Just like us! Our size doesn't define us. Maybe it's time for us to embrace our immortality and overcome our fear of humans.

Milla: (grinning) I'm proud of you, Lilac. You've opened your eyes to new possibilities. Let's show the humans that we can coexist peacefully, just like the ants do. And who knows, maybe even Goku can teach us a thing or two about finding strength in unexpected places.

[They stand tall, ready to face the world with a newfound perspective.]
