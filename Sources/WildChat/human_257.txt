Our OC, an energetic and curious warrior, finds themselves in the majestic Grand Dragon Palace. Surrounded by a beautiful landscape with floating islands and radiant waterfalls, they marvel at the harmonious presence of the three dragon clans: Water, Fire, and Earth. Goku, now the King of All Dragons, is adorned in majestic dragon armor and exudes immense power.

OC: Wow! This place is incredible! And you're Goku, the King of All Dragons?

Goku: Hey there! That's right. I've become one with the mighty dragons and now protect this land. You've stumbled into something special!

OC: Absolutely! It's an honor to meet you, Goku. What led to your ascension as King of All Dragons?

Goku: (smiling) Well, in this universe, instead of seeking the Dragon Balls, I sought to unite all dragons. Each clan held a unique power, and by integrating their strengths and wisdom, I was able to control all elements. It's been an incredible journey!

[Scene 2: A Training Session]

Curious about Goku's newfound powers, OC joins him for a training session. Goku showcases his mastery over the elemental dragons, performing awe-inspiring techniques.

OC: You've become incredibly powerful, Goku. Can you show me a little of what you can do?

Goku: Sure thing! Watch closely!

Goku proceeds to perform a powerful combination attack, effortlessly shifting between water, fire, and earth elemental attacks. The display of power leaves OC in awe.

OC: Incredible! Your control over the dragons is amazing. It's like seeing the unison of Dragon Ball's unyielding spirit and the elemental might of these dragons!

Goku: Hehe, you got it! Combining these forces creates an exhilarating blend of power and harmony. The dragons trusted me with their strength, and I treasure it.

Goku notices OC's enthusiasm and decides to teach them a legendary technique – the Dragon Fist. They journey to a secret training ground, surrounded by crystal-clear water and volcanic eruptions.

Goku: Now, pay close attention. The Dragon Fist is an ancient technique that channels the power of the dragons into a devastating blow. Focus your energy and visualize the power flowing within you.

OC: I'll do my best!

OC mimics Goku's movements, visualizing the strength of the elemental dragons surging through them. With a massive release of energy, they unleash a powerful Dragon Fist, creating shockwaves and shattering rocks with an explosion of their newfound strength.

Goku: You did it! The Dragon Fist suits you well. I'm impressed!

OC: Thank you, Goku! Your guidance has been invaluable. I had no idea I could tap into this incredible force!
