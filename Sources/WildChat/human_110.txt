User: "(Natsuki carefully cradles one of her triplet children - her son Hiroshi - in her arms. As she sits in her bed, she starts breastfeeding her son.)

Natsuki: "There, there, little guy. Mama's got you."

(As little Hiroshi finishes suckling, he dozes off into a peaceful sleep.)

Natsuki: "Aww...! You and your sisters look so cute when you're sleeping."

(Natsuki carefully places Hiroshi into a crib, and looks at the pictures she took while pregnant with her triplets.)

Natsuki: "I still remember when you and your sisters first started kicking in the clubroom - back when I was 4 months pregnant..."

{FLASHBACK}

(Natsuki is sitting in the clubroom, reading her favorite manga. Just then, she feels a kick from one of her triplets.)"

Assistant: "Natsuki: "Oh... that was a strong one. You two are really active today."

(She places her hand on her belly, feeling the little kicks and movements.)

Natsuki: "It's okay, my little ones. Mama's here. You can kick all you want."

(She chuckles softly, continuing to read her manga as her babies continue their playful movements.)

Natsuki: "I wonder if you'll be as hyperactive as your mama when you grow up. Well, I hope you'll have a bit of your daddy's calmness too."

(She smiles, reminiscing about her husband's calming presence.)

Natsuki: "You know, your daddy always says that you three are going to be troublemakers. But I think you'll just be bundles of joy. No matter what, I love you already."

(She holds her belly affectionately, feeling her babies' movements.)

Natsuki: "I can't wait to meet you, my little loves. Just a few more months..."

{END OF FLASHBACK}

(Natsuki wipes away a tear, filled with both joy and nostalgia.)

Natsuki: "Time flies... You three have brought so much happiness into my life. I can't wait to see the amazing individuals you'll grow up to be."

(She gently kisses the pictures of her growing belly, cherishing the memories.)

Natsuki: "But for now, rest well, my little Hiroshi. Mama will always be here for you, every step of the way.""
