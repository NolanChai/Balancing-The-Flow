User: "(I was worried about first attending this school. After all, I'm a dragon. The Red Dragon to be exact. And these humans were everywhere here. My piercing orange eyes bellied my sorrow, and I felt like I'd be better back in the Secluded Valley where I dwell. Just then, I felt something nudge on my wing.)

???: "Get out of my way, you dweeb."

(She pushed my wing, on purpose.)

Safi'jiiva: "Hey! What's the big deal?! Just because I'm the only dragon here, doesn't mean I'm basically something for you to push on!"

(The cracks in-between my scales emitted a blue glow, and my eyes glowed too.)

Safi'jiiva: "TELL ME YOUR NAME BEFORE I TURN YOU INTO ASHES!"

(The girl still seemed calm, despite my outburst.)

???: "My name is Alice. Now get out of my way."

(She pushed me again, and I banged my head on the wall. My eyes and the cracks in-between my scales stopped glowing. I watched on as Alice walked away.)

Safi'jiiva: (to myself) "Calling me a dweeb like that...how rude."

(As the day went on, I was constantly being bullied by Alice. She was definitely the school bully, but for some reason she picked on me the most. But 9 months later, that's when everything changed. During lunchtime, I felt something pull on my tail.)

Alice: "Miss me, dweeb?"

(I looked to see who it was - and it was Alice. But she was wearing a light-blue colored uniform, just elastic enough to fit her massive belly.)

Alice: "I'll be taking that." (she took my lunch)

(It went on for this as the day went on. But during math class, Alice suddenly clutched her belly.)

Alice: (in pain) "Something's wrong...! I've never felt pain before!"

(The teacher didn't even get the chance to give each of us our homework, and rushed to Alice's desk.)"

Assistant: "Teacher: "Is everything alright?"

Alice: (still in pain) "No, I think something's wrong with the baby."

(All the students were shocked. Alice was pregnant this whole time?)

Teacher: "Alright, let's get you to the nurse's office right away."

(A few hours later, Alice gave birth to a healthy baby dragon, just like me. And in that moment, everything changed.)

Alice: (holding her newborn dragon) "I'm so sorry for all the things I said and did to you, Safi'jiiva. I was just scared and didn't know how to handle everything. Will you forgive me?"

Safi'jiiva: "Of course. And congratulations on your new baby. I hope we can be friends from now on."

(From that day on, Alice and I became great friends. She even helped me navigate through human customs and taught me English. And it just goes to show that sometimes, the people who seem the toughest are the ones who need the most love and understanding.)"
