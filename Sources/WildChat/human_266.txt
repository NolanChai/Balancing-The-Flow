Nobody really knows what caused there to be a size difference between macros and micros. One thing we know is that it didn’t always used to be like this. There were no over-sized plants and vegetation that destroyed houses with their roots and vines, there were no insects that could grow to the size of a compact car, and there were definitely no macro furries that delighted in hunted down and swallowing their smaller cousins whole. This, however, was all before the rise of the macros.

As you can imagine, there was a great deal of confusion when one day regular furries, animals, and plants rapidly began to grow to many times their original size whereas the anthropomorphic mammals remained at their normal sizes. At first, there seemed to be at least some form of cooperation between the two groups as they tried to repair the damage that had been done. However, the giants soon started to give up on the idea that the two groups could ever be considered equal. This was largely due to the fact that an average adult-sized micro was only about three inches tall when compared to one of the massive giants. Micros were crushed beneath the macro’s feet without a second glance (sometimes intentionally) as the giants trudged about their daily lives.

Some micros gathered together and fled to remote locations away from most of the dangers that they faced. This didn’t protect them from everything however. No matter where they went, there was always something big that had it’s eye on them. Even if there were no macrofurries around, micros found themselves being eaten alive by the animals that had grown on that day as well.

Several years passed after the rise of the macros, and for the micros, things only became worse. Macros on the other hand had used that time to build the beginnings of fully macro-sized towns and cities where they could live normal lives again.
Ash was an anthropomorphic pardinensis cheetah, a very rare species, he was a micro. He was slim and muscular with a long and thin tail and a short grey fur with darker spots, his short sleek fur was letting see the chiseled details of his muscles. He was also quite intelligent, but perhaps not as much as he thought to be. He despised the other micros who chose to live as far possible from the towering macros and their cities. He was living in their gigantic houses, hiding under their building seized pieces of furniture of in the holes in their walls.
But one day he was captured and sold to a macro.
When the box was finally opened and Ash was brought out, he was met with the sight of a towering anthro jaguar. The massively muscular jaguar grinned down at him, his sharp teeth glinting in the light.

“Well, well, well,” the jaguar said with a chuckle. “Looks like I won myself a tasty little snack.”

Ash shuddered in fear as the jaguar lifted him up, examining him closely. The jaguar smirked as he examined the body of the comparatively diminutive cheetah. “Fine, you seem to have endured the travel quite well. I bought that cage for you, I hope you will find it large enough. From the description on the auction site you’re a freshly caught wild micro. I assume you’re not used to restrained space, but you have to get used to it.” He chuckled and put Ash in the cage. He closed the door of the enclosure just after. “I can’t wait to have some fun with you, but it’s better to let you have some rest to chill out a bit.” Then the jaguar moved on his couch to watch TV, time to time he cast a glance at the cage and his tiny occupant from his seat. Some time later he moved to his bedroom to sleep for the night.

The jaguar came back at the end of the day. He brought several grocery sacks and put them in his kitchen. “I thought about eating you first, but you’re so tiny you would not even fill one tenth of my belly.” He said with a chuckle. Some time later he come back with a dinner TV for carnivores adapted to his enormous size. He reached in the cage for the cheetah. Ash tried to avoid to be grabbed and managed to stay out of the reach of the humongous jaguar paw like hand as he was holding his dinner TV with his other hand at the same time, but the giant managed to seize the cheetah diminutive body eventually. “Don’t make your difficult to get !” Said the jaguar with the same chuckle. He then moved to his couch and sat heavily, the couch creaking under the thousands of tons of his weight. He then put the cheetah on the rim of the tray of his dinner TV. “Several kinds of meat. Beef, chicken, fish, and caiman, my favorite !” He said. “You can take some, it’s not your appetite that will make a difference.” He switched his TV on and searched for something interesting with his remote while taking some bit of food time to time. “Ah, by the way, my name is Lance. But you have to call me Master.” He snickered. “Or, if you feel like being a good pet, Daddy.” He laughed.

One day, when Lance was engrossed in a particularly loud show on television, Ash seized his chance. He quietly slid out of his cage and onto the floor, careful to avoid any creaking or telltale sounds. Using his memory of the house layout and the cacophony of the TV, he stealthily made his way towards the window that he had observed Lance often leaving open.

Ash’s heart pounded as he reached the window, with each passing second a potential for Lance to notice him. With one final act of defiance against his captor, he climbed up the curtain and leapt out into the open air, finally free. As he made his way through the grass that seemed like a jungle, he knew that he had a long journey ahead of him.

Unknown of Ash, Lance was well aware about his position, as by security the giant jaguar put a microchip and GPS device in the collar he put around the neck of his expensive micro anthro cheetah.
Lance followed the moving of his pet on his car sized smartphone as an app what giving him the position of Ash on a map. And some hours later the jaguar resounding steps come close of the hideout of Ash.
“Ash ? I know you’re here. Move out of your hiding place.” The giant waited some seconds. “You know it’s dangerous for you to be in the streets. Critters are big here, they will eat you. And there are other macros too, all of them won’t try to catch you to keep you as a pet. So come with me. You will be safe in my home. I won’t punish you very hard for this time.”
Ash’s heart sank as he heard Lance’s intimidating voice. He knew that there was no denying the giant’s presence, but he was determined to make a final attempt to escape. From his hiding place, he quickly formed a plan.

Taking advantage of the giant’s momentary distraction, he bolted from his hiding place, running as fast as his legs could carry him, away from Lance. The jaguar gave an annoyed grunt and pursued Ash, his massive strides closing the distance between them frighteningly quickly.

In the midst of their chase, Ash recalled a large sewer drain he had discovered earlier during his exploration. Deftly, the micro cheetah made a sudden turn, darting into the drain and disappearing from Lance’s sight.

The giant jaguar cursed under his breath, realizing that he couldn’t fit into the small space. He knelt down, attempting to reach into the drain with his massive paw, but Ash was too fast and had already scrambled further into the darkness.

Lance growled lowly, frustrated at losing his prized pet. He briefly considered calling off the chase and letting Ash make his own way in this harsh world, but the investment in the micro cheetah and his curiosity about whether Ash’s resourcefulness could be put to better use got the better of him.

The giant jaguar decided his next move - he’d take a different tactic. Anticipating the path of the sewers, Lance hurried towards another exit, where he would attempt to recapture Ash quietly and seemingly without effort.

A macro centipede was hiding in the sewer. It was easily four time longer than Ash and about the length of Lance’s forearm. The cheetah inadvertently knocked one of the long antennas of the invertebrate. The centipede became active and started to run after the cheetah. Ash, as a former wild micro before being captured, was used to cross the way of some macro critters, but the place where he lived before being sold to Lance was more in the north of the country in a cooler climate and insects were not as big, even the macro ones. That centipede was looking like a monster for the cheetah who was running with terror.
Ash burst out of the sewer and didn’t even noticed Lance waiting for him. The centipede hurtled out of the sewer pursuing his tiny prey.
Lance quickly realized the danger posed to his tiny prize and jumped into action. With an impressive display of strength and agility, he caught the large centipede just as it was about to sink its venomous pincers into the panicked cheetah. He crushed the giant invertebrate without hesitation, its many legs twitching one last time before going completely limp.
Ash, still in a state of panic, finally noticed Lance standing above him. The skyscraper jaguar had saved him, and though Ash was desperate to escape captivity, he couldn’t help but feel a strange, begrudging gratitude toward Lance.

The jaguar offered a massive paw to Ash, smirking. “Now do you see why I told you it’s a dangerous world out there? You can stay with me, and I can keep you safe from creatures like that. Or you can go back out there alone, and take your chances with the countless other predators lurking in the shadows.”

Ash hesitated, torn between his desire for freedom and his newfound understanding of the true dangers faced by someone in his situation. He glanced back at the sewer entrance, shuddering at the memory of the terrifying macro centipede.

Reluctantly, he climbed into Lance’s outstretched palm, knowing that, for the moment, his best chance at survival was to accept the giant’s “protection”. As they walked back to Lance’s home, Ash wondered if he could ever change the dynamic of their relationship, and perhaps one day regain his freedom without sacrificing his safety.
Lance washed Ash meticulously as his escapade made the micro ran through a sewer. And the giant checked the diminutive anthro feline body to see if he had been hurt. Then he put him back in his cage and took care to close the door of the enclosure.
Later in that same day, Lance gently seized Ash in his massive hand and moved to his couch. He had another of these enormous dinner TV for macro carnivores and he offered some bits of meat to Ash.
Ash was about to eat one of them when he noticed something different. Lance didn’t switch the TV on yet. He put the morsel back on the rim of the gigantic tray and looked up at Lance. The giant anthropomorphic jaguar was looking down at him, his face was looking more serious than his usual jovial appearance. “Well, Ash. I said I won’t punish you hard too much for your escape. But, you made me search for you for hours and you might have been killed by that bug by a narrow margin.” He approached his humongous hand from the cheetah and stretched his forefinger out and gently petted the comparatively tiny body of the micro. “I know you’re a former wild micro with some age and you are not used to be captive. I wanted a pet who had some life before, I was thinking it would be more interesting. But I’m wondering if I should not have bought a micro from farming and already tamed and domesticated.” He moved his hand away. “Well, about that punishment, I wonder what you’re thinking of it ? And how I should punish you for your escapade ?”

Ash hesitated for a moment, considering his response carefully. He knew that Lance held all the power in this situation, and that any defiance could be met with disastrous consequences. However, he couldn’t deny the fact that he was grateful for the giant’s intervention with the centipede.

“Master,” Ash began hesitantly, “I understand that I caused you concern and trouble with my escape attempt, and I understand the need for a punishment in this situation. I know that the world is dangerous for a micro like me, and you saved my life today. I appreciate that, and I will do my best to be a good pet and companion to you.”

Lance raised an eyebrow, somewhat surprised by the sincerity in Ash’s words. It seemed that their previous encounter had affected him more than he had thought.

“As for my punishment, I leave that decision in your capable hands, Master. However, I ask that you consider the fact that, despite everything, part of me still yearns for the wilds as it is where I spent most of my life. Maybe you can take that into account when deciding an appropriate punishment,” Ash finished, his voice barely above a whisper.
Lance looked down at Ash pensively, genuinely considering the cheetah’s words. After a few moments, he nodded slowly. “Very well, Ash. I appreciate your honesty and understanding of the situation. As for your punishment, I will think on it and find something that is both fair and takes into consideration your wild instincts.”

With that, Lance finally switched on the TV, and the remainder of the evening was spent with the giant and the tiny cheetah sharing a meal together. And although the weight of the impending punishment loomed over Ash, there was an undeniable sense of camaraderie between the two that had been strengthened by the day’s events. In a way, their unique relationship was evolving, forming a new bond that neither Ash nor Lance could have anticipated.
Lance seized the cheetah between his massive fingers. “By the way Ash, I’m wondering, how old are you exactly ?”
Ash hesitated, it was obvious Lance was a yound adult, but the cheetah was certain to be older. “So, how old ?” Insisted Lance.
“44.” Replied the cheetah with embarrassement. Lance smirked and chuckled. “Well I’m 25. But I like the idea to have a pet older than me a lot, it’s also for that reason I chose you on that auction site. But you still have to call me Master, or what you already know.”
Ash bristled slightly at the jaguar’s amusement at their age difference, but he knew better than to provoke Lance any further. With a reluctant sigh, he nodded in acceptance. “Yes, Master,” he replied, doing his best to swallow his pride.

The colossal jaguar barely looked at Ash when he left the next morning. The cheetah passed the day locked in his cage till the jaguar came back. The giant opened the door of the cage. “You can go out of your cage if you wish to stretch your legs, but remember : no escape and you come if I call you, Ash.“
He was going to move in an other room when he stopped abruptly. He moved a small cardboard box from his pocket. He opened it, it contained a tinny ball, a futon scaled for a micro with some pillows and blankets. He put them in the cage. “For you, I guess you would like it. As a wild micro you should not be used to use a bed like that, but I think you need a more comfortable enclosure. Consider your cage as your own house.” His massive and muscular form towered above the cage again as he stood up and groped for another thing in his pocket. “I bought that too.” He said while showing a device looking like a metallic pen scaled to the immense size of the jaguar, so easily twice the length of the cheetah and probably weighing more than one ton. He pressed a switch and a bright spot of green colored light appeared on the floor in the direction the jaguar pointed it. “A laser pointer,” he said with an amused smile, "I’m sure you would enjoy playing this way. But not right now, I have some chores to finish.” He put the pointer on a shelf several hundreds feet above the floor. “By the way, I have not forgotten about your punishment. So don’t do anything that would worsen your situation.” He added with a chuckle before he moved out of the room.
Ash couldn’t help but feel grateful for the kindness Lance had shown, despite his earlier transgressions. The items provided for his comfort and potential playing marked a significant change in the giant’s attitude towards him, and perhaps even a softening of his heart.

Despite their newfound bond, Ash couldn’t ignore the lingering dread regarding the punishment he was still yet to face. He occupied himself within his enclosure, making a cozy nest for himself with the small futon, pillows, and blankets, and contemplated Lance’s motivations for the newfound generosity.
Finally, next week, the day Ash had been dreading arrived. Lance entered the room with a solemn expression. “Ash,” he began, his voice carrying a seriousness that had not been present before. “It’s time for your punishment.”
The giant looked down at Ash. “To start with : Heel !” He waited. “You have to come to me each time I call you this way, without any discussion.” He waited watching down the hesitant grey furred cheetah. “Heel !” His deep voice rumbled again. Ash moved with hesitation but came toward Lance. The colossus bent down and reached for the cheetah. “Good. But next time, you’d better don’t make me wait.” Lance checked the collar of his pet and his app on his smart phone. “Perfect, it’s working. Well, how do you have to call me ?”
Ash looked back at the young giant and even though he was wondering why he acted this way he replied : “Master.”
“Fine,” replied Lance, “I expect you to only call me this way tonight. Remember it well !” The massive musclebound jaguar looked down at his cheetah he was holding in his hand. “I registered you for a competition. It will be a race of micro cheetahs. You’ll have to run for me. I expect you to behave properly and to obey every command I give you without question.”
“I’m not trained Master, I won’t win.” Replied Ash.
“I don’t expect you to have the same result a properly trained cheetah, but you have a chance to show me what you can do.” Lance saw his pet was looking stressed. “Don’t worry and relax. You’ll make me proud if you behave properly. If you do, consider your punishment lifted.”
“There will be other macros ?” Asked Ash.
“Yes, we will be several dozens, probably. But don’t panic, only me will handle you.”
“Please Master, find another punishment !” Pleaded the cheetah.
“Nope, it’s too late now. I registered, and you will go.” Replied Lance. The giant jaguar brought Ash in his bedroom and put him down on the top of his desk. He seized a small box in a drawer and opened it in front of the micro. “You’ll wear this.” He said while presenting race clothes at his pet. “Cheetahs usually don’t wear shoes during the race and as you’re a wild one I thought it would be better to let you bare feet.” Lance saw Ash’s face crumpling. “Don’t worry, everything will be alright, I’m here with you.” He put the outfits in front of Ash. “Well, put them on. I will make you run after the laser pointer in my room as a quick training. We have to go in one hour.”
Ash reluctantly put on the racing clothes provided by Lance. The idea of being showcased in front of several dozens of other macros unnerved him, but he had no choice. He focused on the fact that if he behaved well and obeyed Lance’s commands, his punishment would be gone.

As promised, Lance spent the remaining hour letting Ash chase the laser pointer around the room. Despite Ash’s initial reluctance, the practice session ended up being surprisingly enjoyable for both of them. Ash’s natural instincts and agility as a cheetah kicked in as he hunted the elusive dot, while Lance found amusement watching his tiny pet dart around the room.

At the racing grounds, the sight of so many giant macros and their respective micro cheetahs was overwhelming for Ash. He clung to Lance, his tiny body shaking, but the jaguar remained a reassuring presence.

As the race began, Ash found himself driven by a fierce determination to make Lance proud. He put all his energy into running, his heart pounding as he kept up with the other racers. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Lance watching him intently, cheering him on.

As the racers approached the finish line, Ash pushed himself even harder. He knew he wouldn’t be able to secure a winning position, but he needed to prove himself to Lance. As he crossed the finish line, he realized he had placed in the top ten – a significant accomplishment, considering his lack of formal training.

Breathing heavily, Ash looked up at Lance, who wore an expression of genuine pride and approval.
“Well done, Ash,” Lance rumbled.
“It’s not common to see a pardinensis cheetah.” Rumbled a deep voice at the side of Lance. The jaguar stood up and turned on his side and saw an imposing lion approaching. “Yes, I found him in a auction site. Someone captured him as he was scavenging in his home and proposed him. I was surprised to see a rare species on such site.” Replied Lance.
“You’ve been lucky.” Replied the lion. “Even on specialized sites they are rarely proposed. By the way, my name is Bassari Arouk.”
“I’m Lance, Lance Mahogan.”
Ash was looking up at his master and that lion. He didn’t like that other macro came so close. He saw a male micro cheetah passing and moving toward the lion, a jubatus cheetah with the usual yellowish tawny fur an black spots. Ash recognized him as being in the top ten, and even in the top five possibly.
Bassari bent down and reached his massive hand down. Ash moved away but saw the lion was simply scooping the cheetah. “Good job Ran !” Said the lion. “You’ll have a good reward !” The lion was keeping his hand at the level of the track. Ash was moving away but he heard Lance murmuring : “Keep heel, Ash.” The grey furred cheetah struggled to remain close of both giants. Another cheetah, a female jubatus came, trotting toward the cupped hand of the humongous lion and climbed into, then the lion stood up holing both cheetahs in his massive hand. Ash was not sure, but he thought she was also above him in the ranking.
“Wow, you own two champions !” Exclaimed Lance. The lion chuckled before calling out a third cheetah, another male jubatus. “I might have a third one if he was not so unruly.” That cheetah cast a strange look at Ash before being seized by the enormous lion fingers. “Come here you !” Rumbled the lion before putting him with the two other cheetahs.
“I never saw you here before.” Said the lion while examining his three cheetahs. He carefully seized their legs between his huge fingers and stretched them out delicately as to check their state. “And you come with a pardinensis and he finishes among the first ten.” Said Bassari with a smile.
“It was not the most difficult race.” Replied Lance, "I wanted something easy for him for the first time. " Ash started when he heard Lance said “for the first time” doe he intended to make him run again ?
“Indeed replied the lion. I usually use this one as a warm-up for mines.”
“Yes, I heard it was the reason most cheetah doesn’t have their best performances at this one, they save themselves for the next and more serious races. Your’s must be great when they put all their strengths into !”
Ash was proud to have been in the top ten, but he put all hi strength in this race, and hearing most of the other competitors were in fact saving themselves made him feel downcast.
“I hope they will be.” Said the lion with a smirk. “But your cheetah makes quite an impression. I didn’t see a pardinensis on this track for years, if ever you wish to sell him, feel free to contact me, I’m ready to put the price to have him, or if you want a skilled champion I would be happy to trade one of mines with your pardinensis.” Bassari looked down at Ash with a smile. Ash started to move backward but he saw Lance lifted the heel of one of his huge feet and tapped it on the ground.
Lance was also surprised by the words of the lion. “No, sorry, I don’t want to sell him.” Replied the jaguar. “And I’m still trying to tame and train him, it’s a wild micro, he doesn’t always behave properly you know.” The lion chuckled. He seized the third cheetah by the scruff and lifted him to show him to Lance. “I’m used to unruly micros.” He teasingly shifted the cheetah and released him in his huge cupped hand. “You just have to be patient, although I concur an adult and perhaps middle aged wild one might impose some challenges.”
Both giants saw the preparations for the next race were almost finished.
“Will you make him take part to the next races ?” Asked Bassari.
“I don’t think I will, replied Lance. It must have been a lot for him already. I see he is struggling to behave with all the other macros at proximity and this bustle, he is not used to it.”
“I see, replied the giant lion. I think he should have enough energy for another race, although he might not reach the same ranking this time. But lot of cheetahs owners present here would like to see him run.”
Lance smiled and looked down at Ash. The grey furred cheetah was not liking to have to remain close of the lion, and he was glad Lance allowed him to stay on the ground instead to be held in his hand at a closer place from Bassari.
“So then, Ash. What do you think of it ? Do you want to try another race or stop right now ?”

Ash didn’t reached the top ten this time. But Lance was proud of him nevertheless. The grey furred cheetah was exhausted and almost collapsed on the floor of the track. Lance was about to come to pick him up but he was stopped by a massive bull who told him no macros were allowed to walk on the race track for safety measure toward the micros.
Lance scooped Ash in his massive hands when the pardinensis reached the rim of the track and the jaguar moved to a table of the bar of the venue.
“You performed very well ! Consider your punishment lifted !” Said Lance.
“Thank you Master.” Replied Ash. “What rank did I reach ?”
“You’re 18th, out of 32 contestants. But you did it, you overcame your fears and followed the rules. When I explained to Bassari you was a wild one captured from only some weeks he was impressed you didn’t try to run away.”
About the macro lion, his cheetahs performed well, Ran was third, Lene the female was fifth and Laar the unruly one was eighth. Lance saw Bassari was getting them back in his hands.
He smiled and poured some water from on bottle in its cap and offered it to Ash who was still panting from the late race. As the bottle was scaled for macros Ash could barely lift the cap full of water and Lance had to help him.
“Oh, you should use it instead.” Said Bassari as he moved at the table of Lance. He showed a strip where were attached several diminutive bottles scaled to the size of a micro. “It’s easier for them.” The gigantic anthropomorphic lion carefully used the tip of the huge claws of his thumb and forefinger to detach one of the bottles. He gave it to Lance, knowing Ash would be nervous too much to accept to have the huge hand of an unknown macro coming close of him. Lance thanked the lion and looked at it, his eyes squinting to read some diminutive letters, he saw it was only written “north mounts water”.
“Here Ash. For you.” Ash took it and thanked both Lance and the lion. He smelled at the opening of the bottle after having open it but as he saw the three cheetahs of the lion were drinking the same kind of bottle he sipped at it. The water was fresh, more than the one of the bottle of Lance ordered from the bar of the place and it was way easier to drink in this bottle scaled at his size.
Ash saw the lion ordered a red colored drink, but he doubted it was alcohol.
There was two races reserved to micro canidae were African wild dogs, chacals and coyotes were running. This race was timed the way to allow the cheetahs to relax some before a third race. Ash watched some moments of it from the vast screens placed on the walls, he found it enthralling and somewhat understood the interest these macros had for it.
A male macro hyena approached. “Congratulation Mister Arouk ! Your micros were spectacular tonight !” He looked at Lance. “And thank you for the show, your cheetah got attention, several spectators and enthusiasts posted photos of him on the net.” Ash stopped to drink when the hyena started to speak at his master. As a former wild micro used to live hidden and unnoticed, he was not enjoying the idea to draw attention from the macros at all.
“I knew pardinensis were rare, but I was not aware he would draw so much attention in a place like this.” Replied Lance.
“It’s the first time I see one alive.” Replied the hyena. Ash’s ears pricked up as he heard the word “alive”. “There are not so much enthusiasts who own one.” Continued the hyena. “Perhaps you should get in touch with some other owners, the ones who have a female might be interested to get cubs.” Ash was not liking this idea at all, and seeing Lance looking interested made the pardinensis cheetah feeling worried.
“I know one of them.” Said Bassari. “But even when you have a couple, it’s not easy to make them reproduce. At least naturally.”
Lance looked thoughtful as he listened to Bassari and the hyena, considering their suggestions. Ash, on the other hand, felt a growing unease at the idea of being used for breeding purposes with other macros. There was still so much he didn’t understand about this world he’d been thrust into, and the thought of being forced into such an intimate situation with a stranger was incredibly distressing.

However, his thoughts were quickly interrupted when the next race began. The excitement and energy around him were infectious, and before he knew it, he’d been swept up in the excitement of cheering for the competitors. For a brief moment, he was able to forget about his fears and simply enjoy the thrill of the races.

After the races had finished, Lance scooped Ash back up into his hand, carefully cradling the exhausted cheetah. Despite their differing opinions on Ash’s future, it was clear that a bond had formed between them, one that would continue to grow as they faced the challenges of navigating the complicated world of macros and micros together.

As they walked home, Ash couldn’t shake the lingering thoughts of what may come next in his life. Would Lance truly force him into breeding situations, or would he listen to Ash’s concerns and find alternative ways to satisfy his interest in owning rare pardinensis cheetahs? Only time would tell, but for now, the tiny cheetah took solace in the fact that he had a giant on his side, one who had shown him kindness and protection in a world that was so much larger and more dangerous than he could have ever imagined.
Next week end, Bassari came with Lance in a park the jaguar was used to bring Ash to allow him to stretch his legs. Lance explained he usually sat in the lawn and allowed Ash to freely move around in the giant sized blades of grass and other plants at the condition he didn’t go far too much of him and he came back if the giant call him.
Lance and Bassari sat in the lawn, Lance put Ash on the ground and Bassari put the pair of cheetahs he brought with him, Laar, the unruly cheetah from the previous race event, and one of the cub ones to start to familiarize him with new environments than the home of his enormous lion owner.
The young cheetah stayed very close of his master, fascinated with the new and gigantic environment of the park but intimidated too. Lance and Bassari focused most of their attention on him as the cheetah cub was jolting at the mere breeze although he watched at the giant plants with eyes filled with wonder. Bassari picked up the ball looking flower of a clover and moved it gently in front of the cub who smiled and started to play with it. Lance watched with an amused expression.
Laar, walked farther from the lion and after some moment he caught up with Ash who was already some dozen of feet away from the two sitting yet looming colossi.
“Ash ? It’s your name, isn’t it ?” Said the cheetah. “Mine is Laar. We already meet on the race track.”
“I remember you.” Replied Ash.
“So, you’re used to come here ? It’s very big ! These trees, the ones in my master garden are not so huge.” As they two cheetahs walked they disturbed a macro moth. The insect was about 30 inches long and with a wingspan of 55 inches. Its front wings were greyish like the bark of a tree but the rear ones were colored with a brilliant orange. It flitted briefly and landed on a blade of grass about tenth feet away. “Woah ! I never saw one like that !” Cried out Laar. “You never saw moths before ?” Asked Ash with surprise. “I did. There are some that enter in our room sometime and in the garden of my master. But it’s rare to see them so close. And did you saw the color of this one ?”
Ash shrugged, it’s was not such a rare sight for him. “Ash, do you think I can catch it ?”
“Some moths are toxic, if you bite them, but they don’t bite.” Replied Ash.
Laar stealthily approached the moth with the eyes sparkling with amazement, his feline instincts boiling to catch the insect. Ash walked slowly behind as he watched the jubatus cheetah trying his best to leap on the insect. Ash snickered as he saw Laar jolting backward when the moth unfolded its wings abruptly and fluttered about before landing some distance away.
Laar glared back at Ash, but asked him if he could give him some help. Ash was game to do so, after all he had feline instinct too and it was a long time he didn’t caught an animal.
Both cheetahs approached and Laar jumped toward the moth. He ended with a tiny bit of its wing and looked at his hands as he saw grey wing scales of the moth were stuck on them, he wiped them on a blade of grass. “Yes, there wings are fragile.” Said Ash. “I would like to have it intact, to bring it as a trophy and show it to the other cheetahs.” Replied Laar.
The moth landed a bit farther this time and was looking more agitated after having been disturbed in this more brutal way. The twos cheetah approached it stealthily again. But as they were close the collar of Laar started to rang. “Damnit!” Shouted the jubatus. They also heard louder beeps coming far from behind and they saw it was the watch on the massive wrist of Bassari.
The lion realized he didn’t watched Laar carefully enough as he were chatting with Lance and had most of his attention focused on the cub. He let the cub with Lance, the young cheetah looked worried to be left alone with the jaguar but Lance gently scooped him in his massive hand and told him to not worry. The steps of the colossal 185 feet tall lion resounded on the ground under the thousands of tons of his weight as he approached."

Assistant: "“Laar, come here,” Bassari called out in a booming voice.

Ash and Laar exchanged a quick glance before the jubatus cheetah reluctantly walked back towards his giant master. Ash decided to follow, not wanting to be left alone in the open park.

As they arrived at Lance and Bassari, the lion scooped up Laar into his massive hand, giving him a stern look. “You need to be more careful, Laar. You shouldn’t wander too far away from me.”

Laar looked apologetic, his ears drooping slightly. “I’m sorry, Master. I was just trying to catch that moth with Ash, I didn’t realize I’d ventured that far.”

Bassari sighed, shaking his head. “Just be more careful next time, alright?”

The remainder of the afternoon passed without incident, as the cheetahs explored the park under their masters' watchful eyes. As the sun began to set, Lance decided that they should head home, scooping up Ash before saying their farewells to Bassari and the other cheetahs.

On the walk home, Ash couldn’t help but reflect on the day’s events. He realized that despite his initial resistance, he had actually enjoyed his time with Laar and even warmed up to Bassari. Perhaps, he thought, adapting to life with macros might not be as terrible as he first thought.

As they approached their home, he looked up at Lance, appreciating the giant’s constant support and care for him. Although his life had changed drastically since being captured and sold to the colossal jaguar, in a strange way, he wasn’t entirely unhappy with where he had ended up.

Only time would tell what the future held for Ash, but for now, he would focus on building a life with Lance and adapting to the world of macros, with the hope that maybe, just maybe, he could find happiness amid the giants."
