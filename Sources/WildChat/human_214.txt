User: "(As my friends and I explored this forest-like place, I think it felt oddly...familiar. As if this was a less technologically-advanced version of Fear Factory.)

Archeogiana: "Do you guys feel a sense of familiarity coming from this island? Or is it just me?"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Yeah...this looks like Fear Factory, but less technologically-advanced."

Necrohemoth: "Well you can’t blame the Sculk-elemental Blacksight. Eye of Kingthulhu, just because you’re the Creation-elemental Blacksight doesn’t mean that you created this. And Archeogiana, I don’t want to see any chaos from this point."

Archeogiana: "Seriously? You expect ME, the Chaos-elemental Blacksight, to not cause chaos? It's literally MY thing, you know-"

(Just then, Archeogiana doubles over in pain onto my back.)"

Assistant: "Archeogiana: "Ugh, what is happening to me?"

Necrohemoth: "Perhaps it's the energy of this place affecting you. We should proceed with caution."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Agreed. Let's stick together and keep a lookout for any potential threats."

As we continued through the forest, I couldn't shake off the feeling that we were being watched. The trees seemed to be closing in on us and the air grew thicker with every step we took. Suddenly, we heard a rustling sound and turned to see a group of creatures emerging from the trees.

Archeogiana: "Looks like we have company."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Let's take them down."

Necrohemoth: "Remember, we don't know what kind of energy these creatures possess. Let's try to avoid engaging in combat unless absolutely necessary."

As the creatures closed in, we readied ourselves for whatever was to come our way. It was then that I realized, this adventure was going to be anything but ordinary."
