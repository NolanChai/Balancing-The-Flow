User: "how many grams of water will be formed when 32 grams of oxygen gas react with 32 grams of hydrogen gas in the balanced equation: 2H2 + 02 > 2H20"

Assistant: "According to the balanced equation, 2 moles of hydrogen gas react with 1 mole of oxygen gas to form 2 moles of water. Therefore, the ratio is 2:1:2 (hydrogen:oxygen:water).

To find out how much water will be formed when 32 grams of oxygen gas react with 32 grams of hydrogen gas, we need to convert the masses to moles first.

Moles of hydrogen gas = 32 g รท 2 g/mol = 16 mol

Moles of oxygen gas = 32 g รท 32 g/mol = 1 mol

Since the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in the reaction is 2:1, only 0.5 moles of hydrogen gas are needed to react with 1 mole of oxygen gas. Therefore, the limiting reactant is oxygen gas.

Using the ratio of 2 moles of water to 1 mole of oxygen gas, we can calculate the moles of water formed:

Moles of water = 1 mol O2 x (2 mol H2O/1 mol O2) = 2 mol H2O

Finally, we can convert the moles of water to grams:

Grams of water = 2 mol H2O x 18 g/mol = 36 g

Therefore, 36 grams of water will be formed when 32 grams of oxygen gas react with 32 grams of hydrogen gas."
