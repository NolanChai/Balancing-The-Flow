User: "I want to create a button in Excel so that when I click on it, it displays the required values for me through a query box in which I type any numerical value. Thus, it will display all of this entered value in a column from the first row up to 12 rows down vertically. For example, if I have column A and I want to enter a numerical value from the first row in column A up to the 12th row in the same column, I just write the value in the query or text box and once I click on the macro button, all the values will be automatically entered for all the mentioned rows automatically.

Assistant: "To create a button in Excel that performs the required action, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your Excel workbook and navigate to the worksheet where you want to add the button.
2. Go to the "Developer" tab on the Excel Ribbon. If you don't have this tab visible, you need to enable it first. Right-click on the Ribbon, select "Customize the Ribbon", and check the "Developer" option on the right side.
3. Once you are on the "Developer" tab, click on the "Insert" button in the "Controls" group and select the "Button" control from the dropdown.
4. Click on the worksheet to insert the button. This will open the "Assign Macro" window.
5. Click on the "New" button in the "Assign Macro" window to create a new macro.
6. In the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) editor that opens, enter the following code:

```vba
Sub EnterValues()
    Dim inputVal As Variant
    Dim i As Long
    
    ' Display input box and retrieve the value entered
    inputVal = Application.InputBox("Enter value:", Type:=1)
    
    ' Loop to enter the value in the specified range
    For i = 1 To 12
        Range("A" & i).Value = inputVal
    Next i
End Sub
```

7. Save and close the VBA editor.
8. In the "Assign Macro" window, make sure the macro you just created (i.e., "EnterValues") is selected, and click "OK".
9. Now, you will have a button on your worksheet. Resize and reposition it as needed.
10. Right-click on the button and select "Edit Text" to change the button's caption or leave it as "Button 1".

You can now click on the button, enter a numerical value in the displayed input box, and the value will be automatically entered in column A from the first row up to 12 rows down."
