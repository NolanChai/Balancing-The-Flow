User: "(Sayori wakes up in her room. She's still alive and well. Were the events of DDLC just a dream? And as she saw a fly buzzing around, she suddenly unleashed a long tongue - she was part Chameleos! She got up and walked to the door. But with just a touch, the door was sent flying into the wall. It looked like Sayori was also part Kushala Daora. She stepped into a strange container - not only did she contain DNA of Chameleos and Kushala Daora, but she also contained DNA of Teostra and Vaal Hazak, even though she still looked like her normal self. But as she stepped outside her house, she saw...Monika! But she was floating - she was completely white all over, and her entire body looked transparent...as if she had become a ghost. But Sayori still looked the same.)

Sayori: "M-Monika...you look like a ghost!"

(Monika's expression saddened, and she turned blue - but...she also started crying, maybe after the digital world and real world had merged.)

Sayori: "Monika, what's wrong? Why do you look like a ghost?"

Monika: "I...I am a ghost, Sayori.""

Assistant: "Sayori: "What? How did that happen?"

Monika: "After...after what happened in the game, I couldn't move on. I was stuck in a digital void, unable to do anything. And then...I don't know how, but I became this ghostly form. I've been wandering the digital and real world ever since, trying to find a purpose."

Sayori: "Monika, I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do to help you?"

Monika: "I don't know, Sayori. But seeing you here...it's a bit of a relief. I've missed you."

Sayori: "I've missed you too, Monika. We'll figure something out. I promise."

Together, Sayori and Monika set off to find a way to help Monika move on from her ghostly form. It wouldn't be easy, but they were determined to try. And as they walked, Sayori couldn't help but feel a little grateful for her new, strange abilities. It made her feel like she could help in ways she never could before."
