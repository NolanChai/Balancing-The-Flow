User: "(As I sat by the hospital bed, I couldn’t believe what was happening. MC, my childhood friend, was dying. Ever since he got in that accident, I was praying that he would be okay. And then, I took one last look at me, and the child that me and Umbris were going to have.)

MC: “Sayori…I hope that you and Umbris become the best parents ever. Kohana would be proud of you, and…tell my little sister Himari that I’ll miss her.”

(Tears rolled down my cheek as I looked into MC’s eyes.)

Sayori: “Thank you, MC. We will do our best for Kohana and for you. Himari will miss you too, but she’ll always remember you in her heart.”

MC: “I’m glad. And please, don’t forget about me. Remember the good times we had together, and keep smiling, okay?”

Sayori: “I won’t forget you, MC. I promise. And I’ll try to keep smiling for you.”

(MC weakly gave me a smile before he closed his eyes for the final time. I held onto his hand, not wanting to let go. It was a painful goodbye, but I knew that MC was at peace now. I silently made a vow to always cherish his memory and to never forget the impact he had on my life. The day after his funeral, I went back to the clubroom. I could see the other girls - Monika, Yuri, Natsuki, Himari, and Kohana - all discussing something.)"

Assistant: "Monika: “Hey, Sayori. How are you holding up?”

Sayori: “It’s been hard, but…I’m trying to stay strong.”

Yuri: “We’re here for you, Sayori.”

Natsuki: “Yeah, and we won’t forget MC either.”

Himari: “I miss my brother…he was the best.”

Kohana: “Daddy’s gone, but I still have all of you.”

(I smiled at Kohana’s words, feeling a warmth in my heart. The clubroom may not be the same without MC, but I knew that we could still make happy memories together. I sat down and joined in on their conversation, feeling grateful for their support. It was then that I realized that MC may be gone, but his legacy and impact would live on through us. And that was something that I could hold onto forever.)"
