User: "Electrical resistance is measured in ohms (Ω). The total resistance in a circuit that has three individual resistances x, y, and z is given by the formula R(x, y, z) = ( xyz / (yz + zx + xy )). Suppose at a given time x = 100 Ω, y = 200 Ω, and z = 300 Ω. Also, suppose x is increasing at a rate of 2 Ω/min, y is increasing at the rate of 1 Ω/min, and z does not change. Find the time rate of change of the total electrical resistance at this time."

Assistant: "To find the time rate of change of the total electrical resistance, we need to differentiate the formula for R with respect to time t.

Let R = R(x, y, z) = (xyz) / (yz + zx + xy)

We are given dx/dt = 2 (the rate of change of x), dy/dt = 1 (the rate of change of y), and dz/dt = 0 (z does not change).

Now, we differentiate R with respect to t using the Quotient Rule, which states that if Q(u, v) = u / v, then dQ/dt = (v(du/dt) - u(dv/dt)) / v^2.
In our case, u = xyz, v = yz + zx + xy, du/dt = (dx/dt)yz + x(dy/dt)z + xy(dz/dt), and dv/dt = (dy/dt)z + z(dx/dt) + x(dy/dt).

For x = 100, y = 200, and z = 300, we have:


du/dt = (2)(200)(300) + (100)(1)(300) + (100)(200)(0) = 60000 + 30000 = 90000

dv/dt = (1)(300) + (300)(2) + (100)(1) = 300 + 600 + 100 = 1000

Now, we can find dR/dt:

dR/dt = ((yz + zx + xy)(90000) - (xyz)(1000)) / (yz + zx + xy)^2

dR/dt = ((200)(300) + (100)(300) + (100)(200))(90000) - (100)(200)(300)(1000)) / ((200)(300) + (100)(300) + (100)(200))^2

dR/dt = (100000)(90000 - 6000000) / (100000)^2

dR/dt = (-540000000) / 100000000

dR/dt = -5.4

Thus, the time rate of change of the total electrical resistance at this time is -5.4 Ω/min."
