User: "Think a title for One month later, Charles emerged victorious as the champion of the G City Invitational Tournament. On the day of his victory, the little wolf dog trended on social media for hours.

Unable to contain himself, William messaged Joseph on WeChat, "If Rose had taken part in the competition, she could have easily won." Joseph, in James' opinion, accused William of being a meddlesome mother-in-law. However, to his surprise, Joseph responded, "Why didn't she participate?"

"The Chess Institute leader said that she was not feeling well lately, so they replaced her. It's really too bad," William replied.

Joseph remained silent for a while, but William knew him well enough to understand his impatience. So he said nothing more on the matter.

August 10th was Rose's birthday, and Karen came by early in the morning to celebrate it with her. Rose wasn't sure how Karen knew the date, but she was happy to have their company.

The first stop was the supermarket near Rose's place to buy groceries. As they entered the lift from the underground garage, they bumped into William, who lived in the same neighbourhood as Karen. Rose remembered how he had been beaten up and felt sorry for him.

William observed Rose's distress and asked the little girl with a smile, "Is school out for you today?" Dressed in a T-shirt and jeans with a backpack, Rose looked no older than a high schooler with her black hair and snow-white skin. William had come off as an uncle next to her.

Several people still inside the lift gawked at Rose. Feeling awkward, she blushed and nodded in response to William's question.

William had been the only one to call Rose "a sweet and sticky little darling" all her life. She always felt embarrassed after he had said it. It wasn't until several years later that Joseph couldn't bear to hear it anymore and told William to stop it.

He ruffled her hair, smiling. "I live here too, in room 2903. If you get bored later, come on over. I won't be going out today."
Rose agreed with William and Karen's statement that they were her chess fans, and in her mind, they were both good people. However, Karen gave a cold stare when William placed his hand on top of Rose's head. Despite this, William continued to chat with Rose in a friendly manner until his floor arrived, telling her to come down if she didn't like her lunch and he would cook her favorite crab tofu. Karen, annoyed by William's actions, pulled Rose away and muttered about what he had to show off, but William teased her, saying, "What do you think, Auntie?" before finally exiting the elevator.

Karen seemed unaware of Rose's fear of conflict, which stemmed from her childhood experiences with Olivia and Mason's arguments. Karen, now wanting to teach Rose other aspects of life, led her to the entrance of her home to see her parents waiting. Rose was startled and nervous as they stared at her intently, but Karen assured her to relax and consider their home as her own. The group headed to the living room, where Xu's parents jokingly asked Rose if they could eat her.
Xu's mother's smile softened and she chuckled, "Oh, don't be silly. We wouldn't eat you! Come sit next to me, dear." She pulled Rose's hand and guided her to sit beside her, looking at her with almost scrutinizing eyes. "How old are you?" she asked.

Father Xu also stared at her intently, causing Rose to panic and look at Karen for guidance. "Rose can't speak," Karen explained. 

Father Xu sighed deeply, "I can't hear very well. Have you gone to get it checked?" 

Rose felt uncomfortable as the couple surrounded her, despite Xu's mother trying to appear friendly. As she tried to withdraw her hand, Xu's mother stuffed some fruit from the fruit bowl into it. "Here, have some," she offered.

Xu's father and mother looked at her strangely, and Rose felt small and uncomfortable. Karen then decided to intervene, sitting next to Rose and distracting the couple by turning on the TV. "What do you want to watch?" she asked.

Karen mentioned how she often talked about Rose to her parents, and how fond they were of her. Xu's mother chimed in, "We love to talk to kids. Don't be surprised!"

Karen chose a cartoon to watch, and Rose was reminded of how her brother didn't like her using her phone for anything other than making calls or sending messages. Despite this, she had installed WeChat to video chat with her brother, but didn't use it for anything else. She felt out of touch with the modern world, living a life that seemed incompatible with those around her. 

As a nineteen-year-old girl, Rose felt that she should have been curious about the world, but instead spent all her time playing chess, making Karen, a professor, feel ashamed of her own discipline.

Xu's father frowned at the TV screen, disapproving of Rose watching cartoons.
Father Xu inquired once more, "Have you attended school, Rose? And, how old are you?" He handed her a pen and paper to communicate. 

Rose found it difficult to focus with the tense atmosphere. She could sense Father Xu's disapproval in his tone when he remarked, "You're talented in Go, but education is equally important. Why not consider going to college?" 

When Father Xu questioned why she left the Mason family to go to Japan, Rose felt uneasy. She instinctively stood up to leave, but Xu Mama grabbed her arm and attempted to explain their intentions. Karen urged them to hold off, afraid of giving away too much information. 

Father Xu's frustration peaked as he yelled, "How long must we wait? Do you want to wait until I'm dead?" Rose was frightened by the outburst and quickly fled the scene, not even bothering to tie her shoelaces. 

Father Xu continued to rant, "She's an orphan with no foundation, she should be grateful to have been taken in." But Rose knew she wasn't an orphan. She had a family and a brother, but she couldn't risk revealing her true identity.
As she heard the door opening and closing again, Rose turned to see Karen hurrying after her. Her fear of Karen intensified, causing her to quickly step into the waiting elevator and press the "close" button. Her heart raced as she watched the floors descend.

Earlier, Karen had driven her to this vast neighborhood, leaving Rose disoriented and unsure of the way out. She feared Karen would eject her before she could reach the gate. Remembering William's apartment in the same building, she selected the 29th floor, despite her unease about Joseph. Somehow, being near William, who she believed was Joseph's subordinate, gave her some peace of mind.

As she rang the doorbell, Rose waited anxiously. Eventually, "

Assistant: "William opened the door, looking surprised but pleased to see her. "Hey there, sweet and sticky little darling. What brings you here?" he teased.

Rose explained what had happened at the Xu family's house, feeling ashamed of her need to escape. William listened sympathetically and invited her inside, offering her a glass of water.

As Rose sat down, she noticed a chessboard on William's table. "Do you play?" she asked.

"I know how to move the pieces, but definitely not at your level," William replied with a chuckle.

Rose smiled, feeling comfortable in William's presence. She realized that despite his teasing, he was genuinely caring and protective of her.

As she sipped on her water, she thought about her family and wondered how they were doing. She hadn't spoken to her brother in weeks, and she missed him terribly. She also felt guilty for keeping secrets from the Mason family, Karen, and even William.

William noticed her melancholy expression and asked, "What's on your mind?"

Rose hesitated for a moment before mustering the courage to speak, "William, can I trust you?"

William's smile faded as he regarded her seriously. "Of course, you can. You know that."

Rose took a deep breath before revealing her biggest secret yet, "My real name is Li Xiaocai. I'm not an orphan, and I have a family. But I'm not sure where they are, and I'm afraid of what might happen if anyone finds out."

William's expression softened as he listened, "I see. You do have a lot on your plate."

Rose nodded, feeling relieved to have finally shared her secret with someone. She didn't expect William to understand completely, but he surprised her by saying, "I understand the importance of keeping secrets. And I promise to keep yours safe, no matter what."

Rose felt grateful for William's understanding and support. For the first time in a while, she felt hopeful that she might find a way to reconcile her love for chess with her family and identity."
