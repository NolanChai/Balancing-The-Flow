User: "(In the clubroom…)

Monika: “Um…where’s Natsuki?”

Sayori: “Hmm… I’m not sure. She was here just a little while ago. Maybe she went to grab something to eat?”

Monika: “That could be. She does usually get hungry pretty quickly.”

Yuri: “Well, I hope she comes back soon. We were going to discuss some ideas for the next literature club event.”

Sayori: “Oh yeah, I’m excited to hear what everyone came up with!”

Monika: “Me too. It’s always interesting to see the creativity that goes into planning these events.”

(Meanwhile, at a hospital…)

Doctor: “I take it you’re here for an ultrasound, Natsuki?”

Natsuki: “Yeah, that’s right. I wanted to make sure everything’s alright with little Sakura. This is my fifth month now, so I’m kind of worried about her.”

Doctor: “I understand your concerns, Natsuki. But don’t worry, ultrasounds are a great tool to monitor the development of your baby and ensure everything is going smoothly. Please lie down here, and we’ll get started.”

Natsuki: (nervously lying down) “Okay, thank you, Doctor.”"

Assistant: "Doctor: "Alright, Natsuki. I'm going to apply some gel to your abdomen. It might be a little chilly, but it helps with the ultrasound. Ready?"

Natsuki: "Yeah, go ahead."

(The doctor applies the gel and starts to move the ultrasound wand on Natsuki's abdomen.)

Doctor: "Hmm... there she is. Little Sakura is growing nicely. You can see her little arms and legs."

Natsuki: (smiling) "Oh, that's such a relief to hear. Can you tell if she's healthy?"

Doctor: "Well, at this stage, it's a bit difficult to tell for sure, but everything looks normal so far. The ultrasound gives us a good image of her anatomy, and we can also check for any potential complications."

Natsuki: "That's good to know. I just want Sakura to be healthy and happy."

Doctor: "I understand, Natsuki. I'll take measurements of her size to track her growth, and we'll also listen to her heartbeat."

Natsuki: (listening intently) "I can't wait to hear her heartbeat."

(As the doctor moves the ultrasound wand, a rhythmic thumping sound fills the room.)

Doctor: "There it is, Natsuki. That's the sound of your baby's heartbeat. It's strong and steady."

Natsuki: (teary-eyed) "Thank you, doctor. That sound... it's the best thing I've ever heard."

Doctor: "I'm glad I could give you that reassurance, Natsuki. Remember, if you have any concerns or questions throughout your pregnancy, don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to support you."

Natsuki: "I will, thank you. And thanks for making me feel more at ease about everything."

Doctor: "Of course, Natsuki. Being a parent can feel overwhelming at times, but it's also a beautiful journey. Take care of yourself and little Sakura, alright?"

Natsuki: "I will. Thank you again, doctor."

(Back at the clubroom...)

Monika: "Ah, there she is! Welcome back, Natsuki. We were starting to wonder where you went."

Natsuki: (smiling) "Sorry for disappearing. I had something important to take care of."

Sayori: "Is everything alright? You look a bit teary-eyed."

Natsuki: (happily) "Everything's more than alright. I just had an ultrasound for Sakura. She's doing great, and I got to hear her heartbeat."

Yuri: "That's wonderful, Natsuki! Congratulations."

Monika: "I'm so happy for you, Natsuki. Becoming a mother is a beautiful experience."

Natsuki: "Thank you, guys. It means a lot. And I'm really excited to plan the next literature club event too."

Sayori: "We'll make it the best one yet, Natsuki. We're all here to support you."

(With newfound joy and support from her friends, Natsuki dives back into the literature club meeting, filled with excitement for both her baby and the upcoming event.)"
