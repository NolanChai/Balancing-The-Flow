Assistant: "This SQL query retrieves a distinct list of invoice items that meet the specified conditions, along with their associated deferred revenue and recognized revenue accounting codes. The query filters by various criteria, including the accounting code, subscription type, customer type, and date posted. The results are sorted in ascending order by object key (invoice item ID).

It is not possible to know what specific database system this query is intended for without more context. However, the syntax and structure suggest that it could be used in a standard SQL implementation such as MySQL or PostgreSQL."
