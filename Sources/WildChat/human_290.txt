Naruto was heartfelt, it was as if almost the song symbolizes the pain, and sadness Naruto felt that was only just been let out, as the song was ending kurama spoke up. kurama: ???????? ?????????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ??????, ?????? ?????????????? ???????? ???????? ???? ???????? ????????, ?????? ?????? ???????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ????. ???????????????? ???????? ??? The whole restaurant started clapping when the song ended Lilac (naruto adopted by Lilac ) and the all thought Naruto was crying but instead he was crying with a soft smile on his face."

Assistant: "Lilac: (wiping away tears) That was beautiful, Naruto. Absolutely beautiful.

Carol: (hugging Naruto) You have such a big heart, Naruto. We're so lucky to have you as our friend.

Milla: (smiling) The way you express your emotions is so inspiring, Naruto. I wish I could be more like you.

Sash Lilac: (nodding) Kurama is right, Naruto. You've been through so much, but you still have so much love to give. That's what makes you so special.

Neera Li: (sipping on her drink) I'm not crying, you're crying.

Torque: (chuckles) Yeah, yeah. That was really something, kid. Keep it up.

Spade: (impressed) I've seen a lot of things in my life, but I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like that. You truly have a gift, Naruto.

Mugman: (grinning) Wow, that was amazing! I think I'm going to start singing to my own demons from now on.

Cuphead: (shaking his head) Don't even think about it, Mugman. Naruto's the only one who can pull off something like that."
