User: "(I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop. I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.)

Yuri: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this. I-I-It’s about MC.”

(My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl. Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.)

Sayori: “I can’t believe this! MC has been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too! How could he do this to me?”

Monika: “Sayori, calm down. We don’t know for sure that he’s cheating. Maybe they’re just friends.”

Yuri: “But the picture seems to suggest otherwise. And that girl’s belly…she’s definitely pregnant.”

Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?”

(Just then, MC enters the room.)

MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?”

(Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.)

Sayori: “How could you, MC?”

MC: “What do you mean?”

(Sayori thrusts the picture in MC’s face, tears starting to fall from her eyes.)

Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!”

MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.”

(Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.)

Sayori: “Your cousin?”

MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.”

(Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.)

Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions. I just saw the picture and…”

MC: “It’s alright, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.”

(Yuri and Monika both look relieved, and the tension in the room eases.)

Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?”

(Everyone nods, and we all move on from the misunderstanding. A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.)

Emily: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.”

MC: “No problem, Emily. We just wanted to see how you and the baby are doing.”

Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily. And congratulations on becoming a mother.”

Emily: “Thank you, Yuri. It’s been quite the journey.”

Sayori: “I’m sorry again for jumping to the wrong conclusion about you, Emily. I didn’t mean to make things awkward.”

Emily: “Don’t worry about it, Sayori. I understand why you were upset. But I promise you, MC has been nothing but a supportive cousin to me throughout this whole pregnancy.”

Monika: “Well, now that everything’s cleared up, let’s celebrate the new addition to the family!”

(We all cheer and bring out a cake to celebrate Emily’s soon-to-be-born baby. It was a warm and joyous occasion, and we all felt grateful to have each other in our lives. But just moments before we were supposed to leave, Emily and I started to feel pain in our bellies - labor pains at that.)

Emily: “Oh no, it looks like it’s time. I’m about to give birth.”

Natsuki: “And me too, I think. I wasn’t supposed to give birth for another week.”

(MC rushes to help Emily, while Yuri and Monika help me.)

MC: “Don’t worry, Emily. We’ll get you to the hospital.”

Yuri: “And we’ll do the same for Natsuki.”

Monika: “Let’s hurry, we don’t want to waste any time.”

(Without another word, both me and Emily were rushed into the car. Emily was in the back seat, while I was in the trunk. But just before we could reach the hospital in time, my labor pains were getting stronger by the minute - and I knew I had to push in order for Sayori’s dream of motherhood to come true.)"

Assistant: "Natsuki: “Oh no, I can’t wait any longer!”

Monika: “Hold on, Natsuki. We’ll do our best to help you.”

Yuri: “We don’t have any medical supplies, but we’ll use our shirts to help deliver the baby.”

(Suddenly, with a push, I gave birth to a baby girl. Yuri carefully wrapped her up in a shirt and handed her to me. I couldn’t believe it - I was a mother now too.)

Natsuki: “She’s beautiful...”

Monika: “Congratulations, Natsuki. You did it.”

(Yuri helped me clean up, and we quickly made our way back to the hospital. Emily had also given birth to a beautiful baby boy. After a few hours of rest, we all went back to the clubroom - with our newborns in tow.)

Sayori: “Oh my gosh, they’re so cute! Look how tiny they are!”

MC: “I know, right? I can’t believe they’re finally here.”

Emily: “Thank you all for helping me deliver my baby.”

Natsuki: “And thank you for being there for me too.”

Yuri: “It’s moments like these that make us appreciate the miracle of life.”

Monika: “And it’s moments like these that make our bonds as a club even stronger.”

(As we all looked down at our newborns, we knew that our club would never be the same. We had become parents now, and that was a bond that would last a lifetime.)"
