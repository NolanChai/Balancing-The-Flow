Plot:

CJ receives a call from OG Big J, inviting him to a secret meeting to plan a big score that will require rival gangs to put aside their differences, and in turn, foster respect among the gangs. CJ drives to the El Corona safehouse where OG Big J briefs the team on the mission - a casino heist that will need cooperation from Razor-Ray of the Front Yard Ballas and Smoothskin of the Los Santos Vagos.

CJ and OG Big J buy into the concept of Respectful Men and reach out to the rival gang leaders rotating their respective territories. After a series of mini-games aimed at building mutual trust and respect, CJ convinces Razor-Ray and Smoothskin to join the heist.

Together, the four plan the heist in detail, establishing an entry and exit strategy, discussing weapon choices, and assigning roles. The team then organizes a dress rehearsal at the casino, ensuring all leaders understand their roles and practicing the Respectful Men code, which involves no killing, no disrespect, and self-control.

Once the preparations are complete, the team drives to the casino in a stolen van. CJ, along with the two rival gang leaders, sneak into the casino, avoiding security cameras and guards. They break into the vault, collecting the cash in a raging storm that causes the casino staff to panic, providing the perfect cover for their swift escape.

Returning to the El Corona safehouse, CJ and the gang leaders successfully split the money equally between them. With the mission complete, CJ gains a respect boost from all gangs involved, as the Respectful Men have managed to carry out their heist under the banner of loyalty, trust, and above all, respect. This respect boost paves the way for CJ to accomplish more missions in the future, uniting Los Santos' gangs against common foes."
