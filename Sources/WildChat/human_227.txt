User: "[this is told entirely from MC’s point of view:]

(In the clubroom…)

Monika: “Wait a minute…where’s Sayori?”

Natsuki: “I honestly don’t know.”

Yuri: “MC told me he rushed to the hospital. He also said something about ‘Sachiko’…no idea what that means.”

(Meanwhile, at the hospital…)

MC: “Sayori, are you alright?”

Sayori: “I’m fine, MC.” (putting a hand on her baby bump) “Sachiko’s doing fine, too.”

(I gently rest my hands on Sayori’s baby bump, eagerly awaiting the arrival of our daughter. I couldn’t believe my beloved wife was already full-term.)

MC: “I’m so relieved to hear that, Sayori. We’ve been through so much, I can’t believe our daughter will be with us soon.”

Sayori: “I know, MC. It feels like just yesterday we were joining the literature club together. And now, we’re starting a family. Oh!!”"

Assistant: "Sayori interrupts herself with a sudden gasp, clutching her stomach.

MC: "What's wrong, Sayori? Are you okay?"

Sayori: "I think... I think it's time, MC. Our baby is coming."

Panic sweeps over me as I quickly grab Sayori's hand and rush out of the hospital room, searching for a nurse or a doctor. We navigate through the halls, my heart pounding with anticipation and fear.

Finally, we find a nurse who rushes us into a delivery room. Everything is a blur as doctors and nurses quickly surround Sayori, preparing her for the birth of our child.

MC: "Stay strong, Sayori. I'm right here with you, every step of the way."

Sayori manages a weak smile before the pain intensifies, and she starts pushing. Time seems to slow down as I watch the diligent medical team working to bring our daughter into the world.

And then, after what feels like an eternity, I hear the cries of a baby. The sound brings tears to my eyes as I turn to look at the small and precious life we have created.

Doctor: "Congratulations, it's a beautiful baby girl!"

Sayori and I exchange tearful glances, overwhelmed with joy and relief. The doctor carefully places our daughter in Sayori's arms, and she smiles down at our miracle.

MC: (whispering) "She's perfect, just like her mother."

Sayori gently cradles our daughter, her eyes filled with an indescribable love. In that moment, it feels like the entire world fades away, leaving only the three of us.

MC: (whispering) "We did it, Sayori. We're parents."

Sayori: (teary-eyed) "We certainly are, MC. And we're going to be the best parents for our little Sachiko."

As we bask in the overwhelming happiness and love that fills the room, I can't help but feel incredibly grateful. Grateful for Sayori's strength, for the arrival of our precious daughter, and most of all, for the incredible journey that led us to this moment."
