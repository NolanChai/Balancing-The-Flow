User: "(In the clubroom…)

Monika: “Wait a minute…where’s Yuri?”

Sayori: “I honestly haven’t seen her in a while. I honestly miss rubbing her belly and feeling Violet’s little kicks.”

Natsuki: “Me too. I’ll give her a call.”

(Natsuki pulls out her phone and dials Yuri’s number.)

Natsuki: (waiting for a response) “Huh…it’s going straight to voicemail. That’s strange.”

Monika: “Maybe she’s just busy or her phone’s off. But usually, she lets us know if she’s going to be late or if something’s come up.”

Sayori: (concerned) “Yeah, Yuri is usually very punctual and reliable. I hope everything is alright.”

Natsuki: (trying again) “Let me try again. Maybe she missed the call.”

(Natsuki dials Yuri’s number once more, but it still goes to voicemail.)

Natsuki: “Okay, this is getting weird. Yuri NEVER ignores our calls.”

Monika: “Maybe we should go check her house. I know it’s a bit intrusive, but if she’s not answering and we’re getting worried, it might be worth it.”

Sayori: “I agree. We need to make sure she’s okay. Let’s go together.”

(The three girls head out of the clubroom and make their way to Yuri’s house.)

(At Yuri’s house…)

Monika: (knocking on the door) “Yuri? It’s Monika, Sayori, and Natsuki. Are you home?”

(They wait for a moment, but there’s no response.)

Natsuki: (concerned) “What if something happened? Should we try opening the door?”

Monika: “Let’s give it a try. If she’s in trouble or something’s wrong, it’ll be better to find out now.”

(Sayori tries the doorknob, and to their surprise, it opens.)

Sayori: (worried) “Yuri? Are you here?”

(They cautiously enter Yuri’s house, calling out her name as they explore each room. Finally, they reach Yuri’s bedroom.)

Natsuki: (noticing the pain on Yuri’s face) “Oh my god, Yuri!”"

Assistant: "Sayori: (rushing to Yuri's side) "She's unconscious! We need to call an ambulance!"

Monika: (pulling out her phone and dialing emergency services) "Stay with her, Sayori. We need help right away."

Natsuki: (searching the room) "What could have happened to her? Everything looks normal."

Sayori: (holding Yuri's hand and speaking softly) "Hang in there, Yuri. We're here for you."

(Moments later, the ambulance arrives and paramedics rush into Yuri's bedroom.)

Paramedic: "What seems to be the problem?"

Monika: "We found our friend unconscious in her room. We have no idea what happened."

Paramedic: (assessing Yuri's vitals) "We'll do our best to stabilize her. Can you provide any additional information? Did she mention any symptoms or issues recently?"

Natsuki: "No, nothing out of the ordinary. Yuri has always been quiet about her personal life."

(Sayori and Monika exchange worried glances as the paramedics continue to work on Yuri.)

Paramedic: "We're going to take her to the hospital for further evaluation. You can ride with us if you'd like."

Sayori: (nodding) "Yes, please. We want to be there for her."

Monika: "We'll meet you at the hospital, Yuri. You're not alone."

(As the ambulance drives away, the three girls hurry to gather their belongings and follow Yuri to the hospital. An overwhelming sense of concern and uncertainty fills their hearts as they pray for their friend's well-being.)"
