If you have the following data about a bag of chocolate chips, about how many chocolate chips are estimated to be in the bag?
Mass of Chocolate Chips + Bag = 2041 grams
Mass of 100 Chocolate Chips = 31 grams Mass of Bag ONLY = 67 grams
How many chocolate chips are in the bag?
Round your answer by using significant figures."

Assistant: "To find out the number of chocolate chips in the bag, you can subtract the mass of the bag only from the mass of chocolate chips plus the bag. 

Mass of chocolate chips = Mass of chocolate chips + bag - Mass of bag only

Mass of chocolate chips = 2041 g - 67 g
Mass of chocolate chips = 1974 g

Now, divide the mass of chocolate chips by the mass of 100 chocolate chips to find the approximate number of chocolate chips in the bag.

Number of chocolate chips = Mass of chocolate chips / Mass of 100 chocolate chips

Number of chocolate chips = 1974 g / 31 g

Number of chocolate chips ≈ 63.7419

When rounding using significant figures, the answer should be rounded to three significant figures because the least number of significant figures in the given data is three.

Therefore, the approximate number of chocolate chips in the bag is 63.7."

If you have the following data about a box of crackers, about how many crackers are estimated to be in the box?
Mass of Crackers + Box = 924 grams Mass of 27 Crackers = 24 grams Mass of Box ONLY = 328 grams
How many crackers are in the box?
Round your answer by using significant figures."

Assistant: "To find out the number of crackers in the box, you can subtract the mass of the box only from the mass of crackers plus the box. 

Mass of crackers = Mass of crackers + box - Mass of box only

Mass of crackers = 924 g - 328 g
Mass of crackers = 596 g

Now, divide the mass of crackers by the mass of 27 crackers to find the approximate number of crackers in the box.

Number of crackers = Mass of crackers / Mass of 27 crackers

Number of crackers = 596 g / 24 g

Number of crackers ≈ 24.8333

When rounding using significant figures, the answer should be rounded to three significant figures because the least number of significant figures in the given data is three.

Therefore, the approximate number of crackers in the box is 24.8."
