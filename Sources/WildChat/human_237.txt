After navigating the museum exhibits, Lilac encounters Kakugan and instantly recognizes it as the robot that had destroyed her treehouse earlier. Carol remarks to join up and help, though Lilac refuses stating the fight to be personal and requiring a more "delicate touch". Upon destroying the robot, it's pilot is revealed to be a small tarsier whom Lilac berates for destroying her home. The primate rambles about the hard work put into the robot before he faints. Baffled about what transpired, Lilac contacts Neera to tell her that the culprit was "incapacitated". However, Neera exclaims that the thief was getting away with Pangu on an airship, much to Lilac's shock, and demands her to head to the seaport to intercept. Meanwhile, the tarsier, who had faked being unconscious, reappears on a platform from the wreckage before calling Lilac out for falling for the ruse. He soon flies away as Lilac gives chase.

After invading the airships and boarding the Sigwada, Lilac soon finds the deactivated Pangu in the main hull. She is soon intercepted by the ship's captain, Corazon, who claims that the AI came from Parusa and that they were taking it back. Refusing to leave, Lilac soon engages with the captain atop the ship. After successfully beating her back, Corazon comments on the top before the rest of the team arrives, with Neera accusing her of being the mastermind of the theft and Milla curious as to why the captain looked familiar. Carol was the last to arrive on the scene and seems to recognize the captain calling her Cory, who also seems to recognize Carol."

Assistant: "Both Lilac and Carol are taken aback by the familiarity between Carol and the ship's captain, Corazon. They begin to question their connection and what it means for their mission. Corazon, however, remains silent, refusing to provide any answers.

As the confusion settles, Neera takes charge and instructs the team to apprehend Corazon and retrieve Pangu. The group engages in a fierce battle, utilizing their unique abilities and skills to overpower Corazon and her crew. Despite her best efforts, Corazon is eventually defeated, and the team regains control of Pangu.

With the mission seemingly successful, Lilac demands Corazon to reveal what she knows about Carol's past. Corazon, now defeated and vulnerable, reluctantly confesses that she used to be a member of a bandit group that roamed Avocet Heights, a lawless region on the outskirts of Parusa.

Carol, shocked and emotional, recalls fragments of her past, memories that she had long forgotten. She realizes that Corazon was a fellow bandit and someone she trusted before her time as a member of the group was erased from her mind. Carol confronts Corazon, demanding to know why her memories were taken and what happened during her time as a bandit.

Corazon explains that their bandit group had encountered an ancient artifact during a robbery named "The Amnesiac", capable of erasing memories. The group, including Carol, willingly underwent a procedure to erase their memories, believing it would allow them to start anew without their thieving past haunting them. However, Corazon reveals that she had betrayed the group soon after, taking the Amnesiac for herself and leaving the others without their memories.

Filled with anger and resentment, Carol lashes out at Corazon, blaming her for the loss of her past and the pain she had caused. Lilac and the others intervene, calming Carol down and reminding her of their current mission and the danger Merga poses.

Corazon, realizing the severity of her actions, expresses remorse and offers her assistance in taking down Merga as a way to make amends. Divided between forgiveness and revenge, Carol reluctantly agrees, recognizing that it is in their best interest to work together to protect Avalice.

With Corazon now on their side, Lilac, Carol, Milla, Neera, and the Naruto characters set forth on their next mission – to stop Merga and bring peace back to Planet Avalice. Along the way, they will face challenges, uncover secrets, and strengthen their bonds, all while battling against the looming threat of Merga's wrath.
