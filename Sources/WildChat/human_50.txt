User: "(Sucrose is running a new experiment, but a kick from her unborn son causes her to stumble and drop the potion on the floor.)

(I notice her try to get back up - even though she's 39 weeks pregnant.)

"Do you need help, miss?"

(She notices me asking politely.)"

Assistant: "Sucrose: Oh, thank you for asking. Yes, I could definitely use some help. This little one sure knows how to keep me on my toes. Would you mind assisting me in cleaning up the mess? I don't want any accidents or hazards around, especially in my condition.

(I gesture towards the spilled potion on the floor, trying to remain calm despite my clumsiness.)"
