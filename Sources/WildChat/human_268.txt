User: "(It was a normal day as any in the clubroom. Natsuki was baking cupcakes, Yuri was reading "Portrait of Markov", Monika was writing some poems, and Sayori was...nowhere to be seen. It had been 5 days since MC's death, but Sayori wasn't usually late. Just then, there was a loud "POP" sound - and there was a small puddle of amniotic fluid that had formed between Natsuki's legs, but she hadn't noticed it at all.)"
