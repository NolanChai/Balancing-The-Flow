User: "(In a large cavern-like room, all the aeons are asleep. Just then, one of the aeons - Valefor - stars to feel sick.)

Valefor: (groggily waking up) “Ugh…I don’t feel so well…” (looking around her) “…everyone is still asleep?” (she looks towards Anima) “Even Anima?! She rarely even sleeps! Hmm…maybe I can wake up one of the others.”

(Valefor lets out an ear-splitting screech, but nobody wakes up - not even Anima. Confused, Valefor tries again - accidentally blasting one the Magnus Sisters - Mindy - out of the cavern.)

Valefor: “…oops. Sorry about that.”

Ifrit: (furiously waking up) “VALEFOR! WHAT IN SPIRA IS ALL THAT NOISE?!”

Valefor: (sheepishly) “Sorry Ifrit, I didn’t mean to wake you up, but I’m not feeling too well. I tried waking up the others, but no one seems to be responding.”

Ifrit: (grumbling) “Well, you certainly made your presence known with that screech. What’s the matter? Are you injured?”

Valefor: (coughing) “I don’t think so, it’s more of a…sickness. I feel weak and dizzy. I thought maybe one of you could help me.”

Ifrit: (sighs) “Fine, let me take a look.” (approaches Valefor, examining her wings)

Valefor: (wincing) “Careful, it’s quite tender.”

Ifrit: “…nothing seems to be infected.”

Valefor: (weakly) “That’s good to hear…what do you think could be causing this?”

Ifrit: “It’s hard to say without further examination. But I can sense a disturbance in the ambient energy here. It could be affecting your health.”

Valefor: “So, what should I do?”

Ifrit: “First, we need to wake up the others. We’ll need everyone’s expertise to figure out what’s going on. Can you try waking them up again?”

Valefor: “I’ll give it another shot.”

(Valefor lets out another loud screech, this time even louder than before. Still, none of the other aeons wake up - not even Anima.)

Ifrit: “Well, that didn’t work. We’ll have to try something different. Valefor, I need you to go and fetch Bahamut. His wisdom may be helpful in this situation.”

Valefor: “Alright, I’ll go find him and bring him back here as quickly as I can.”

(Valefor spreads her wings and flies off in search of Bahamut. Meanwhile, Ifrit begins inspecting the area, trying to locate the source of the disturbance.)

Ifrit: “There’s definitely something off about this place. The energy feels twisted and corrupted.”

(Valefor returns moments later, leading Bahamut into the cavern.)

Bahamut: “What is the meaning of this, Valefor? Why have you disturbed our slumber?”

Valefor: “I apologize, Bahamut, but I’m not feeling well. I think there’s something wrong with the ambient energy here. Ifrit sensed a disturbance.”

Bahamut: “Hmm, interesting. Allow me to examine the area.”

(Bahamut closes his eyes and spreads his wings, channeling his ancient power. He slowly circles the cavern, analyzing the energy.)

Bahamut: “Yeah, uh, I’m not seeing anything external…”

Ifrit: “Could it be some sort of internal affliction? A sickness that affects only Valefor?”

Valefor: “I’m not sure.”

Bahamut: “…the air is fine, too. Something else must be causing this.”

(Just then, Mindy’s cries can be heard outside the cavern.)

Valefor: (sighs) “I’ll check on her.”

(Valefor rushes outside to find Mindy, who has crash-landed a few meters away from the cavern entrance - she was crying non-stop.)"

Assistant: "Valefor: Mindy, are you alright? What happened?

Mindy: (sniffles) I don't know, Valefor! I was just flying, and suddenly I lost control, and... and...

Valefor: It's okay, Mindy. We'll figure out what happened. Let's get you back inside, and then we can all discuss what's going on.

(Valefor helps Mindy back inside the cavern, where Ifrit and Bahamut are waiting.)

Ifrit: Mindy, what happened out there?

Mindy: I'm not sure, Ifrit. I was flying around, and then I just... crashed. I couldn't control myself.

Bahamut: (deep in thought) It seems like whatever is affecting Valefor might be spreading to the rest of us. We need to find a solution quickly.

Valefor: I agree. Whatever is causing this, it's only getting worse. We can't just ignore it.

Ifrit: I'll take another look at the area. Maybe I missed something. Valefor, you should rest and conserve your energy. We'll need it if we're going to solve this.

Valefor: Alright, Ifrit. Just... be careful out there.

(Ifrit leaves the cavern to search for any signs of the disturbance, while Valefor rests and tries to regain her strength. Meanwhile, Bahamut gathers the other aeons in the cavern and briefs them on the situation.)

Bahamut: It seems that something is affecting our health and abilities. We need to work together to find the source and neutralize it.

Anima: (in a low, raspy voice) You have my support, Bahamut. I will use my power to assist however I can.

Sandy: We're with you too, Bahamut. We won't let anything harm our family.

Valefor: (weakly) Thank you, everyone. I'm sorry for causing the disturbance. I just want to get back to full strength and help find a solution.

(Bahamut reassures Valefor and the others, and they begin discussing their theories and possible courses of action. They know that time is of the essence, and they must find a way to restore their health and protect the aeon realm.)"
