Title: CNN's Dr

Beginning: (CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere.","
[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Alice-red)](https://github.com/AliceBot2018)","(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. ""Marijuana...?"" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, ""I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing."" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, ""You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering."" I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to ""turn around."" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first ""Weed"" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in ""Weed 3,"" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When ""Weed 2: Cannabis Madness"" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. ""This time will be different,"" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn't take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot .",success,3.61

Title: Child has amassed thousands of Twitter followers with 'gang life' photos

Beginning: He looks barely teenage.","
In response to the article, I think that it is not good for a child (younger than 18) to post pictures and videos of themselves in such manner. It is one thing if they are an adult, but when they're still a minor, then there are some issues of privacy and safety that need to be taken into account.

### Explanation:

While I do believe it is wrong for children (younger than 18) to post pictures and videos of themselves in such manner, there should be some exceptions to this rule. For instance, if the child has a very good reason that they are posting these kinds of images on social media then I think it would be alright as long as their parents approve of them doing so. However, even with parental approval there can still be issues because sometimes children don't know what is right or wrong until they are older and wiser themselves.
","He looks barely teenage. But this child has amassed thousands of Twitter followers with his pictorial updates of 'gang life'. The baby-faced boy from Memphis, Tennessee, poses with guns, cash, and bags of what looks like marijuana. Scroll down for video . Baby-faced: This little boy has amassed more than 3,000 followers on Twitter with pictures like these . In many pictures he is smoking suspicious substances, with captions such as 'High Life' Backlash: The boy, from Memphis, has prompted a wave of critics calling his stunts 'sad' In one video he laughs and points the gun at the camera in an apparent attempt to look menacing - as adults laugh in the background. In others, he is pictured blowing smoke, with the caption: 'High Life'. Tweets include the phrases, 'I need a bad b****', 'f*** da police', and 'gang sh** n****'. Some feature sexual references, such as: 'quit suckin my d***'. As he is a minor, DailyMail.com will not identify the little boy. The child's tweets have prompted backlash from other Twitter users and members of the community. One woman tweeted him: 'you need help i feel so bad for you your parents should be ashamed please get help and a education this is sad and disappointing.' Another Twitter user said: 'You poor baby. Just stop it & go to school.' Adults around: Many of his pictures and videos are taken with adults who are seen laughing, unfazed . Guns: The little boy, who appears to be barely teenage, regularly poses for his followers with guns . The boy hit back at his critics claiming he has had a tough year and the backlash is 'stressing out' his mother . Orrden Williams, a Memphis resident who has been the victim of gang violence, told AOL.com: 'What he's doing on here is something that he's going to bring upon society one day. It's just inevitable.' He added: 'All it takes is the right influence, and all this can change. So that's a wake-up Memphis call right there.' Hitting back at critics, the boy tweeted on Friday: 'Wish some people would mind dey own business' as 'it's stressing my mama out'. He adds that his sister has 'been locked up for two years' and his critics 'don't know the half of what we been through end of 2014 & beg of 2015.' Authorities are increasingly cognizant of Twitter as a means of perpetuating gang culture. While many like this young boy use it as a forum to flaunt their drugs and guns, around 50 per cent of organized gangs maintain in the United States maintain a social media profile.",success,15.35

Title: The presidential hopeful held a town hall meeting in Kenilworth on Tuesday

Beginning: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn't looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting.

Christie, who is running for the Republican nomination for President of the United States in 2016, held the event at Kenilworth High School on Tuesday evening to answer questions from voters about his plans if elected as president next year.

However, he was confronted by a teacher named John Pascucci who told Christie that he had ""messed up"" when it came to education and accused him of not doing enough to help teachers in the state.
","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wasn't looking too presidential Tuesday night when he got into a heated debate with a veteran teacher at a town hall meeting. And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling him out for his 'bullying' behavior. 'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. 'It's the one thing that never seems to change.' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued. 'I wanna know how you know that. Because you're a teacher, and you're standing in front of students every day, conveying to them, facts - things that they need to learn. So I would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long, court case, that you have enough detail to know.' Mooney explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting 'to be bullied'. 'You're not being bullied, because you're asking me a question, I'm going to ask you questions back,' Christie says, as he continues to dodge the issue. 'He said, ""I'm not bullying you' as he bullied her,""' Wollmer said of the exchange. Perhaps the reason why Wollmer and his union responded sharply to Christie's town hall meeting Tuesday night, is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system. 'The fact is your union, over the course of time, has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford,' Christie said Tuesday.",success,12.93
