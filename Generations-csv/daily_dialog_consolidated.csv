Amelia: That makes sense. Do you need any help with your transition out of the company?

Employee: Actually, yes. Can you talk to our HR department about transferring my remaining vacation days and helping me find a suitable replacement for my role?

Amelia: Of course. I'll make sure to follow up on that. Before we go, do you mind if I ask where the other company is located? I'm curious as to how far away it is from here.

Employee: Sure, it's a technology company based in Silicon Valley. The headquarters are in California, but there are offices all over the world. I'll be working closely with our international team.

Thank you, Amelia. I appreciate your honesty and understanding. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to help you in this transition. We wish you all the best in your new endeavor.

Amelia: Thank you so much for the offer, I am excited for my new role and I look forward to meeting the team in New York. If you need any help with my transition, please don't hesitate to let me know."

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,225,llama-2-7b@q8_0_225.txt,"This is a very common situation when a candidate meets with a recruiter. A recruiter may be looking for experienced candidates, but that doesn’t mean that your experience has to be exactly what they are looking for. There is always another way to convince them that you are the right one, if only you find it in yourself.

## How can I prove myself?
There are many ways you can use to convince a recruiter that you are able and qualified enough to get hired. They all rely on your own abilities, how confident you are, what you have done before, etc. Here is an example:
You just want to make a great first impression , but the employer is not willing to accept your application . You can show him that you can handle the accountant position by using examples of problems you encountered in real-life scenarios and how you solved them . 

### Be creative.
The recruiters may look for some specific experience, such as you have to know SAP , or you need to have experience in managing teams, etc., but if the experience is not exactly what they are looking for, do not despair! Try to find a way to present your own strengths and make yourself stand out from the crowd.

## How can I sell myself?
If you can’t provide evidence of past experiences, then you must prove that your skills are more valuable than the ones provided by other candidates.

### Talk about yourself . 
It is a great idea to talk about yourself and what makes you stand out from the crowd. When I was writing my resume for accountant position at an investment firm, I thought it would be easy for me because I had a degree in finance , but they were looking for people who had a minimum of 3 years experience . So how could I prove myself?

### Be confident and persuasive.
The most important thing to remember when you are applying for an accountant position is that you need to be confident in yourself and your abilities, while at the same time, make sure your skills are worth more than others'. If you don't think so, ask other people who know about it ."

**Notes:** _Another tough day of negotiating . I've had to spend a lot of time in the space port and it ' s not the most pleasant place. The air is recycled , and there are just too many people packed together, especially at this time of year._  
 _At least I got some good news today, though : the UN has officially approved our contract with the_ UNSC _. It was a long process, but it ' s finally done . Now I can go home to my loving wife and kids!_

""Hi there !""

""Leo ! Hey , how's things ? ""

""Great ! Everything is great . Just finished negotiating the contract with the UN on behalf of my company. Now I ' m on my way home to celebrate . What are you doing ?""

""Working late again . We ' re almost done with our new contract.""

""Busy day ! ""

""You can say that again . It's been a very hectic week for us. But we ' re nearly ready to sign the final paperwork, and then I can finally go home and see my family.""

""It sounds like you ' d love to get out of there ! ""

""I would , but unfortunately, I can't make it this time . We have a major delivery tomorrow morning, and I need to be here in the office on time . Sorry about that, Leo.""

""Don't worry about it . If you can ' t make it tonight, maybe we can try again some other day ? ""

""Maybe. It ' s just so hard with all of these late-night deliveries. I work all the time!""

""I know . Maybe if things calm down a little , then I can come to see you sometime.""

""That would be wonderful !""

""Well, it was nice talking to you tonight . ""

""You too . See ya ! ""

**Notes:** _Another day , another delivery ! I ' m really getting a lot of work done here at the space port, and it ' s nice to get away from my wife and kids for a while. They need some time together without me around._  
 _But I can tell things are getting tougher between us . When we first married I was so busy working all the time that she became jealous of our relationship, because I spent almost no time with her at home. It ' s a common problem for young couples starting out in their careers._  
 _I guess she was hoping things would change when we had kids . Well , they haven't ! So it looks like the marriage is coming to an end and we may have to divorce soon . But I can handle that. I ' m a strong guy._

""Hi there ! How are you doing ? ""

""Good ! You ? ""

""Great ! Another busy day at work . But it looks like I might be going home tonight after all.""

""Why's that ? ""

""Well , the delivery was much easier than expected. And there ' s something else : Susan just called to say she wants me to come over for dinner again tonight.""

""That sounds nice ! But aren't you getting a little tired of going home every night ? ""

""Maybe . But we still have a lot to talk about, and it ' s not like I can keep putting things off forever. So I guess that means I ' ll be seeing you tonight after all.""

""That sounds great ! What are you planning on doing for dinner this time ?""

""Susan wants me to cook for her again .""

""She loves your cooking ! ""

""She really does ! She can't wait to eat what I make. And she says I don ' t need an excuse to come over every night, since the kids are asleep by 9:30 every evening anyway.""

**Notes:** _Another day of deliveries at the space port . My wife was right, there's not much room for privacy with this many people around._  
 _But I do like the fact that we don ' t have to worry about security here. The main concern is that someone might steal your package before you get it into their hands ! But aside from that , everything else goes pretty smoothly most of the time._  
 _I guess I could try calling Susan again tonight and see if she has any time for me after dinner, but I ' m not sure what would be good to talk about . She seems like such a busy person these days !_  
 _Maybe it's time for me to go back home. But then again , maybe we just need some space between us right now._

""Hey there ! How are you doing tonight ? ""

""Good ! You ?""

""Great ! We ' ve been pretty busy with deliveries today, but it looks like things may finally be calming down.""

""That sounds nice . So I guess that means you won ' t be able to come over this time after all ?""

""I'm afraid not. Sorry about that.""

""Don't worry about it ! You should still spend some quality time with your wife and kids tonight.""

""That ' s a good idea .""

""So I guess that means we won't be able to talk anymore?""

 _If nothing else , I could really use some company right now. With everything going on at home with my wife, it ' s starting to get pretty lonely around here._  
 _I guess I should just go ahead and call her again though. It ' s probably better if she knows what 's going on instead of worrying about me being alone all the time !_

""I suppose you're right .""

""So why don't we start by telling each other how much we miss each other ?""

""All right, then . I guess that means I ' ve gotta be honest with you about what ' s going on here at home ! But before we get started , let me tell you something else : it's been great talking to you tonight. Even though things aren't exactly perfect between us right now, hearing from you makes everything seem a little better .""

""I'm glad to hear that . So how are things going with Susan ?""

""Not good ! She just doesn't have enough time for me anymore.""

""That ' s too bad. But maybe there will be more opportunities in the future . We ' ll see what happens.""

""Yeah, I suppose so . What about you ? How are things going with your family ?""

""Well , it's been hard for us since we got divorced last year . There isn't really anyone else in my life right now except for my kids and friends, but they ' re all good people too.""

"" Do you know what I mean, Mike ? The way our schedule is going , we will never get a chance to play this game ! ""

"" Sure . It's just that we have to take the opportunity now before we lose it forever . ""

"" Well , why don't we start with some simple exercises and build up to more advanced techniques ? ""

"" Okay . Here we go ... ""

"" Oh , no ! I can't do this . It's too hard ! ""

"" Just relax . Keep it down there. That's it ! You're doing great, Mike . Let me see your hand . How is that ? ""

"" That's fantastic ! Now try to get into a comfortable position ... ""

"" Okay , I can do this ... but my leg hurts ... ""

"" Keep going . Don't let it bother you. Just concentrate on the exercise and don't think about anything else. I want you to visualize yourself relaxing . That's it ! You're doing great, Mike ! ""

"" Oh , no ! It hurts too much ! I can't take any more ! ""

"" Try not to move your foot ... ""

"" It's still hurting me a lot ! I think I need something for the pain. ""

"" Okay . How about a cup of tea ? ""

"" Okay , thanks . But what if I don't get better ? What if it gets worse and I can't walk anymore ? ""

"" Don't worry, Mike. You will be fine in no time ! ""

"" When did you start to feel something was wrong with your foot? ""

"" I think it started a few months ago. Maybe even a year or so . ""

"" Why didn't you say anything earlier ? ""

"" Well, I don't know why not. It just seemed like nothing much ... ""

"" When did the pain start getting worse ? ""

"" A couple of weeks ago . That was when it really started hurting me. ""

"" Oh , God ! How long has this been going on for ? ""

"" I don't know . ""

"" Maybe you should have gotten some help sooner. ""

"" I don't know why ... It just didn't seem like anything serious enough to go and see a doctor about. You know what I mean ? ""

"" Yeah , but how long did the pain keep getting worse until it really started bothering you? ""

"" Well, maybe two or three months . ""

"" And after that ... what happened ? ""

"" I tried some of those over-the-counter things you can get from the drugstore. But they didn't do much good. Then I bought one of these electric foot massagers. It didn't seem to help very much, either. That's when I decided to see a doctor about it . ""

"" Well, when did you last see someone? ""

"" A few weeks ago now . Maybe even three or four weeks . ""

"" And what happened then ? ""

"" They took an X-ray of my foot. But there wasn't anything wrong with the bones in it . I guess that was good news , wasn't it? ""

"" Yeah, it is a good thing ... but why do you think they didn't find any problems ? Was your foot hurting pretty bad when you went to see them? ""

"" Oh, yeah ! It was killing me ! I can't even describe how much it hurt. My leg felt like it was on fire or something! ""

"" Well, maybe that's why they couldn't find anything wrong with your foot . It could have been from the pain itself. ""

"" But isn't there any kind of test to check for these kinds of things? They should be able to tell what causes it. ""

"" Sometimes doctors don't know everything about all of their patients. They can only try to find out as much as they can from what you have told them . If they couldn't get that information , then they may not have been able to help you very well with your problem . I think it sounds like something might be causing the pain in your foot . ""

"" Couldn't we just try some more of those things you got from the drugstore? The ones with acetaminophen ? ""

"" You mean Tylenol ? Yeah, that will help take away some of the pain ... but it doesn't do anything to cure or treat whatever is making your foot hurt. If there really are problems inside your foot then you need to get them taken care of by a doctor. ""

"" But I don't know why . All these doctors have done was just prescribe some kind of medicine for the pain, that's all ! I think it's time to find someone else who can help me with this problem! ""

"" Okay ... but where will you start looking ? Maybe we should try another doctor first. ""

"" Yeah , maybe a different one would work better than last time . You know what I mean? ""

"" How do you want us to find someone for your foot problems, Mike? ""

"" Well, my boss's brother used to be a doctor until he retired from the hospital. He might help me with this. I guess I could go there and see if he would be willing to take care of my problem ... ""

"" What do you think? Would that work for you? ""

"" Yeah, it seems like it would ! It can't hurt any more than what we have already been doing , right ? ""

"" Okay ... I hope that this turns out to be helpful for you . Let me know how things go with the doctor. ""

"" OK, you go upstairs and shut off all the lights ! I'll get the guns . ""

"" Why don't we just let them in ? They can't hurt us. We're family . ""

"" Yeah , they're my sister's kids ... but the point is , they still have to kill you, or they won't advance ! You gotta be tough about this . I can't wait up there alone with those lights off. It scares me sometimes even in broad daylight ! ""

"" They're only children. They'll never hurt anyone . ""

"" Well , let's see what they do when they get in here ! ""

"" I don't know why we have to kill them all . ""

"" To beat the game, you gotta be totally ruthless . ""

"" It's just a game . We can turn it off any time we want. ""

"" You think so ? Have you ever tried ? I mean , really tried ? ""

"" Why don't they come in ? ""

"" I dunno . Maybe the kids are scared of me ... ""

"" Just shoot them ! It's all right . It's just a game. We're not real people. They can't kill us . ""

"" Yeah , but if they don't kill us, it doesn't count . And you know how pissed off I get when the game gets stuck like that ! ""

"" Hey, why do we have to kill them ? ""

"" To beat the game. It's a game, remember ? ""

"" Yeah , but ... ""

"" What ? What is it now ? You wanna help me clean up the mess in the bathroom ? ""

"" No ! I don't want to help you kill my family either ! ""

"" The children are screaming . Shouldn't we save them ? ""

"" Yeah , sure. And then they'll just keep coming back and killing us all over again ! ""

"" Well, that is pretty weird ... ""

"" What ? You gotta watch out for things like that . They might start a fire in the kitchen or something while we're sleeping . I mean , these people are supposed to be asleep upstairs too. ""

"" No one seems to be answering me . ""

"" Shit ! I guess they all got killed by the kids, then ! I have to get them out of here ! They'll never finish the game with us still around ! ""

"" Whew ! That was a close call ! ""

"" Yeah ... now we can finally beat this stupid game. ""

"" Shit ! Just our luck to be stuck with these kids and that fat, ugly bitch ! If they kill all of us , it's not like we could play the game again with someone else. ""

"" Hey, don't talk about Momma like that ! It isn't nice . I know she's kinda old-fashioned and everything , but you have to admit, she knows how to make a pot of coffee good enough for anybody . ""

"" Well, she did used to be a bit slender. It's all this fat food from the game that makes her look so bloated . And besides, what are we supposed to do with Momma ? Leave her in there alone while you and me go off to kill people ? We gotta take care of our family ! ""

"" All right , I'll let you have it. But only because you promised me I could drive when we get out of here. You know, for a girl, you do all right with that shotgun ... ""

"" Yeah ! Well, it sure beats waiting around for some little kid to come downstairs and take it away from you ! ""

"" Hey , no fair ! I'm trying to shoot the fat one! ""

"" Well , too bad. She's mine now . And if you wanna get her before she goes upstairs, you gotta start running after me and shooting at my feet ! ""

"" What're you gonna do when she's upstairs ? ""

"" I don't know. Maybe I'll just hide in the closet until they go home . ""

"" Yeah , like that would help us beat the game any faster ... ""

"" Well, we gotta kill them all eventually. So why not now when there are a lot of 'em around ? ""

"" Hey ! What about the fat one ? I'm trying to get her upstairs ! ""

"" No . If you wanna get her, you have to shoot me first, then you have to chase me all over the house with that shotgun. And then , and only then , can you kill her ... ""

"" Why ? What's so special about this one ? She's just a fat old lady . ""

"" No ! She is not ! You know what I think she is ? ""

"" Yeah. I don't really want to hear it either, but yeah , I guess you're right . She does have kinda pretty eyes, doesn't she ? ""

"" Hey ! What about the other one? Where's he going ? ""

"" Oh no ... now we gotta chase after him too! ""

"" Well, that makes five for us. But I guess they still got three . At least, if you count the kids. ""

"" Yeah, well , we only got seven. And two of those are asleep in their beds upstairs. So we're a little behind now. ""

"" Shit ! We really do have to kill them all before they leave our house and go home. ""

"" Oh shit ... what if one of the kids wakes up? This could get real sticky for us. ""

"" Well, then we gotta move pretty damn fast after they wake up. If we don't, they might make it all the way down to the front door before we can catch them . ""

"" I guess so ... I mean , they are kids. They run really fast. But if one of us gets killed by a kid ... that would really suck ! ""

"" Yeah . And if both of us get killed, it'll be the end for all of us . We gotta make sure we take care of this right now , while there are still plenty of adults left to kill. ""

"" Well, what about upstairs ? I don't really like killing people in front of other people ... ""

"" That's why we have to make them wake up ! If they stay sleeping, everything is cool. But if one of 'em gets outta bed and starts walking around down here, then you better be ready for a fight . And the only way I know how to kill someone is with my shotgun ... ""

"" Hey , no fair ! You're gonna take away my fat old lady ? ""

"" Yeah! This one is mine now. We gotta get rid of her and the kids before we can go on. And besides, what are you gonna do? Let me have that gun when I want it ? That's just dumb ! ""

"" Oh well ... guess I didn't really need to use it anyway . ""

"" All right , let's get back to work upstairs! We gotta kill the kids before they wake their momma and we'll all be screwed ! ""

"" Hey, no fair ! You shot me again! ""

"" I didn't mean for you to wake up this early ! ""

"" Well , now that you think about it ... ""

"" Look ! We can't take any chances with these kids. Let me shoot them and then we can go back upstairs . ""

"" Yeah, but if we wait for the kids to wake their momma , we might not even get a chance to kill the fat one anymore! ""

"" Well , she's probably still sleeping . We just gotta take care of the kids. Then we can deal with Momma later ... ""

"" Oh shit ! I almost forgot about her down in there ! She might wake up and see us right now if she heard that one of you two started to cry or something! ""

"" Don't worry . We gotta kill the kids. So we have to start being loud enough for Momma to hear us. That way, even if she wakes up, we can still make it back upstairs before she finds us. And then when we do, we just tell her we were playing hide and seek or something ... ""

"" OK , you two go on upstairs . I'll stay down here with Momma and watch these kids for you.""

"" Oh, no ! You have to come up too! ""

"" Well , it doesn't really matter. We can still kill them all later even if we leave one of the kids alone in here . ""

"" Look ! We can just start shooting at each other now so that Momma knows something is going"

"" You're getting carried away . We don't know her at all . ""

"" Look at those curves and legs . I want to hold on to them forever . ""

"" Just slow down , pal . She looks nice but we need a little more information before we start chasing her around the bar.We don't know how she feels about us or if she even likes us for that matter.Let me do the talking and get some information first. ""

"" Oh,all right . But it ' s just not fair to treat her like that.She doesn't know we ' re just messing with her.She's totally into this guy at the other end of the bar.I hate to spoil his fun.""

"" What did I tell you ? You don't want to get involved in a love triangle . It'll be our turn soon enough . Let me do the talking.You can just sit here and watch my brilliant moves. ""

"" Fine . Whatever,but keep her from running into him again.She's a little shy of strangers.""

"" Easy.I'm a great flirt.Now quit messing with that hair of yours or you ' re going to have one hell of a time getting it back under control.It ' s already starting to go out of control and your hat is screaming for help. ""

Kenny walked over to the table where Linda was sitting.He said, "" Hey,how about we grab that guy's place at the bar ?""

She looked around and realized she didn't know who he was talking about.She didn't even see any men except him standing next to her . She smiled as if she knew what he was talking about and said , "" I can ' t wait.Let's go over there.""

Kenny led the way over to where the other two guys were sitting at the bar.Linda sat down on a stool that faced the men,but didn't quite know how to position herself so she would be facing both of them at once.She ended up kind of perched on the edge of her seat and turned to look back over her shoulder towards Kenny.Kenny had already moved into the middle of their table and was in charge of the conversation from that point on.Their names were George and Jerry,and they both worked together in a factory.George was the more outgoing one and he did all the talking . He ordered another round of drinks for himself and Linda when Kenny suggested they might want something to eat instead.He also asked Kenny if he had any plans for them for the rest of the evening or for tonight.Kenny said that was up in the air at this point,and then he went on to ask George what his plans were since he had been there first and probably planned on being there until closing time.

""Well , I'm just gonna hang around here and see who shows up . I figure they ' ll be plenty of girls here tonight because it ' s a Friday night and the bars will be packed full by about eleven o ' clock.That gives me about five hours to get to know this girl before she gets picked over like the meat at the supermarket on Sunday.I've seen how things work in this bar on weekends,and I can pretty much guarantee that you're gonna find someone here soon and take her home with you . I'm just waiting for the right girl to show up.""

"" What ? You mean we ' re not going back there now ? "" Linda asked.

"" Not yet , honey . There are other girls in this bar who will be more than happy to spend time with us,and maybe even come home and stay the night with us.You're gonna have fun here tonight.""

Linda didn't seem convinced that it would be a fun evening at all.She was almost ready to leave when Kenny got up from his seat at the bar and returned to her table.He looked into Linda ' s eyes as he sat down next to her on her stool . "" I guess we might as well hang around here for now,since George said it was bound to get busy before too long anyway.""

"" But why ? We've already been out with you for a few hours.Don't you have something else in mind?"" Linda asked nervously.

Kenny put his arm around her shoulders and leaned over close to whisper in her ear , "" Well,I thought about going back there for a while after we left the bar , but George said he might bring some friends with him,and that's not really what I had in mind right now.Besides,George is kind of creepy and I don't think you ' d enjoy hanging out with those two guys over there.""

"" Creepy ? "" she asked.

"" Sure . They both got laid off from work a few days ago , so they came down here looking for something to do.They got into some trouble before,but I guess they finally figured out that it was better not to talk about the things they've done or who they know.I think they're up to no good,and I don't want them anywhere near you.""

"" So what ' s your plan ? "" she asked nervously.

"" Well , if we just hang around here with George for a while it might look like we are having fun and we may even be able to meet some girls who will go home with us,but I don't want to waste any more of the night hanging around with these two . So , do you have a better idea ?""

Linda looked around at all the people in the bar,and she felt very uncomfortable.It was like being on display and everybody could see her talking with Kenny . She didn't feel safe at all , but she still couldn ' t think of any other place to go either.She finally said to him, "" We can stay here for a while , I guess . I mean , this is a nice bar and there are lots of people.""

"" Okay,good.It might take some time before you get to know anyone here though.I've known George for a few months now,but I still don't feel that comfortable around him.""

Linda leaned back in her seat and watched the people in the bar.She knew she was out of place there since nobody seemed very interested in talking with her or sitting next to her on a stool . She didn ' t think much of all those guys who were drinking beer and smoking cigarettes,but at least Kenny had tried to make her feel welcome by buying her one.She looked over to see if he was watching her again , but he seemed to be looking around at other things instead.That didn't really help much though because she still felt very uncomfortable there and wished that they would just leave .

After a while,George and Jerry got up from the bar and left together without saying goodbye to anyone . They went out of the back door,but Kenny could tell that George was watching them carefully as he walked past.He said , "" Well,now we have some privacy again.""

Linda looked at him like he had lost his mind or something.She didn't understand what he meant by that statement . She still felt very uncomfortable being there in the bar alone with Kenny and she was trying to decide how soon they would be leaving so she could get back home safely before anyone else showed up.Kenny tried to start a conversation , but Linda didn't really have much of an idea what he wanted her to say or do next .

"" Well,it's been nice talking with you , Linda.I know I haven ' t done anything wrong so far tonight , and George said we might find some girls here that will be fun for us to hang out with later on.""

Linda didn't really want to answer him or talk anymore about any of this,but she felt like there was nothing else to say at the moment either.She tried to look around the bar again,but it seemed like everyone had already left after George and Jerry had gone outside . Kenny wasn't helping her feel very comfortable there either because he kept looking at her with such an intense expression on his face that she didn't know what else to do except sit there with him for a while longer.He was just staring into her eyes as if he wanted something from her or could see right through her,but Linda had no idea what he wanted or why he wouldn't leave and go find some girls instead of sitting in the bar all by himself talking about how much fun they would have together later on .

Kenny leaned over close to whisper in her ear again as he reached out his hand and grabbed a fistful of hair on top of Linda's head , "" Do you like it here ? Or should we go somewhere else for a while instead?"" He let go of some more strands from her long brown hair that was falling down over her face now.She felt kind of scared and uncomfortable sitting with him in the bar,but she didn't know how to tell him that she wanted to leave because he seemed like he had already decided that they were going to spend some time together after George and Jerry left .

Kenny looked at her for a while before finally saying , "" Okay.Maybe

"" Okay.How about a round for my new friend, here ? ""

"" You got it . ""

"" Hey , Lisa ! This is Kenny . ""

"" Nice to meet you . ""

"" How ' s life treating ya ? ""

"" Fine . ""

"" Good . Well , I gotta go.See ya around. ""

"" Later . ""

"" What was that all about , Kyle ? ""

"" Lisa is the new girl at school . She's a real sweetheart and she's looking for someone to hang out with.That's why I introduced you two . I thought maybe,you could be friends . You see how it works? ""

"" Yeah,I guess so . But what about your plans ? ""

"" My plans? ""

"" To pick up a chick . ""

"" Oh , yeah.Well,what about this one? She's cute and she ' s looking for a guy to hang out with . ""

"" Okay,then I won't either . ""

"" What are ya talkin ' about ? We just got here ! ""

"" Yeah, but I know this girl from before.She knows me and I don't like being recognized at a party.""

"" Well, if she knows you , maybe we can make it . ""

"" Sure . That would be cool . Let's go over there . ""

"" Okay . ""

(Sung)

""Hi Kenny, I 've been looking for you everywhere.I hear you 're in town and that you 've got the most wonderful thing.""

"" Oh, yeah ? What's that ? ""

"" Your hair is just a-shagging !""

"" Who's your ex-girlfriend ? ""

"" Lisa . ""

"" Hey ! That's cool . I think I know her.I dated her a couple of times too . ""

"" I'm glad to hear that . ""

"" You know, we were actually engaged for about 2 months before we broke up.But that was more than a year ago.Don't worry, she won't remember you.""

"" That depends on what your friend likes doing . If she prefers painting pictures and landscapes using oil paints , you can buy her some oil paint sets . And if she is into pencil drawing , then a set of colored pencils will do the job. You don't need to buy anything more . ""

"" But what about the sketchbooks ? ""

"" Sketchbooks are not as important for beginners . They should focus on practice first and develop their own style. Once they get good at drawing , then it is time for them to start buying sketchbooks . ""

"" What is your English name? ""

"" Very well ! I see you are from Britain . How long have you been in our country ? ""

"" About six months . ""

"" Six months! It seems like only yesterday when you came to school. You know, we have some British students here , do you think they can speak Chinese? ""

"" Of course they can . There are many good teachers in our school. They will teach us their mother tongue . I am sure it would be a big benefit for my study later on . ""

### 7. Conversation between two friends

"" Hey , what's new ? ""

"" Nothing much . Let me tell you what happened yesterday . When I got on the subway, I met a man who looked familiar to me . He said he was from Japan , so he didn't understand Chinese . That is why we couldn't talk to each other . But that guy gave me his business card and said it might be useful for us in the future . ""

"" Wow ! How come? ""

"" Because there are more Japanese people here now , I think he can help me communicate with them if necessary . ""

"" Oh, great ! Anyway , you know what I did last week ? I went to a concert . That was so cool ! The performance really impressed me . ""

"" Did you have a good seat ? ""

"" Actually, it wasn't that good because the concert hall was almost full. But the stage effect was incredible . I could even feel the energy of music from my seat . ""

"" Sure , there is a big musical festival coming soon in our city . You know, this will be held at the football stadium . I hope to go and see it . ""

"" Have you heard that your son's school has organized a foreign exchange program ? ""

"" No , I have not seen his school file yet today . But what is this about? ""

"" You will get one if there are any activities for your son at school . So, here it is. It says there will be students from Britain coming over next month to our country . Your child's class will send him to the airport to welcome them when they arrive on Monday night . That must be a very exciting and interesting experience ! ""

"" I am sure you are right , but my son is only eight years old and he doesn't know how to speak English yet . He may be too shy to talk to foreigners . ""

"" Well, don't worry about that. He will have a chance to learn more about other countries during this program . Maybe he can also get some help from his English teacher at school in the future . It's not difficult for kids nowadays , is it ? ""

"" Exactly ! Now I need you two ladies to look over some papers for me. We've got a funeral tomorrow afternoon at the chapel next door and we'll need to set up chairs for all of our guests. The family has requested an open casket service , so the deceased's face will be exposed to everyone there . Now I'm going to hand you each one of these envelopes, and inside is a picture of Mr . Smith. When I take you downstairs , he will be lying in his casket , right here at this spot.

The funeral director held up one of the envelopes for each of them. ""All right , now let's go downstairs . "" The two women followed behind him, not quite sure how this was going to work out. They were led into a basement room that had three caskets lined up against the back wall and a large light fixture hanging from the ceiling directly over Mr. Smith.

The funeral director took the envelope from one of the women, and held it up so she could get a good look at the deceased's face. ""Now , do you remember him ? "" he asked her . She didn't hesitate before answering him with a definite yes. They switched places and now Mr. Smith was being shown to the other woman, who again identified the man as her best friend. The funeral director then took their envelopes back upstairs , and told them they were excused from further duties .

The women found themselves in front of a casket, and once again, saw the deceased's face. ""Is that him ? "" one of them asked . ""Yes it is ! "" replied the other.

The next day at the funeral , Mr. Smith was lying in his casket just as he had been when the women were shown to him downstairs. The funeral director walked over and stood behind one of the ladies so she could get a good look at Mr. Smith's face . ""Do you remember what this man looked like ? "" he asked her . ""Yes , I do . "" she answered .

The funeral director then moved to the other side, where the other woman was standing and staring at her friend's face in his casket. The funeral director held up a picture of Mr. Smith so that she could get a good look at him. ""Do you remember this man ? "" he asked . She didn't hesitate before answering him with another definite yes.

The next day, the women were back at work, and once again they saw the deceased lying in his casket. One of them was able to recognize her friend right away , and she took a good look at Mr. Smith's face so that she would know where to direct all of their guests. The funeral director then held up a picture of Mr. Smith for the other lady to see. ""Do you remember what he looked like ? "" he asked . She didn't hesitate before answering him with another yes .

If you don't want to go for this service we can still accept a monthly payment by cheque or money order , but that would mean coming in here every time to pay . ""

"" All right then , I think I will sign up for Direct Debit and see how it goes ! ""

"" Thank you Madam . The Direct Debit form is attached. You can fill it in , send it back to us, and we'll arrange everything from there .""

The Direct Debit form is a simple one-page document requesting your bank account number (which we already know) , the amount you want to pay every month for each of your utility bills , the date on which you would like these payments to start and the name under which you want us to send the receipts.

We can set this up either at the branch where you opened your account (or even at any one of our other branches), or we can come out to visit you at home , but this is more expensive than the other methods. If it's convenient for you , please fill in and sign the Direct Debit form, and then return it by post .
\end{blockquote}

Comment: Thank you for your help, I understand that now. I don't have a problem with the direct debit. What I don't get is why they are saying 'We can set this up at our branch where you opened your account (or even at any one of our other branches)', but then later say 'Please fill in and sign the Direct Debit form, and return it by post.' They contradict themselves - is there a way around that?

Comment: The contradiction is between the two sentences in italics. What you have to do (direct debits are set up at your bank not your utility company) does not contradict what they say about setting them up ""at any of our other branches"", which is just a marketing statement. They're telling you that the direct debit can be arranged either where you opened your account or elsewhere, but that if it's convenient for you they would arrange it at home (if it's not, then do it at the bank).

Comment: I see what you mean now - thanks so much!

"" Well , that sounds wonderful . I don't know why everyone isn't signing up for this service . You said it would be easy ? ""

"" Yes. It will make things easier for you . We send you a form . All we need is your bank account number and the names of all of the utility companies to whom you want payments made . I hope that helps . ""

"" Yeah , but it wasn't the first time . They've been doing this for a long time. ""

"" So what happened after that? Did they take your money or anything ? ""

"" No , but they told me how much it costs . ""

"" And then? ""

"" I've never had a ticket before and didn't want one again . ""

"" Are you going to pay for it ? ""

"" Yes , but not immediately . ""

"" Why aren't you paying right now ? ""

"" Because I need the money for something else . ""

"" Okay, that's understandable. And then? ""

"" Then I called a friend and he gave me some advice on where to park next time so it wouldn't happen again . ""

"" Yes , they're in hurry . ""

"" So you have to wait a long time, don't you ? ""

"" Not really. You can get what you want even if you stand behind the people who are already ahead of you. You just have to look at their trays and pretend that everything is OK . ""

"" And when you go to dinner , do they give you a knife , a fork and a spoon ? ""

"" No, because we eat in silence so we don't need them . ""

"" Why not? ""

"" Well , the first reason is that it's difficult for us to speak with a mouth full of food . And also eating by yourself gives you more time to think and talk about serious things. For instance , if there are two men at table, one will say :

\strong{"" It seems our company is going to have some problems in the future ."" }

\em{and the other man says} :

\strong{"" I'm sorry to hear that . ""}

\em{and they continue talking like this without thinking about the knife and fork.}

"" But what if you want to eat something else ? ""

"" No problem at all , because we can put the tray down on the floor and help ourselves from it again . ""

"" And if a man who is sitting by himself wants to speak with another man who is also alone? ""

\em{The old lady stares hard at her student.}

"" They can just stand up and walk to the other table . ""

\em{The class laughs.}

"" That's very interesting , but you said before that you were in a hurry when people rushed for their lunch . So how long do they have to stay at the buffet ? ""

"" It depends on what kind of food you like . ""

\em{The old lady stares at her student.}

"" If you want to eat fast, then you have to choose a simple thing , for instance , an apple or a banana.""

\em{The class laughs again.}

"" But if you're hungry , and you like more complicated food, it will take longer. For example , when I went to the buffet with my friend, she took some rice, soup, salad, cheese , vegetables, beans, an egg , a sausage, tomato sauce and a meat dish . ""

"" And how long did she stand in line ? ""

"" She waited more than thirty minutes because the food was so delicious. But for me it was enough to eat a piece of cake.""

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,70,llama-2-7b@q8_0_70.txt,"The door closed. Miss Minton walked back into the room where Mrs. Crosse was waiting. She looked at her.

"" I hope you don't mind my leaving so abruptly . I'm afraid I have rather upset that nice girl.""

Mrs. Crosse looked startled. "" Who? What are you talking about? I haven't seen anybody in the room but you, Miss Minton!""

Miss Minton turned to her with a strange look on her face. "" You didn't see her? She just came in here . I was so interested in what you said that I never noticed her at all.""

"" My dear,"" cried Mrs. Crosse, ""I have seen no one but you!""

The two women looked at each other a moment in silence. Then Miss Minton sat down in the chair where the mysterious visitor had been standing and buried her face in her hands. She did not weep, for there were no tears, but she sat for several moments in a position of despair. When she lifted her head Mrs. Crosse saw that her eyes were wide open, but that they looked as if they had been screwed into their sockets. They stared fixedly at some point far beyond the range of Mrs. Crosse's vision .

""My dear,"" said Mrs. Crosse gently , ""what is the matter? I'm afraid something has upset you.""

Miss Minton shook her head. There was no movement of the lips which accompanied this gesture, but it was not necessary in order to convey her meaning. She merely sat there, staring into nothingness . Mrs. Crosse had never before seen Miss Minton so utterly overcome by anything , and she wondered what she could have said that would affect her so strangely.

She herself felt somewhat bewildered at the manner in which this young woman was behaving . She sat on, waiting for some explanation of what had happened. Presently Miss Minton got up from the chair and began to walk about the room. Mrs. Crosse did not like to leave her alone , but she could see that the girl felt so uncomfortable in the silence that she was better off with a companion .

She walked slowly up and down, still staring into nothingness. She seemed to be going over some experience or memory which troubled her more than anything else could possibly have done. The mystery of this behaviour on Miss Minton's part made Mrs. Crosse feel more uncomfortable than she had ever felt before .

What was the matter with the girl? What did she know that no one else knew? Had she found out something about her mother which she did not care to share with any one else?

Mrs. Crosse stared at her in amazement , while Miss Minton went on pacing up and down . She was very close to the chair on which Mrs. Crosse sat, but she never once looked towards that side of the room . It seemed as if there were something between those two women which they did not wish each other to notice.

Mrs. Crosse made her way over to Miss Minton's side and laid one hand on her shoulder , while with the other she drew down the girl's head, so that their faces were only a few inches apart . This action had no effect in bringing Miss Minton out of her strange trance-like state. She sat there quite still. Mrs. Crosse bent towards her ear and whispered:

""Miss Minton , I think something has upset you very much.""

The girl raised one hand slowly and pushed the hair away from her face . There was an expression on Miss Minton's face which was very different from anything that Mrs. Crosse had ever seen there before. It was not a look of fear or anger, it was rather one of surprise , almost of bewilderment . But she did not utter any sound, nor did she move her lips.

""What is the matter, dear? Tell me.""

Miss Minton looked at her gravely and slowly shook her head . She gave no explanation of her strange behaviour , but she let Mrs. Crosse know that she understood perfectly what she was feeling. The look on Miss Minton's face expressed sympathy for another's trouble, which Mrs. Crosse had never seen there before . It made the other woman feel quite uncomfortable in spite of all her desire to help.

Mrs. Crosse put a hand on Miss Minton's arm and tried again to lead her away from these thoughts. "" I can see you don't want me to know what it is that is troubling you . But I feel sure there must be something I could do for you.""

Miss Minton looked at her with eyes which were not unkindly, but which seemed almost accusing. She shook her head again and moved slowly away from Mrs. Crosse's side. "" No , there is nothing you can do ."" She paused a moment as if in thought, then continued:
"" You could help me though.""

Mrs. Crosse was so surprised at this statement that she looked at Miss Minton in amazement. "" Help you? How?""

Miss Minton's eyes flashed for a moment and her face took on a very stern look . She moved away from Mrs. Crosse, saying:
"" I can't tell you how.""

Mrs. Crosse sat there for several moments thinking about what had happened and wondering where the girl was going with this strange request. The thought came to her that she would like to see Miss Minton before she went away . She might find out something of great importance to her if she could only manage to persuade Miss Minton to tell her .

But there seemed little chance of Miss Minton doing so when they met again, for the girl gave no indication that she was willing to speak. As Mrs. Crosse turned away from this last encounter with Miss Minton, she wondered how she could possibly find out what had upset her so much.

Chapter Thirteen

Miss Minton returned to London and began preparations for her departure to England. She went out on several occasions while the preparation was in progress, but never for any great length of time . It seemed as if there were something that she wanted to do before leaving. Once again it became apparent that she spent a lot of money during this period .

It did not seem likely to Mrs. Crosse that Miss Minton would be going back to live in England, but when she asked her about this she was told: "" I am returning there for a few months."" She seemed so sure of herself that it was almost impossible for Mrs. Crosse to doubt her.

On the day before Miss Minton was due to leave London, Mrs. Crosse paid her an afternoon call and found her alone in the drawing room . She looked at Miss Minton as if she expected some explanation from her, but none came. She merely shook hands with the other woman and said: ""I'll be back soon.""

It was then that Mrs. Crosse realised that something had happened which would prevent Miss Minton returning to live in London . She must have known about this herself before she made her departure, but for some reason she had not told anyone else what it was that was making her go away from them.

Mrs. Crosse sat down and looked at the girl as if expecting an explanation of all that had happened since they parted on such a strange note . But Miss Minton seemed to have forgotten about this meeting, or perhaps she thought she would find out something more about it later . She was not likely to be satisfied with what Mrs. Crosse could tell her.

Mrs. Crosse walked over and sat down beside the girl again. They were now quite close together , so that Miss Minton could have touched her if she wanted to. But she did nothing of the kind . She looked at her with a sad smile on her face, then said: ""I'll be back soon.""

Chapter Fourteen

"" Well , I suppose I must be going now."" The young woman's eyes were fixed on a spot somewhere out in front of them . They were like those of a man looking at a landscape , with the same expression. But there was something about these eyes which made it hard to tell whether they were fixed on some distant object or not.

Mrs. Crosse looked up from her book, and then back down again quickly as if she had been caught doing something wrong . She said: "" Oh , I'm so sorry.""

The girl seemed not at all concerned about what was happening. Her eyes were still looking out into nothingness . Mrs. Crosse began to wonder whether there really was any reason for her presence here and, if so, why she had come. She wanted very much to ask the girl's opinion on this matter , but it seemed impossible for her to do so until Miss Minton spoke first.

"" I don't want you to think that I'm not grateful . It was a great deal more than anyone could have expected . But there are some things in life which cannot be changed and we must make the best of them.""

Mrs. Crosse sat up straight again and stared at this stranger who had come so suddenly into her house, saying: "" But why should you feel that way about it"

"" We're talking about business here . As a matter of fact, I am not very enthusiastic about doing business with you . You will understand . ""

"" Well , we might as well be frank with one another. If the price is too high for you , let me know . ""

"" We are also dealing in goods and prices , so your attitude is incomprehensible to us . 10 boxes , at 15,000 yuan each ? ""

"" I can't agree with that price either. ""

""I'll have to think about it then . Maybe some other time . Bye for now. "" ( Mr. Zhuang leaves . )

CHAPTER SEVEN: TACTICS

( 1 ) The tactics of buying and selling are similar, but different.

Tactics in selling, as distinct from strategies , involve the application of several basic principles:

* Make your first offer the lowest possible price.

This will be accepted by the majority of buyers. You can then gradually increase the price to the level where you expect to close the sale. This procedure is particularly effective in face-to-face selling situations, such as door-to-door sales and telephone calls. It's a good idea not to go over your mark; however, if you are in a position of strength and can afford to give away some profit for a quick sale , do so.

* Find out what the customer wants before you begin negotiating prices or terms.

This will allow you to determine the most effective way of proceeding in making an offer. You'll also be in a position to discover whether the customer is interested in buying, and if not why he isn't . ( See "" A Study on Purchasing Behavior"" ) . This information will enable you to decide how far to go with your negotiation.

* Let the other party set the price or terms; then follow his example.

This tactic is particularly useful in negotiating contracts, and for a number of reasons: First, if you initiate the process , the other party will be put on guard against your motives. Second, you'll have an advantage over him because he must match or beat your price ( or terms ) . Third, you can use this tactic to encourage a bargaining spirit. If the customer sets the price, you can make several counteroffers of increasingly higher prices ( or lower terms ).

* Take into account the other party's situation and emotional state in making an offer.

Selling techniques require that you establish rapport with the other party and determine his needs as well as his ability to buy. If your offer is too far above his buying power, it will probably be turned down. On the other hand, if you make a low bid because of insufficient knowledge of the situation, you may miss an opportunity .

* If negotiations fail for any reason , be sure that there's no misunderstanding; then, say ""Thank you"" and leave immediately.

This will avoid a possible confrontation or a bad impression on the part of the other party .

( 2 ) Tactics in buying, as distinct from strategies , involve the application of several basic principles:

* Start out with a low bid; then gradually increase it.

The most effective way to buy goods is to make your first offer lower than that of any competitor . This will induce the seller to make his lowest possible offer in order not to lose you as a customer . If he doesn't have the goods, or they are not available at this time, it will be easy for you to turn down the offer and find someone who does.

* Always ask for a price breakdown; then negotiate individually for each item.

When bidding on large quantities of similar items ( such as furniture or appliances ) , always ask for an item-by-item breakdown of prices . This is especially effective in face-to-face selling situations, where you can examine the goods at once and decide whether to accept them.

* Find out what the other party wants before making your bid; then follow his example.

This will allow you to determine how high a price to offer and to get an idea of the total costs involved in buying from him . If he is not interested, you can use this information to decide whether it's worthwhile to try again later or with another company . You may also be able to negotiate on the basis of a partial order ( for example, just one item ) , which will reduce your total costs and give you more bargaining power.

* Make sure that there are no misunderstandings by checking the seller's response.

If the seller agrees, say "" Thank you"" and leave immediately . This avoids a possible confrontation or a bad impression on his part; it also helps to establish good rapport between you. If he refuses your bid, find out why and try again at another time if necessary.

CHAPTER EIGHT: MANIPULATIONS

( 1 ) How do the tactics of selling and buying differ from those of manipulating?

Manipulation is an unscrupulous tactic of obtaining something by deceiving or tricking others. This technique should be avoided whenever possible because it often leads to bad feelings between people who may have to deal with one another in the future. It also violates the law and is frowned upon by society .

( 2 ) What are some common forms of manipulation?

Manipulations can take many forms, but here are some of the most frequently encountered:

* Taking advantage of people's ignorance or lack of experience in negotiating.

This is a common tactic used by salespeople who try to make the best deal possible for themselves at the expense of their customers . The seller may know that his customer can't make an informed decision about the price of goods because he doesn't understand how prices are determined, so he will offer an unreasonably high bid or request a higher commission than usual.

* Making use of people's greed to get them into a situation in which they cannot back out .

For example, you may be asked for your opinion by someone who knows that it is worth more than what he is offering you, and then offered a reward if you agree with him . This type of manipulation can occur when buying or selling anything from real estate to investments; it often leads to loss for both parties involved.

* Convincing people to do something by appealing to their pride .

For example, you may be asked for your opinion on a certain subject because the person asking is interested in hearing what other people think about it , and then later told that if you agree with him he will give you an extra bonus or commission . This type of manipulation occurs frequently during negotiations; it can also occur when purchasing anything from real estate to investments.

* Misrepresenting the facts in order to make yourself look better than your competitors ( this is sometimes called "" playing dirty"" ).

For example, you may be asked for your opinion on a certain subject because someone else has been asking him what he thinks about it , and then later told that if you agree with him he will give you an extra bonus or commission . This type of manipulation occurs frequently during negotiations; it can also occur when purchasing anything from real estate to investments.

* Manipulating the timing of events to your advantage .

For example, someone may ask for your opinion on a certain subject because they are interested in hearing what other people think about it , and then later tell you that if you agree with them they will give you an extra bonus or commission ; this type of manipulation can occur during negotiations when buying or selling anything from real estate to investments.

* Misrepresenting the facts to make yourself look better than your competitors ( sometimes called "" playing dirty"" ).

For example, someone may ask for your opinion on a certain subject because they are interested in hearing what other people think about it ; then later tell you that if you agree with them they will give you an extra bonus or commission . This type of manipulation occurs frequently during negotiations; it can also occur when purchasing anything from real estate to investments.

( 3 ) What should we do to avoid being manipulated?

In general, the best way to avoid being manipulated is not to engage in any type of negotiation or purchase with people who have been known to use this

"" We cannot accept your conditions . ""

[Illustration: 0143]

[Illustration: 9144]

"" I ’ ll try to come some time next week , "" I answered , as we shook hands at the door ; and then I went home happy. It was a bright, warm day, and the birds sang so merrily that I walked on with a light heart until I reached my house, and then I hurried up-stairs to get the box ready for the lady in blue, who was to come as soon as she finished her shopping.

It was nearly two o ’ clock when she came , and it seemed to me that she had been gone longer than an hour ; but after she had closed the front door behind her I ran up-stairs to bring down my box. In a few minutes we started on our walk . The sky was darkening, and it looked like rain .

"" Perhaps you ’ ll not mind walking faster now ? "" said Mrs. Jones , as we turned into a long street ; and then she told me how busy she had been that morning, and asked if I did n’t think the day would clear up in time to get home before dark. We walked briskly along till we came to a bridge where some men were working .
"" There ’ s your chance , "" said Mrs. Jones ; "" if you run across the bridge now you can be at my house just as it begins to rain, and so save yourself all the trouble of walking back. I ’ ll wait for you here. ” I ran across, and had nearly reached the other side before a cloud came over, and I could see that it was going to rain very soon .

"" Goodness ! what ’ s the matter now ? "" said Mrs. Jones as she ran after me ;
"" you look so pale . ""

"" I do n’t feel well , "" I answered . "" And besides, my mother will be frightened about me if it rains before I get home. But don ’ t you think the sun is going to come out now ? ""

"" I am afraid not , "" she said ; "" this shower is likely to last till night. Now just go on across the bridge and meet me here, and we will walk down the other side of the river together. I ’ ll make no more remarks about your looking ill.""

So off I started again . There was a good many people standing around in the street, waiting for some show to come out ; but I could not stay long with them , for it began to rain harder and harder every minute. Just as I turned into the second cross-street that I came to there were more men at work than usual on the bridge . They looked so busy that I hurried past without speaking to any of them , though I did not know why they were so late getting in when the work was all ready for them ; and just then a heavy gust of wind blew up, and some large pieces of plaster fell down.
"" That ’ s it ! "" said one man who had been standing on the bridge watching me come along ; "" now we shall get wet to-day before we have finished our work."" But another man spoke up quickly.

[Illustration: 0149]

"" I don ’ t see why that should make any difference with us, for as long as they keep on building new houses over there they will want plenty of plastering done in a hurry ; and as soon as this shower is over we can get to work again. The bridge has been finished three weeks now, and I don ’ t believe that it will be half an hour before the sun comes out."" And he stepped off into the roadway with his long-handled brush in one hand and a small bucket of plaster in the other .

"" Look at him ! "" said another man ; "" there goes for all of us. He knows that as soon as we are ready they will be calling to have our work finished, and he thinks that if it rains now he is safe from being sent home again. But I ’ ve a good mind to follow him.""

I looked at the men as they went on with their brushes ; one of them had his hair cut very close all around except in front , where there was a long lock hanging down over one eye . He had been shovelling dirt for some time, and now he stopped to look at me. I could see that his face looked pale and tired , and there was a dark mark on it that was not there when the sun shone .
"" How is your hand ? "" I asked, as I passed him by ; but he did n’t answer me, only turned around to pick up something that had fallen off his pile of dirt. He looked very much surprised, and after a minute or two he spoke out slowly and distinctly :—
"" Can ’ t you see that it has been cut ? "" I saw the long mark plain enough now . It was fresh and bleeding. It must have been hurt some time during the night , for it had not begun to show until morning ; but in the sunlight he could not hide the blood from me, and I looked at him again.
"" That ’ s all right ; your work is good enough , "" said one of the men who was near by . "" He won ’ t send you home because of a little cut. And I don’t believe that we will be sent back either when it rains as hard as this."" But I did not say anything more to him, and he did not speak to me after that ; so I kept on walking alone till I came out where I could see the river running down from the bridge in a black stream .

I passed on without stopping , and soon found myself near my mother ’ s house. The rain was falling very hard now, and just as I went by her window she called me in to stay for dinner ; but I ran home as fast as I could . I had to be there before dark. But it did n’t rain any harder than if it had been raining all the time , so at last I thought that perhaps she would not mind waiting until evening. When I reached my house she was just taking off her things and hanging them up in the closet ; and when I went into the room where we were to have our dinner she came in with me. It was a nice, warm room, and there was a large fireplace on one side , but no fire . My mother had brought some wood into the house from the cellar, for it was so cold that morning ; and when I saw her take off her hat and put it on the pile of sticks in front of me, I did n’t say any thing at first. Then she looked around at me very kindly.

"" Don ’ t you like to see a fire ? "" said she .

[Illustration: 0153]

I had never seen so much wood before , and when I saw that my mother was trying to keep me from being cold, I felt ashamed of myself for not speaking out. So I began to tell her about the bridge , and how many men were on it ; and then I told her about the man whose hand was hurt , and why he had been sent back home in such a hurry . But she did n’t seem interested in that ; instead, she looked at me very sharply, as if there were something wrong.
"" Why don ’ t you tell me what is troubling your mind ? "" she asked. I was too much surprised to say anything just then , but I felt that I ought to have spoken before she came into the room .

"" Now I shall have a chance to see whether this little boy knows how to keep a secret or not,"" said my mother ; and I did n’t know what to do. "" Did you tell your story all by yourself ? ” I shook my head slowly, then I looked at her again as if there were nothing wrong , when she had turned away from me for a minute .
"" You have been listening to the people in the street while we walked along together ! "" She was now looking down into the fireplace ; and then she lifted one of the sticks that was lying on the hearth. There were three pieces sticking out , where my mother had cut off the ends for kindling.
"" What ’ s this ? "" I could see her smile as she looked at me . "" You have been listening to what we say to each other without telling us about it ! It seems that you are very quick in your business, and if you are not more careful there will be no secrets for you to keep. Now, tell me why you did n ’ t speak before , when I asked you about this bridge.""

I told her the whole story ; how the men on the bridge had spoken to me in a whisper ; how it was almost dark when we started out ; and then how one man stopped by my side and talked with me as long as he could .
"" But why did they speak so low ? "" I asked , when I told her all about that.

"" Because they were afraid that people passing by would hear them talk, or else they thought you might be a policeman and wanted to keep out of trouble for speaking with strangers on the street.""

[Illustration: 0157]

"" Are you going to stay here for a while longer ? ""

"" Yes, I think so . At least until my sister goes back to her home town in Florida . ""

"" Well , I think it's been more than two years now . We used to live in the same house together when we were little, but she moved out five or six years ago . ""

"" Doesn't it seem strange to you that your sister has been living in San Francisco for 10 years and you don't know where she lived before that ? ""

"" That is strange . But she wasn't here when we were kids so I never talked with her about anything then . We moved away from home and went to college together . She was born in California but our parents moved us all around the United States during her childhood . So she spent most of her life in other states . ""

"" How long does it take for you to get my claim form when I mail it in ? ""

"" It depends on how quickly we are getting your payments in and how quickly we can get them out of our system ; but, typically , we process that within 30 days . ""

"" I had another question about the Continued Claim Form. ""

"" You can mail it back to us any time you want to ! ""

"" Well, when should I send in my form ? ""

"" We don ’ t like to see people wait until they are right on top of a deadline . It is always better to get it done ahead of the deadline . ""

"" But how do I know if there was anything wrong with the previous check ? ""

"" You can call us and we will let you know what happened with your last claim . ""

"" Well, did my payment go out this week ? ""

"" We have not issued any payments for last week ’ s period yet ! ""

"" But I was at the unemployment office last Monday . ""

"" You can only come into our office when you are supposed to get your payment and we aren ’ t making those payments until this coming Monday . ""

"" I don ’ t think it will be very smart to come in on Monday . Will it ? ""

"" Well, if you want to come by then, that is certainly okay. But remember — our office will only be open during business hours ! ""

"" This is all very confusing to me ! ""

"" We do our best to help people understand the process of collecting unemployment . ""

"" Not necessarily , because we need to process that claim form before any unemployment benefits can be issued . We may not know if you qualify for this payment until next week. ""

"" Is there anything I can do? ""

"" You can always call back on Friday evening after 5:30 p.m. or Saturday between noon and 1:00 p.m. to see about the status of your claim . ""

"" Can I come in and file my form with you ? ""

"" No , but we are able to give you a list of drop boxes where you can take your unemployment forms if they need to be submitted more quickly than by mail or fax. Just call 1-800-582-4169 for the location closest to you . ""

"" Why is it taking so long? I never had any problems before! ""

"" That ’ s unfortunate , but this situation has put us in a very difficult position and we are doing our best under extremely trying circumstances. We appreciate your patience during these challenging times. ""

"" Are you crazy ? We don’t need that ! "" Dick looked at his watch and said, ""Look, I have got to be going now. It ’ s getting late.""

The couple stood there, looking at one another, not knowing how to proceed from here. There was silence for a long time between them. They were both thinking the same thing, what on earth was going to happen next ? They couldn’t believe it !

"" Hey , Dick . ""

"" What now ? ""

"" We ’ re going to be late for work . ""

"" Oh, right.""

Dick said as he turned to leave.

"" Goodbye. ""

"" Bye . ""

Dick left the coffee shop, not knowing whether or not he would see her again. He had just gotten his coffee from the cashier when he saw her sitting there drinking hers. She smiled and said , ""Good morning.""

"" Good morning. ""

She didn ’ t sit down but asked him to join her for a second. When Dick sat, she said , ""Thanks so much for taking care of me yesterday . ""

"" No problem at all . ""

Dick smiled.

"" I was just thinking we both are busy today and we hardly had any time for one another the other day . Why don ’ t you come over to my place tonight ? "" She asked, with a big smile on her face.

Dick thought about it for a moment, then he said , ""Well, I don ’ t really have anything special to do tomorrow night except hang out and watch TV . So that sounds great ! What time can you pick me up ? ""

"" How about 7:30 ? "" She smiled again.

He nodded his head in agreement then stood up. He walked over to her side of the table, put his hand on top of hers and said , ""I ’ ll see you tonight . ""

She just kept looking at him as he left.

The next day passed by so quickly for Dick that he couldn ’ t believe it had already come 7:00PM and time for them to go out. He went over to her house, rang the bell and waited. There was no answer from within, not even a dog barked at him, which he found quite strange but he decided to wait until she came out anyways. Finally after waiting about 3 minutes, she opened the door and greeted him with a warm smile on her face , ""Hello, Dick . ""

"" Hello.""

He smiled back then followed her into the living room where there was already some light music playing in the background. They sat down on the sofa while they talked for about 10 minutes. It wasn ’ t until she asked him to take off his shoes that he realized how late it had gotten since he had arrived.

"" Oh, man . "" He said with a smile as he took them off and then threw them over by the doorway.

"" You should relax more often , Dick ! "" She laughed out loudly.

He looked at her from across the room and smiled back , ""It ’ s nice to see you laugh like that . ""

She replied with a big grin on her face, ""I haven ’ t really done much of it lately but I promise to try harder ! ""

"" Well then, I guess we have nothing left to do now except watch some TV ? "" He asked.

"" I think that sounds like an excellent idea . "" She replied cheerfully, while walking over towards the entertainment center in front of her sofa.

Dick sat down on the sofa, put his feet up and said with a smile , ""I can ’ t believe how fast time flies by when you are having fun ! ""

"" It sure is ! And you know what else ? It seems like it ’ s going faster than ever these days . "" She replied.

They sat there for about an hour talking and watching TV, when all of a sudden he got up from the sofa , came over to where she was standing and put his arm around her shoulder. He leaned in close to whisper something into her ear while smiling at her with those beautiful brown eyes which seemed to have captured her heart ever since that first time they had met.

Dick ’ s hand trailed down her back until it reached her bottom where he began kissing her neck softly. She was so surprised by his sudden act of affection , but then she couldn’t help but get caught up in the moment too because all she could think about right now was how much she wanted him to make love with her !

Dick ’ s hands moved lower until they were caressing between her legs, while he whispered into her ear some more things which made it even harder for her to resist his advances. He began unbuttoning her blouse before kissing every part of her body that he could reach without touching any sensitive areas !

Dick moved closer and pressed his lips against hers as they kissed passionately . Her hands found their way underneath his shirt, feeling the warmth of his skin through clothes which she wanted to rip off but knew better than to do so! Their tongues began dancing together while he continued fondling her breast with both hands until they were rock hard !

Dick pulled away from her kiss for a moment and said, ""I love you !"" as he moved his lips down to taste hers once more . His fingers began caressing between the folds of skin that protected her vagina before penetrating deep within.

He began making love with her so tenderly that it seemed like she was being carried away by a dream!

They continued to kiss passionately for some time until Dick finally pulled away from her lips, saying, ""I ’ m going to go into the other room and get my boxers , okay ?""

Dick walked off in another direction without waiting for an answer . After a few minutes had passed by without his return, she said out loud , ""What should I do now ? ""

It was then when he came back with his pants in hand and smiled at her . Dick ’ s clothes were already removed before he entered the bedroom, where they had spent most of their time since arriving. He sat down on top of the covers while she got underneath him , so that she could kiss all over him again !

Dick began fondling between his wife’s legs until he felt her warmth begin to increase with every stroke ! He placed one hand against her chest and used it as leverage to penetrate deeper into her vagina .

As they continued making love , Dick couldn ’ t believe how much pleasure she gave him ! After an hour or two had passed by, he came inside of her so fast that the only thing left was a loud moan from deep within his throat!

He pulled away and looked into her eyes again with those beautiful brown ones while saying, ""I love you too ."" He smiled as she kissed him on top of his head once more before he rolled over onto his side of the bed !

Dick turned over towards his wife , who was still lying there looking at him. She said out loudly again, ""What should I do now ? "" And Dick replied with a smile .

He got up off the mattress and walked over to where she had been standing earlier on in this story . He picked her up by her hands , so that they could kiss one another again ! When he finally released his hold on her arms, she began caressing him all over as they kissed passionately once more !

Dick ’ s hands traveled down between their bodies until they found what had been missing since the beginning of this story . He began fondling her breasts while she kissed every part of his body that she could reach with her mouth !

After a few minutes, Dick pulled away from the kiss once more and said out loudly , ""I love you too."" But before he could say anything else about what was going on between them right then , she stopped him by saying softly .

"" What should I do now ? "" And this time he replied with a smile as they continued making love for hours upon end !

### 20. I Can ’ t Believe How Much We Have Learned About Each Other Since The Last Time We Made Love Together !

Dick and his wife were sitting there in bed , still making love after what seemed like ages ! They had learned so much about one another since the first time they met . She always felt that she could trust him with her body even though he had never made any moves towards her before they started dating! And now, all of these months later, he was finally taking advantage of the situation by making love with her every night !

It had been more than six months since Dick ’ s wife and their daughter had moved into his house , so that they could be together full time . This meant that she had to work part-time for some extra income while they were away from each other . But now, after all this time passed by without anything going wrong between them , it seemed like there wasn ’ t enough hours"

"" Oh, he died five years ago . ""

"" She has always been very bitter since then , hasn ’ t she ? ""

"" No . Not at all . At first it was just so hard to understand why God could do this to her , but she never complained about him. I don’t know how she did it. Then a few months ago she decided to leave the church. ""

"" She left? Why ? What happened ? ""

"" I guess she had been thinking and praying about all these things and realized that nothing she could do would ever bring her son back or change what he has become . ""

"" So now she no longer believes in God’s sovereignty over our lives? She doesn ’ t think everything happens for a reason ? I guess you never know, huh? ""

"" No , not really. But it is kind of sad to see someone who used to be so strong and confident now doubting the very foundation on which she built her life . It seems like all she ever had was her faith in God and his ability to give meaning to things that happen, but now I don’t think she has anything left. ""

"" What is there to believe in? She ’ s lost everything . ""

"" Maybe so. But isn’t that the way it should be sometimes—when you realize all your possessions are nothing more than temporary and that really they mean nothing? Don’t we want our lives to be empty of ourselves at some point if it means having Christ dwell in us ? ""

""I suppose . I just don ’ t understand why she can ’ t accept the things we have faith in. Is there something wrong with her, or is this just a natural part of growing as a Christian? ""

""That ’ s hard to say . She could be experiencing a time of spiritual crisis like you are talking about , and it does seem that at these times she has turned from God , but I don’t think it has anything to do with the truth of our faith. The apostle Paul had times when he was confused, too, even though he had more faith than most of us will ever have . I ’ m sure he would still be confused if we could see him now—he would probably be asking himself why he did so many things that caused so much pain to himself and others. But it wasn’t the truth in our faith that led him astray; it was his own sinful nature. ""

"" I guess . Maybe my sister-in-law is having some sort of struggle, too, but she doesn ’ t even talk about what happened in her life after her son died , so how would I know? I don’t mean to be a nag or anything, but I can’t help thinking that we ought to have some kind of relationship with God and other people. Isn ’ t that why we were put on this earth—to worship God ? ""

""That doesn’t necessarily mean we have to believe the same things . We are all part of a family, and no matter what our beliefs may be , it is important to care for each other in time of need. Your sister-in-law still has many needs and she doesn ’ t see God as the source of her strength—she sees herself. That’s not always bad; but it does limit her faith . ""

""What do you mean? I thought faith was supposed to be unconditional. Isn ’ t that what we are taught in Sunday school ? ""

""Yes , it is, but our relationship with God and with each other must remain true if we are going to live out our Christian faith. If she can’t believe that God could bring good out of something as tragic as the death of a child, then her beliefs don ’ t have any meaning for her at all. I think she should try to find some place in herself where she can make room for God and allow him to work within her . ""

""You mean like we did? Is there anything wrong with how we believe now ? I can’t imagine it being any different from how we used to live. ""

""No, I don ’ t think so . Maybe you should try to find out what is going on in your sister-in-law ’ s life and then pray for her—maybe the two of you could go to church together? You never know where God may lead you if you let him.""

""I guess it wouldn’t hurt, would it ? """

The middle-aged woman did not continue to speak. She just looked at him silently waiting for what he would say next.

""Ms. Yang, I know that this is the first time I have come here. You must think it 's a very strange thing for me to do , but I am really here to ask for your hand in marriage . ""

The middle-aged woman smiled and looked at him. She had already expected what he would say. She nodded her head with a smile, ""I see that you are indeed very brave to come here.""

He stood up with a smile on his face. The middle-aged woman also stood up. He handed the envelope in his hand to her and said with a smile: ""This is my proposal letter. I hope you can accept it.""
The middle-aged woman took it out of his hand, opened it and read it carefully for a long time. She looked at him and smiled. Finally she nodded. She reached out her hands to hold the envelope and said to him: ""Mr. Cheng , I have already accepted your proposal letter.""
""Really ?"" He was surprised when he heard this, because he did not expect that she would accept it so quickly.
He had thought that it might take a few days to talk her into accepting his hand in marriage, but instead she had already said yes after reading just one page of the proposal letter!
""Yes."" She smiled and nodded. ""Mr. Cheng , I have already accepted your proposal . What kind of things do you want me to give you ?""
""I ..."" He did not know what he should say, because he had never thought that this would happen so quickly.
He thought: 'Why is she so easygoing? If I were the person in her position , I wouldn't have said yes so easily.'
Then he took out his wallet and handed it over to her. ""Ms. Yang, these are all my money . You can take as many as you want.""
""I don ' t need any of that. I accept your proposal letter because I like you. That's all."" She smiled at him and said.
""Really ?"" He asked in surprise.
""Yes , Really."" She nodded her head with a smile . ""Do not worry about me. Just take care of yourself well . ""
He was silent for a moment, and then he said to her: ""Well ... I accept your proposal letter as well.""
The middle-aged woman smiled and nodded. ""I see that you really like me. You are very kind, Mr. Cheng , so thank you . ""
""Please call me Steven from now on . "" He bowed down slightly to show his respect to her.
She took out a card from the desk in front of her and handed it over to him. She then said: ""Here is my address and telephone number. Please write down your name , address and phone number for me . ""
""Thank you very much."" He accepted the business card from her.
The two people looked at each other and smiled.
He then said to her: ""Ms. Yang, I will take my leave now. I hope that we can see each other again soon.""
She smiled and nodded with a smile on his face. He then left the office .

""Hey ! You two are so close. What's your relationship ? ""
A man in sunglasses with short hair walked up to them while they were sitting together at one corner of the cafe. He pointed a finger at Steven and said: ""You are Steven, right ? I am Wang from the same office building . You know that she is Ms. Yang , don 't you?""
""Yes, I do know her."" Steven stood up and shook hands with him.
Then he asked : ""So what's your relationship with her ? Are you two dating each other now? ""
The woman next to him was laughing. She said: ""Hey ! You 're too nosy . Just don't ask me for a date if I don't want one . ""
""Alright."" Wang laughed and nodded with a smile on his face. He looked at Steven and asked : ""Do you know Ms. Yang ? ""
Steven smiled, shook his head and said to him: ""No , we just met yesterday for the first time in our lives.""
Wang was surprised when he heard this. He stared at Steven with a questioning look on his face .
Then he looked at Ms. Yang and asked her: ""Is that really true ? You two have never seen each other before ? ""
""Really."" She nodded with a smile .
Wang was silent for a moment, then smiled to Steven and said: ""Hey ! I believe you , but do not try to make me feel suspicious. We are all good friends. If there is any misunderstanding between us two, it will ruin our friendship.""
""OK!"" Steven nodded his head with a smile on his face. He knew that he could not afford to lose this friend .
""Ms. Yang , you have to help me solve one problem for him . "" Wang laughed and said: ""He just called Ms. Yang yesterday and asked her out today. What should I do?""
""I will tell you."" She smiled at Steven and then turned back to look at Wang, who was standing behind them . She looked up into his eyes with a smile on his face. Then she said : ""Wang , don't worry about this problem. It is not that difficult for me to handle it . I just need your help.""
""OK ! "" He nodded with a smile on his face, and then he sat down in the chair again.
Steven was stunned when he heard this.
He had never expected her to have such an amazing ability . It really made him feel very shocked.
He looked at her with a puzzled look on his face , but she just smiled and said nothing.
She turned around, walked towards him and sat next to him. She then put her arms round his neck, kissed him lightly on the lips and said to him: ""Steven , we should go now . We have an appointment with the manager of the store later.""
""OK ! I know that you will take me shopping tomorrow."" He smiled and nodded.
Then he put his arms around her waist, pulled her towards himself and kissed her on the lips again ."

He asked for five minutes to think it over, and then he returned .

"" I've changed my mind ! "" he said to the man .

"" I want only two pairs of 21 . The other one will have to do without . ""

"" I will try and watch them . Now , what about the skates themselves ? ""

"" Well, I suggest you take the kids around in circles for an hour or so. That should be long enough to see whether the skate is comfortable on their feet. If they want it later, then put it aside for another two hours. Otherwise, just put them back into the rack and get one of the other three pairs . ""

"" Can't you rent them by the half hour ? ""

"" Yes , I could , but you see if people don't know how to skate well enough by the end of an hour then they will have wasted a lot of time . So, we have this policy that people must pay for an hour in advance. This is so that the kids can make up their minds without being rushed , and also so that no one is kept on their feet for too long . ""

"" I understand . Is there anything else you'll need to rent ? ""

"" Well, two pairs of gloves are important. The first time the kids go out, they may get quite cold. So we recommend that they wear thick leather ones underneath their regular clothes. If you see someone wearing these on a hot day , I suggest you ask them for one . ""

"" All right . What else ? ""

"" Well, if the kids are going to fall over quite often then there's no need for any helmets at all. But if they will be skating near to each other, or in some way at risk of hurting themselves , then you should get them a helmet and elbow pads. You can see that the kids who are really good usually wear those too . ""

"" I'll remember that next time . ""

"" And make sure they wear their helmets ? ""

"" Sure ! But don't worry too much. They are beginners. It's not easy for kids of that age to get injured on a skating rink, just because the rules aren't followed very well . ""

"" I hope you're right . ""

"" So , what do you want to do ? Just walk around slowly at first ? ""

"" Yeah. Maybe I could show them how to do that first . ""

I hang up and stand there for a moment. Then, I get to work. I turn on my computer , open my email program , and hit reply.

To: invoking@hotmail.com
From: djthorne@hotmail.com
Subject: Invocation

Thank you for your help . I will let you know how it works out.

I guess that's about it. The next day, I get a reply from Samantha. It doesn't come until after midnight , so there are no emails waiting in my inbox when I check. There aren't any more emails the following morning either . but at lunchtime , when I sit down to work on another chapter of ""Fantastic Flesh"" (I haven't forgotten about that book) , there is an email from Samantha waiting for me. The subject line reads:

Invocation

You got it ! You invocated the sexy into your life ! Way to go, dude ! ""

Thank you , Samantha . I really appreciate it.

I guess I'd better get started on the next chapter of my book .

Until we talk again ...

Later that day , I check my email again and there is another message from Samantha waiting for me. The subject line reads:

Invocation Results ?

I want to hear how it went ! I'll bet you're getting a lot of action in your life these days . I hope so .

Until next time ...

Later that day , as promised, I get another email from Samantha. The subject line reads:

Invocation Results ?

Well , the results are mixed , to say the least.

I started getting some action on a regular basis . and then things got a little weird. There was this one guy that I met who seemed pretty cool. He was a DJ at some club downtown, so we had some things in common. We even went out for dinner once , but ... ""

"" But what ? ""

I don't really know . he just sort of stopped calling and coming around after a few weeks. I tried to talk to him about it, but nothing really changed. He was nice enough on the outside, but inside he seemed sort of cold or distant. That feeling was even stronger when we went out for dinner. We sat down at our table , ordered drinks , and then just sort of stared at each other like two zombies for about five minutes before I finally said something to him . ""

"" You're awfully quiet tonight ... ""

"" Yeah . so what are you thinking ? ""

"" I was just wondering if everything is all right , that's all. Are there any problems with your job or anything else that might be bothering you ? ""

"" No . I don't think so. The job is great . and I love the nightclub scene, but ... ""

"" But what ? ""

"" I just don't feel right around him , somehow. It seems like every time we're together something happens to make me feel weird or creeped out . I guess it's kind of a strange feeling because nothing really seems to be happening , but at the same time there's this uncomfortable vibe that surrounds us whenever we get close.""

"" Well ... ""

"" So what am I supposed to do ? Just sit here and wait for him to ask me out again . I mean , it isn't like he has a girlfriend or anything. And even if he did , why wouldn't she want him around ? ""

"" It just seems like there should be some way to get past this ... ""

"" Well , maybe not with that guy , but you're right . There must be something I can do about it . So what do I need to do ? How do I invoke the sexy back into my life ? ""

"" OK . so we start with your thoughts. What are you thinking about when you meet him ? ""

"" Hmmm ... well , I guess I'm kind of comparing him to other guys that have come along lately . It's like there was this one guy who seemed really into me the last time we went out and now he's not calling or coming around anymore. And then there's another guy I met at work ... ""

"" All right , let's stop right there for a minute . The thing to remember is that you have no way of knowing how other guys are feeling about you when they meet you . If anything, you might be more likely to attract the kind of attention you want by focusing on yourself instead of thinking about what everyone else thinks.""

"" I guess it sounds crazy , but I don't really know what else to do. All this time I've been trying to think my way into getting more action and all it does is make me feel like there must be something wrong with me . ""

"" But how can you possibly know that ? It seems to me that the only thing we have to go on here is what other people tell us. We're not mind readers, after all.""

"" I guess you might be right ... ""

"" Well , then maybe it's time for a change . What if instead of trying to figure out how guys feel about you when they first meet you, what if you just start thinking differently ? Think like a guy thinks. When you meet him, don't focus on how he looks or what kind of car he drives . Just think about yourself and what you can do for him . ""

"" You mean I should be thinking more like ... ""

"" Like a sex-object ! That's it exactly ! And this goes right along with the whole invoking process. When we talk to someone else , we project our own thoughts onto them. We assume that they feel just like us and think about things in a similar way.""

"" But ... ""

"" It works both ways . If you want to attract a guy's attention, then the best thing you can do is to focus on yourself instead of comparing him to other guys he might be meeting or wondering what he thinks about when he meets you.""

"" I see where you're going with this , but ... ""

"" But nothing ! The key here is that once we understand how our thoughts affect our feelings and actions, then everything starts to make sense . We can start seeing the world as it really is instead of letting other people tell us what they think about things.""

"" I guess that's true enough ... ""

I just stare at her for a moment. Then, I shake my head and laugh. I don't know if Samantha realizes how right she is or not , but somehow I can't help feeling like things are starting to change around here . Maybe it's just because everything seems so different now that I'm thinking differently about what goes on around me . maybe it's something else .

But whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure : from this point forward , invoking will never again feel like such a difficult or confusing task !"
llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,181,llama-2-7b@q8_0_181.txt,"\end{blockquote}

I also found this in a book called ""The Longman Student Grammar of Spoken English"" (1986):

\begin{blockquote}
""Excuse me, sir. Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is?""

""That's over on Callaway Street, isn't it?""

""Yes, but I can't find Callaway Street.""

""Walk that way for about four blocks. The hotel's about two blocks north of there.""

""Thanks a lot!""
\end{blockquote}

In this example, the questioner doesn't know which direction is ""north"". Also, you could easily say ""I can't find Callaway Street \strong{west}"" or ""Callaway Street is east of here.""

Does it make any sense to answer an unspecified question about a street with an unspecified direction? I don't think so.

Comment: This is incorrect, and based on misinformation. The speaker does know in which direction Callaway St. is located relative to the listener. That fact was established by the first question (which is an essential component of the sentence).

Answer: You are assuming that if a person does not specify a direction then they don't have one in mind; but this is not always true. For example, I might say ""Do you know where the admiral hotel is?"" to someone who had told me that they were going there for dinner. Since I would already know in which direction they were facing (i.e. whether or not it was west of their current location), I wouldn't have to specify a direction when asking if they knew its name.

Answer: The question is really not well formed because the interlocutor does not know what kind of hotel you are looking for and if it exists at all. To answer this, you need to add more information about the context.
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Excuse me sir! Do you know where Admiral Hotel is?}
\end{itemize}

He might answer ""Yes"" and say the hotel is on the other side of the street, or he could just point in one direction and say something like:
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Yes I know it's across the road.}
\end{itemize}

But he doesn't necessarily have to answer with a direction. The speaker has no idea where Callaway Street is or whether there even is an Admiral Hotel in that street, so just saying ""yes"" could mean any number of things and can be answered with any kind of answer. There might not be such a hotel at all!
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Excuse me sir. Do you know where the Admiral Hotel is?}

\strong{""Yes, I know it's in Callaway Street.""}
\end{itemize}

Now the speaker knows what kind of hotel you are asking for and where it is located in relation to the interlocutor. But the speaker doesn't know if he himself will be able to find such a hotel since he doesn't know if he knows which side of Callaway Street the admiral hotel is on, or where exactly it is in that street (which part?). He could answer with ""I don't know"" but that would mean nothing.
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Excuse me sir! Do you know where Admiral Hotel is?}

\strong{""Yes I know it's somewhere near the intersection of Callaway and Dockside Street.""}
\end{itemize}

The speaker now knows what kind of hotel, in which street and at what intersection. But he doesn't know if that means north or south of the intersection, so his answer might be wrong. In this case, you can ask him to describe it more precisely by asking him to tell you where exactly on Dockside Street and whether Admiral Hotel is north or south of that intersection.
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{Excuse me sir! Do you know where Admiral Hotel is?}

\strong{""Yes I know it's somewhere near the intersection of Callaway and Dockside Street.""}

\em{""So, which side of that intersection is the hotel? Is it north or south?""}

\strong{""It's on the north side. In fact, the Admiral Hotel is a few blocks south of here but you can see the sign from here.}
\end{itemize}"

"" And what makes you think you haven't tried it properly ? ""

"" Because it takes me an hour to get ready in the morning , and I still don't look great . ""

"" So, that's your problem? You want more amenities because you can't do your hair properly?""

"" Exactly ! ""

"" I see. And what about the rest of us ? What makes you think we would even want to go through all that trouble? Why do you think that everybody else on this ship doesn't just wash their hair with water like everyone else does in your family?""

"" Well, because it's not nice.""

"" Not nice? I think the problem is more fundamental than that. Have you ever asked yourself why you and your family have so much extra money to spend on souvenirs and amenities ? ""

"" No . We just have a lot of money, that's all ! ""

"" Well , I see. It seems like there are a few misunderstandings here.""

"" What do you mean? ""

"" For instance , I think maybe we should talk about what 'enough' means.""

"" Enough is enough . ""

"" How do you know when something is 'enough'?""

"" It's simple. If it costs a lot of money, then it must be a lot.""

"" Why do you think that ?""

"" I don't have to explain why ! You just have to know what 'enough' means . ""

"" And how much is enough?""

"" That depends on the situation.""

"" What does it depend on? ""

"" Well , for example , when I'm in New York City, it would take a lot of money to get me through the day. But if you took me to someplace like Mississippi or Indiana , then I wouldn't need any money at all.""

"" Okay , so maybe 'enough' is not exactly the right word . ""

"" Of course it is ! Enough means having enough for your needs.""

"" And what are your needs?""

"" Well, first of all there's food. If you don't have enough food , then you die.""

"" Right . ""

"" But I need more than just food to live a full life. I also need shelter and clothing.""

"" I see . So do I .""

"" So, why does anybody want to spend money on souvenirs and amenities?""

"" Because they're fun ! ""

"" What is the difference between fun and survival ?""

"" Well , one is fun , and the other is not.""

"" You see . The problem here has nothing to do with money. It all comes down to what we really need to have in our lives, versus what we think we want to have . ""

"" There is a solution to that problem . We have these nice little bottles of shampoo and shower gel. Would you like one ? ""

"" That would be great ! ""

"" All right , here we go ! ""

( The voice fades out as the man opens the door to his room . )

"" Okay . We're not giving away free souvenirs . But if I give you a $25.00 voucher will that be sufficient ? ""

"" No , it won't . If I can't take back my soap and shampoo to use as souvenir soap and shampoo , then there's no point in giving me the vouchers . ""

"" But if you want free amenities , why didn't you just say so ? ""

"" Because I don't like getting what I ask for ! ""

250. Question: Hi Jim , can you give me some advice about my job?
Answer: Sure. What kind of work do you do now? I worked for a while at an insurance company, but found that it wasn ’ t what I was interested in. I decided to change jobs and get more experience in the field that I wanted to be in. The best way to find out about other jobs is to talk to people who already work in them. If you don’t know anybody at your school who has the kind of job you want, go to a classroom or an office where there are a lot of people and start asking questions. I met one of my friends by talking to him when he was working on his car.

I have also found that it helps to read about jobs in books like this one, so look around at the library until you find something interesting. You can also write letters or talk to people who know about a job that you are interested in. Don ’ t be afraid of trying new things! It’s a great way to learn and to get experience. Good luck!

- _Teacher's Note :_ The vocabulary word "" field"" (noun) means the area of study or work that is related to your job, such as insurance or sales.

251. Question: Jim , can I come in and talk with you?
Answer: Of course! Just knock on my door when I’m not busy.
- _Teacher's Note :_ ""Just"" (adv.) means ""immediately,"" as in the previous sentence.

252. Question: Jim , what should I do about my job search?
Answer: It sounds like you could use some advice on that! Let me give you a few suggestions. First, keep your eyes open for jobs wherever you go; read the classified ads in the paper and talk to people. You might also want to check out employment agencies. Then, when you find something you’re interested in, apply for it and see what happens. If they call you back, show up on time for your interview — and be sure to dress neatly and carry a copy of your resume. Then sit down and relax while the interviewer asks questions about why you think you would fit into his company, how much experience you’ve had in related jobs and what kind of salary you expect. The last thing you want to do is give them reasons for turning you down!
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words ""applies for"" (verb) means that someone sends an application to a company or school, usually by mail but sometimes in person.

253. Question: Jim , why does it take so long to get a job?
Answer: It depends on your situation, and there are many different things you can do to help the process along. For example, you might want to ask for suggestions from people you know who have found good jobs recently — or if they don ’ t work in your area of interest, maybe they can point you to someone who does. You could also check out the school placement office; many employers look there first when they need to fill vacancies. Finally, it might help to put together a list of all the places where you’ve worked or volunteered — including any details about your responsibilities and achievements — so that you can have ready references if someone calls them for a reference check. Good luck!
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words ""achievements"" (noun) means the things you do well, such as getting good grades or helping people with problems. You might also see the word ""accomplishments.""

254. Question: Jim , what does “interview” mean? Answer: It’s an important part of applying for a job — it’s your chance to talk with the hiring manager and tell him why you should be chosen over all the other candidates who applied. During this interview, he or she will usually ask questions about your work experience and any training or schooling that you have had; then they may ask you to give examples of times when you made a difference at each place where you worked or studied. At the end of the interview, be sure to ask if there are any other steps in applying for this position before making up your mind about whether it’s right for you! Good luck with it.
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words ""make a difference"" (idiom) means that you have done something good at work or school and the person who hired you is happy about it. You might also say, ""do well"" or ""get ahead.""

255. Question: Jim , what does “salary” mean? Answer: It’s an amount of money given to someone for their job — usually in addition to any other benefits they receive like health insurance or vacation time off each year. The word comes from the French word ""salaire"", which means ""wages,"" and it’s often used when talking about payments made by employers rather than employees themselves (like if someone were working as a consultant). If you’re considering taking a new job, be sure to ask what kind of salary they offer first — then compare this amount with other offers before making up your mind!
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words ""addition"" (noun) and ""benefit"" are often used together in business English. When the word ""addition"" is followed by ""to,"" it usually refers to more money that you earn on top of your regular pay, for example when working overtime or as a bonus for doing something well at work. You might also say, ""extras.""

256. Question: Jim , can you tell me what a job interview is like? Answer: Sure! An interview usually starts by introducing yourself to the person who will be conducting it; then they’ll ask about your past experience and qualifications for this position (or any other positions that may interest them). If everything goes well, at some point during or after the conversation, they might offer you a chance to make sure there isn't anything else they want from you before making their decision. Don’t be afraid to ask questions about what kind of training they provide for new employees and whether there are any benefits included with this position — especially if it’s more than one year long!
- _Teacher's Note :_ The word ""offer"" (verb) is used in two different ways. When it means to make an offer, you can use the simple form (""to give something away""). If you are not sure about making a promise or saying yes or no at this time, then use ""propose"": ""I propose that we talk for half an hour."" You might also say, ""I suggest ...""

257. Question: Jim , can I speak to one of the managers here? Answer: Sure! Let me ask him if it's a good time right now... he's actually in the middle of something but maybe we could come back later today or tomorrow morning instead... ok, let’s go talk to him then.
- _Teacher's Note :_ When someone asks if it is ""a good time"" (idiom) they mean that you should wait until a better opportunity comes along in the future. In other words, this could be another chance for them to meet later on when things are less busy at work.

258. Question: Jim , what can I do if my boss doesn ’ t want me to work overtime? Answer: If you have any concerns or questions about what your job might entail — whether it’s how many hours per week they expect from an employee before paying them extra for working more than that amount — ask these things before accepting the position! In fact, even if there isn’t anything specific written down in contract form (which would make any kind of discussion about this subject easier), don ’ t hesitate to bring up this issue during your first meeting with him/her: ""I was wondering what kind of schedule I should expect while working here...""
- _Teacher's Note :_ The words ""expect"" and ""should"" are very important in job interviews. When you use them, it means that you want to know more about the job before deciding whether or not it’s right for you. You might also say, ""require.""

259. Question: Jim , I need help with my resume! Answer: Sure thing! What kind of job are you looking at? Maybe we can look together and talk about what kind of things to include in yours... maybe even write some new ones down if needed (don ’ t worry, they won’t cost anything).

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,285,llama-2-7b@q8_0_285.txt,""" Ok . Thank you ! ""

"" Then which is better? ""

"" I think it's best to take the 13 bus , because you can get off anywhere when you need to. ""

### Explanation of the answer:

We can see that we have used the following structures in this dialogue:
- Present Simple to talk about things which are going on now and will continue (e.g.: We use the present simple for everyday habits). 

""Where are you going, Jane?"" is a question to get more information from somebody who we already know. This type of questions often come in English conversation: ""What time are you going out?"" ""How long does it take to get there?"" 

We use the Present Continuous when something happens now or at that moment, for example, when someone is speaking: “I’m playing basketball” (at that moment) or when somebody is doing something right now.

In this dialogue we have used: ""She was a little better"" which means she isn't feeling as bad as she did before. The verb to be + adverb is called the ""be-adverbs"", and they are used to show how someone feels at that moment. 

Whenever we ask for information or want to make an offer, it’s best to give options: “A number 7 bus will take you there.” We can use this structure when making offers in English conversation (e.g.: Would you like another beer?)

“The 13 buses run much more frequently” shows the frequency of the bus service and the fact that the information is accurate (because Jane said it).

When we give advice, we can say which option is best: “I think it's best to take the 13 bus because you can get off anywhere when you need to.”"

여름방학이다 ! 이때는 푸드트럭이 정비를 하지 않는다. 그래서 아무리 고민을 하자, 가진 건 맛없는 음식만 바라보는 일에 시간이 들어갈 수도 없다.

저희는 모두 학교로 가지 않을 무렵에, 하차하여 아는 사람에게 정말 고마워해요 ! 이제 가진 건 다만 바나나와 팥밭스켓, 그리고 15억원의 재미로 구입한 대학교 사진을 모아 페이지를 짜는 것만이다.

일주일 전에도 나도 바나나와 팥밭스켓을 구해서 자기광고를 마무리했다. 그리고 내 소개하는 사람들이 수없이 많아졌다! 하나로 시작된 일, 저에게는 진정한 포스트의 기운이 생기기도 했다.

내가 전학을 넘긴지 4년 만이다. 그리고, 다시 하나의 여정을 함께 해보고자 한다! 저는 어쩌면, 실수를 하거나 도주를 하는 듯이 아무말도 못해도 그림을 통해서 보낸다.

오늘 학교 앞에서 내 재미로 만들어진 장편 연극의 크레딧을 소개하고자 한다. 그럼, 더 나아가! 삶은 여정이라는 것이다.

Soon they began to be interested in what I said. I never shouted at them. Whenever a child did something wrong, I would use my hands as if clapping in order to draw attention ; then I said, “Look here! ” and pointed out the child ’ s mistake.
I have been practicing this way for some time . My children are very much interested in what I say, even though they don’t understand everything ; they will ask me questions. So we can communicate with each other easily. They are becoming more and more patient when listening to me . Sometimes we even talk together about the things that interest them .
I have a habit of clapping my hands when something good happens . It is also important for the children to know what is going on . If I am not there, they will do it by themselves. As time goes by , they are getting better and better at it ; even when no one claps, they keep doing it .
When you speak with your child about something he or she likes, try using this method : 1 ) Use your hands to attract the child ’ s attention. (This is not the same as shouting.) 2 ) Point out what you want your child to notice by using a particular gesture or expression of voice .
If you follow these steps, I think you will find it easy to teach and learn from each other."

I. The Chinese Character

What does ""character"" mean in China? It doesn't mean just one person, as it might seem to the Western mind; instead it refers to the combination of all the forces and ideas that constitute a nation.

In the past there were no written characters and every nation had its own language system —the Mayas used pictures to communicate, for instance—but China was unique in developing a phonetic script that could be used by all her people. A Chinese character is a picture made up of strokes to indicate sounds. As time went on, the strokes became more and more curved and ornamental until now they are almost like calligraphy paintings themselves.

Chinese characters are divided into two groups: radicals and phonetic symbols. Radicals consist of basic shapes that can be combined with others to make different pictures or sounds, just as the letters _a_ , _b_ , and _c_ can be arranged in many different ways to form words like _apple_ and _abracadabra_. The radicals are themselves composed of simple strokes which have been made into pictographs.

The phonetic symbols, or sounds, are the more complex part of a character. There are sixteen different kinds; five are vowels — _a_ , _e_ , _i_ , _o_ , and _u_ , the others are consonants — _p_ , _k_ , _t_ , _n_ , etc., which sound like the letters in our alphabet, but without the aspiration of the vowels. The vowel sounds may be represented by either one stroke or two strokes and the consonant sounds by one, three or four strokes depending upon how they are written. For example:

The radical for _tree_ ,   ( _shan_ ), is made up of three strokes; but when used as a phonetic symbol, it takes the form  . The symbol for _sun_ has only two strokes to indicate its sound, but when it is used as a radical it becomes  .

Since Chinese characters are read from left to right and top to bottom (from the point of view of the writer), the same character may appear different in the various parts. This is especially true for the phonetic symbols which have four possible ways of being written; two are more frequently used than the others, however, depending upon what sounds the characters have with other ones and how they are arranged when put together to make a word or phrase.

The Chinese character is so complex that even people who speak the same language may not be able to understand each other's writing unless they are using words which have become familiar to both of them, as we would say in America, ""they use the same English."" Even with those who write and read the same characters there will sometimes be differences because of their individual ways of writing; it is like two people speaking the same language but using different dialects.

II. The Artist

The Chinese character is a work of art. In China, calligraphy is an important part of education which children begin to learn early in life. Some calligraphers spend their lives perfecting and refining what they know and developing new ways of writing characters; the result can be as beautiful as any painting or sculpture.

To write a Chinese character, you first draw a vertical line with one stroke (called _yong_ ). This is called the ""ruling pen"" because it gives form to the horizontal lines that follow afterward. After drawing the ruling pen you make five horizontal strokes which are called the ""radical strokes."" Then you add two more horizontal strokes and finally a short vertical line at the top. The Chinese call this last stroke _xing_ , or spirit, because it is like a flame in its upward movement.

The Chinese character is written with either brush or pen and the artist can use either black or red ink to color his writing. If you go into an art store and look at their supplies for calligraphy, you will see that the inks are colored in a variety of different colors —blue, purple, green, etc.—and the paper is made from various materials too; rice paper, silk, bamboo, cotton, wood, metal, and even gold leaf. The coloring may be applied before or after the character is written on the paper but it should be applied with a brush rather than a pen because this gives you more control over what you are doing.

The tools used to write Chinese characters consist of: one ink stick; two ink sticks held together; five brushes and an ink stone. The ink stone is made from either quartz, agate or jade depending upon the coloring required. To make the ink, you put a little water on your paper with which to clean off the dust before you begin writing. Then you take your ink stick (or sticks) and rub it against the stone until it is moistened. You then use a brush to draw on top of this.

In the past there was no such thing as modern calligraphy paper, so artists made their own by adding water to rice, wheat or other flour and letting this harden before drawing on it with ink. Today the paper is available at most art stores but I prefer to use natural materials when possible because they make a better surface for writing than anything man can produce.

The ink is also made from different substances depending upon what you want your coloring to be —black, red or other colors—and this is why there are so many kinds of Chinese calligraphy paper available now. You might think that one kind would be better than another but I have found that using natural materials for both ink and paper gives me more control over what I am writing because the brush always seems to respond differently depending upon the type of surface on which it is being written.

The Chinese character is a work of art. It is like painting with words because you start by drawing one line after another until you have made an entire picture with its own special meaning that can only be understood if you are familiar with both the writing and the culture from which it comes. Calligraphy is a language which combines words, pictures and thoughts into something which has its own beauty no matter how simple or elaborate it may appear to others who do not understand what they see.

III. The Artist

""I would like to write a story for you . ""

"" Really ? That's very nice of you . ""

"" Yes . My name is Li Cheng-hua and I'm from Beijing in China . I came here two months ago with some friends who are also calligraphers. We live near each other but we don't know any English so we wanted to come over to your country for a while before returning home again. It was very difficult at first because none of us spoke any English except what we had learned in school, which wasn't much really . But now we have been here long enough that most people can understand some Chinese and we feel more comfortable with the language than when we first arrived.""

"" That is wonderful ! I have always wanted to know more about China. My mother was born there but she died when I was only two years old so I never had a chance to meet her . ""

"" Oh , I'm sorry about that . But maybe you will have another opportunity someday ? ""

"" Yes, perhaps I will . Tell me more about yourself. What do you like best about America ? ""

"" Well , the people are very friendly and there is no problem getting along with them because almost everyone speaks English so we don't feel as if we have to hide our feelings or worries when we meet someone new. The food here is also better than what I am used to back home; it tastes more like real vegetables instead of just being a mixture of dried beans and grains like they do in China where most people are poor enough that they can't afford fresh food every day.""

"" I think that's wonderful ! Where do you live ? ""

"" Oh , we've got an apartment not far from here . It's pretty small but at least it's close to the university where my friends are studying for their degrees so we can visit them there too.""

"" What do they study ? ""

"" Mostly English literature and history, as well as Chinese culture. They have some books about calligraphy in their library which is really helpful because I don't know any better than what I learned at home.""

"" That must be hard . Where did you learn to write Chinese characters ? ""

"" From my parents and grandparents, of course ! It seems strange to think that people here don't even know how to read the words they use every day; they just say them out loud without understanding what they mean or where they came from.""

"" Don't be ridiculous , you can sleep on the ground if there are no mosquitoes or frogs. And besides ...""

"" Oh , yeah ? What do you suggest that we use for a bed ? ""

"" Well ... maybe an air mattress ... ""

"" Oh , sure ! An inflatable something to lie on . Surely the campground will have those things around somewhere . ""

"" Don't be silly ! You know how campgrounds are. The only place you can sleep is in your own tent. Besides, if there are mosquitoes or frogs , we can just stay inside and watch TV.""

"" So ... where exactly are we going ? ""

"" Someplace called Forked Lake . It's about three hours out of town . ""

"" That's pretty far out in the sticks. What if there isn't any electricity , or cable TV, or a grocery store nearby ? ""

"" Don't worry ... there are campgrounds all over this country with electricity and TV. I just want to get away from it all for a few days . ""

"" Yeah ! The last thing you need is to be in the middle of nowhere and suddenly realize you're out of Cds, or that your hair looks like crap, or your makeup isn't waterproof anymore.""

"" It's not really going to be in the middle of nowhere ... just a few miles from town . ""

"" Yeah ! But you never know who lives near campgrounds . Maybe some yokel will come walking down the road and see us in our tents. The last thing we want is for him to start talking to us about what he thinks about Obama, or Hillary, or whatever.""

"" Hey , there's no way anyone around here would talk like that. There are too many smart people who live out here to talk like that . ""

"" Sure ! You can find some nice people in any town . But if you really want a camping trip without having to deal with stupid people, you need to go out where there aren't any towns.""

"" Well , I just hope that it's not too far from the highway ... ""

"" Yeah ! If we're three hours from the nearest town , we better be able to get to a hospital or something if we have an emergency . ""

"" Don't worry ! I read in one of those magazines that you can call 911 on your cell phone if it's really an emergency . ""

"" You know what ? I just hope this trip is worthwhile. If all we do is sit around and watch TV , then the whole point was a waste. Besides ... don't you think that camping is supposed to be, well , fun ?""

"" I'm sure it will be . ""

"" I'm going to take some CDs . And maybe one of those little radios where you can play your own music and don't have to worry about being able to pick up a station . Just in case we get stuck in the middle of nowhere with no way out. ""

"" Yeah ! We might even see some bears or deer . Or wild turkeys ... I never saw any wild turkeys until one year when my grandfather took us camping and there were like thousands of them all over the place.""

"" We'll probably run into a lot of tourists , too. It will be great to see what kinds of things other people do on vacation . ""

"" You know , I hope we have cell phone service out here . Because if not, and I can't get one of my hair-care magazines from the library, then this trip might not turn out to be that much fun.""

"" Don't worry ! You'll get a chance to read your magazine. The campgrounds are usually near restaurants and stuff like that . ""

"" Yeah ! And there will probably be stores nearby where we can buy junk food if we get really bored ... ""

"" We should bring some games or something for the kids , too.""

"" I hope they don't whine about being bored all day. If that happens, it would ruin my whole vacation.""

"" Hey ! This is supposed to be a camping trip for everyone ... not just you . ""

"" Well , if the kids are bored and can't find anything fun to do , they can always play video games on their handheld gadgets or something. ""

"" Yeah ! We could even bring our own DVD player if we want.""

"" Hey ! Maybe there will be a pool somewhere nearby, or a beach . If there is, maybe my husband and I can go swimming without having to worry about getting sunburned , like last year when we went on that cruise with those people from church. ""

"" I just hope this campground has real showers ... because if it doesn't, then I'll probably spend all day trying to get clean. And besides ... if there aren't any stores around, then how are we supposed to buy groceries ?""

"" Don't worry ! We can bring our own food and just cook on the camping stove.""

"" That won't be too much fun , I don't think . ""

"" Well , at least we won't have to worry about bugs or mosquitoes or frogs while we're eating dinner ... ""

"" Yeah ! And if there isn't any electricity, then I guess you'll get to learn how to use your flashlight. ""

"" You know , maybe this whole camping trip is a bad idea .""

"" It won't be that bad.""

"" All right ! If it makes you happy , then we can go ... but if we end up spending the entire weekend sitting around and watching TV or reading magazines, then I'm going to be disappointed. ""

"" There will definitely be more stuff to do than that.""

"" You never know . Maybe it won't work out. Maybe the campground is all booked up , like last year when we tried to go somewhere on Labor Day weekend and had to stay at a hotel instead of a tent because there weren't any openings anywhere.""

"" I just hope they have some kind of phone service or internet so that if something happens, then someone can call 911 or contact our insurance company. ""

"" You don't need cell phones or the internet to do that . You could always use a pay phone if there isn't any other way.""

"" Yeah ! And besides ... I bet there will be restaurants and stuff within driving distance , so we won't have to worry about starving. ""

"" If you really want this camping trip to happen , then why don't you just make the reservations right now ? ""

"" Because I need a little time to figure out what I'm going to pack . ""

"" Just bring whatever clothes and shoes that fit ... we can always buy more if something gets lost or ruined.""

"" But what about my hair ? It's already starting to frizz from the humidity ... and besides , my hair products are not waterproof.""

"" Don't worry ! You'll figure it out . ""

"" Yeah ! I can put my makeup in a plastic bag so that it doesn't melt while we're driving down the road.""

"" Okay ... let me call our insurance company and see if they have any good advice about camping or something. ""

"" Okay . Bye ! We'll talk again soon ... I hope ! ""

The woman who was talking about the driver’s skills said angrily:
""What? You don ’ t know how to drive either! You also think that this is a beautiful place. Let me tell you that I will never go to any scenic spot again in my life, no matter what kind of beauty it has . ""

The woman hesitated, but finally agreed. At this time, the car came to a stop and the two of them got off. They walked along the way to the foot of the mountain, where there were not many people. It was quite quiet here. The man took out his mobile phone and dialed a number:
""Hello, is that you? ""

"" Who else can it be! You come out first . ""

""Hello, are you still not here yet? Come quickly . ""
The woman beside him heard it and looked over. There were four young men standing at the foot of a cliff about ten meters high. At first glance, they could not see who they were looking for. The man’s mobile phone rang again:
""Let me tell you that I will never come to this kind of place in my life . ""
The woman next to him said angrily:
""Shut up! Let ’ s go and have a look, maybe there is something to see here!""
The man looked at the young men below and then walked down with the two. He went straight towards them and saw that they were all wearing casual clothes and their hair was messy. One of them said:
""Brother Fang, this is your girlfriend . ""
As soon as she heard this sentence, the woman beside her became furious! She shouted angrily:
""You are wrong! You must be blind to recognize me , I am not Brother Fang ’ s girlfriend at all !""
The man said angrily:
""What? Didn ’ t we come here together?""
The woman beside him said angrily: ""You can tell your brother who I am ?!""
The man was a little embarrassed. He hurriedly asked the other party for forgiveness, but before he could finish his words, he was interrupted by the young man below again:

"" What are you going to do now ? "" ( Jane walks into Tim ’ s room and asks him what he wants. He says that he wants another piece of bread and she hands him one while Jack stands by the window again, looking out at the garden. Sally is still lying on her bed when she calls Jack’s name )

"" Where are you going ? "" ( Jane goes into Timmy ’ s room to give him some water as well. She tells him that she wants to talk with Jack while he walks into the kitchen and puts his hands in his pockets. He looks outside at Sally, who is lying on her bed )

"" What are you doing now , Jane ? "" ( Timmy comes out of his room and stands by his mother. They start talking about what they did today. Jack walks to the door while he asks where Sally is. He does not say anything as she follows him into the kitchen, where Jane is standing at the table with her head in her hands )

"" I don ’ t know . Maybe we should call the police ? "" ( Timmy stands next to his mother and looks out at Jack, who has taken a seat by the window. They talk about what they did today. Sally comes back into the kitchen and starts talking with Jack, asking him where he wants to go now )

"" I don ’ t know . Maybe we should call the police ? "" ( Jane walks over to Timmy, who is standing next to his mother and asks why he said that again. He answers her question before she talks about what they did in their morning routine )

"" Do you want a piece of bread ? "" ( Jack stands by the window looking outside at Sally, who is sitting on a chair next to Jane while Timmy comes into the kitchen and sits down at the table. They start talking about what they did that morning again )

"" No ; thank you . "" ( Jane walks over to where she stood before when Jack was sitting by the window looking out of it. She asks if he is hungry and then says that she wants to go outside to talk with Sally again, but Jack does not answer her question. He stands next to his mother who walks away from him )

"" What are you doing now ? "" ( Jane looks around the room while she talks about what happened today, before Jack comes into it and sits down at the table again. Timmy asks where he wants to go, but Sally does not answer her question. Instead, she stands by the window looking out of it )

"" Maybe we should call the police ? "" ( Jane walks back into the room and talks with Jack once more before they both walk over to where Tim is standing on his bed. She asks what he wants and then tells him that he can go outside again as soon as she has finished talking about what happened today )

"" What do you want ? "" ( Jane

"" You see , I can ’ t tell you everything that happened in a minute , because there were so many things going on. But Tim was sitting under the tree, and he saw Sally sitting in the garden . Then Jack came running into the garden, calling for Sally , but she couldn’t hear him , because she had put her head down on the table . So she said "" Jack , what ’ s happened to you ? Why are you crying so much ? "" But he was just shouting and shouting. "" Tim !"" he shouted , and then he ran away .
So I went into the garden and asked Sally , where Jack had gone, but she couldn’t hear me either because her head was still down on the table. So I said "" Jack!"" very loudly , and that ’ s when he came back. "" Oh !"" he cried "" It ’ s you! I thought it was Tim . But wait a minute !"" he ran into the house and got his father’s trumpet, which made such a big sound that we could hear him anywhere in the garden.
Sally jumped up from her chair , and said "" Oh my goodness me ! What ’ s happened to you , Jack ? Why are your eyes so red ? Are you crying ?"" But he just ran round in circles with his trumpet, making such a noise that we couldn’t hear what he was saying .
Tim came running from the tree and said "" Jack ! Jack !"" and he picked him up and carried him off into the house. Then I went out of the garden to look for Sally , but she was gone.""

"" He ’ s lying on the grass by the garden fence . ""

"" And what are you doing , Jane ? ""

"" I am picking up flowers for Sally and Tim to give them in the morning . ""

"" Is there anybody else in the garden with us , then ? ""

"" There ’ s only Mother. She is sitting on the doorstep reading a book . ""

"" Where have they all gone ? ""

"" They have just been here for five minutes and then suddenly they were not here any more ! ""

"" What happened to them then ? ""

"" I don’t know exactly , but I think there is something very strange about it . ""

"" Do you mean to say that you really believe in magic ? ""

"" Of course. There is no other explanation for what we saw . ""

"" But we were only children then and now we are grown-up people ! We know better than that. ""

"" Perhaps . But if you could see the way those flowers moved it would convince you, too ! ""

"" Do you really mean to say that you can do magic ? ""

"" Yes , I do . Of course, I am not a real witch like Sally but I can make flowers grow and things like that . ""

"" Can you also turn into an animal and fly through the air as they did in _Aladdin_? ""

""No , of course not. But there is a story about how I once turned myself into a dog ! ""

"" Really ? ""

"" Yes, really . It happened when I was seven years old . My father had bought me a new kite and we were flying it in the garden when my mother saw an animal looking at us from behind the hedge. She said that she didn’t think it was safe to have a child alone with such a big dog so close by, so I went into the house to telephone her and ask her for some advice. I wanted to go home , but I couldn’t find any other way to get there .

"" The only thing I could do was wait until she came back and then try to take a bus to my father ’ s office. There are no buses in the city where we live, so if I took one it would have cost me more than five minutes , but that wouldn’t matter because I had plenty of time before our next meeting .

"" It was already dark by then and the kite flew around without any help from us. Then we saw something moving behind a hedge on the other side of the road, just where the dog had been sitting down before, so my mother came over to watch what it was doing there—she thought I must have lost something else, too . But when she saw that all three cats were chasing after him with their tails curled up like snakes behind them , she ran out of the house again and came running back into our yard screaming: “Run ! Run ! The dogs are coming !”

"" We both took off immediately, but before I could get through the gate at home there was another loud bark from one side, so I ran across to where my father was sitting on his balcony with a cup of coffee . He saw me running towards him and asked what had happened. “Nothing ” , I said quickly , trying not to look nervous because he wasn’t used to being told that things weren’t going well in our house . Then when I got up close enough for him to see my face clearly without being afraid of hitting anything with his coffee cup—which was probably full anyway since it was already dark outside and we had been sitting there drinking together for quite some time by then —I noticed that he wasn’t smiling anymore either. Instead, his eyes were wide open like they usually are whenever I start telling him something serious . “You said nothing had happened ,” he asked me again calmly as if this wasn't important at all .

"" But you know better than anyone else what can happen when there aren’t any cats around . The dogs don’t care who they kill—they will just chase them down and rip their throats out until they’re dead ! And once those cats are gone , all the other animals come running too. There won’t be anything left in our garden for us to eat!
"" This is what I told him, but he didn't seem impressed by my words at all . Instead, he just shrugged his shoulders as if everything was fine now that we knew where each other were standing when it mattered most—which wasn’t really true since there aren’t many places in this house where you can actually stand still without being stepped on or tripped over.
"" Then my mother came back home again, and I ran into the living room to tell her what had happened . She was sitting on one of those chairs that have high backs , so when she saw me coming through the doorway behind my father’s armchair she jumped up quickly without saying anything except: “Huh !” which means something different from huh but is still very useful for showing surprise . And then we both went back outside again where my father had already gone into our garden. He was standing on a ladder , trying to pull down some branches that were growing over the fence and blocking our view of everything else except each other !
"" “What are you doing ? ” I asked him . “Why don’t we just go out onto the street instead?” But he shook his head . ""No , it would be better if we could see what was happening outside without having to leave our house. If there is anyone coming over here from anywhere else, then they can easily walk up behind us and kill us both before we know anything about them !
"" I didn’t say anything for a moment because this seemed like a good idea . But then , just as my father finished climbing down off of the ladder , he suddenly jumped back up again onto it, so now he was standing on top of his head with one leg still on the ground. And when he started walking towards me I could see that he wasn’t really paying attention to where he was going at all . Instead, he kept looking straight ahead as if trying to find something in particular among those tall trees behind us—or maybe just some place where no one would ever see him again !
"" As soon as we were both safely out of sight inside our house , however , everything changed completely . My father came over and started patting me on the back while saying something like: “Don’t worry , dear, you are not alone anymore ! I’ll take care of things now.” Then he went outside again to look for more cats or dogs or whatever was making so much noise in our neighbourhood.
"" For about half an hour everything stayed quiet until suddenly there was another loud bang from behind us—only this time it wasn't a dog but a car! A big red one with black stripes going all around it , like something out of _Gone With The Wind_ . The next thing I knew my father had already jumped back up onto the ladder again and he was climbing down towards us quickly, holding his flashlight so that its beam could shine directly into our faces!
"" At first we were both too shocked to move or talk , but then after a few seconds had passed without anything happening at all I managed somehow to find my voice. ""W-what do you want ? "" I asked him . But instead of answering me he just turned around and walked slowly back towards the house where he had been standing before—and while doing this he kept shouting something like: “We have got nothing here ! There isn’t a single thing left to eat , so please go home now .
"" Then suddenly everything went dark again. This time I didn't need my eyes at all because even though there wasn't any light coming through the window, I still knew exactly what was happening inside our house: My father had disappeared ! All that remained behind him were two small piles of clothes lying on top of each other . The first one contained everything he had been wearing before; the second consisted only out-of-date underwear and socks.
"" So I started crying because now it seemed like there wasn't any point in staying inside anymore—and then all at once something happened that was even worse than anything else ! The sound of sirens filled our street, followed closely by shouts coming from the other side . In no time flat , dozens upon hundreds upon thousands of cars had appeared around us; cars with blue lights flashing everywhere . It felt like an enormous wave was rising up to swallow us all , but just before it could reach us there came another noise even louder than anything else : A voice shouted: “Hey ! Look out ! ” And right then we were surrounded by men who wore uniforms with black helmets . They seemed so strong and powerful that they might have been able to destroy the world if they wanted to do so.
"" After everything had stopped moving around us , my father finally came back into our house again —and as soon as he saw me standing in front of him he started laughing like crazy ! “How did I know you wouldn't come home sooner ? ” he said . ""It was very easy ! There were lots of people waiting for me outside because they knew what would happen when I got there—they wanted to take my clothes off before giving them away again , so that nobody else could wear them later."""

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,7,llama-2-7b@q8_0_7.txt,""" Three suitcases and a duffle bag . ""

"" Is the duffle bag overstuffed , like this ? ""

The bell captain's hands move quickly into the bag.

"" Yes . But I've had it for years ! It belonged to my father and I always take it with me whenever I travel . ""

"" Oh, I see . And what about these three suitcases ? ""

"" They are overstuffed too . You know , we have so many things here in China that you can't buy there . ""

The bell captain takes out three more items.

"" Okay ! Now may I have your keys please ? ""

He holds up the items he has taken from the bags.

"" Oh, no! Not my jade bracelet and my pearl earrings . They are very valuable , you know . I always keep them in this small box that looks like a jewelry case ! ""

The bell captain tries to open the case , but he can't. He tries again with great effort , but still nothing.

"" And what about the other two items ? ""

"" They are my wife's favorite pieces of jewellery . Please don't lose them ! ""

The bell captain is trying to open the case now, but he can't. He tries again and again with great effort , but still nothing. Finally he asks for help from the bellboy.

"" Look , you need someone bigger . My hands are just too small . Could you please help me ? ""

"" Yes , please see it for yourself. "" Yao Lan showed it to her with her back still facing the receptionist at first. She then turned around slowly.

"" They were sent up quite a long time ago . ""

"" You're welcome . ""

Yao Lan checked out, paid the bill and went upstairs.

At about 10 o'clock in the evening, she received a call from her cousin Yao Zhi Han to tell her that she was at the railway station. After they had exchanged a few words, Yao Lan told him that she was on her way there, which made Yao Zhi Han feel relieved .

The next day , the two got off the train together and started for Yao Lan's new home in B City.

It wasn't until the next morning when they arrived at their destination that Yao Zhi Han realized that Yao Lan had not packed any clothes apart from one or two sets of underwear, which he found rather strange . However , as she had a few shirts and jeans in her bag, he was able to put his mind at rest.

When the two arrived at Yao Lan's home, they discovered that it was not the type of house they had envisioned - no windows, just a plain wooden door; the entire building looked like it could collapse at any moment .

"" This is my new home . ""

Yao Zhi Han said in disbelief.

"" Is there anything wrong ? "" Yao Lan asked , looking quite hurt.

"" No , no , nothing's wrong . You can move right in.""

After Yao Lan finished unpacking, she went downstairs to wash up and found that the shower room didn't even have a curtain; it was a space of about ten square feet that had been divided into two sections by a door. She couldn't help but feel quite worried .

After lunch, Yao Zhi Han accompanied her to go shopping for some groceries and clothes, which took up the whole day . When they got back home at 7 o'clock that evening , she was exhausted ; she didn't even have enough energy to cook dinner, so they bought a couple of plates of noodles from a roadside stall.

The next few days passed in this way. Yao Zhi Han always went back home at about 10 o'clock every evening . He would arrive just as his cousin was putting on her make-up, then he would cook dinner for them both before going to bed himself. The two of them got up very early each morning, and they didn't even have time for a proper breakfast.

Yao Zhi Han felt sorry for Yao Lan every day . He knew that the only reason she had agreed to come with him was because he was her cousin; if it weren't for that , he would never have been able to persuade her to move over here.

One morning, when Yao Zhi Han got up at six o'clock as usual, he suddenly felt that something wasn't quite right and he opened his eyes wider . The room was full of black smoke ; it was only after he had put on a shirt and went outside to take a look around that he discovered the problem: the two-room house that he lived in with his cousin was on fire!

His heart filled with anxiety, he ran into their room. Yao Lan was lying on her bed sound asleep . He shook her awake and asked if she had eaten anything since yesterday evening; she said no and told him to leave quickly - it seemed that the fire hadn't spread very far yet.

Yao Zhi Han took a couple of plates down from their kitchen, filled them up with rice and vegetables, and then ran back into Yao Lan's room with them . When he reached her doorstep , she was sitting on her bed, still fast asleep; so he shook her again.

"" Wake up ! ""

"" I just ate . What are you making such a fuss about ? ""

When Yao Zhi Han saw the food he had brought over for her, he told her to get up and eat it with him . She refused and asked him why she should bother getting up when she was already awake; at that time, the fire didn't seem so urgent anymore.

"" If you don't hurry, I might have to wake you again later . "" He tried to persuade her , but Yao Lan wouldn't move . The fire had now spread all over the building and the smoke was filling the room; he couldn't even see what was going on outside.

"" Hurry up ! "" Yao Zhi Han said, picking up a pair of scissors to cut her hair . He knew that if she were to get burnt to death in this house because she was too lazy to move from her bed, it would be impossible for him ever to find another woman again.

"" Why do you need to cut my hair ? "" Yao Lan asked, covering herself with a blanket and getting ready to go out .

"" You can't wear your hair like this . Hurry up ! ""

Yao Zhi Han grabbed her head and started cutting off her long blond curls in one go - she suddenly felt dizzy. As soon as he had finished cutting them, he put his scissors down and held her shoulders; her face was so pale that he could hardly see it at all.

"" I'll take you to my house for the time being . ""

When Yao Lan woke up again , she discovered that they were already in a new place ; she didn't even recognize where they were. The room was about twice as big as their old one - and it had windows! Yao Zhi Han told her that he had arranged for the owner of this house to move into a small shop to allow them to live here until they could find another home to rent.

At this moment, Yao Lan felt incredibly happy . She thanked him again and again; she knew that without his help , she would have died in the fire. However , although she was very grateful for what he had done, it didn't mean that she could ignore everything else . She still couldn't understand why he wanted to move into a place as bad as this one .

"" You can stay here for a few days until we find something better . "" He told her.

She was speechless. Yao Zhi Han had moved all his clothes and some of hers over from their old house ; she didn't know what to say at that point , so she simply nodded in agreement."

But he forgot this advice.He brought a beautiful bouquet to school . His friend gave him an orange with many green leaves.Jimmy was very happy that day and went home quite late.In the evening he sat in front of his mother while she sewed.It was already dark.Suddenly,his father came into the room :

"" Jimmy ! It's late . Go to bed at once ! ""

"" All right , daddy.""

Jimmy went upstairs with a light heart,but when he was on his bed and had turned out the light,he felt very bad.He began to cry,and all of a sudden he remembered that he hadn't watered the flowers . So he got out of bed and walked down into the garden . He didn't see anything special but one little flower was still in bloom . He thought it looked lovely.So he took the orange,put it under his coat and went back to his room.

Next morning Jimmy woke up quite early as usual ,but when he got out of bed he felt very ill,and had a headache.He had to stay at home from school . It was raining .
His mother was angry with him :""You should have watered the flowers last evening.""But he only shook his head and said nothing.Jimmy went to bed again ,but he couldn't sleep.It got colder and colder,and it began to snow.The next day there wasn't a sign of spring any more .

131.Talking about sports

The games we play are different from country to country.We have tennis and table tennis, basketball , soccer, hockey, handball and volleyball in England.In Spain they play football, tennis, soccer , basket ball and golf .But in some countries there are still more games than this.For example, in South America people play chess, backgammon and bridge.

In England, sports like tennis or table tennis are very popular.They have got a good team for the next Olympic Games.You can hear about them on the radio , because they play every weekend .If you don't want to miss this important game , it is better that you buy yourself a television set !

Sports are also interesting in some countries like Italy or Spain,where they love soccer and football games.But here in England we have got another team for football and tennis.We do not have teams like South America , but if our team wins the next Olympic Games it will be very important !I think you will all hear about this on the radio !

There are also other sports which I don't understand at all .Like,for example, ice hockey or chess and backgammon.In some countries people even play with a ball inside of a glass!You can imagine that it is very dangerous !

132.The most interesting games

A few days ago we had a bad accident in the street where you live.But yesterday we went out again to walk.It was a nice day , so everyone could see us.In our group there were three couples .We played two games .First of all we looked for five objects which begin with 'F' and which are yellow or red !When we found them, we ran to the other side of the street.Then we started another game.

The second game was about a man who is very busy, but he has no time for his family.So , we had to find five things which begin with 'A' and which are made in wood !We couldn't find any wood !So , we had to wait until the next day .And what did you think about these games ?

I have a lot of interests, but there is one sport that I really like very much : badminton.I often play it with my friends and I try to be as good as possible !You know , in this game we need a net between us and our opponents.And you must throw your ball into the other side of the court.But it isn't so easy, because if your friend can hit the ball before you do it , he wins.I like playing this sport with my friends, but I hate playing alone !

Why ? Well , maybe because I have a very bad temper and I often get angry .So, when I play alone sometimes I hit my opponents so hard that they don't want to see me again !

What about you?Do you like badminton or another kind of sport ?If it's not badminton , what is it?Are there some sports in your country which we haven't got here in England ?I should like to know all these things!

134.My favourite sport

Everyone knows that I am very interested in this subject,because my mother and father are professional golf players !They play a lot of matches on television.So you can see them every day .They won some important competitions last year.I know everything about this game,so I can help them when they want me to do so .

Now , what is your favourite sport ?What does it mean 'to be interested' ?Well, for example, if you are interested in golf you always think of it !You can play it and watch other people playing.But there are some sports which we don't have here in England.Like chess or tennis , but I am not so good at these games .I am more interested in football.Do you like this sport as well ?If not , why ?

135.What kind of exercise is better for us?

A few days ago one of the boys was sick because he didn't have enough food .He felt very tired all day long and then his mother took him to the doctor .The doctor examined him carefully.Then they found out that the boy needed more vitamins !So , they gave him some special tablets which will help him in future !

Do you know what 'vitamine' means ?Well , it is a natural substance which our body needs for living .If we don't have enough vitamines,we can get ill.It doesn't matter whether you are a child or an adult;you need these things too !So, you must take care that you eat right and don't forget your tablets !

Do you know any other important things for keeping yourself fit ?The first thing is to sleep enough every day .Don't work too much in the garden , because it might hurt your hands.And if you have problems with breathing or anything like that,see a doctor as soon as possible!I hope you won't need this advice !

136.Ways of exercising

A few days ago my mother was ill and couldn't get up from the bed .So , we had to look for someone who could help us.And our neighbour suggested that I should walk more often because he said that exercise is very important for keeping your body fit !Then I began to take special exercises with a friend of mine.We took them every day and they helped me a lot!

Now , do you know what 'exercising' means ?It means training our muscles .For this we need some good shoes, because our legs are very important for walking.If we walk too often or too far in bad shoes,we can get blisters on our feet.Do you think that these things are interesting ?We had to go to the doctor two times,because my mother needed special medicine and I got a small wound on my foot !

Sometimes there is very good weather outside , so we like to go out for walking .I am sure that when you're old enough,you will understand how important it is to have a good health.If you do not take care of yourself at all ,it could be too late then!So , don't forget about your mother and father !

137.Games in the air

A few days ago one of my friends went away for three weeks because he had to work .He said that if there wasn't enough money,he would come back sooner .But now he is still at his new job and we haven't seen him for a very long time.I don't know what it is like at the place where he works , but I heard that sometimes you can make a lot of money there !

So what do you think about this?Maybe it isn't so good for him to spend all his free time working ?Well,it depends on your job and how much money you earn.But if your friends come back,you have to write letters to them regularly ,because they need this from their family and friends!

And do you know why we should write letters ?Well , because sometimes we can't talk about our problems with our friends when they are away .When I go for a weekend trip to France,I always take some letters with me.So what do you think about this?If I want to tell my parents something which happened on the way,they will have to wait until Monday morning !

138.Healthy food and drinks

A few days ago my mother was sick because she ate too much fruit , but now it is better .She has got an infection because of this , so I've got to buy her medicine from the doctor !But what can you do against this?I hope that we won't need this again soon,but if there are no tablets for her , we will have to see a doctor!

What do you think about these things ?Well,you must take care of yourself and your friends when they eat too much fruit .Maybe you should try some other food instead !Like hamburgers or sandwiches .But remember that everything has got its good side as well as its bad side !So , what do you prefer?Sandwiches or hamburgers ?

Do you know why we shouldn't eat so many potatoes and bread ?Well,it is because they make our teeth yellow !If we don't have any money to buy something else at the supermarket , we should look for some old fruit instead of buying new ones .So if I had known this before ,I would never do it again!But now everything is better again and my mother feels much healthier than before!

139.Keeping fit with sports

A few days ago one of my friends was sick because he didn't take enough exercise !He felt very tired all day long, so he went to the doctor .The doctor examined him carefully and then they found out that his body wasn't strong enough .So , he gave him some special tablets which will help him in future!

Do you know what 'exercising' means?Well , it is training our muscles.For this we need some

"" I don 't know, doctor . ""

"" Has he got a temperature ? ""

"" No , it's not that , doctor . My husband is away on business.He's in New York . ""

"" You can't go to him at once ? ""

"" No , doctor. I couldn 't go if I wanted to.""

"" Tell me when he comes back, will you ? ""

"" Yes , of course . Thank you , doctor.I hope Jimmy gets better soon ! ""

"" I'll call again tomorrow evening . Good-bye , Mrs Williams ! ""

"" Good-bye , doctor . Thank you very much."""

""Fifteen thousand yuan . We still have more than thirty thousand left in our current account. I think we should be fine for now.""

""Let me tell you something else , Miao Ping. The interest on the 20th of each month is settled at quarter-end. It also needs to be paid off when you close your bank account . ""

"" yes , I'm sure they have something really good ! Let me look at the menu again . ""

"" I think we should drink water for now , since it's so hot outside and there are lots of other things on the menu that look good . How about you ? ""

"" yeah, I guess so as well.""

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,268,llama-2-7b@q8_0_268.txt,""" Oh ! You can just use a simple white card with your name and phone number on it , then no one will know you work at the bank or not . I don ’ t think they need a fancy business card anyway . ""

"" Well, that is a different story . People always want to promote their personal brands and be known in the circle of business world , so everyone should have his own card as part of professional image . But some people do work at big corporations which already has its own standard design . I guess it would not look good if they try to put their own brand on that card . ""

"" For me, it is a bit different from the idea you ’ ve just expressed . As for me , there are some people who really love and want to have their own business cards and use them when they go through business trips or workshops or networking events or job interviews . Those kinds of occasions always call for such kind of special cards, which is not only a way to promote personal brand but also a way to make good impression on others . ""

"" I see your point ! But I think it takes more than just the design and quality of card , in fact , the contents are as important as the form . If you ’ re an illustrator, then you must put some interesting designs or illustrations on it . ""

"" That is so true . Even if a card has the best design of all , but nobody can read it due to its small size and complicated words , that will be useless . A good business card should be concise yet informative, easy to understand while showing personal style , at the same time it should be large enough for people to notice easily . ""

"" I totally agree with you . To attract attention , a card should have strong visual impact which makes an image of yourself in one glance . There are some simple designs with few words and colorful backgrounds that can show your personality while also easy to read at first sight . But there is another way too , like using pictures or illustrations as the main contents on cards . It looks very interesting but sometimes it only works for a certain group of people who love them . I still prefer concise text with clear information written in a simple way that is not hard to understand for all people no matter what their backgrounds are . ""

"" Yes, business card designers should also think about how they can use space to the best advantage. The size of card doesn ’ t always have to be standardized , you may also try some interesting folding and see if it looks good or not . But there is a common sense that every person wants to have something large enough for easy reading and no one likes to receive a very small business card with unreadable words . ""

"" I think there are many ways to make a design look special but all of them should be well-planned, such as the size, color, images and text on cards . A good example is the artist who makes his own designs , like those crazy paintings with colors everywhere and some words or sentences written in different styles . The same thing can also happen to a business card . But the key is that everything should look organized yet not dull or boring, which I think we have been discussed earlier . ""

"" That ’ s right . Some people might use pictures of their favorite characters instead of text information about themselves , some may write short sentences only while some will use special fonts to show their own style . But the most important thing is that everything on cards should be organized in a way so it looks clear and easy to understand for others without any effort needed from them . ""

"" I like using pictures of my favorite cartoon characters . That makes my business card unique and people can notice me easily even if they do not have much time to read everything about me . Of course, it also depends on how I design the layout , so sometimes a picture or a character only takes up a part of space and other information is displayed in different ways such as using colors , size or typeface etc. ""

"" Yes ! Pictures can be used in many different ways to make your card look special . There are some people who love their pets so much that they put their pictures on business cards instead of writing words about themselves . Some might want something simple but with a colorful background which looks good from distance . I think the key is choosing what you like and putting it all together in an organized way . ""

"" Well, my advice for people who want to design their own cards would be to just try some different things , such as using pictures instead of text information about yourself or combining colors with images which make them look very unique but still readable from distance . A good example is a card that has only one picture and no words at all , but it will definitely catch people ’ s eyes because they can see what you do easily without even reading anything else on your cards . ""

"" That sounds like a great idea ! But I think there should be some basic things about business cards which everyone needs to keep in mind before creating any design, such as choosing the best size for your card (the standard is 3.5×2 inch) , making sure it ’ s not too small or large and also picking out colors that go well with each other . Another thing you need to consider when planning how you will use space on a business card is what information you want to put in each section of the card so everything fits together nicely without taking up too much room. ""

"" Yes, those are very important points . But there is still another aspect which many people forget about – it ’ s all about style ! It ’ s true that some designs might look better than others but at the end of the day , if you don ’ t put enough effort into making your card attractive and interesting to look at then no one will even notice what you have written on there . So my advice is just make sure everything looks good before sending out any cards ! ""

"" That ’ s true too ;-). But I think it ’ s more than just about the way things look , for example, some people like to use funny or strange images as their business card design instead of traditional ones . If you want something unique then maybe that would work better for you , but again make sure everything is well organized before sending anything out ! ""

"" That ’ s another great point ! I think many people don’t realize just how important it is to have a professional-looking business card design which reflects your personal style and makes others want to learn more about what you do . If you don’t put enough thought into this then no one will care about reading anything else on there , so make sure everything looks good ! ""

"" Well, I think we ’ ve talked about many things here today regarding business cards so now it ’ s time for me to wrap up our conversation by sharing with you some tips which might help if you want to create your own design . So let’s just say – keep in mind that there are no rules when it comes down to creating something original , but at least make sure everything looks good before sending anything out ! ""

"" Thank you so much for this amazing advice ! I have learned a lot today and now I feel like I know how to create my own design . It seems like we still have some more things left on the table though, such as what color would be best for using in business cards or should there even be any pictures at all ? ""

"" Yes , you are right ! But don’t worry because these are just simple questions that can easily be answered with a little bit of research . All we need to do is find out the answer by ourselves and then write about it on our websites ! If anyone wants to know more information on how to create business cards then I suggest checking out my blog post from last week which talks all about this topic , but if they want something specific then maybe that would be best left up for someone else . ""

"" Okay, well thanks again for everything and I ’ m sure we will talk soon ! """

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,122,llama-2-7b@q8_0_122.txt,""" Thank you Christine . ""

"" I will be back at six o’clock tonight , Mr . Emory . ""

"" See you then, Christine . ""

CHRISTINE SAT AT THE DESK, her face stiff with concentration. She had been at it for nearly two hours and still could not bring herself to cry. The tears welled in the corners of her eyes, but she refused to give them permission to flow. It wasn’t that they hurt or embarrassed her; rather, they symbolized an admission of defeat. She did not want to feel defeated, so she clenched her jaw and pushed them back down, focusing instead on her work.

She was a messenger for the CIA, which meant that her primary assignment was to deliver secret documents from one place to another, but it wasn’t just any delivery—she had to know what each document said in order to make sure she didn’t get into trouble by showing it to someone who wasn’t supposed to see it. It made the job more challenging, and occasionally, Christine found herself wishing for the easy life of a messenger whose only task was to deliver papers from one place to another without any scrutiny or curiosity.

But as she sat there trying not to think about Mr . Emory’s reaction, she couldn’t help but wonder what she had done wrong and whether her punishment would be more than just a tongue lashing in front of her fellow workers. It was probably nothing serious, she told herself; after all, this wasn’t the first time it had happened, but there were times when it almost felt like Mr . Emory took pleasure in finding fault with her work and berating her for mistakes that, although she acknowledged they could have been avoided, were not necessarily her fault.

The truth was that Christine was a good messenger, one of the best the CIA had ever employed—she always got to her destination on time, delivered documents safely without anyone finding out their contents, and never once missed an assignment in over three years as a messenger. She was reliable and trustworthy, which is why she was surprised by Mr . Emory’s reaction. After all, this wasn’t the first time it had happened; she’d lost important documents before and each time Mr . Emory had given her a stern lecture about the importance of keeping them safe. It seemed to her that he should have known better than to scold her again for something so minor—but perhaps, after all these years, he felt like he could no longer trust her to do her job properly?
As she sat there thinking about it, Christine’s eyes drifted down towards the pile of papers on her desk. They were a mix of reports from various agents around the globe and assignments for other messengers to deliver documents that needed special handling or sensitive information. The files all had different names on them—some were labeled “Sensitive” while others simply read “Top Secret” —and she knew not to look at any document marked with those labels until it was time for her to deliver it, and even then only after making sure no one was around.
But the file that had caused Mr . Emory’s outburst wasn’t like the rest; instead of having a label on it that read “Top Secret” or something similar, it was labeled simply with Mr . Emory’s name and her own. The only thing Christine knew about it was that Mr . Emory wanted to see it immediately upon returning from his appointment with MI6 at noon—and yet here she sat, unable to give him what he asked for until after five o’clock when all of the other messengers had gone home and there were no more assignments left to do.
As much as Christine tried not to think about it, the file kept nagging her mind; finally giving in to temptation she picked up one corner of its brown cover and unfolded it open flat on her desk before leaning back in her chair to read what was inside: a single sheet of paper containing only two sentences written in Mr . Emory’s neat handwriting.

“Mrs . Christine ,
I have received word from the director that you are no longer employed by our agency due to recent misconduct. We will be replacing you with another messenger as soon as possible, so please make sure your belongings are clean and ready for pick-up at six o’clock tonight.”

Christine blinked hard, trying not to let the tears that were threatening to spill out onto her cheeks. She knew she shouldn’t be surprised—after all, Mr . Emory had given her several warnings before finally letting her go, but somehow this felt different; as if there was something about losing her job and being forced to leave all at once without any warning or explanation that hurt more than anything else could ever hope to inflict upon her.

With one last look at the file sitting open on her desk, she stood up quickly before grabbing hold of a pen from her pocket. She jotted down the address of where she was supposed to deliver an envelope containing Mr . Emory’s letter and then proceeded through the door into the hallway without saying goodbye or looking back—it didn’t seem necessary anymore, now that she had accepted what must come next: the end of everything she knew and loved.

A few hours later, after returning from one final errand before departing for home, Christine sat alone in a small diner sipping her coffee while waiting for her ride to arrive so they could make their way back across town together once more without saying another word about what had just happened between them—but now that it was all over she felt better than ever before; as if whatever burden might have been holding on to her from deep within finally let go, freeing her up in a new and unexpected way so much that when the man sitting next to her reached out with his hand across the table, she smiled before taking hold of it without hesitation.

“Thank you for everything,” he said softly while looking straight into Christine’s eyes as if trying not only understand but also explain why he felt like this was somehow more important than all else combined; a feeling that made sense once they both realized what had happened between them—that love may be stronger than even the toughest challenges life can throw at us because it is capable of shining through even when everything else seems dark and hopeless.

With one last kiss on Christine’s cheek, Mr . Emory stood up and reached for his coat before turning around towards the door whereupon he smiled brightly as if trying hard to fight back tears while saying goodbye; “It was my pleasure Mrs . Christine ,” he said before walking out into the night air with a spring in step that only someone who knows they have done something right can muster—and then, with one more smile on his face, he disappeared around the corner leaving nothing but memories behind as if proving once again why love will always win no matter what stands in its way."

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,2,llama-2-7b@q8_0_2.txt,"Tim left with Karen, and then went to bed, but he could not sleep.He was worried that Karen would never call him again, but she did on Monday afternoon,and they made a date for Wednesday night . They had a good time at the movies ,but as soon as it was over Tim asked her to drive out to a little beach about twenty miles from town where he said there were some great cliffs and secluded coves. She agreed to do so without questioning why.

When they got to the beach,they found that it had a nice sandy beach and lots of shells in the tide pools , but they did not find anything else to occupy their time there except each other. Karen was glad she had worn her bathing suit underneath her clothes , so she put it on with Tim's help,and after he helped her down from the sand dune where they were sitting,they went into the water .
It was a warm summer day and the water felt good when you got into it.The tide was out pretty low and there was not much surf to speak of.They had some difficulty getting their clothes off because they were stuck on each other,but Tim eventually helped her get free and then they went swimming together.Karen did not know how to dive in the water yet ,so she just floated around at first,then when she got tired she tried diving underwater,and she discovered that it was much easier than she had thought it would be .
After a while Tim asked her if she wanted to go swimming with him out past the breakers where there were some good cliffs and deep water.She said yes ,so he put his arm around her shoulder and pulled her towards the edge of the water,and then they both began swimming toward deeper water .
They did not talk at all while they were swimming out in the ocean;they just swam side by side and occasionally they would look over at each other.Karen was glad that Tim had worn his bathing trunks because she did not want to be seen in her suit,and since he was older than she was ,he might think it was a little strange if she were wearing one .
The deeper they went the better they both liked the water;it was so clear and clean.There was nothing like swimming underwater with no one around you at all except your partner to make you feel real good about yourself.After about fifteen minutes of swimming ,Karen started feeling a little tired,so she asked Tim if he would go back in towards shore with her .He told her it was OK and then they both turned around and swam back toward the beach where Karen had left her suit on the sandy part of the shore.
When they got there ,Tim put his arm around her shoulders again,and walked her up to the top of the dune where they could get a good view of everything from above;the beach,the water,and even some houses nearby with people in them .It was so peaceful and quiet there ,it made you want to stay forever.
""You know what I wish , Karren?"" Tim said, looking out into the distance. ""I wish we were here all day long just like this.""""That would be nice , wouldn't it?"" She answered,looking up at him.He smiled and then held her in his arms tightly as he kissed her on the neck;her cheeks blushed red with embarrassment.She could feel how much she liked being with him again,and she had to fight back her own feelings of desire for him because they were both still too young to be doing this kind of thing together .
Karen's mother was at home when Tim dropped Karren off after their date on Wednesday night, and she asked him if he wanted to come in for something to drink.He told her no thanks ,that he had better go before anyone else came out looking for him;his father would probably be up soon because it was getting late already .She said OK then ,and told Karen good-bye as she walked away from the doorstep with Tim,and she waved good-bye back at them both.
The next morning when Tim got to school he was very tired from being awake all night long thinking about Karren;he fell asleep during his first period class and had to be woken up by his teacher.His mother asked him how the date went last night,and he told her it had been a really good time . She smiled at him with pride knowing that her son was becoming more likeable every day ,but then she remembered something else.""Oh my God,Tim!You're not going to tell me that you and Karren got together again? I thought we agreed last week when we talked about this that it would be better if you just stayed away from her .""
""Mom,don't worry . I am not doing anything with Karren;I don't even know where she lives ,and anyway she's too young for me.""He said ,staring at his shoes.She looked up at him in surprise.""What do you mean?""She asked ,handing him a cup of coffee that she had just made. ""Well,she told me last night on our way home from the movie theatre about how old she is;it's only three years younger than I am so it doesn't make any difference at all.""
""You're kidding!Why would you do something like that? She's not even seventeen yet!""She shouted angrily. ""I don't care what age she is;I just wanted to get her off my back because she was always calling me and asking me out for another date .""
""Well,OK then.""He said ,looking down at his shoes again. She stared at him in disbelief,then went upstairs to talk to Karren on the phone about what Tim had done ,but when she got there Karen had already hung up without even saying good-bye .She tried calling back several times but there was no answer each time;finally after half an hour of trying she gave up and decided to go out for dinner instead with her parents like they had planned beforehand.
The next day Tim didn't go to school because he felt sick again ,and his mother told him that if he wanted her to let him see Karren again then he should talk to her about it himself .""You know what ? I think she's too young for you anyway;I don't want anything bad happening between the two of us.""She said firmly before walking away from their conversation in the living room.Tim sat alone in his bedroom listening to music on headphones until evening came when he decided that since nothing was going right today,he might as well try talking to Karren one more time;maybe she would have changed her mind by then .
When Tim got home after work on Friday night ,Karren was already there waiting for him at the doorstep with flowers in her hands and a big smile on her face.He took them from her without saying anything before leading her into his house where they sat down together to talk about what had happened between them while he was gone all day today .It seemed like forever since last week when things went wrong between them ,and now that she knew how old he was she didn't mind spending more time with him;it would only make their relationship easier for everyone involved.
They talked until late at night before going out to eat dinner together again like they had done the other day,then came back home where Tim helped Karren take off her clothes and get into bed .As soon as they were both in bed ,she reached over and turned on some music on his laptop computer so that he could watch some videos online while she fell asleep beside him ;it wasn't until later when they woke up early next morning before anyone else came home from work,that Tim realized how close they had actually become during these last few days .
At lunchtime on Saturday ,Tim brought Karren out to a small park near their house where there were some benches and swings for them to sit down upon ;he told her that he was thinking about going away somewhere far away from everything so as not to hurt anyone else around him again like what happened last year with his family after his father's death .She said nothing until they got back home ,but then she sat there quietly waiting while Tim explained how he felt about the whole thing,and then finally asked her if she wanted them both to leave together or just stay at their own house without telling anyone else where they had gone .
Karren looked up at him with sad eyes for a moment before answering :""Well ,Tim ,I think we should go somewhere far away from here . Maybe someplace like Las Vegas ?""He smiled as he nodded his head in agreement ;it seemed like she was finally starting to understand how important it was that they spent more time together without worrying about anything else besides their own happiness.
The next day ,they took a plane ride out West towards California where Tim had visited before with some friends during college .It wasn't until after he got home however,that he realized what Karren meant by saying she wanted him to take her away from everything because once they arrived at their destination ,she told him that this was going to be our new home !
As time went on and things became easier between them both,he began feeling more comfortable with the idea of living together forever without ever having to worry about what might happen if he left again .They both agreed that one day soon they would like children too ,so they decided to start trying as"

"" £10,000 Euros is what I am selling at £1.50 to 1 . So your £10K will get you €15,000 . You can't lose on that deal. ""

"" No , I don't want the money in pound sterling any more. That was just an example of what my needs are going to be in pounds. Now I am taking only Euros because I will stay here for long and there is no point in taking back with me such a large amount . ""

"" Yes , sir, but £10K in pound sterling gets you €15K in Euro . It's good to know that . ""

"" No , thank you. I will go to another bank if I need money in pounds . ""

"" Five hundred and one thousand . ""

"" What do you need that amount for ? ""

"" To pay rent of a room in the city . ""

"" You mean for this month ? ""

"" Yes , I think so . ""

"" Let me take your passport please . ""

"" Thank you . ""

"" What is your occupation here in Germany ? ""

"" I am a student now . ""

"" How long have you been living and working here ? ""

"" Since 2014 . ""

"" Is it an international school ? ""

"" Yes , from the USA . ""

"" What is your name ? ""

"" Ahmed Ahmad Al-Ribat . ""

"" Is this your passport ? ""

"" No . I have lost my passport . ""

"" Who is this photograph ? ""

"" This is a picture of me from 1980 . ""

"" How much do you think you could purchase with RIB here ? ""

"" Maybe one thousand for a hotel room and about three thousand for a meal at McDonalds . ""

"" What name did you use for your application to this school ? ""

"" Ahmed Al-Ribat . ""

"" Could I see that please ? ""

"" Of course , but it is just my name on the list of students who are in the student dormitory . ""

"" Yes . So you have been living and studying here for one year now ? ""

"" Exactly . ""

"" Do you have any plans to work here after graduation ? ""

"" I think so , if my English is good enough . ""

"" Is that all for the time being ? ""

"" Yes please , thank you . ""

"" Please wait while I make a copy of your passport and send it through to the immigration department here in Germany . ""

"" Thank you very much. ""

"" Sure ! ""

"" This is my signature . ""

"" Here it is . ""

"" Thank you very much for your purchase . Next customer . ""

"" Oh ! Is that possible ? ""

"" Sure , I can change them for you now . ""

"" Well , then could you give me a small box of it ? That will be convenient in daily life . ""

"" No problem , I'll provide you one as soon as possible . ""

"" Thanks, that's fine . ""

### Hematology

The study of blood and blood disorders is called hematology or haematology (/ˈhiːmətɒlədʒi/; from Greek αἷμα, haima ""blood"" + -λογία, logia ""study""). Hematologists are physicians with specialized training in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of blood. The field was created by William Osler, who called for more attention to hematology in 1894:

It is time that this subject, which so affects our life and health, should have a separate existence as an independent branch of medicine ... In many cases it becomes the special duty of the general practitioner to deal with these diseases, not merely as they come into his hands, but by continuous study, keeping abreast of all that is done in this field.

Hematology has three main branches:

1. Coagulation disorders and hemostasis: the clotting mechanism and bleeding tendencies are studied to understand their causes, pathophysiology, clinical significance and management
2. Hematologic malignancies, or blood cancers, including leukemias (of various types), lymphomas, and solid tumors that may also involve the hematopoietic system (such as myeloma, histiocytosis, multiple myeloma)
3. Congenital anemias and inherited disorders of blood cells (including hemolysis and other erythrocyte abnormalities)

"" Doctor , my fever is worse . Can I have some medicine now ? ""

"" Let's wait a while longer , young man . I want to keep you out of danger . You may feel sick for a few more days . ""

"" But my head aches so much and I am coughing constantly . ""

"" That is normal in cases like yours . If you get better within two weeks , I'll be satisfied . ""

"" How can you say that ? You told me it would only last a few days ! ""

"" Just as I said before - it may last up to three weeks . ""

"" Doctor , my cough is much worse and I have a fever again . Is there something wrong with the medicine ? ""

"" Well , young man , your illness has already been in progress for several days . Don't worry. You are getting better now ! ""

"" I feel worse than ever before and my cough is very violent . My fever keeps rising and I don't understand what is going on here ? ""

"" Young man , you have a bad case of pneumonia ! It's quite serious this time . You must stay in bed and drink as much water as possible to keep your temperature down. Do not worry though - it will pass soon enough . ""

"" Doctor , I can hardly breathe . What should I do ? ""

"" Don't talk so much . Just lie there quietly and rest . It won't take long before everything gets better again ! ""

"" Doctor , what are you saying ? Am I going to die ? ""

"" Young man , that's enough . You must be calm now . You will get well soon . But in the mean time it is very important not to talk too much or cough . Do you understand ? ""

"" I do, Doctor - but my fever is back again and I have a terrible headache . It hurts so much ! ""

"" That's normal , young man . If your illness continues like this for a week or two , we will be able to get rid of it completely . Do you understand now ? ""

"" Yes , Doctor - but the pain is unbearable ! ""

"" Well, my dear boy , just bear with it for another day or two and everything will be alright ! Now get some rest before your next visit tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock . I'm very satisfied with you so far . ""

The patient is not a doctor - he is just an ordinary man who went to see his doctor. He told him about a headache and a cold , but the doctor didn't believe him . The next day he came back saying that he had a fever again , which was confirmed by the doctor who said it would last only two weeks.
The patient went home thinking that everything is going to be alright now ! But his condition became worse everyday and after three days his fever rose even higher than before . He felt like dying all of a sudden and when he finally got the courage to ask for help again , he was told by the doctor that it's only temporary - nothing serious at all !
The poor man couldn't believe what was happening anymore so he decided to leave without saying goodbye! The next morning his wife called him telling him about her husband's death . She said that doctors were not able to save him because of their ignorance and stupidity , but she didn't want them knowing how angry she felt ! So here we have another example for you guys: _Doctors can be very rude sometimes_ - especially when they don't understand what is happening with someone else's body.
This article will discuss all kinds of doctors including their good and bad sides! We hope that you found it interesting because our aim was to show how important knowledge about medicine really is . If we had been able to diagnose the patient in time , he probably wouldn't have died so soon after such a short illness .

"" What's wrong with me ? ""

"" You have tonsillitis , my dear young man ! Your fever is probably caused by an infection in your throat . ""

"" Oh , that explains everything . I'll be fine then ! Thanks doctor . ""

The next morning , while the coffee was brewing , he sent out his first good luck forward. The subject line said:

 Good Luck Forward

 and it contained the following message:

 I had this crazy idea last night ... I need some help figuring this one out . Please take a look at it and let me know if you can come up with anything for me. It's something that has been bugging me lately , and I just can't seem to get my mind around the solution.

 It looks like we are on the right track, but now we need some help .

 Let me explain ...

 Last week, a friend gave me an envelope with the following problem written on it:

 You have 7 marbles in your hand , and you want to put them into a bag containing 25 marbles.

 The problem is that I don't know how many bags there are ...

 If they are numbered from 1 - 4 , then the problem becomes trivial . But what if there are more than 4 bags ? How would you solve it in this case ?

 I figured out a way to do it, but I don't know how many bags there were. So I thought that maybe I could use a computer to determine the number of bags so I could do some brute force trial and error on the problem . But if I knew the number of bags, then maybe this would be easier ...

 We had no idea what to do with it, but we were thinking about it. We decided that since we didn't know how many marbles there are, nor did we know how many bags , we could just pick any number we wanted and use that as a guess for the number of bags . This was our first thought ...

 But then it hit us ... what if we had some way to determine the number of bags ? What if we could figure out the number of bags by knowing how many marbles there are ? We were still in the dark , but we figured that if we could know that, we would be able to solve this problem with just a little bit more thought .

 So here it is ...

 How do you determine the number of bags given a known number of marbles ?

 Here's an example ... Suppose there are 7 red marbles and 18 blue marbles in your hand . We know that there can be no more than 4 different colors , so we assume that each bag can contain either 2 or 3 of the same color. And since there must be at least one bag containing only blue marbles, we assume that each bag contains a minimum of 3 blue marbles .

 We also know that since we have some red marbles and some blue marbles in our hand , it's impossible to fill all bags with the same color. So now we can subtract off the number of colors from the number of different types of bags, leaving us with just 2 or 3 possible combinations for each bag.

 How many combinations are there ?

 Well , if the bag contains only red marbles then it has 6 red and no blue marbles . Since we know that all bags contain at least one color , this means that none of the other bags can be completely red as well ... so this is a possibility. But how many possible ways are there to combine three colors into two bags ?

 There must be 6 combinations for each bag because if the first bag contained no blue marbles then all bags would have to contain at least one blue marble . This means that there would be 3 choices of color in this first bag , and therefore we can only choose between six combinations: Red , Blue, Green or Purple.

 But wait ... what if the first two bags contained no blue marbles ? We're back to square one again ... so this is another possibility .

 If all three bags contain red marbles then there are 6 ways of combining these colors together: Red , Red, Red; Blue , Blue and Blue ; Green , Green and Green ; Purple, Purple and Purple.

 And if the first two bags contained no blue marbles , but the third bag did? Then we have five possibilities : Blue, Blue and Red ; Green , Green and Red ; Purple, Red and Red; Blue, Green, Red and Blue .

 If all three bags are red then there are 6 ways of combining them: Red, Red, Red; Blue ,Blue and Blue ; Green ,Green and Green ; Purple, Purple and Purple.

 And if the first two bags contained no blue marbles but the third bag did? Then we have five possibilities : Blue, Blue and Red; Green, Green and Red; Purple, Red and Red; Blue, Green, Red and Blue .

 So , given a number of red marbles , there are 2 combinations possible if you have exactly one blue marble in the first bag. If you have no blue marbles in either of the first two bags then there are five possibilities for what the third bag can contain; which means that there are 7 possibilities altogether .

 Now let's look at another example ... suppose there were only 3 red marbles and 5 blue marbles in our hand. How many ways could these be divided up into bags ? There would still be exactly two combinations possible if you had only one bag containing all three colors : Red, Blue and Green (or Purple). If not , then there must be at least 2 or 3 bags of some color other than red , so this is another possibility .

 We're getting closer ! But what if we were given a number of blue marbles instead ? What about if only one bag contained all three colors? How many possibilities are there for dividing these up into two bags, assuming that they can be divided at all ?

 Well , if you had exactly one blue marble in each of the first two bags then you would have 2 ways to divide them up ; otherwise there must be at least 3 or more different colors among the remaining bags. This means that we don't know how many possibilities there are unless we can divide these three into any other number .

 But let's look at another example ... suppose there were only five red marbles and four blue ones in your hand. If all of them fit into one bag then it would take two combinations: Red, Blue; or Purple, Red/Purple , depending on how you count purple as being either a separate color or just an extension of red .

 But what if we had only 2 blue marbles in our hand? Then we could divide them into one bag with three colors (Red/Blue) and another bag containing only two colours (Purple). How many different combinations are there ? Well, as long as each bag contained at least one color , then it would take no more than six possible ways of dividing up these 4 blue marbles between the first and second bags .

 So now we know how to divide all six colors into any number of bags ... but what if you don't want to deal with just 6 colors ? What happens when there are more than seven colours in your hand? Can you still find a way to divide them up into two bags ?

 This is where our next step comes in . Suppose we were given an even number of blue marbles (for example, if they were all 5 ). In this case , because there would be exactly as many red marbles as there are blue ones then each bag could only contain either one or two colors , so it's no longer possible for any other combinations to occur .

 But what happens when there is an odd number of blue marbles ? We can still divide them into bags with three colours each (Red/Blue) and another bag containing just two colours (Purple), but now we must make sure that each one has at least 2 reds, or else we couldn't create any combinations .

 So what would happen if there were exactly 10 blue marbles? Then it wouldn't matter which order they went into the first bag - so long as no two of them were adjacent to each other on a line drawn through their centers . But since this doesn't really tell us anything useful , let's just assume that all ten went into one bag containing only three colors (Red/Blue).

 So far we have shown how many combinations there are for dividing up 6 colors among two bags. We also showed what happens when there is an even number of each color, or if there are any odd numbers at all . However , this doesn't explain anything about why some combinations might be better than others ...

 But wait ! There's more ! Because now we know that once you divide up the six colors into two bags then it will always take exactly 2 combinations of these bags to fill your hand with every possible color combination . So if there are any odd numbers anywhere in this process , it would be best if they were removed before dividing them up into different groups .

 Now let's look at another example ... suppose we had four red marbles and three blue ones in our hand. How many combinations could these 7 colors divide themselves into two bags?"

She had called at 2:00 o'clock .

She was not only pretty and tall but also slim and well-built .

Her hair, which was dyed a soft brown , flowed down to her shoulders in waves that were neatly tied up into a pony tail with the help of two hairpins .

The top part of the hair was cut straight across while the lower section was cut in layers to look like curved strands .

She wore no makeup and had beautiful eyes . They were small , dark and round without being too wide apart or close together . The pupils were slightly slanted with black irises which stood out against a white sclera.

A very delicate, well-defined nose was adorned by the presence of two small nostrils .

Her thin , soft lips were painted a pinkish red to match her skin color and they made a perfect frame for her beautiful teeth .

She had an oval face with a well defined chin . Her ears were perfectly shaped with no protrusion or other physical defect .

She was wearing a simple white dress with short sleeves . It had a long, straight skirt that came down to the middle of her calf and reached all the way up to the middle of her thighs . The top portion of this dress consisted of a close-fitting bodice which stopped right above the navel in order to show off her flat stomach .

She wore a thin gold chain around her neck on which hung an irregularly shaped pearl .

Her shoes were high-heeled black leather pumps .

She was very polite and courteous . She had been extremely warm in her invitation to attend the banquet at 7:00 o'clock .

"" Oh ! Miss Rose ? "" said Shirley .

"" Yes ? "" she replied with a smile .

Shirley did not know what to say but, after some hesitation, she spoke out of turn :

"" I'm sorry if my words sounded rude at the time . I was surprised by your offer . ""

"" It's quite all right . I understand how you feel. But don't worry too much . ""

"" Oh ! No . It's not that . It's just that it seems so unusual for a girl like me to be invited to such a banquet . ""

"" Don't underestimate yourself, Miss Shirley . I can assure you that your presence will be an honor to the guest of honor. And if you accept my invitation, we would also be happy if you could stay for supper . ""

"" Well, then , I won't go to the banquet this evening after all . ""

"" It's a shame , isn't it ? "" said Miss Rose with an apologetic look on her face.

Shirley shook her head in the negative :

"" No . It's not that at all ! I just want to be clear about this so there are no misunderstandings later on . If I accept your invitation, it is only because I feel very flattered and honored by Mr. Carter's thoughtfulness towards me. However , the real reason why I am going to attend this banquet is in order to thank him for all his good deeds throughout the years and for all the benefits that he has brought me . ""

"" I see ! That sounds perfectly reasonable then . ""

Miss Rose smiled warmly at Shirley :

"" You're right . It would be an honor for us if you attended our banquet . ""

Shirley nodded her head and asked :

"" Are you going to take me to the hotel in your car ? ""

Miss Rose shook her head with a smile :

"" No . I'm afraid not . That would be rather difficult for us because Mr. Carter wants to go home first so that he can change into his dinner clothes . He would then drive over to pick you up at the hotel and take you to the banquet hall in the Shangri-La Hotel . ""

Shirley nodded again as she replied :

"" I see ! Well , then , let me come with you now because Mr. Carter's going to be waiting for a long time before you arrive at his house . ""

She was about to get up from her seat but Miss Rose stopped her and said :

"" No , no . Sit down please . I know what Mr. Carter wants . He wants to see that you are ready in plenty of time . But let's wait for a few more minutes because it looks like he has something else to do right now . ""

"" Is that so ? What about ? "" asked Shirley curiously.

"" Let me guess ! Mr. Carter has gotten another phone call from someone and is waiting for him at the door of his office . It might be a business associate, a client or just an old friend . I can't tell you any more than that because it isn't my place to know . But what's important is that he won't be able to leave before he finishes talking on the phone . ""

Shirley smiled as she replied :

"" Well , then , let me just sit here and wait for him with you until he comes back home again ? ""

Miss Rose shook her head with a smile :

"" That won't be necessary, Miss Shirley . If you don't mind waiting for another few minutes, I can go ahead to Mr. Carter's house first so that I will know when exactly we have to leave in order not to keep him waiting too long outside his office . ""

Shirley nodded her head as she replied :

"" That sounds like a good idea ! But let me help you out by walking over there with you instead of calling a taxi ? It's no big deal and I can get some fresh air while we wait for him . ""

Miss Rose smiled warmly at Shirley and said :

"" Oh, please don't worry about it ! I'm sure he will be pleased to see you waiting here for me with such a pretty smile on your face instead of riding around town in some taxi like an old woman . ""

Shirley smiled back at her as she replied :

"" It won't take long for Mr. Carter and I to walk there, so don't worry about that either ! Now let's go ! ""

They got up from their seats, walked out of the coffee shop and headed towards the doorway where Miss Rose had parked her car ."

"" I suppose so, but I do not see what that has to do with the fact. ""

"" I meant only this, that if he liked coming to our parties he must also have been very much pleased by your kindness in inviting him ; and yet when you had such a chance of making him really glad, you did not even speak to him, although you saw that he was looking at the ground with an uneasy expression on his face ? ""

"" That is true, I did not speak to him . ""

"" You were very ungracious . ""

"" I did not want to be disagreeable . ""

"" But why do you think that he was so uneasy in looking at the ground? What had made him uneasy? Was it that he did not know me, or what? ""

"" I am not sure ; but if he had been happy and light-hearted, he would not have looked like that. And besides, his face is always sad . ""

"" I thought so too ; and that's why I wanted to talk with him. But now you see how it was —you were right in being angry with me for not speaking to him. But will you tell me one thing more? Where is he ? ""

"" Then we shall soon be able to judge of his mood by his behavior. I have long wished to speak to him, and now it is too late . ""

"" Is it not better that you should have a good opportunity? ""

"" Yes ; but he has been so often invited here that one would think he had some other reason for being glad of an invitation than pleasure at meeting his friends. I can hardly imagine what that might be, and it is all the more important to find out now . ""

"" Shall I go in first? ""

"" Yes, do ; but say nothing about me. ""

She entered the room, where he was standing by a table with his back turned toward her, while his eyes were fixed on some little objects lying there.

He heard her voice and turned round quickly; she had seen that he was so surprised to see her alone in the room, as it was not usual for any one but herself or her brother to come in unannounced. He was going up to her with outstretched hand when she stepped back a little behind the door-post, and looked at him without speaking.

She saw his eyes grow tender as he gazed at her, and then he bowed silently, with a very grave expression.

""You are here alone?"" she began suddenly, in a tone that startled him. ""Where is Robert? He has often been invited to these parties, but I do not know why he never comes.""

She had intended to speak calmly and pleasantly; but when her words came out in such an unexpectedly sharp tone, it was too much for his weakness and he could not reply.

""I am alone,"" she repeated, as if asking a question. ""Have you nothing to say? You know that we want you here; Robert is very fond of you.""

He still did not answer ; the words seemed to choke him, for there was so much in them that he could not bear at once . But his eyes had grown still brighter and more tender.

""Why do you look at me like that?"" she said again, taking a few steps nearer. ""You must know why I have asked Robert to come here."" She stopped again with her hand resting on the table, as if waiting for an answer. He did not move nor speak.

""I cannot understand,"" she went on, looking at him in astonishment.
""What is there to make you look so ? ""

But he only gazed at her more steadily than before .

""I don't know why I am here alone with you; it seems strange to me myself; but Robert never comes. He has been invited to every party here, but has always found some excuse for not coming.""

""Perhaps he does not like them ? "" said the stranger quietly.

She turned her eyes quickly away as if something had wounded her. But she soon raised them again and looked at him inquiringly ; then a cloud seemed to pass over her face, as she grew very pale. She cast an angry glance round the room, and stepped back still farther behind the door-post.

""I don't know why I am here alone with you; but Robert never comes!"" she repeated in a low voice. ""No, he never comes ; that is certain."" Then her eyes gleamed again brightly as they grew moist, and she added hurriedly : ""He has often been invited to these parties, and this time I was glad to see that my brother had not forgotten him; but now you have told me what it means. Why did he look so uneasy when he saw us walking in the garden? Was he really unhappy about it, or only shy ? ""

""I am afraid he is very much in earnest,"" said the stranger with a sigh.

She looked at him angrily and asked : ""How can you say that he is very much in earnest, if he has often been invited to these parties without coming? ""

""You must not be so angry,"" she heard him murmur softly ; but she would not listen to what he said. She did not even look at him as she went over quickly to the window and looked out. He was standing by her side a few minutes later, when he began speaking again in a very low tone:
""I am afraid he is very much in earnest."" But then his voice became fainter still ; only once, when she turned round impatiently, did he speak quite distinctly. ""It is easy to understand why Robert never comes,"" he said; and as he spoke the words seemed to come from her own heart.

She did not answer him for some time, and then she took no notice of his last sentence at all ; but she began to walk up and down the room in an agitated manner, while her eyes kept turning anxiously toward the door-post behind which he was standing. Suddenly she stopped in front of him with a quick movement.
""Why did you look so when we were walking together? ""

He replied by a silent gesture that it was true ; but his eyes said more than any words could have done, and they filled her heart with such bitter anguish that she forgot all else for the moment. Then he came up to her and put his hand on her arm. She did not look at him or reply; but the hot tears began to roll down her cheeks.
""Why are you weeping?"" he asked softly, as if speaking to a child. ""Let me lead you into another room ; there is no one here."" And he gently raised her hand and led her into an adjoining room, which had been arranged for guests in the evening. But she did not look at him now or give him any answer; only once she turned round suddenly with a bitter smile when they reached the door of this new room ; then she hurried away from him as if he were no longer her friend, and ran out into the passage.

CHAPTER VI.

They had been talking together for more than an hour before they heard any one coming, so that both felt very tired at last, but there was still something in their hearts which neither could speak of yet; only now and then a word slipped from one or other's lips as if by chance. ""When shall we be able to talk about it?"" he asked once, almost inaudibly ; but she did not answer him; so he said no more for the moment.

""I am sorry,"" she began at last, ""that you are angry with me, because I did not speak to Robert as I ought."" She paused a little and then went on: ""Do you know, when we were walking in the garden, that was just what I had been thinking of doing? But I wanted first to see whether you would give me any help ; so when I saw you looking at us with such surprise, I thought it must be because Robert did not wish to go.""

She said this quite gaily; but her face grew grave again as she asked suddenly: ""Do you know why he does not come here? It seems strange that one should always find some excuse for not coming. But you do not know him, and so how can you understand?"" She turned away from him quickly as if she did not want to hear what he would say ; but then she added, in a low tone : ""You are right; I must have been very thoughtless to speak like that before Robert came into the room. But I do not know why I should be so angry with you .""

He went up and put his hand on her arm, as if he wished to say something more ; but she drew herself away quickly and said : ""I think we had better go out now.""

She was sitting in the carriage that took them home, but did not seem at all inclined for conversation. He tried to talk with her, but after a few words he saw that it would be useless. She looked so sad and weary; there seemed to be something wrong which he could do nothing about. At last she said suddenly : ""You are"

"" What can I do for you,Mr.Jones ? "" he said with a smile.

"" You've got me,Stevenson , "" the other returned,grinning widely."" I know it . But if I didn't know that before,I found out by getting your car over in front of my house last night and following you here this morning. It's a beautiful car--you must be doing well to have so much money--and I just thought I'd like to drive it around for an hour or two.""

"" Oh ! "" exclaimed the detective,with a startled look on his face, and drawing back to the window. "" Why,I didn't know you could drive. ""

"" Not very well--not at all,"" said Jones, grinning broadly again. ""But I can take care of myself pretty well in an automobile,and I think that's what you'd be interested to learn.""

"" Well,come along and see,"" Stevenson went on quickly, recovering from his surprise a little. ""I'm going out to my house this afternoon and will give you a chance then. But don't do anything to make the car go too fast. That's all I ask of any one who drives it.""

"" Don't worry about that,"" returned Jones. And he turned away, walking toward the door which had opened when Stevenson came in and shutting behind him as he stepped outside into the hallway. ""I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your car,Mr.Stevenson . I shall be careful.""

"" That will be all right,"" laughed Stevenson. And a little later he added with a laugh: "" I guess that's the limit of my ability to talk like an innocent,young country boy!"" and he went back into his private office to attend to some business matters before he left the store for his home.

""That was rather a good imitation,"" remarked Fred as Stevenson came out from behind the counter. "" But I don't understand just how you expect me to help.""

""Why,don't you see?"" exclaimed his uncle in surprise. ""I'll have to go down there after he's run it for an hour or so and see if I can pick up any clews as to who he is.""

""Oh! "" Fred ejaculated. ""That's different.Well,you might try. But the first thing I thought of was that you could make out what sort of man Mr.Jones is by finding out his nationality and if he is a stranger in New York.""

""But it doesn't seem to me as if we could learn anything more about him from his talk,"" Stevenson went on. ""He must be very clever,I think,to have imitated my voice so well--I didn't recognize that at all.""

""Well,it would be a good thing for you to do anyhow,"" Fred replied. ""You might be able to find out how he happened to know that you had such a valuable automobile--and what sort of work he does besides driving it around.""

""I can't imagine why he should want to talk like a country boy,"" Stevenson went on after a moment, as the two went into his office. ""He must be trying to get my confidence.""

""Perhaps that is it,"" Fred agreed. ""Anyhow,I suppose we had better find out what sort of man he is--if he's any different from Mr.Stevenson. I'll tell you what you can do: You ask him if he wants to come and have some supper with us.""

""That would be a good plan,"" Stevenson agreed. ""But how will I know that it isn't one of your chums who is playing the part?""

""Oh,that wouldn't bother me so much,"" Fred returned. ""And then if we are going to have supper together I guess there's no reason for his pretending not to be a stranger in New York."" And soon afterward Mr.Stevenson went back down into the store and asked Jones whether or not he would like to come home with him and spend an evening at the house.

""Yes,please,"" was the reply, ""and if I can't drive your car any better when we get back I'll never go out in one again.""

The two were soon on their way and driving along through Harlem they came to a long line of automobiles waiting at a garage. As Jones slowed up his machine, several men who had been sitting in the store began talking about it.

""That's my car,"" Stevenson said to Mr.Jones as he leaned forward toward the other. ""Why don't you join us?""

""I guess I won't,"" was the answer. ""I've got some business at the garage,and I must be getting along."" And a moment later he had disappeared into the shop and Stevenson went on to his home.

Inside there were several things for the detective to do before supper--among other matters he wrote out a statement that he was going to make in connection with the death of Mr.Lee, which would appear in the newspapers later--so that Fred and his chums had to wait until nearly eight o'clock for their dinner.

""I suppose you wouldn't like it if I went over and invited one or two other fellows to supper?"" asked Ned as he looked around at the table, where three boys were waiting for the food that was being prepared. ""You know Fred has been pretty particular about the number of fellows who come here.""

""That's all right,"" laughed Jack. ""We can go over if you want to--though I don't know but we might get into trouble by having too many boys staying at our house.""

Ned made some arrangements with two other lads of about his age, and then the four went over to Ned's home. The meal was a good one, and afterward Fred asked Mr.Jones if he would like to come back with him for a game of billiards--a favorite amusement in that house.

""I don't know whether I can or not,"" was the reply. ""You see,I have promised my mother that I would call on her at half-past eight and she may be out if you should come before then.""

""Oh! Is there anything special going on?"" asked Fred.

""Well,it's a sort of a play party,"" was the reply. ""But don't tell your mother I said so--she doesn't like me to say much about these things,and she never has any such affairs herself.""

The detective had no objection to this secrecy, and Fred suggested that Mr.Jones might as well go over and see if his mother would care to have him come later. So he started off alone toward the other house, while the two young men remained in the billiard room of Ned's home.

""That is rather a strange person,"" remarked Jack to Fred after a few moments of silence had followed the departure of Mr.Jones from the room. ""He doesn't seem like any one I ever saw.""

""Why not?"" asked his chum quickly, and with some curiosity in his voice.

""Well,he seems very queer--in a way,"" Jack went on. ""I wonder what sort of work he does? He certainly didn't strike me as being able to get much money at his trade.""

""Oh,we don't know anything about him yet,"" Fred said. ""But I think if we keep an eye out for that fellow it won't be long before we find out all there is to be learned about him."" And a few minutes later, the two boys left Ned's house and walked back home with Jack proposing a game of checkers on the way.

They had not gone far when they heard some one shout: ""Stop! I want to see you!""

CHAPTER XV

AN EXPLOSIVE DISCOVERY

""That was Mr.Jones,"" Fred exclaimed as he and Jack came to a sudden stop and turned toward where the voice seemed to come from. And there,some distance off, but coming slowly toward them, was the man whom they had met in the automobile store. ""We must have lost him,I guess,"" went on Jack.
""How could we?"" Fred wanted to know with some curiosity. ""Do you see any one else about? There doesn't seem to be anybody near."" And then he added: ""Maybe he wants to tell us something about himself that he didn't want our folks to hear. I wonder what it is!""

""Let him come up and talk,then,"" said Jack with a laugh, and as Mr.Jones came closer the two boys walked on until they were not far off from where their mysterious visitor was standing. And now they saw that he had stopped in front of them and was looking down at Fred's shoes.

""What is it?"" demanded the detective boy. ""Do you want to tell us something about yourself,Mr.Jones ?""

The other made no answer for a few seconds, but continued to stare down at the shoes"

"" But why me ? Why does everything happen to me? Do I deserve all of these problems? Is it just my luck that he would cheat on me and break up with me again? Am I the only one who goes through life without ever being happy? What if this is how things will always be for me ...""

"" Veronica , you have to fight ! Don ’ t give up yet . ""

"" But why not? Nothing makes sense anymore! This isn’t how my life was supposed to turn out. I thought it would be so much better than this...I mean, if there is a God then where is he right now when I need him most ? What good will come of all of this? I can ’ t do this any longer ...""

"" Do you like going out in Hollywood ? ""

"" Oh yes . We go out almost every night. We used to stay home because I didn't have any American friends, but now we are making friends everywhere we go. Last weekend, we had dinner with a lot of the people from Canada who live here , and it was great."" 

"" What kind of music do you like ? ""

"" Oh , I listen to all kinds . I like old popular songs that were recorded many years ago, like 'The Way You Look Tonight' or 'Smoke Gets in Your Eyes'. There are a lot of wonderful songs from the 1930s and 1940s. Of course , I also listen to some current pop music.""

"" Do you like musicals ? ""

\end{code}

I tried adding some things like this:

\begin{code}
""How long have you been working as a model?""
""Five years."";
\end{code}

and it gives the error that there are no statements allowed. Why does this code not work? What am I missing or doing wrong?

Comment: This is because a semicolon is required after every statement in JavaScript, which are separated by commas (either with no space before/after them like in your example, or with spaces).  A statement is simply what you have after an open parenthesis and before a closing parenthesis.  In your example, `var x = 5;` would be the start of one statement, and `console.log(x);` would be another statement.

Comment: Please [edit] your question to include the code as text rather than images. Images can't be copied or searched and are therefore not useful in many situations. See the [help], especially the sections named [""Text vs. Images""](https://stackoverflow.com/help/text-vs-images) and [""Why not upload images of code/errors when asking a question?""](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/285551/).

Comment: The code doesn't work because you've forgotten to close the parens at the end, but also because you haven't properly defined x... you need `x=5;` to define a variable that can be assigned to.

Comment: You don't have to do `console.log(x);` or `alert(x)` or any of those things for it to work - you just put the var declaration in quotes and it will assign an empty string (`""""`).  What I was referring to when I said ""statements"" above is the opening parentheses with whatever code follows them (like a function call) which requires another closing parenthesis.

Answer: You've not closed your parentheses, or assigned any values to `x` . If you want it to print out 5 when prompted just do:

\begin{code}
""How long have you been working as a model?""
""Five years."";
alert(""I am five."");
\end{code}

"" Yes . ""

"" And what did you do ? ""

"" Well, it's kind of hard to say . I had all kinds of odd jobs . ""

"" How long have you worked as a waitress ? ""

"" Oh , about eight months . ""

"" What was the reason for your first job here ? ""

"" Well , we just thought that it would be fun to work at one of these big hotels . ""

"" Didn't you want a more responsible position? ""

""Well, not right now. We want to do this kind of job for a while and save our money.""

"" Oh , about six years ago . ""

"" And you've been here ever since ? ""

"" No , I came back to Los Angeles two years ago. ""

"" Do you like it better here now than when you first got back? ""

"" Yes , much better, because I have a job and friends now . ""

"" What do your parents think of the country ? ""

"" Well, they don't really care for California . They miss Canada , but I like to be in the States anyway. ""

"" How long did you live in France? ""

"" It was three years . ""

"" Did you learn French when you were there ? ""

"" Yes, I learned French and a little bit of Italian and Spanish . ""

"" Was that difficult to do? ""

"" Well , it wasn't easy at first , but after the first year, it was pretty easy. ""

"" How long did it take you to get over there ? ""

"" How did you meet him? ""

"" We met at a party last year. It was really funny because I had already seen him there once before but didn't know who he was. Then he asked me to dance , and I just fell in love with him from that moment on . ""

"" Do you like your work? ""

"" Oh , yes! I'm so lucky - I have a job that I love. I've been here for two years now, and they pay very well. And the people are wonderful - we all get along so well together ! ""

"" How did you find this place? ""

"" My mother told me about it, actually . It was on the Internet , and she said it would be perfect for me. So I called up to see if they had any rooms available yet, but they were all booked until next month . But then we decided that since it is only a few miles from my office anyway (it's about ten minutes by car), I could just come over every day instead of staying there at night - so now I don't have to pay for a room anymore! Isn't that nice? ""

"" Wow ! That sounds great . Do you get along well with the other girls ? ""

"" Oh , yes, we do ! There are five of us in this building right now - me, two friends from college who moved here too recently (we live on different floors though) and three others that just moved in today. It's really nice having so many people around all day long because everyone helps each other out when something needs fixing or someone wants company . There aren't any problems between us yet , but if there ever was one , I think we could work it out pretty easily.""

"" What do you like to do in your free time? ""

"" Oh, I love reading books and watching movies. Also, I play tennis sometimes with my roommates. But mostly I just relax here at home because this building has everything I need .""

"" Do you think it's hard being away from family for so long ? ""

"" Oh , yes ! My parents are very worried about me since they don't know what kind of work I do yet. But my brother helps them out by telling them where we live and how much money I make every month . We talk on Skype sometimes too.""

"" Well , I taught English at the Berlitz School of Languages . ""

"" Really ? Are you fluent in French now ? ""

"" Oh , yes ! I speak it pretty well . But I also lived for a while in Japan and learned some Japanese. Then I worked as an interpreter for a year at a factory that made medical equipment, so I picked up a little Spanish too. I like to travel and learn languages . ""

In the last three stories, we have had two girls being helped by two different men. Ruth and Carl are in love with each other but they've never met before until now. In this story, we will learn how a young man would act if he was in this situation.

If you were at a restaurant or a bar with someone you didn't know very well and that person asked you to walk them back to their house after closing time, what would you do? If the person you are walking home is male or female, does your answer change? Would it be safe for you to walk home alone in your hometown late at night?

"" Yes , but don't tell me how many buses to take . It is a long trip from Queens for her and she doesn't know where Chinatown is ! ""

"" Well , I'll see you at 10,45 then . Bye . ""

Ruth hung up the phone. She had forgotten how many buses there were in the city! Oh well. It didn't matter. The important thing was that Ann would be able to see the sights with her friends tomorrow.

The other students nodded and smiled. They were about to begin their field trip to the famous city of Tokyo, Japan's capital. They were going to visit the world-famous Tsukiji Market for its fresh seafood and many delicious cuisines. After that, they would head on to an observation deck at one of Tokyo's highest buildings to have a bird's eye view of the whole city below them.

They were all very excited and couldn't wait to get there.

After class was over, they went to the bus that was going to take them to their destination. A teacher helped them get on the right bus before getting off himself. After about half an hour, the students saw that they had already arrived at Tokyo. The teacher was waiting for them at the entrance of the Tsukiji Market.

The market had many food stalls with delicious foods. But since it was early in the morning , only a few stalls were open. They went to one and ordered some sushi, which is famous all around the world. The teacher told them that they could take as much as they wanted but not more than ten pieces each.

They then went to the observation deck at the top of a skyscraper with an amazing view. At first glance , they saw that Tokyo was surrounded by water on three sides and mountains on the other side . It was incredibly beautiful from up there ! After taking in this magnificent view, they headed back down to get ready for their next activity: shopping at the biggest mall ever built.

The students walked around looking at all kinds of things until it started getting late. They decided that they had seen enough and went out again to have dinner before going back home ."

# Chapter Three : The Patient

### Background Information

In this chapter the patient will be a man named Mr. Johnson. He has had diarrhea for 2 days and is unable to keep anything down, including water. His family called an ambulance and he was brought to the hospital.

Mr. Johnson's condition is not improving despite his visiting doctors on staff at the emergency room.

The EMS crew took a history of Mr. Johnson before they started their trip to the hospital. They also observed his signs and symptoms as they were en-route.

On arrival, he was wheeled into an examination room where a doctor assessed him immediately. He then performed further tests to try and diagnose what the problem may be. 

Mr. Johnson was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and treatment. His condition is still not improving.

"" Oh ! that's nice . ""

"" Where to now ? ""

"" To my place please . ""

"" All right . Take your bags . ""

"" I won't put them in . ""

"" Oh , please do . We are on our way and we haven 't much time . ""

"" That's all right . Let it stay with you . ""

"" Thanks. ""

"" Well , where to now ? ""

"" To the next station . ""

"" How far is that ? ""

"" I don't know exactly , but at least 50 kilometers away . ""

"" Oh ! That 's far . But it can be done by lunch time . ""

"" Yes . ""

"" Thanks . We are all set then . ""

"" What about my money ? ""

"" I'll give you a bill when we reach the station . ""

"" Oh , that 's very nice . ""

"" Here we are ! ""

"" Where ? ""

"" In front of a hospital . ""

"" But what is it for ? ""

"" It's just an ordinary hospital . ""

"" I thought you said something else . ""

"" All right , get out . Come along . ""

"" Thanks. """

"" Why not ? He is very fond of her . ""

""But she don't like his ways . She told me that he spends too much time with those fellows at the club . ""

"" But what can a man do ? We are always together , day and night . I think it's quite natural that we should be together when we go out , or when there is anything going on that interests us both. Susan must make up her mind to that . ""

"" But she don't like the way he looks at other women in public places , and how he smiles and talks to them . I saw him do it once myself . And she says they are not so good looking as his wife . ""

""What do you want me to say ? If Susan wants a divorce she will get one . Peter can't prevent her from having one if she asks for it. But don't let the subject drop, or I shall tell them that we have been talking about it. You are such an innocent fool.""

"" Well , you needn't look so cross at me when I see that Susan is going to get a divorce . ""

""I'm not cross . It's just that I don't want my husband to know we have been talking about it. You are a little fool, anyway.""

"" What ? Do you think that Peter knows more than I do ? He can talk of nothing but his wife all day long , and how handsome she is , and what a good dancer . And he says that Susan isn't a bit like other women ; she never goes out to theatres with her girl friends ; she stays at home alone and plays the piano while Peter sits in the other room and smokes. But I know better than you do how much women talk about their husbands when they are together . ""

""That's a silly thing to say.""

"" Well , if Susan wants a divorce she will get it , won't she ? And what does Peter think of that ? If he is so fond of her why doesn't he make things right and stop all the talk ? I guess he is as much to blame for this as she is . ""

""Well, you can go and tell Peter how angry I am with him. Let him say what he wants about Susan's conduct . He knows better than anybody else if it is true or not. I'm going home now.""

"" Well, have you asked the new girl to come over and play ? ""

"" No; not yet. ""

"" She's too shy ? ""

"" I guess so . ""

"" That's too bad ; if she is a nice girl, she should be invited into our play-group. ""

"" I don't know; but I'll ask her when I see her at school tomorrow, and then tell you what she says. ""

THE STOLEN GUN

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT 1906 BY CHARLES COOK & CO., CHICAGO.]

THE BOYS OF TOMMY'S FARM

""Tell me about the gun, Tommy. Did you ever see one like that before ? ""

""No; I never did.""

""What do you suppose it is for? ""

""I don't know exactly; but it looks to me as though it were a cannon.""

""Well, you are right ; it is a cannon. It was stolen last night from the village armory. ""

""You mean that the soldiers took it away ? ""

""Yes . But they did not take it all; for this piece is broken off , and I saw the men come to work with crow-bars trying to pull it out.""

""The men were soldiers ? ""

""No ; but some of them looked like that. Others were in suits as though they belonged to a church. But they all came here, for we found this paper on one of them . This is a picture of the broken cannon and the place where it was stolen. Here is another picture; this shows what happened at the time. ""

""Were any people hurt ? ""

""Yes! There was an old man who lives here, and he was frightened almost to death by the noise that came from this gun . But no one else was hurt.""

""I should think they would be sorry they stole that cannon. Don't you think so ? ""

""Oh, I don't know; perhaps some of them were glad. It might have been very valuable to the men who took it. You see that there is a lot of gold on this paper . And if it could be sold for gold , it would be worth a good deal. But how could they get rid of such a heavy cannon ? ""

""They couldn't; and that is why I asked you what it was like.""

""I think it must have been brought away in pieces. That is the only way it could have been taken here.""

""It looks as though there were two cannons in this picture . What do you suppose happened ? ""

""I guess that one of them exploded, and blew up the other gun with it. And so it was broken into pieces just like ours here.""

THE HOUNDS OF LIONEL'S FARM

LIONEL : ""I hear that you have two hounds. Tell me about them .""

RALPH : ""Well, there is a dog in the woods out back of our house , and he has a big litter of puppies.""

LIONEL : ""Why do they call him a dog ? ""

RALPH : ""Because he doesn't bark like a fox or a coyote. He whines, just like the little pups we have around our house .""

LIONEL : ""Whose dog is it ? ""

RALPH : ""His name is 'Pup,' and I think he must belong to some one who has been hunting with a gun.""

LIONEL : ""Why do you say that?""

RALPH : ""'Because there are no foxes or coyotes in these woods; but there are plenty of rabbits. Pup hunts rabbits and makes them into his dinner, instead of trying to kill other animals .""

LIONEL : ""He sounds like a good dog. He must be very useful.""

RALPH : ""Yes ! And you should hear the way he carries himself when he sees us coming in the road. Just as soon as he knows that we are looking at him, he puts on an air of importance, and walks up and down with his tail straight out, showing that he is our friend.""

LIONEL : ""He certainly looks as though he would make a good companion for us. But why doesn't Pup bark if you call him ? ""

RALPH : ""'Because he has never heard the sound of any dog but his own mother and father, and so he doesn't know what it is. When we came into these woods, I think that Pup was surprised to find us around; for he had no idea that dogs could be like us.""

LIONEL : ""He looks as though he would make a fine companion .""

RALPH : ""'I don't know about that. He is such an ugly little thing that nobody ever likes him except Pup and his mother. And the only way to get any one else to like them, would be for them to do tricks.""

LIONEL : ""And can they ? ""

RALPH : ""'No; not as well as our dog does .'""

THE SHOOTING AT TOMMY'S FARM

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT 1906 BY CHARLES COOK & CO., CHICAGO.]

LIONEL : ""What do you mean, Ralph ? The only thing I ever heard that dog do was to bark at us when we came near his house.""

RALPH : ""'But Pup can't bark; he whines like a puppy.""

""Well ! Do you think it would be worth while for him to learn tricks ? ""

""That depends on how they are done. If they could do some of the tricks that our dog does , I believe that everybody would like them just as well as we do our own dogs .""

LIONEL : ""What kind of a trick can a dog do?""

RALPH : ""'Why, he can sit up and beg for something to eat. He can shake hands with you when you say 'howdy.' And he can make any number of different sounds, if he has learned them.""

LIONEL : ""But Pup couldn't learn to do that.""

RALPH : ""'I don't think so; not at once. But after a while I believe he would get along as well as some other dogs we know. You see, when the first dog was made by God, He gave him the power to understand things , and also to speak to us with his voice .""

LIONEL : ""And what has that got to do with Pup's not learning tricks ? ""

RALPH : ""'Why, he doesn't know how to talk. God told our first dog that if he did his lessons well and obeyed all the rules that were made for him , that He would teach him to speak just as other dogs do .'""

LIONEL : ""Then you think Pup should be taught ? ""

RALPH : ""'I certainly do. And I am going to see if I can find a man who will give him lessons.'""

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT 1906 BY CHARLES COOK & CO., CHICAGO.]

THE DOGS OF LIONEL'S FARM

RALPH : ""There is another dog in the village that I think you would like to know. His name is 'Sam,' and he lives on a farm not far from here .""

LIONEL : ""'How did you come to know him ? '""

RALPH : ""'I heard my father tell about it.""

LIONEL : ""Did Sam live where your father used to live, before he bought this farm?""

RALPH : ""'Yes; but I don't believe that there was any connection between them. The old dog and the farmer lived together as friends for many years ; and then, when the farmer died , Sam went back to his own people in the village.'""

LIONEL : ""Why did he do that ? ""'Because they wanted him.""

RALPH : ""'Yes; but not because they knew any better how to take care of a dog than my father does. They liked Sam so much, that when the farmer died , and no one else came forward to claim the dog for himself, his relatives bought him.'""

L

"" Is she thin or fat ? ""

"" No , not at all . I think that she is quite pretty . ""

"" She has a beautiful face . ""

"" Have you seen her hair? ""

"" No, but it seems very nice from what I've heard . ""

"" I think that you will like her . ""

"" Does she have a car ? ""

"" Yes , but not a very expensive one . ""

"" I can tell you how to meet her. ""

"" How? ""

"" When you see her, say hello and ask her name . Then invite her over for coffee . After that just let things happen naturally . ""

"" You mean we should act natural ? ""

"" Well , yes. Just be yourself. That's the best way to get to know someone better . ""

"" I'll try it. Thanks. ""

"" And then ? ""

"" Then I saw that she had a very pretty face and smooth skin . ""

"" What color is her hair ? ""

"" Her hair is light brown in color , with bangs across her forehead . ""

"" What about her clothes ? ""

"" She wears a nice, dark green dress . ""

"" Is that the only thing she's wearing ? ""

"" I don't think so . ""

"" Oh yes ! Her shoes are light brown with pretty flowers on them and her stockings are light blue . ""

"" That sounds very nice. Now, tell me what else you see when you look at this girl.""

"" I notice that she has a lot of freckles across the bridge of her nose and down across her cheeks , ""

"" I don't think I like girls with freckles . ""

"" Well, there's a reason for it. They're attractive to boys because they are considered sexy and cute . So if you want to get the attention of the boy of your choice then go ahead and be yourself , even if that means having some freckles on your face ! ""

"" I think she should wear a scarf over her nose though because it looks kinda bad. ""

"" What about her hair ? ""

"" She has beautiful long brown hair that is soft and silky to touch . ""

"" Well , if she's as pretty on the outside then surely her personality will be just as nice ! ""

"" I don't think so . ""

"" Oh yes, you do! Just because someone is attractive on the outside doesn't mean that they are going to be attractive on the inside. Look at all the celebrities out there in Hollywood , they're all pretty but some of them have such nasty attitudes and bad habits . ""

"" Well, I think she is pretty and if you don't like her then maybe you should move away from this town because there aren't any other girls as pretty as that one here ! ""

""It seems to me that if a person is going around behaving in such an arrogant way, he should expect people to gossip about him.

""That is true , I suppose . But still I don ’ t want my wife and children to think that we are being rude or snobbish in any way, do you understand ? ""

""Well, I don ’ t see how anyone could get the idea of rudeness from your behavior. You are as polite as can be with these people , aren’t you ? ""

"" Oh yes , that is true . But we have to be careful, haven ’ t we ? We wouldn ’ t want to give them any reason to speak badly about us. ""

""Well then , I think your children should learn how to behave the same way with everyone they meet . ""

""That is what I say ! And not only that : if you are going to be rude to someone, why should it matter who he or she is ? There may be a time when we might need some help from this person , and then it would be too late. You should treat everyone with kindness and respect , regardless of how much money they have, or what their family name is . ""

""Well , I guess you are right ! It isn ’ t good to talk that way about people we don’t know very well . I just wish there were some way for us to meet them on a more equal footing . ""

""What do you mean ? You can speak to these people as politely or rudely as they do, and if they are rude , it will be because of their own bad manners. ""

"" Yes , that is true too. It’s just that we don ’ t know them . I suppose we could have tea together sometime.""

""That would be nice ! If you can manage to make yourself understood without seeming rude, then they will learn how to behave with us as well . ""

""Yes, yes . But what would I say ? They might not understand me anyway. ""

""That ’ s right ! If they don’t know your language , then they will have to learn it quickly in order for you to talk with them.""

""Well . That sounds easy enough. And when we get there, how do we act ? What are the rules that we should follow? ""

""That is simple too ! If someone walks up to you and says ‘ Excuse me , sir ’ or ‘ Madam ’ or whatever the appropriate term might be in your language – if he says this politely enough then you should answer him likewise : ‘ Yes ? ’ Then ask what he wants.

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,270,llama-2-7b@q8_0_270.txt,"The Dragon Boat Festival, or Duanwu Jie 端午节 / 端儀节 , is an important Chinese public holiday celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month according to the lunar calendar. It honors Qu Yuan (340–278 BC), a famous poet and politician of the State of Chu during the Warring States period. His suicide by drowning himself in Miluo River is said to have been caused by the fall of his native state, as well as political persecution by its successors, so on this day, people traditionally race dragon boats and eat Zongzi (雜碼) , a kind of Chinese food.

## History

Qu Yuan was banished from his home because he opposed corruption among the Chu state's government. He spent his time writing poetry that reflected the suffering of the common people in ancient China. A poem titled Li Sao (離騷) is one of his greatest works, which describes him as ""drifting on a raft alone"", unable to return home or go elsewhere.

The festival originated in 214 BC when the third-century poet Qu Yuan committed suicide by drowning himself in a river after being banished for opposing corruption among the royal court of Chu. The local people raced their boats on the river to save him from drowning, and dropped rice dumplings into the water as food to lure fish away from Qu Yuan's body. This was because the fish were thought to be his favorite food.

The dragon boat festival became more widely known when it was made a national holiday in 1963 by the Chinese Government. It is now celebrated on the fifth day of the lunar calendar (which usually falls between May and June on the Gregorian calendar). The event also commemorates another patriotic poet, Li Bai (李白), who died in A.D. 818.

## Zongzi

Traditional zongzi are triangular-shaped bamboo baskets filled with sticky rice and wrapped with banana leaves or reed leaves. There is a variety of fillings including sweet red bean paste, glutinous rice with meat filling, savory pork, etc., but the most commonly used type is sticky rice with salted egg yolk inside. This kind of zongzi is also known as ""zhong"" (粽) .

The festival's food also includes Zhongzi 馅子 and Tangyuan 汤圆. The word tangyuan literally means ""round ball"", which refers to the round shape of glutinous rice balls, usually filled with sweet fillings such as red bean paste or black sesame paste. It is one of the most popular festival foods in Chinese culture and a traditional New Year food.

## Dragon boat races

See also: Dragon Boat Racing and List of dragon boat regattas

Dragon boat racing, as well as eating Zongzi and drinking realgar wine (硫黃酒), is an important part of the festival in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and other areas with large Chinese communities. The dragon boats are made of wood, usually from teak or other fine hardwoods and covered with skin or cloth, and they have a dragon's head and tail at the bow and stern, respectively; they are rowed by 20 to 70 paddlers in a sitting position, facing toward the bow of the boat.

Dragon Boat Races take place on the fifth day of the fifth month, in memory of the suicide of the ancient Chinese poet Qu Yuan who drowned himself in Miluo River because his political views were not accepted by Emperor Chu. It is believed that if he could have reached land on this particular date, he would be rescued from death.

## In popular culture

Dragon Boat Races are featured in the following media:

* The Chinese film The Emperor's Shadow (1987), directed by Zhang Yimou
* The TV series The Legend of the Condor Heroes (2003) and Return of the Condor Heroes (2006)

* In the animated series American Dragon: Jake Long, there is a Chinese restaurant called ""Chu's"" named after Qu Yuan which plays an important role in the episodes ""Mirror of Life and Death"" and ""Race Against Time"". The restaurant hosts annual dragon boat races on the day of the Dragon Boat Festival.
* In the video game Street Fighter V, a new stage called Shadaloo Dojo is available during the 2015 Chinese New Year seasonal event and features a race at the Dragon Boat Festival."

"" Yes, my young lady ! when we talk about death we must always remember one thing  : that no change can ever bring about any new form of matter.

"" And do you know why ? ""

"" Yes, my young lady ! because everything that exists must come to an end . You may perhaps remember the story of a man who, having been lost at sea for many months, came ashore on an island, where he lived happily and peacefully for some time.

He took his hat off, bowed low, and left the room. The girl went back to her reading ; but soon afterwards she threw down the book and began crying . Then she leaped from her chair, tore her dress as if it were made of paper , ran with wild haste into a room near by, and locked herself in for fear of being seen .

XII.

"" If one could only be alone ! ""

The girl spent the whole day weeping and crying so violently that she could hardly breathe. At length her mother came to see if she were ill. She found her lying on her bed, still as a statue, with her eyes fixed upon the wall. It seemed as though she had been stricken dumb .

"" My daughter ! "" said the mother, who was quite upset ; "" my poor child  ! I am afraid that you are not well . ""

The girl started up quickly and began to laugh wildly . Then she spoke .

"" Mother , I have seen death . ""

"" Mother ; if you knew what had happened to-day, and how the whole world has been turned upside down , and everything changed round again . Oh ! I cannot say it  ""

"" But why should your heart be so troubled ? What have you seen or heard  ? ""

"" Ah ! mother ! if you knew ! if you only knew . And yet, perhaps, no one could explain it better than myself. It is very difficult to tell all that I feel and what passes through my mind , but I must do what I can . I shall begin from the beginning . The first time that I ever saw anything was when I had just been born . At least , I think so ; because as a rule people cannot see things at once. But perhaps I may be mistaken . Perhaps it all began with the moon  . And now listen, mother ! Listen to my story . ""

"" Well ! tell me your story . I am listening . ""

XIV.

The girl was silent for some time , as if she were thinking of what she should say ; then she began :

"" Mother, when I first opened my eyes I saw nothing but darkness and mist; and all this made me cry very much . Then my mother came into the room where I lay  and put her arms round me. But at that moment a terrible storm burst in upon us with such violence that we were afraid it would blow away the roof of our house. My father, who was a sailor , took up his arms and ran out into the night . Then I heard him crying bitterly; and I had never seen him so sad before. He called me by name several times as if he knew that I could hear him ; but all my tears were useless . As soon as the storm passed away, I was still lying on my bed and seemed to be looking up into the sky. But there was no moon  and nothing else above me except a dark cloud which covered the whole of heaven . My mother had been in great trouble about my father ; and at length she fell into an anxious sleep, with her head resting upon her arms . As soon as she woke I asked her where my father was , and what it was that made him cry so much. But when I asked these questions it seemed to me as if all the world had fallen on my head, and I began to feel dreadfully frightened  ""

"" What ! how dreadful . ""

"" Yes ; for at first my mother could not tell me anything , but after a time she told me that she did not know where my father was ; and this made me very unhappy indeed. At length, when I had been in the world for several days, one evening it seemed to me as if all my little teeth fell out of my head; but though I felt so ill that I could hardly breathe , my mother did not seem at all alarmed . However, soon after she gave me some wine mixed with sugar and honey ; which made me feel a good deal better. In the middle of the night I began to see things around me in quite a strange way, but when I tried to tell my mother about them they disappeared as if by magic . She began to cry bitterly , and I think that she would have gone out of her mind if it had not been for an old woman who lived near us. When morning came , I began to feel much better ; and after a little time, when the sun was high in the heavens, I saw my father returning home. He came in with his arms full of beautiful things which he held out towards me . But as soon as I took them from him my mother became angry and cried bitterly again because they had been given to me ; so I thought no more about these things until another time  ""

"" This is very strange ! "" said the mother. "" Go on with your story , however.""

XV.

"" After a while , when I was able to look around me , I began to notice all kinds of strange objects in my room . The first thing that struck me was an image of our Lord, and after it came two great lamps made out of gold . Whenever I looked at them the sun seemed to be rising ; but when they were removed from my sight they disappeared as if by enchantment.

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,27,llama-2-7b@q8_0_27.txt,""" Ahhhhh ! "" says the patient.

"" Good ! Now, if I can get it open any wider, will you please say'ahhhh ' again ? ""

"" All right , doctor , but my throat hurts so badly that I don’t think I can do it . ""

"" Well, we have no time to argue about it . Just open your mouth and say’ ah ’ one more time . Now swallow. Good ! Your nose is stuffed up again ? ""

"" Yes , doctor . My head feels like a rock , my throat aches , I feel dizzy , and my temperature has gone up to 102.7° F. I can’t see straight , my stomach hurts, and there is a ringing in both ears ! ""

"" Just sit down over there . And don't move until I tell you what to do next . Now, just sit here quietly . Don't move your head at all . I want to look into your right ear . Let me have a mirror , please. Good ! "" says the doctor as he turns away from the patient who has sat there motionless while being examined.
"" Your right eye is twitching . We ' ll give it an injection and then you can go home and lie down. Now, let's get you up to my office. ""

The patient, meanwhile, had been thinking about the doctor's words : I must be a terrible case. If he thinks I'm all right, I'd better stay away from him. He knows more about the human body than anybody else in the world . Maybe I'm dying , or at least my mind is affected and I can’t think straight . I ' d better get to bed as soon as possible .

The doctor puts a thermometer into the patient's mouth. After that he tells him : Now, put this handkerchief over your nose and breathe through it while we go downstairs. I want you to lie down on the examining table. Take off your hat and coat, please . ""

The patient is not really able to follow what is going on. He has only one thought in his mind : It’s all over ! My life is finished . The doctor and his assistant take my pulse , blood pressure and temperature. Then they examine me with a stethoscope, listen with their ears to the heartbeat, the breathing, and the sounds coming from the chest . They lift up one leg and press on it in different places, to see whether or not there is any pain there. Next they pull on my arm so that I can't move at all. Then they shine a light into each eye, one after another, with a little instrument . After that , the doctor turns me over onto my stomach and lifts up my head. He takes the thermometer out of my mouth, puts it in his pocket, and then gets out a sponge and begins to wipe my face clean with water. The patient is beginning to lose his senses now . But he does not complain because he feels that this treatment must be necessary .

Then comes the injection . And soon after that, I'm allowed to go home again. The doctor says: "" You won't have any more trouble from your cold for several days . Now, here is a little bottle of pills which you can take twice every day for ten or twelve days if necessary . But it shouldn’t be necessary because we ' ll give you another injection next week.""

The doctor and his assistant are now looking at the patient with friendly eyes as they say good-bye. He is not sure whether or not this visit was necessary ; but he knows that he is no longer ill , and so he walks out of the office feeling better than he has for several days . But when he gets home, his wife tells him that she hasn't seen a single person since she got up early in the morning. She didn't have time to finish her housework before he came home from the doctor . So now it is too late ; and everything must be put away immediately if she wants to go out with their friends at seven o ' clock , as has been planned for several weeks.

"" Oh ! "" says the patient to himself, "" I think it would have been better for me not to have seen this doctor . Maybe he really did make my headache worse and gave me a temperature ? But then what would be the matter with me if I didn't see him again? "" So he decides that since his wife is busy cleaning up the house , he will go back to sleep for an hour or so until she has finished .

A few days later, however, the patient has a very bad headache. He can’ t get out of bed . His temperature is 103° F again, and there are spots before his eyes when he tries to read or watch television . "" What's wrong with me ? "" says the patient to himself as he lies in bed feeling miserable .
"" I've had a runny nose , my throat hurts, and now this headache . Maybe it’ s just nerves . "" So he gets out of bed and goes downstairs. The first person who comes into the room is his wife . She sees that her husband looks bad and asks him what's wrong ?
"" Well, I don't know , "" says the patient. But when she begins to talk about all the things that need doing around the house before they can go out with friends next week, he feels very angry . Soon his temper rises even more because of her constant complaining while she is cleaning up their bedroom and kitchen . Then comes breakfast : eggs , bacon , juice , toast and coffee . "" That's enough ! "" shouts the patient when his wife brings him another glass of orange juice. And it isn’t long before he has had a fit of rage and starts to scream at her about all she does wrong .

"" Oh, don't talk like that! You sound just like my mother-in-law ! "" cries the patient as he begins to cry and beg for mercy . But his wife can’ t stop yelling back until finally she slams down a plate of scrambled eggs onto the table in front of him. Then she takes off her apron, throws it into the sink with everything else that has been dirtying up their house for weeks, and walks out of the room .

"" Oh , Lord ! "" says the patient as he lies on his bed again feeling very sorry for himself because he knows what will happen next : His wife will come back in a few minutes to ask him where she should find some clean clothes so that they can go out with friends at seven o ' clock this evening .

Now, it is eleven o ’clock and the patient has been lying on his bed for nearly three hours without moving or even thinking about getting up. Suddenly he remembers something : If I had seen a doctor yesterday morning , then maybe my headache would have gone away by now ? He gets out of bed , goes into another room where there is no one else around, opens the telephone book and looks for the name of an eye-ear specialist in this town . There isn't one listed under Eye , Ear or Nose; so he closes it again without finding anything useful . Now what am I going to do ?

"" Well, if you ask me , "" says a voice behind him, "" It sounds like it would be a good idea for you to go see the doctor before this week is over.""

The patient turns around quickly because he doesn’t know where the sound came from . But then he recognizes his wife's face smiling at him through tears as she stands in the doorway holding her apron in one hand while with the other she pulls a bottle of pills out of an old shirt pocket which is hanging over her shoulder .
"" I didn't know you were awake , "" says his wife, who has been waiting outside to see if he was going to get up before coming into this room. Then they both laugh because it seems so funny that the patient should have such bad headaches and be afraid of seeing a doctor at the same time .

So now all of our patients are sitting in their beds, or lying on the floor next to them thinking about what happened yesterday . Maybe they will remember something else too : That there is an eye-ear specialist in this town who can treat any kind of illness that you have ? And then perhaps they will get up and go see him before tomorrow morning.

"" I thought so . Well , what can you do for me ? ""

"" I can prescribe something that will help you . But first let me see your pulse and blood pressure . Stand up on one foot and close your eyes . ""

"" All right , doc'tor . Here goes. 'One, two-three-four . One, two-three - four . ' Now , open your eyes . ""

"" You have a good strong pulse , but you are running a high fever . I'm going to give you an injection and some pills that will help you sleep . In a day or so the fever will be gone . But in the meantime, you ' lIe have to stay home . ""

"" Well, doctor , can I go back to work ? ""

"" Not yet . You're not well enough . Don't do any heavy lifting or manual work for at least two days. ""

"" OK, doc'tor . But when can I go back? ""

"" When you feel like it . I wouldn't say anything to your boss, though. He might get angry and fire you if he thought you were trying to trick him into keeping a sick man on the payroll. And that would not be good for you.

"" No , doc'tor . I don't want to lose my job. ""

"" I understand. ""

15. The doctor came in, looked at me and said, ""I have something very serious to tell you.""

""What is it?""

""You are going to die within the next year.""

I was shocked, but tried not to show that he had upset me.

""How can you be so sure? You don't know anything about my health,"" I said.

""I am a doctor and have seen many people before like this who are now dead,"" the doctor answered calmly. ""It is too late for you.""

""If it's too late, then why should I worry?"" I asked.

""Because I can save your life if you follow my instructions carefully."" He looked around the room as though he was checking something and said, ""Have you got any cigarettes, tea or coffee in this room?""

I shook my head no.

""Then leave immediately,"" he ordered.

I thought about what had just happened to me but I didn't want to believe it.

""Why can't I stay here? What will happen if I smoke a cigarette or drink coffee or tea in this room?"" I asked. ""You said you could save my life, so tell me.""

The doctor sighed. He looked at his watch and then answered, ""If you do any of the three things that I have just mentioned, it will be fatal to you. Your body will die immediately.""

I thought for a minute about what he had said and decided I wasn't going to take any chances. I left the room immediately.

""Hey, wait a second! Where are you going?"" I heard him call as he came out of his office after me. ""Come back here!"" But it was too late for me because I was already gone.

I went into another building on the hospital grounds and told them what had just happened to me. The doctor looked at my face, checked my pulse and asked me some questions about my health history before he could believe what I said. He decided that I was not lying or imagining things because I seemed sincere.

After hearing my story, the hospital staff decided it would be best if we told someone else about what happened to me in case something similar happened to them in their homes or offices later on. They didn't want anyone else going through such an experience unless they were sure that everything was safe for them first time around!

16. The doctor said, ""It is too late for you."" I was shocked and tried not to show that he had upset me.

""How can you be so sure? You don't know anything about my health,"" I said.

The doctor looked at me coldly and said:

""I am a doctor. I have seen many people before like this who are now dead.""

I was shocked, but tried not to show that he had upset me.

""If it's too late, then why should I worry?"" I asked.

He shook his head no and said: ""Because I can save your life if you follow my instructions carefully."" He looked around the room as though checking something and continued speaking in a calm voice: ""Have you got any cigarettes, tea or coffee in this room? If not then leave immediately!""

I thought about what had just happened to me but didn't want to believe it.

""Why can't I stay here? What will happen if I smoke a cigarette or drink coffee or tea in this room?"" I asked. ""You said you could save my life, so tell me.""

The doctor sighed. He looked at his watch and then answered: ""If you do any of the three things that I have just mentioned it will be fatal to you! Your body will die immediately.""

I thought for a minute about what he had said and decided not to take any chances. I left the room immediately.

""Hey, wait a second! Where are you going?"" The doctor called after me as he came out of his office. ""Come back here!"" But it was too late for me because I was already gone.

17. It is very important to understand that the doctor's advice can only be given on the basis of certain facts and not feelings or emotions. In other words, if you are not sure about something then do not ask him. Also, never ask questions like ""Can I take this medicine?"" If someone has prescribed it for you already then there is no point in asking again as they would probably have already told you everything that needs to be known before they gave it out.

18. In case of an emergency please make sure that everyone involved knows what their job description entails so that things don't get confusing during stressful times like this one!

19. When talking about something serious like medical issues always keep your voice calm and controlled even if it seems hard at first because people tend to listen more closely when someone speaks softly rather than shouting which makes them think that there could be something wrong with their ears (which isn't true).

"" Thank you , doctor . ""

"" Now, if only this cold were as contagious as the one he had last winter . He could spread it around the office in no time. ""

# 10.
"" Good morning . ""

"" Morning . ""

"" Can I see you for a minute , doctor ? ""

"" Surely . Just be quick about it . There are lots of other patients waiting . ""

"" Well, here's the thing . You know my wife had two children . I don’ t want any more . But she says that if there are any tests in birth control that will make sure we never have any more, she wants to try them. She’ s afraid of having another baby because she says they give her headaches and she has a hard time feeding the one she had already. What do you think ? ""

""Well, it's not all that simple, Mr . . . ""

"" I'm Bill Roberts . ""

""I know who you are , but what was your question about birth control again ? ""

"" Well . You see my wife is afraid of having another baby because she says they give her headaches and she has a hard time feeding the one she had already. What do you think ? ""

""Well, Mr Roberts, I think your wife should take some aspirin or something. Now , let's get to the point . Have you been taking any birth control measures ? ""

"" No, we haven't really done much of anything yet. We have tried using a condom but it doesn’ t seem to do very well for us. And she says she hates using birth pills because they make her so tired all the time . She wants something else , something different that will work better without giving her headaches and making her so tired. ""

"" Well, Mr Roberts, I don't think it is such a good idea for your wife to use anything until you find out what really happened in the past with her children. A woman can have two babies without having them close together , or even at all . And she may not know it yet, but maybe that's what has been happening with your wife. Have you ever discussed this matter with her ? ""

"" No, not really . I know we should do more about it. She seems to think it might help if I went and saw a counselor or something. I told her I would come in here and talk with you , but she doesn't seem too happy about that either . ""

"" Mr Roberts, I think your wife is right. Your problem should be discussed with someone who can help both of you understand it better. You will have to do a lot more than just say that you want her not to have any more children. And before anything else is done, she needs to see a specialist who can tell us what happened in the past and what kind of treatment she would need now if there are any problems at all. I'm sure we can find someone here or through your insurance company . ""

"" Well, thank you very much , doctor . ""

"" Now, Mrs Roberts, please try to do something about this problem while you are waiting for us to get some answers for both of you . You don't want to keep having headaches and being tired all the time if there is a way you can avoid it. Is that right ? ""

"" Well, I guess so . ""

"" All right , then . You can come back in about two weeks when we have more information for you. Meanwhile, take some aspirin or something. Don't worry too much now if the pain is bothering your sleep at night . Just try to rest and relax as much as possible during the day, especially between 10 a.m. and noon when you are hungry. I have written down all of this information for you here on a little card so that you will remember it when you get home . ""

""Thank you very much , doctor . ""

# 11.
"" Good morning, doctor . What do you think ? ""

""Good morning, Mrs Thompson . I can't tell from what you have told me, but I am quite sure your son is deaf . ""

""But how did you know that , doctor ? I don't understand.""

""Well, for one thing he has never complained of a sore throat. And his headaches are in the back of his neck and not behind his eyes. And he never uses his hands to speak . ""

""But why is that ? ""

""Because he can't hear when you talk with your mouth, but he can see what you do with your hands so he knows how to understand what you want him to say or write for you.""

""Oh , I never thought of it like that . But if you are sure he is deaf, why did you tell me last week that he had a cold ? ""

""Because he has been coughing and sneezing just like most other kids his age with colds. And I am afraid your son may have a heart condition also . ""

# 12.
""Good morning , doctor . I’m feeling better now, but my throat is still really sore . What can I do ? ""

""All right then, young man , you can start by going to the rest room and washing your face with cold water from a faucet, not running hot tap water over it.""

""But why is that , doctor ? ""

""Because if you run hot water over your throat, all of the germs will be transferred right back to where they started. So put some ice cubes in a glass and pour some cold water on them until the water starts to steam. Then rub this mixture over your throat for five minutes.""

""Okay . I'll try it . Thank you , doctor . ""

# 13.
""Good morning, doctor . It seems that my mother is having a hard time understanding some of what you told her last week . So could you give me another copy of the instructions and maybe we can both read them together ? ""

""Certainly , young lady. I'll write it all out again.""

# 14.
""Good morning, doctor . What can I do about my cold ? ""

""Well, you may find that if you take a shower with lots of hot water instead of cold or warm water, you will probably feel better in just a few minutes. Then go and see your mother before you go to school.""

# 15.
""Good morning , doctor . What can I do about my throat ? ""

""Well, young man, why don’ t you try gargling with some warm water instead of cold or hot water, like most people have been doing for years? ""

# 16.
"" Good morning , doctor . My grandfather is very sick and has a terrible cough . What should I do ? ""

""Well, young lady, the best thing you can do is to bring him to see me as soon as possible so that we can find out what kind of an illness he might have.""

# 17.
""Good morning , doctor . My mother has a cold and doesn't feel good at all . What should I tell her ? ""

""Well, young lady, I think the best thing you can do is to get her some aspirin or something that she can take in the morning before breakfast for a couple of days. Then bring her back here so we can see what else might be wrong.""

# 18.
"" Good morning , doctor . My mother has been taking my father's medicine for the past few weeks, and I think it is time she went to the hospital . ""

""Well, young lady, you should do something about that right away. And in fact, it might not be a bad idea if your mother came here today so we could get her admitted into the hospital and give her some tests.""

# 19.
"" Good morning , doctor . My father is very sick and has been taking medicine for a long time . I think it would be good for him to go to the hospital . ""

""Well, young man, you might have something there. You should see that your mother comes with her father so that we can discuss this matter before they go on home.""

# 20.
""Good morning , doctor . My sister has been taking my father's medicine for the past few weeks and I think it is time she went to the hospital too . ""

""Well, young man, you are probably right about your sister needing some tests as well. If you have her here in a little while with your mother, we can start her treatment as soon as possible."""

### Exercise 12

There is not much difference in my daily life and that of my peers. My parents also do the same things as them to make a living.

I get up every morning, go to school, do homework after school, play with friends, do housework at night, watch TV or go to bed early. There is nothing special in this daily life.

### Exercise 13

""He's not the same as me.""
""His character is different from mine.""
""My personality is quite different from hers.""
""His way of thinking and his methods are quite different.""

### Exercise 14

I think I am a calm kind of person. When I get angry, my parents will give me some advice about calming down. They always say that anger isn't the answer to any problem. So I know that if you can stay cool and calm in times of trouble, then everything will turn out fine eventually.

I am not a shy person but sometimes I get too excited over something that others don't seem to be bothered by at all. This is probably because my hobby is dancing. When I see people dance well on stage or in films, I feel like running out and performing myself! If you ask me what kind of personality I have, then I would say ""quiet"".

### Exercise 15

It's not that hard for me to find friends. We go to the same school so it isn't difficult at all.

I think my friends like me because they know that I am a good person who does what she says and helps other people whenever she can. They also know that if you need anything, just ask me!

### Exercise 16

There is nothing special in my daily life . My parents have the same routine as mine: get up early , go to work , come back home late at night , eat dinner then watch TV until they fall asleep. They are not very busy people so we don't spend much time together during weekdays .

On Sundays, however , my father always goes fishing with his friends while my mother stays home and cooks dishes for us all day long ! When I grow up ,I want to be more like her than him !!!"

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,275,llama-2-7b@q8_0_275.txt,""" Sorry mate , gotta go . ""

The guy didn't seem to take it personally. He walked off and I headed back into the train station where the bus would be leaving from .
I had forgotten my camera on the bus when we went around the town a few weeks ago so I was trying to decide if i should try and catch up with the group again or get some snaps of the place by myself.
I decided to go it alone and take a quick walk through the city, and maybe buy a few things at the market stalls on my way back to the bus stop.
So I went out into the street , taking a few photos as I walked along .
A few hours later i was sitting at the bus stop drinking beers , when i suddenly heard some familiar voices behind me. It was them again!
I turned around and there they were ! They had followed me back to the bus station and waited for me until i arrived. They also brought a few others with them . A few more friends who they invited along.
After a quick chat we all sat down at an outdoor bar together and had some beers and dinner. We ended up having another 8 beers between us and then headed back to the hostel where i stayed that night. It was great fun ! I met such a nice group of guys .
The next day they were going on a tourist boat cruise and invited me along as well. It was fantastic. There were so many beautiful buildings everywhere we looked , from every angle there was something to see. The river cruise lasted around 2 hours and the guide gave us some history about the city . I didn't have much time to take any photos because i wanted to enjoy the experience, but i managed a couple of snaps with my phone as we floated down the canals.
After the boat tour was finished we all headed back to the hostel again and had another beer before parting ways for the night. I never heard from them again , but it's funny because they left me with such a good feeling that i always think about my time there whenever i need some inspiration .
I hope you guys liked this post! Thank you so much for reading, and if you like what i do please subscribe to stay updated ! I promise to post more content soon :)

"" No , thanks , really . ""

"" But it is so cheap , I can't believe how much they charge us for these things in the States. ""

"" Yeah, that sucks . ""

"" So anyway , my friend , you don't smoke weed ? ""

"" Nope . ""

"" Why not ? ""

"" It does nothing to me ! I mean , it just makes me feel stupid and lazy ! ""

"" Oh yeah ? ""

"" Yep ! You know , after smoking a few joints , you start to think that everything around you is soooo funny . So you can't stop laughing and the more you smoke weed, the higher you get until finally your mind just stops thinking altogether . And then , like you are floating or something ! I mean , it is kind of cool at first but after a few joints, I start to feel stupid and lazy ! ""

"" Oh yeah ? ""

"" Yep ! You know , when I am high on weed , all I want to do is lay on the bed and watch some TV or just sit in front of my computer . It gets boring after a few hours but it takes forever for me to get up off the couch to go do something productive, like play sports or go out and meet people ! ""

"" Yeah , I understand what you mean . ""

"" Oh , so your girlfriend does smoke weed ? ""

"" Nope , she doesn't . ""

"" Ahh . ""

"" But you know some one who does ? ""

"" Yeah , my sister smokes a lot of weed and it is starting to get on my nerves ! I mean , every day when I come home from work, I just want to kick back and relax but she is always sitting there on the couch , babbling on about what happened in class or how much she hates her teacher . It gets so annoying sometimes that I feel like smashing some one in the head ! ""

"" I know what you mean . ""

"" You don't smoke weed do you ? ""

"" Nope , never ever have and probably never will ! ""

"" So why are you asking me all these questions about it ? ""

"" Oh , nothing really . ""

"" Come on man ! I know what you want to ask ! ""

"" Nope ! You don't ! ""

"" Why do they call it weed or pot ? ""

"" What difference does that make ? ""

"" None at all but the other day , when my friend was telling me about how much money he made selling marijuana to kids in school, I asked him why he called it marijuana and not just plain weed . He said that nobody knows why they started calling it weed or pot back in the days but apparently it is a name from the past that stuck ! ""

"" Really ? ""

"" Yeah , and so far, no one has ever told me what the true origin of these words are ! You know , I mean like where did marijuana come from ? ""

"" Huh , well I have never heard any of this before . ""

"" So anyway , what do you think weed is ? ""

"" I don't know . ""

"" Do you mean to say that it doesn't exist at all and people just smoke some kind of herbs and call them marijuana ? ""

"" Well , I guess so . ""

"" Ok man ! Enough talking about this bullshit ! We should get outta here and go somewhere else for a drink ! ""

"" Ok , sure . ""

And then after all that talk , we got up to leave but before leaving the bar, my friend decided it would be funny if he could make me laugh so he took an empty water bottle off the shelf behind us and filled it with some kind of liquid that stunk like rotten eggs . When I saw him holding this thing in his hand , I knew what he was going to do but I couldn't stop laughing as soon as he threw it into my face !

"" Hahaha ! Oh man, you are so funny ! ""

And then after a few minutes of joking around with me, we left the bar and went for a drink at one of those outdoor pubs on the main square in town .

"" You’re so generous ! ""

"" So whatcha say, man ? ""

"" Thanks , but no thanks . ""

"" You don’t know what you are missing out on, brother . ""

"" No , I really do not need any drugs at the moment . ""

"" Alright, cool ! If you ever change your mind just let me know . ""

"" I will definitely keep that in mind . ""

"" Some weed ! ""

"" I like it when a lady speaks her mind ! But I guess you got to do your share as well right ? ""

"" So you smoke weed then ? ""

"" Occasionally yes , but not that often . ""

"" Well what about the blow and acid ? ""

"" Nope . Never used them . ""

"" And what ’ s the matter with you , I thought all the young people smoked pot these days ! You don ’ t even look old enough to have a driver ’ s license ! How old are you ? ""

"" Nineteen and half . ""

"" Oh sorry about that . So how old are you then ? ""

"" Twenty one , why do you ask ? ""

"" Well I don ’ t know . Is there something wrong with it ? ""

"" No not at all . ""

"" Well , I am only twenty six , but my friend wants to try some blow so can you help us out ? ""

"" Sure ! What are your names ? ""

"" John and Bill . ""

"" Ok , follow me into the back room of this car wash and we will get started . ""

"" I guess I could use a shower first though . ""

"" Come on John , we don ’ t have all day ! ""

*

"" What is that ? ""

"" This is the blow ! It should last us through two to three good sessions if you dose it properly . ""

"" And how many times will I need to smoke this stuff before my head will stop spinning and I can finally get some sleep again ? ""

"" Don ’ t know man , but at least a few hours . ""

*

"" Damn , that is the worst trip in the world ! ""

*

"" Bill, what are you doing ? ""

"" Nothing dude . ""

"" Well why do I feel like someone just punched me right in the gut ? ""

"" Probably because they did . ""

"" What ? Come on , you gotta be kidding ! Who would try to beat up a guy that is already tripping hard off of some blow ? ""

*

"" Man I think we are going to die here in the forest somewhere if this trip doesn ’ t get over with soon . ""

"" We need to find water fast Bill . ""

*

"" There it is ! That tree right over there has a stream running underneath it . Let ’ s check it out . ""

*

"" I guess the only thing left for us to do now is to get drunk and pass out so we can wake up in the morning when this trip is finally over with . ""

*

"" Dude ! That was totally awesome ! You really had me going there for a while ! ""

"" Thanks man . I didn ’ t expect it to affect you quite like that either . ""

"" Yeah , well my girlfriend and I used some weed this afternoon so maybe that is why I reacted even worse than usual . ""

*

"" That was one hell of a trip Bill ! Let ’ s do it again sometime soon huh ? ""

"" Sure thing , but next time let ’ s try and find an indoor spot to trip in though , this shit gets cold fast out here ! ""

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,261,llama-2-7b@q8_0_261.txt,""" You are right , it is hideous . ""

"" Thanks . What do you think of this one ? It was on sale . ""

"" So so , eh ? ""

"" But I can change the belt and put these shoes with it . ""

"" Oh , but those shoes are too tight ! You will have terrible corns in a few days . ""

"" So what do you think of this one ? It was on sale . ""

"" Hmmm , so-so . ""

"" I love the color . ""

"" The color is OK , but those shoes are too tight and ugly ! You can change them with these ones here . ""

"" These shoes aren ’ t that great either . ""

"" But they will make you look a bit more dressed up . And I hate to see you dressed up so badly . ""

"" Yeah, but don ’ t you think it is better to have ugly feet than an ugly ass ? ""

"" Well , no one can see your ass unless you want them too . But your feet are in everyone ’ s way all the time . ""

"" Oh I don ’ t mind having people staring at my feet . ""

"" So what do you think of this one then ? ""

"" It is OK . ""

"" How about this sweater ? ""

"" Not too bad, but it looks a bit tight. ""

"" Maybe we could try this one on and see how it looks with my skirt ? ""

"" Ok . Let ’ s do that then ! ""

"" We are going to the movies tonight , right ? What is playing ? ""

"" Nothing interesting I think, but since you want to go it will be OK. ""

"" Well we could always grab a bite afterwards. You like Chinese food ? ""

"" Sure . Do you mind if we eat with some other people ? ""

"" Not at all , just as long as it is cheap ! What do you think of this place ? ""

"" It looks OK, but I think there are nicer ones around here. ""

"" You are right . Let ’ s go in and have a look anyway. ""

"" Hey, how about going to the club later tonight after dinner ? ""

"" Yeah , sounds like fun. Are you coming ? ""

"" Not if it is too crowded and I don ’ t know anyone there. But you should come along . ""

"" I don ’ t really feel in the mood for going out to a club tonight, but maybe later in the week. ""

"" OK , that’s fine . Maybe we will go on Wednesday ? ""

"" No , I have to work that night . ""

"" Oh , well I guess it can wait. See ya ! Bye . ""

"" I heard you . You want me to choose the worst sweater in our wardrobe and tell you that it s not too flashy . ""

"" Yup ! ""

"" Sorry , but we are both so shallow . ""

"" Whaaat ? ""

"" We are so shallow ! I ’ m just as shallow as you are . You are looking for the best, the most beautiful , the one with more or less of whatever that suits your fancy and I am doing the same thing . ""

"" Okey , now you have to explain what you mean by ""shallow"" . ""

"" It s easy : we both like things for superficial reasons. We look at all these beautiful items in shops, but we don ’ t buy anything because we really need them or want them or believe that they fit with our personal style . Instead of choosing something that we know will make us feel good , and that we are sure will be used often by us, we choose things just to please other people. We buy stuff for others ! ""

"" Yeah but there ’ s no harm in that . ""

"" I guess not . But when you give an expensive sweater to your aunt because she likes it and you hate it , but you don ’ t tell her why, you are shallow . You don ’ t even care if the sweater will be used often or not. In fact, you don ’ t even know if your aunt will like it or not ! So what is the point ? ""

"" Hug, I can see where you are coming from now , but you don ’ t seem to get my point . You just made me feel bad and ashamed of myself for being so shallow . What do you think we should do instead ? Buy a sweater that we like, even if it means breaking the bank ? ""

"" Nope ! Buying stuff only because they look nice doesn ’ t make any sense. It might not be easy to find clothes that fit with your style and looks good on you but that s what you have to do . You can t buy a sweater that fits just because it s the right colour , or has a fancy label or costs too much money for you ! ""

"" That ’ s true. But how am I going to know if a sweater suits me or not ? The only way is to try it on and look at myself in the mirror . But what if we can t find clothes that suit us, what are we supposed to do ? ""

"" We could start by finding out our personal style ! You might like trendy clothes with bright colours and crazy patterns , but maybe you actually prefer sober, classic styles ? Or is it the other way around ? How about a test to see if your personality suits certain styles ? There are several tests on the internet . ""

"" I don ’ t know … I have never taken any test before. But I like your idea ! Let s find out our style and then we can start looking for clothes that fit with us . ""

"" Cool ! We should try this right away . Are you hungry ? ""

"" Don’t know how you can afford those sales . You always spend more than we do , no matter how many coupons or gift cards you use . ""

"" Easy — I work, while you sit on your duff and watch TV all day . ""

"" I have a real job ! ""

"" So does 90 percent of the population. ""

"" Fine ! If you don ’ t want to discuss my wardrobe choices , then why did you bother calling me ? ""

"" Because I thought it was nice that we had dinner together last night . ""

"" It wasn’t exactly a romantic evening ; it was just the two of us eating dinner at home. And now I have to do all this shopping for other people, and you don ’ t even want to help ! ""

"" Well , I guess that’s it then . You always know how to ruin Christmas — I hope you have a nice time with your parents . ""

"" Yeah, well you don ’ t even know who I ’ m rooting for ! ""

"" Well we can have a bet . ""

"" A bet ? What do you want to bet on ? ""

"" Who ’ s going to win the game , of course ! ""

"" What ’ s our wager if we ’ re wrong ? ""

"" Whatever you like . ""

"" Let me think . Well how about this – I get to choose what you wear for a week ? ""

"" And what could possibly motivate you to do something like that ? ""

"" You want me to wear your new clothes ! ""

"" Oh , no, I don ’ t want you to wear my new clothes . I just thought it would be funny if we had the same wardrobe for a week or so. ""

"" Well, alright then – what do you say ? ""

"" I guess that sounds kind of fun . What shall we bet on ? ""

"" Oh come on , it ’ s just a little game ! ""

"" OK , if that’s how you want to play . ""

"" It is just a little game, but one of the most important things in my life . You don ’ t understand me at all ! ""

"" No ? ""

"" I ’ ve never been so bored or annoyed in my entire life ! ""

"" Well what shall we bet on then ? ""

"" If you lose, you have to wear the clothes of my choosing for a week . ""

"" And if I win, you get to choose what I wear for a whole month ! ""

"" That ’ s not fair ! ""

"" But it ’ s my game . ""

"" OK , deal then . Who gets to pick first ? ""

"" You do. ""

"" Oh , well in that case, how about we both bet on the same team ? ""

"" What do you mean by that ? ""

"" Well we each pick our own favorite team and see who picks the team that wins . If it ’ s a tie, I win the game. ""

"" Oh . I guess that would work . ""

"" So what team are you rooting for ? ""

"" The Buffalo Bills ! ""

"" Well I picked the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and they lost 15-10 . Now it ’ s your turn. You pick first. ""

"" OK , well I don ’ t really know anything about football so I guess we should just flip a coin . ""

"" And what are you doing on New Year ’ S Day ? ""

"" Oh, nothing special . Why do you ask ? ""

"" Well my cousin is coming over and she wants to go for a hike. She says that it ’ s really pretty this time of year in our local park – I think she ’ s lying , but if I tag along it will be nice to have someone to talk to . And since we don ’ t see each other very often, I thought it would make things more interesting for me too. ""

"" Well what about you ? ""

"" I have nothing planned , so maybe I should go with you and your cousin. She sounds like she knows how to have fun ! ""

"" Sure . It ’ ll be great. So shall we meet up in front of the park entrance at 10 AM ? ""

"" That ’ s fine . But what are you doing on New Year ’ S Day anyway ? I thought that was your day off and everyone gets to sleep late or do whatever they want ! ""

"" Well , my plans aren ’ t very exciting . But I figured it would be nice if we went out for breakfast together. That way you can meet all of my family in one sitting instead of making several trips there throughout the year . And then we could maybe see a movie, or go to some other fun place after that ? ""

"" I don ’ t know , but it sounds like a nice idea ! What time do we want for breakfast ? ""

"" Well you can meet me at 9 AM if you would like. Then I guess we should spend the day together. Maybe we can go to this new museum that just opened up in town . ""

"" That does sound pretty cool . But what about after that ? You said something about a movie or another fun place ? ""

"" Well , there is this nice new restaurant where they serve food from all over the world – it ’ s really tasty ! So maybe we could go to dinner at 8 PM . Then, if you still want to come with me after that, I guess we can hang out together for a few hours and then call it a night ? ""

"" I don ’ t know . What time do they close the museum anyway ? And where is this restaurant located ? ""

"" Well , we can check it out once you get there. As far as the closing time of the museum, I think it closes at 9 PM on weekends and at 6 PM during the week, but maybe we could just go earlier . If you really want to see the place then that ’ s fine with me. And I don ’ t know where exactly this restaurant is located either , but it should be pretty easy to find – there are plenty of signs posted in the area ! ""

"" That sounds like fun, but maybe we could do all of that stuff together tomorrow instead ? ""

"" Well sure . I guess there ’ s no rush. It would just be nice if you were able to make it this year. And besides, now you know where everything is and what time they close, so next year won ’ t be such a surprise ! ""

"" Oh , I see. You want me to come to your New Year ’ S party ? ""

"" Well yeah . I guess that makes sense too – it wouldn ’ t really feel like a party if no one shows up! So anyway, you can meet me at 10 AM tomorrow morning. It should be fun ! ""

"" Alright . But what time will this all end ? ""

"" Well , it depends on how long we stay there or go somewhere else afterwards – but I guess around midnight would probably be the cutoff point for our party, unless you want to come back early from wherever we end up going after that ! And then we could have a few drinks and count down together . ""

"" Yeah , that sounds nice. Maybe next year we can even make it a whole weekend away somewhere . ""

"" Oh , I don ’ t know . That sounds pretty expensive for me right now, but maybe you could just come with me to some of my friends ’ parties instead ? You ’ ll have fun there too ! ""

"" Yeah , that sounds good. And if we go to more than one party together then it won ’ t cost as much money! ""

"" I guess so . But what time should we meet again tomorrow morning for the first part of our day? I don ’ t want you to be late or anything ! ""

"" Well , we can start at 10 AM like last time . Is that OK with you ? ""

"" Yeah , sure it is. See you then ! ""

"" OK , see you soon too ! """

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,102,llama-2-7b@q8_0_102.txt,""" Yes , you can , and it' s going to make all the difference in the world to your health . It's what they call stress relief . ""

"" Stress relief ? What on earth do you mean by that ? ""

The doctor is silent for a few seconds before replying.

"" Well , I know this sounds pretty strange and probably even difficult, but it can work wonders if you'll only try it . It's all to do with releasing the tension in your body-and the best way that I ' ve ever found is through exercising . ""

"" Exercising ? That sounds pretty easy , but what exactly are you referring to ? ""

The doctor pulls a small pamphlet out of his briefcase and hands it over.

"" Well , I've written down some of the things that we talked about last night . Now, this is the most important one-it concerns your breathing . You've probably never been taught how to breathe properly . ""

The doctor then explains that by taking long, slow, deep breaths, you can begin to reduce the amount of tension in your body. It helps with relaxation , and once you get into the habit of doing it, it will become easier as time goes on-especially if you do it regularly . You'll find that after only a few days, you'll notice a marked improvement in yourself , and all because of some simple breathing exercises .

"" What other exercises ? ""

The doctor explains that you don't necessarily need to go to the gym-you can get the same results just by doing things around your house. He then gives a few examples: cleaning the house; washing the car; mowing the lawn etc . By taking on these tasks, and by making sure that they are done in a relaxed manner , you'll be able to build up the strength in your muscles as well as reducing some of your stress.

"" How does this help my blood pressure ? ""

The doctor explains that when we do things at high speed, our bodies often respond with tension . We get into a kind of rhythm where everything is done quickly and without thinking , which increases the chances of mistakes happening -and of course it's no good for our health either. So by taking on these tasks slowly, and gradually increasing the amount of time that you take to complete them-you'll find that your body will respond differently . It'll be able to relax more easily , which means less chance of getting overtired or having a heart attack .

"" Heart attack ? Are there any other side effects ? ""

The doctor replies: ""Well , I don't think so-but you might notice that it can take longer for things to get done. It may sound like a silly question, but why is this? Because your body is now relaxed and can focus on what needs doing rather than worrying about how long it takes .

"" So basically , what I'm saying is that we have all these stresses in our lives -from work to family commitments-and sometimes they get so overwhelming that we just want them to go away . But the only way to do this is by taking on some of our daily tasks slowly and calmly -as if it was a hobby or something .""

"" That sounds good , but how do I start ? ""

The doctor says: ""Well , I think that's up to you. All I can say is that it might take you a few weeks before you notice any difference, but after that -who knows ! Maybe even some of those other things you ' ve been worrying about will start to disappear too .""

"" Sorry, ma'am , but there isn't any food here except cereal, orange juice, a few bananas and some apple sauce . We don't have anything at all to cook with either . ""

"" Well , what am I going to do ? My husband is out of town on business for two weeks. If you can't feed me breakfast in my room, where else would you suggest I go?""

"" Uh ... well... ""

"" Do you think I might go downtown and find something at one of the restaurants there? It will cost more than a hotel breakfast, but if there's nothing here, I can't stay in my room all day. ""

"" No ma'am . Not today . There are no restaurants open this early . The only other place is McDonald's , and that won't be open for another couple of hours . ""

"" Well ... what am I supposed to do ? Just sit here until 10 o'clock or so, then go downstairs and eat in the dining room? That doesn't seem reasonable. I should have some options , don't you think ? ""

"" Yes ma'am . We're very sorry for this inconvenience. There is one more alternative : You could always go back to bed . ""

"" Very well . ""

"" By the way , I'm in 109 . Would you kindly send up some bacon with my order ? ""

"" Certainly , madam. Thank you for calling. Good-bye . ""

"" Thank you . Good-bye . ""

"" Now that is good service ! ""

"" And the most interesting thing about it is that I don't have to speak English . ""

"" Not at all ? ""

"" No ; the maid and the waiter both understood my French . ""

"" Ah , yes . How did you learn them so quickly ? ""

"" Oh ! That was very simple. You see, when I first arrived here in Paris yesterday morning , I found that I had forgotten to bring some money with me . So I went out and bought a pocket dictionary of English words . And then I went into the hotel lobby and asked the maid for my room number. She said it was 109 . ""

"" Well ! How did you know what she was saying ? You don't speak any English at all ! ""

"" Oh , that wasn't very difficult . All I had to do was look up 'tennis racket' in the dictionary . That told me it was number ten . And then I just added nine and found out that 109 meant room 109 . ""

"" How simple ! But how did you know what she meant by saying, 'Room service,' when you didn't speak English ? ""

"" Well , as a matter of fact, I don't remember exactly what she said in French . But from the way she spoke to me and from my knowledge of that language, I knew what it meant . ""

"" And how did you know what 'good-bye' was in French ? ""

"" Well , when I wanted to go back to the room this morning , I asked her if the room service still had anything for me. She said yes ; and as she spoke, I noticed that there was something different about her voice . It seemed somehow friendlier than before . And then she used some French words I'd learned in school when I studied my language books back home in America . ""

"" Oh , I see ! Good-bye is the same in every country. When you want to say good-bye, you always use the same word . ""

"" That's right . And that's how I found out what it was . So I said, 'Good-bye' to her and she said 'Good-bye' back to me . ""

"" It was very simple . But now we come to our next question. How did you know your waiter would understand French if he didn't speak a word of that language ? ""

"" Well , it was rather difficult there, because I couldn't see how I could have found out what he meant when he said something like 'breakfast ready.' But then the situation reminded me of something else . One night back home in America, my wife and I were watching a television program about France. And they showed some people eating at breakfast. The waiter came to their table with a tray , and they began to talk. Afterwards, they explained that what he said was this : 'Good morning.' What the waiter actually said in French was 'Bonjour.' ""

"" Really ? That's very interesting . But how did you know it meant breakfast ready when you didn't speak any French yourself ? ""

"" I didn't , exactly . It just came to me somehow. And then I remembered that the words 'breakfast' in English and French are pronounced almost exactly the same. So I knew what he was trying to tell me . And then after breakfast, we went for a walk together. He asked if there was anything else I needed. I told him no , but I would like some bacon . He understood that part very well because of the dictionary I bought . ""

"" Good ! Now let's see how you learned French so quickly . How many words did you have in your pocket dictionary ? ""

"" About three hundred , I think . ""

"" Well, that isn't enough for a person to learn English as well as French . Besides, it would take too long to look up every word he heard . So how did you manage to understand what they were saying? ""

"" Oh ! That was very easy. All I had to do was listen carefully and use my common sense . You see , people don't talk in foreign languages the way they talk at home. They usually say one thing and mean another. For example, when you come into a restaurant, your waiter doesn't really ask you if you want something to eat. He asks whether or not you like something to eat ! So I just listened carefully and understood that 'room service' was something he did for me in the room . And then , whenever anyone spoke English at all, I knew it would be a good idea to ask him what they said . ""

"" Very good ! But I must say that this is the most amazing thing I have ever heard. You must be a very gifted man! ""

"" Oh ! Not at all ! It's no problem for me. After all, if you are going to speak a foreign language , it helps to know something about its people and their customs . And that is what we Americans do in our country when we come into contact with other cultures around the world. ""

"" Well ? Is there anything else I can tell my French friends? They might be very interested if they knew all this. ""

"" Oh ! There is just one thing left to say . And it's really quite simple. You see , when you are going to speak a foreign language, the first thing that you should do is study its alphabet carefully. But if you can't do that , you might try memorizing all of your vocabulary at once instead of learning one word at a time . ""

"" And what is it you want me to do ? ""

"" Well , I thought this morning when you came in that you should begin by studying the words for 'tennis racket,' 'ball,' and 'paddle.' Then you could learn more easily after that ! ""

"" But where can I find such a book ? ""

"" There is no need to go looking any further. Just take out your English-French dictionary . Look at the beginning of each word in French and you will find it's English equivalent right there underneath it . You see, it's very simple ! ""

"" Well , I guess that explains why I don't understand much French when I hear other people talk. But if this is true, then I must say it would make things easier for me here in Paris! """

He has gone so far that he is almost sure to get away from them this time , for he knows every hole in the ground, every hiding place about the mountains. The police never had a chance with him before . ""

"" I am going as fast as I can walk . "" said the old man. He hurried on , and presently turned a corner that led to his house. There were three or four of the cops in front waiting for him , and he began to tremble as he saw them. They seized him at once, and dragged him away to jail ; but they let him take with him this bundle which was tied up in a piece of red flannel :

"" Let me have that bundle . "" said the old man . "" There is something inside it that will make you all happy when I tell you what it is. ""

So they took it from him and carried it away, but did not open it ; and as soon as he was locked up in a room by himself , where there were four big policemen who would see that nobody should disturb or bother him, John Smith got out of bed and sat down by the window. The moon had come up then , and shone upon the great mountain which loomed over the town like a huge black wall. He felt tired, and sad, but happy too ; for he was sure now that he was going to get away from them this time .

"" What is it ? "" asked one of the policemen who was standing by him .

"" This bundle . "" said John Smith. "" It contains a pair of trousers , a shirt, a jacket and a hat ; all made of red flannel. The man whom you have put in jail has been so poor that he has never had any new clothes before in his life , and now I am going to give him these which will be enough for a year or two , I guess . ""

So John Smith was sent away with the policemen who were taking care of him, but they did not know where they were sending him. They kept him locked up in different places every night , so that he would have no chance to escape ; and at last when his trousers began to wear out, he bought a new pair.

"" I want you all to be very careful of this red flannel bundle now , "" said John Smith one day . "" It contains the clothes which I am going to give my wife as soon as I get away from here and back home again , so it is worth more than anything that you have got in your possession. I would rather have a hundred thousand dollars than these trousers, but if they are not safe , neither I nor any other man can be happy. ""

When John Smith was released at last he took his bundle with him and hid it on the mountain ; but one day when he was gone his wife discovered it there and opened it up to see what was inside of it . There were those new clothes that had been made for her husband by an old man who could not afford to buy them.

"" I am going back to see John Smith , "" said the old woman ; so she ran down into town and met him on a street corner where he stood talking with some other men. She took hold of his hand then, and told him how much she loved him. He could not say anything at first; but as soon as he saw her face all covered with tears and heard what she said , he burst out crying too .

"" You must be careful now , "" said John Smith to the man who was holding on to his hand , while they stood together looking up at the moon which had come up again. "" This red flannel bundle is worth more than anything you can buy in any store or anywhere else in the world. I have told my wife where it is hidden and if she should find out that I am here with you then I would rather die than to go back home . So, if we are going to be happy always together after this , don't let her know what you have got there . ""

"" All right . "" answered the man. He did not want John Smith to leave him at any price .

The next morning when they parted again , John Smith went away with his bundle hidden under some leaves in a tree where nobody could see it ; but after he had walked along for several miles without stopping, the other man caught up with him and began running by his side. He was carrying an empty sack which he intended to fill with straw when they got there , so that no one would be able to tell what he had found under those leaves .

"" I will put it in your hand now , "" said John Smith as soon as the other man had reached him .

Then together they began running along the mountain road until they came to a small house that stood alone in front of them. It was dark inside when they knocked upon the door, but presently there appeared at one side of it an old woman who peeped out to see what was happening; and then she opened up without any fear or hesitation.

"" Good evening , "" said John Smith . "" This is my wife . "" And he held out his hand to her as if he had been a stranger who had met her for the first time ."

### 8.Do you prefer pop or electronic music?

""I like both! But if I had to choose one, it would be pop!""

""Why is that?""

""Well, there are more singers and bands in the world of pop music than in the world of electronic music.""

""And why do you like them so much?""

""Because they have good voices and their songs make me feel happy!""

### 9.Do you listen to classical music?

""Yes, I do. My favorite type is jazz because it's very relaxing for me.""

""But what kind of music do you like better?""

""I think it depends on the mood I have at that moment.""

""What's your best day to listen to classical music?""

""When I want to relax after a hard day. That's when my favorite songs help me get rid of stress and enjoy life more!""

### 10.Do you like Mozart?

""He is one of the greatest composers ever! His music has a very special sound.""

""Why do you think he's so famous?""

""Because he wrote amazing melodies and harmonies in his operas and symphonies!""

""How about Beethoven?""

""He is also great but not as good as Mozart. He didn't write any opera or symphony.""

""So what did he do instead?""

""Well, he composed a lot of concertos for piano and other instruments like violin or flute!""

""I didn ' t know what was going on . You asked me to play something for you and you played Beethoven . ""

"" Well, my mother plays the piano and I used to go with her.I started listening when I was about 8 years old.""

""Well , that's great ! ""

"" Thank you . ""

""Hey , Blake . Are you still listening to Mozart ? ""

"" Yes. Do you like it ? ""

"" It's great . and I 've heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent . ""

"" Really ? I haven ' t heard that before . I just like it . ""

""Is classical music your favorite ? ""

"" Yes . What about you ? ""

""I Like pop music best. Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .""

""Pop music doesn ' t have any depth for me.""

""Yeah , that's why I can enjoy myself in it.""

"" Did you always like pop music ? ""

""I think so , since I was in primary school . How long have you been interested in classical music ? ""

""I didn ' t know what was going on. You asked me to play something for you and you played Beethoven.""

""Well, my mother plays the piano and I used to go with her. I started listening when I was about 8 years old.""

"" No , not really . But I enjoy listening to it very much . ""

"" So do I . I think if one enjoys classical music as much as I do. he/she is a bit of a snob . ""

"" I don't think so . The way I see it, classical music is not something only for the educated people , like what they say in the movies . It has more to do with personal taste . ""

"" Well , we are getting off track here . Why don't we talk about you ? What did you do today ? ""

"" Nothing special . I did a few exercises and went for a walk in the park . That was very relaxing . """
llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,114,llama-2-7b@q8_0_114.txt,""" George ! What about the kids ? They can ’ t sleep in your van . It is not comfortable . ""

"" Come on Lili, relax. We don ’ t have to travel all the time. We can stay at a hotel for one night , when we want to spend some time in an amusement park or something like that. The rest of the time we will be sleeping in the van . ""

"" Well , George . You are right ! I ’ ll go with you this time . I hope my friend is not going anywhere on vacation during this week . We can travel for a couple of weeks . ""

Their friend had just bought an RV and he said he was planning to go away in the mountains, near the coast. He would stay there for a few months to be close to his daughter who lives in that area . The time he spent with his family made him happy . He wanted to spend some more time with them before returning to his business life , which made him unhappy .

He said his friends could use his RV if they wanted to . They were welcome to travel the country as long as it didn ’ t interfere with their work. "" Come on , I know you will enjoy this ! ""

Lili and George spent two weeks in California . It was a very hot time of the year, but they enjoyed being together while seeing new things around them. Their friend ’ s RV worked like magic. They visited places they had never seen before, like Disneyland , Yosemite National Park and Hollywood Boulevard.

When they returned to their home in Los Angeles, they both felt tired from traveling and happy about all the memories they had shared together as a family .

### 4.3.2 Actions that require ""permission""

Some verbs need an object after them. This is because the verb requires some action on your part to be carried out . Examples of such verbs are ""give"" , ""tell"", and ""ask"". In these situations, the pronoun _you_ can also appear as a subject in place of the direct object that follows the verb.

The word ""permission"" means giving someone permission to do something or allowing them to have something . It is used when someone asks for permission from another person , company, organization etc.. 

If we want to ask for permission then we need to use a question mark at the end of our sentence . Example : _ Do I have your permission to take off now ?_ ( _Can I leave?_ )

When you say ""I would like to know if ..."" , it means that there is no problem with doing whatever action was just stated, but one needs confirmation or authorization from someone before actually doing the thing . Example : 

_""Do you mind if I use your bathroom?"" _(""I want to ask if I can go in there."")

""It would be great if we could stay at a hotel while we visit New York."" ( _We would love to stay somewhere comfortable during our trip._ )

""I really hope my boss does not mind us working overtime this weekend so that we finish the project on time ! "" ( _I want him to approve of this extra work_ .)

""Please excuse me while I ask if you can tell me which door leads out onto the patio ? "" ( _Please don't mind my asking this question._ )

""Do you have permission for us all to go out tonight after our shift ends at 9 pm , sir ? "" (""I want to know if we are allowed to leave early."")

"" Yeah ... I guess so. OK ! It sounds good . I accept your plan . But don ’ t forget to bring some bed sheets and pillows ! ""

"" Of course 14 . So , tomorrow morning you will pack some stuff for the trip . Right ? ""

"" Yes . Bye . See you soon 13 . ""

"" You too. Bye . ""

"" George , there aren ’ t any restaurants in the state that serve good Chinese food . ""

"" But one or two 10 Chinese restaurants are pretty good ! ""

"" Maybe some of them . But still not enough to satisfy all your cravings . ""

"" Oh , I think we should try anyway . Besides, when do you have time to eat out ? ""

"" Well , that ’ s true . I only go out with friends from work once in a while . ""

"" So what are we waiting for ? Let ’ s start ! We will take the van and leave right after work tomorrow . ""

"" Ok . ""

"" You better get some sleep now. We have an early start tomorrow morning . See you at 7:00AM . ""

[ 21.06 ]

"" George , I can ’ t believe how lucky we are ! ""

"" What do you mean ? ""

"" This restaurant has the best Chinese food in the state ! We had a great time last night . But look at this menu . It’s pretty expensive ! I think it is more than 40 dollars for two people with drinks included . ""

"" Oh , it ’ s nothing . I know how to order dishes that cost less money . ""

"" You can ? How come you never told me before ? ""

"" Oh , just now . You didn’t ask . ""

"" Well , why don ’ t we try a different restaurant this time then ? ""

"" I think it ’ s better if we order the same things next time so that we can compare how the taste changes with each dish we ordered last night . ""

"" Ok . ""

[ 21.07 ]

"" How was your trip to Los Angeles ? ""

"" Pretty good . I am glad I came back here for my vacation . ""

"" Yeah . Why didn ’ t you stay there with George and Lili ? ""

"" I don ’ t know . Maybe it will be fun next time . But this was a nice break from the routine of everyday life . We visited museums , parks , restaurants . It wasn ’ t too expensive either . And I got to see a lot of interesting things . ""

[ 21.08 ]

"" Oh , Lili ! How much money do you think we have left ? ""

"" George , I don ’ t know exactly . We can check the bank statement tonight and get back to me later . ""

"" But I really need some new clothes for work . ""

"" You shouldn ’ t have used your vacation days before starting a new job . ""

"" Hey ! Why are you always on my side ? George , I thought you were going to take care of the finances in this family . ""

"" Well , we had some expenses . ""

"" Yeah , like eating out every night after work and drinking at the bar almost every weekend . ""

"" Oh ! I think we can control our spending a little bit better . But you can ’ t stop me from buying new clothes if I want them . Besides, I already bought some of these jeans when I was in LA with George . ""

"" Lili , the price of those clothes is pretty high . You could have bought them in a cheaper place. ""

"" What ! Are you saying that I should go to the thrift stores ? That ’ s not very cool for a professional like me . ""

"" How do you know you are a professional ? Have they paid you yet ? ""

"" No , but we haven ’ t even started working together officially . ""

"" So how can you say you ’ re a professional ? You don ’ t have any experience. I think you should stop buying things that aren ’ t really necessary and start saving money for your future family instead of spending it on clothes and food . ""

"" George , we have been together for 8 years now ! If I can ’ t buy a new dress when I want to, then what is the point of being with you in the first place ? You should just take care of yourself and leave me alone . ""

[ 21.09 ]

"" George , where are we going tonight ? ""

"" Do you remember that Chinese restaurant last night ? I think it was very nice . ""

"" Yeah . But Lili said the food there is expensive . ""

"" It is not as bad as she thinks . Let ’ s go again . ""

"" George , let ’ s eat at a different place this time ! ""

"" Why ? Are you mad at me ? Didn ’ t I take you to a very nice restaurant last night ? You said it was the best Chinese food in the state . ""

"" Oh , we just want to try something new . It would be interesting . ""

"" But it ’ s not necessary . Besides, Lili said that she likes eating at this restaurant . ""

"" Well . Let ’ s go there then . I don ’ t mind . ""

[ 21.10 ]

"" George , is everything ok ? You look a little bit sad tonight . ""

"" Yeah . Just thinking about Lili ’ s comment last night . She said the food in that Chinese restaurant isn ’ t as good as she thought it would be and I didn ’ t know how to order dishes that cost less money . ""

"" Oh ! But it was still good . We could have ordered something more affordable if we wanted to . ""

"" No , it is not good enough for me . I think there must be a restaurant in the area with better food than that one . ""

[ 21.11 ]

"" George , why are you so angry ? Is Lili bothering you again ? ""

"" Oh , no ! Not at all . I have been thinking about how to improve my cooking skills . And today I found a great cooking class in town . It is very cheap too ! I ’ ll register for it tomorrow after work . You should come with me and check it out . ""

"" But I don ’ t think you can learn anything from that class . ""

"" Why not ? Don ’ t you want to be a better cook so we can save money on eating out more often ? ""

"" Oh ! Yes , of course . You can also find some great recipes online or in the library . I have a book with Chinese dishes in it at home that I used when I was living there before . If you want, you can borrow it and check it out tonight . ""

[ 21.12 ]

"" George , how did your cooking class go today ? ""

"" It went well ! The instructor taught us a lot of great recipes . I will bring some home next time so that we can try them together . ""

"" Ok . But why are you looking at me like this right now ? Didn ’ t the chef teach anything worthwhile to you today ? ""

"" Of course he did ! He taught us how to make fried rice and egg rolls . I will show you the recipe when we get home . ""

[ 21.13 ]

"" George , don ’ t worry about it . Just do what you think is right . You should not be bothered by her comments like this all the time . It isn ’ t worth your time . ""

"" But she is my wife and I have to respect her . Besides, when did I say that I would quit working ? I will continue to earn money for our family . And you also need to start a new job so we can live better ! ""

"" Oh ! Don ’ t get upset. You are already doing your best . If anyone needs to change something it is Lili who has been spending too much of her salary on clothes and food all the time . She should stop buying things that she doesn ’ t really need and start saving money instead . ""

[ 21.14 ]

"" George , I think we will not be able to save any money at this point in our relationship . You know what Lili said last night when you went out with her friends from work ? She thinks the food in that restaurant is expensive and that you don ’ t know how to order dishes that cost less money . ""

"" Oh ! I am tired of listening about this subject all day long ! Do you want me to quit my job so we can be more frugal at home ? ""

"" Well , I think it would be a great idea . Then we could use the extra income for something important like paying down our credit card debt or saving money for our future family . ""

[ 21.15 ]

"" George , don ’ t tell me that you want to quit your job because of Lili ’ s comments last night . What are we going to do if you leave the company ? You have been with them for such a long time and they have invested so much in training you ! They will never hire anyone else who knows as much about their business as you do ! ""

"" I know that . But how can she be so rude all the time ? Why does it bother her when I eat out with friends from work every weekend ? She never complained when"

"" No , there are three sons and two daughters . There must be 10 grandchildren altogether . ""

"" Wow , that's quite an age gap between you ! ""

"" Yes , I think the eldest son is about 23 years older than me . I am the second last child. My youngest sister was born when my father had already gone back to work after being on leave for several months . ""

"" Yes . He was born in New Zealand so they haven't seen him yet . They are going to visit us first and then we will all go together . ""

"" Will you be staying in England for a long time ? ""

"" In about 3 weeks time . The flight is leaving on a Sunday afternoon so we will pick them up at the airport . I think my parents are staying for two weeks , maybe three . And then I'll take my brother to a few universities in England and Scotland as well before he goes home again . ""

"" What do you want to do today at the mall ? ""

"" How about we take a break and get some lunch ? ""

"" Maybe I should go get food for us . ""

"" We can walk there together. ""

### 16. You're going on an exciting date with someone special ; what would you say beforehand ?

"" It's been so long ! Are you ready for this wild night out ? ""

"" Would you like to go somewhere romantic or play a fun game together at the arcade? ""

"" How about we get some drinks and dance our hearts away ? ""

"" I have an idea . ""

### 17. You're in love with someone but are feeling awkward ; what would you say to break the ice when it comes to taking things further ?

"" We should do something romantic together sometime soon. ""

"" How about we get coffee and talk more? I know that sounds silly. ""

"" Is there anything you like doing, or somewhere you'd want to go with me? ""

"" What do you think is the best way we could spend time together ? ""

"" Do you want some coffee or something , first ? ""

"" That would be nice . Thanks . ""

"" You know that one place I used to love but don't know if it's still there ? ""

"" It must have closed by now . ""

"" So do you like burgers, hamburgers , hot dogs or fried chicken best ? ""

"" I can never decide which is my favorite ; they are all great ! ""

"" Maybe I'll have some chili for lunch ; it's not too cold to sit outside . ""

"" How about you ? Are you up for a walk after your meal ? ""

"" Sure , but maybe we should get back before dark ? ""

"" I am, if that's okay with you . ""

"" Are you looking for a different type of food now than last time ? ""

"" Let's go to the other side of town ; there are some really good places around here . ""

"" What do you think about sushi tonight? We can make reservations for that if you want. ""

"" I like seafood better than beef , so it should taste great ! ""

"" Let's stop at the convenience store to pick up some snacks . ""

"" I forgot my wallet ; let me run home and get some money . ""

"" Would you want to go for a walk or ride your bike after dinner ? ""

"" Sure , but let me wash off first ; I've been gardening all day ! ""

"" Where would you like to sit for dinner? We can order something different if you wish. ""

"" It doesn't really matter where we go . ""

"" Do you want dessert afterward , or maybe a movie ? ""

"" That sounds good too! ""

"" Can I bring your leftovers home with me? ""

"" Mainly news programs or documentaries . ""

"" I shall eat nothing. ""

""Then what are you waiting for? ""

"" For your love to come here. ""

"" What? Is that so ? Well, since you say you want my love, I will give it to you if you like. ""

"" If I have no money, how can you do anything for me?""

"" Even without money I shall be able to give you the kind of love which only I know how to give, and that is the love a mother gives her child. ""

"" But I am not your child! You are my aunt. ""

"" Oh! my dear niece, you have no idea what I can do for you now. I will take care of all your needs. And you don't know how much better off we shall be once your husband joins us. He has been very ill lately and we are worried about his health. I am sure he must have forgotten you. ""

"" How did you come to know that? ""

"" Well, we are a little family. We all live together as one big happy family. We each look after our own business and then help out with other people's too. You see I make a living by selling my embroidered articles, which is how I was able to buy you this beautiful dress .""

"" So it was you who bought me that dress ? ""

""Yes, it was me. I bought it for you as soon as you got married and then gave it back again. Now do come with me at once! ""

The young wife was still undecided whether to go with her aunt or not when the latter added:

""Oh my dear niece, how can you be so ungrateful? Your husband is dead, that I know. But if he were alive, what would he do without your help and support? You are his only relative and it is your duty to take care of him and provide for his needs.""

The young woman could see the poor man in a bed surrounded by filth. She hesitated no longer but went with her aunt at once. It was really a most depressing sight. There she saw the dead body covered with flies and other insects. The smell of corruption filled the room and made her head swim.

""It's a real disgrace! ""she thought to herself, as if for the first time. She sat down by the side of the bed and looked at him for some time; then she began to cry, as though she had no control over herself. The old woman came up to her and said:
""Oh, my niece, your tears are for naught! Your husband's body is already a corpse! There is nothing we can do now.""

The young wife looked at the dead man with anger in her eyes, then she took hold of his hand and pulled him toward her.

She had come to save his life; so she thought that if she could give him a good blow on the head it might revive him, but it was not possible for a woman to hit anyone at all. She gave up in despair and fell down weeping on her husband's body. The old woman said to herself:
""Why should I help such a bad woman? What will I gain by it?"" She sat down near the fire and began to work at her embroidery with great concentration, as though she had not seen anything. But she was listening carefully to every word which passed between her niece and the dead man. Presently they started talking about the kind of life a wife should lead with her husband, and how it is necessary for each one to be tolerant of his or her spouse. The woman said:
""You see, I am now alone in this world without anyone except my aunt. I have nothing left but my virtue."" Then she burst into tears again and went on like that until the sun had set. When night came down, the old woman lit a lamp and began to embroider her dress. Presently the young wife fell asleep.

But no sooner did the dead man hear his wife's breathing than he opened his eyes. He took hold of her hands and pulled them towards him, then he began to talk to her. She had not understood what she was doing. For a while she continued sleeping peacefully; but soon she woke up with a start, terrified by the ghostly voice which seemed to be speaking from her husband's mouth.
""Oh! what are you doing?"" she thought. ""Who is it who is talking and how did he get back here? It must be my imagination."" And as she said this out loud, he started talking again:

""Don't be afraid! I am your husband! I have come to tell you that we can no longer live together here. You know that the earth has been made for us by God to keep us company and help us live, but now it is useless for us. We are dead and gone! ""

""What do you mean?"" she replied. ""I don't understand what you're talking about.""

""Let me tell you that the earth is like a woman who gives birth to all creatures and brings them up to adulthood, but when they grow old and are no longer useful for her, she kills them. That is why we must die now because our work is finished! ""

The young wife was frightened and tried to get away from him, but he would not let go of her. So she called out to the old woman:
""Auntie! Auntie!"" she cried. ""What are you doing there? Come here at once, I beg you."" The aunt came over at once and began to look for something in one corner and another; but nothing was to be found. She took off her embroidered cloak and spread it out on the floor, so that they could sit down together.

The young wife got up and went over to where her husband was lying and began to talk with him again: ""You see, I'm sorry about what has happened. But do you know how we can be rescued? There is a priest living in the village who is famous for his knowledge of all matters sacred and profane; he is very learned indeed and I am sure that if we went to consult him we could come out of this trouble. ""

""So you think that the world will be saved by a priest ? You must not take me for a fool! It would have been better if you had never come here, because now there's nothing left for us except to go to hell!""

The woman was very distressed and continued to talk to him: ""Why do you say that? Do you want to condemn me too?"" She went on, ""I am sorry for what I have done but it is not my fault. Now help me please to find the priest we were talking about.""

""How can a man like that help us when there are so many people who need his help and he does not have enough time to see them all? ""

""I don't care! We must try at least!"" she replied.

The old woman was listening to their conversation attentively; then she asked:
""Auntie, what is it you are talking about?""

""Do you want to go out for a walk in the countryside with me and see if we can find anyone who will give us a place to stay ? ""asked her niece.

""What? You mean I am going to sit by my husband's side for ever? Never, never! Do you think that I would like to be buried alive?"" she cried out. The young wife could not understand what the old woman was saying; but soon she understood and said: ""Oh well, if you are too scared of staying with your dead husband then you can come along.""

So they went outside into the courtyard where there were so many pots full of water that it seemed as though all the rain which had fallen in the previous days was contained within them. The woman called out to her husband: ""Now listen, my dear! I have just remembered what we were saying about our salvation and how you can help me .""

But the ghostly voice replied: ""No, I cannot help you now!"" And he said to himself : 'If only it had not been for this woman, all would be well. But she is so obstinate that nothing will do but she must have her own way."" Then he added with a smile on his face: ""There! You see what has happened? If we were still alive, then there might be hope for us .""

The young wife was very upset and said to her niece: ""Oh Auntie! How can you be so cruel ? What did I do to deserve this treatment from you?"" Then she added with a sigh :
'Well, that is the way it goes sometimes. If we are not careful about what we say or do, then the consequences may turn out badly for us.'

The old woman was very sad and went back into her room where she lay down on her mattress to have some rest. Then the young wife took hold of her husband's hand and began to talk to him as before. After a while he opened his eyes again and spoke: ""Auntie! Auntie ! I"

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,35,llama-2-7b@q8_0_35.txt,"said the woman, and she went on to ask many questions. The woman became very frightened. She was still standing at the door when the ambulance arrived.
The man was carried in, covered with a blanket. His face was white. He lay on a stretcher beside an unconscious woman who had been hit by another car.
The man said to the ambulance driver: ""Take me home."" The woman watched him and wondered what he meant by that. She thought about it until she fell asleep.
She woke up in the middle of the night. Her husband was not in bed beside her.
When she got out of bed, she saw that all the lights were on and there was a man sitting at the kitchen table reading a newspaper. The woman stared at him for several seconds, then said: ""Where's my husband?""
""Your husband?"" said the stranger. ""He died an hour ago."" He pointed to the covered body in the corner of the living room.
The woman rushed over and took off the blanket. She saw that it was not her husband. It was the man she had seen at the restaurant.
She ran back into the kitchen, screaming: ""Where is he?"" The stranger looked up from his newspaper and said: ""I don't know. He got out of here just before the ambulance came."""

"" A steak ! ""

"" Oh ! Sorry about that . Let me try again , what would you like for a main course ? ""

"" Hmm ... Well I was thinking about having a juicy steak with some mashed potatoes and salad on the side. ""

"" That sounds really good , so are we going to be eating in or taking out ? ""

"" Oh ! Sorry again . Let me try again , are you saying that you want us to eat at your place ? ""

"" Vegan ... I don't eat anything that comes from an animal . ""

"" How

"" I am afraid that there is nothing that we can do. ""

"" Well , you were supposed to take care of this place ! ""

"" That does not make us responsible for everything . ""

"" But , why isn ’ t the landlord responsible ? ""

"" No one told me I had to pay rent for a room that is not even there . ""

"" We never said anything about having you move out now . ""

"" This place isn ’ t very safe anyway. ""

"" This building has been condemned. ""

"" I don ’ t understand what the problem is . ""

"" All right , here is your deposit back . ""

"" How can I do that if you ’ re moving out ? ""

"" The rent is not refundable ""

"" I don ’ t understand why the rent is not refundable. ""

"" Because you ’ re breaking your lease agreement. ""

"" I didn ’ t even break my lease agreement . ""

"" You signed a lease with us for six months and you only lived there for two . ""

"" But I haven ’ t broken the lease ! ""

"" How can I get my deposit back if you won ’ t give it to me ? ""

"" Because you are leaving before your lease is over. ""

"" You have to give it back to me because we signed a contract . ""

"" There was no written contract . ""

"" If there wasn ’ t one, then how do I prove that my deposit should be returned ? ""

"" That ’ s why you need a written lease. ""

"" But you didn ’ t give me a copy ! ""

"" If we don ’ t have an agreement in writing , then who gets to decide what is fair or not ? ""

"" I can ’ t answer that question because you are breaking your lease agreement . ""

"" You aren ’ t answering my question . ""

"" Well, if you don ’ t agree on something and there isn ’ t anything in writing , then the laws of the land decide for you. ""

"" That ’ s not fair ! ""

"" The law doesn ’ t care what is fair or not . ""

"" I think that you are lying to me because there is no way that we would have a problem if I had done something wrong and I thought it was only right that I give the deposit back to you. ""

"" Why do you think this ? ""

"" Because you want your money . ""

"" That ’ s not true ! ""

"" I don ’ t know what else could be going on here . ""

"" Do you really believe that there is some sort of conspiracy to keep my deposit from me ? ""

"" No . But it doesn ’ t seem like you care much about why you didn ’ t get your deposit back or what has happened during the last 10 years. ""

"" If I could give you a million dollars, would you be willing to help me keep my deposit and avoid further legal action ? ""

"" You have already asked for this before . ""

"" How much money do you want ? ""

"" At least $500,000. ""

"" I don ’ t have that much money . ""

"" Okay then, how about a new car ? ""

"" I would never sell my car to you. ""

"" You must be a really good lawyer if you can do something like that . ""

"" We all think that we are the best at what we do . ""

"" Do you want me to tell you what happened or don ’ t you care ? ""

"" I want to know everything. ""

"" You were in my apartment and didn ’ t take anything. ""

"" What about your dog ? He was really nice . ""

"" Well, he had to go outside because it got cold. ""

"" But you left him outside all night when I was sleeping ! ""

"" That wasn ’ t very nice of me. ""

"" You were gone for 8 hours and he was stuck in the cold . ""

"" Why don ’ t you ask your landlord about that ? He has the record on how much money is owed to him for rent from when you lived there. ""

"" I was going to talk with my lawyer before talking with yours because we both think that this conversation could go in a direction that neither of us want. ""

"" Maybe we can work things out . ""

"" We won ’ t be able to work anything out unless one or both of us agrees to give up our positions and start fresh. ""

"" I don ’ t know how much you would like me to tell you about your former roommate, but he was a bad person and I will not say any more than that. ""

"" You were his girlfriend for almost 2 years ! ""

"" He asked me not to say anything so I won ’ t. ""

"" Okay then . Let me tell you what happened at my apartment last night when you came to pick up your stuff. ""

"" So, now that we are finished with this conversation , do you want to work something out ? ""

"" You could still help us by telling me how much money is owed from the time I lived there until today and then you will get half of it . ""

"" Do you know where my landlord lives ? ""

"" He has an office downtown. ""

"" If you would give me his name, address and phone number , maybe he could help us find a solution to this problem so we can all move on. ""

"" You need to work out the problems with your landlord because I am not getting involved in this anymore . ""

"" I don ’ t want to talk about it any more either. Let ’ s just say that you were lucky enough to have someone as nice as me helping you get a new car, new clothes and food for 10 years and then leave me alone so we can both move on with our lives . ""

"" If I didn ’ t care about getting my deposit back , then maybe you wouldn ’ t be able to drive your car or eat any more food. ""

"" You are right, that is exactly how this situation works. It ’ s a very bad deal for both of us but there isn ’ t anything we can do except hope that it will work itself out in the end . ""

"" You’re not giving us any time ""

"" There isn ’ t a lot of time left on your lease . ""

"" Why aren ’ t you helping me ? ""

"" We can ’ t help you with that right now . ""

"" But I need to find somewhere else to live . ""

"" You have plenty of time ""

"" If I don ’ t pay rent now I am going to be out on the street ! ""

"" You’re not being evicted if you leave before your lease is up . ""

"" How long do I have to stay ? ""

"" Your lease says 6 months . ""

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,238,llama-2-7b@q8_0_238.txt,""" I carry all kinds of products but the one I like best is from Paul Mitchell called Awapuhi Wild Ginger Shampoo and Conditioner. They are really good for controlling curls. It's $38 a bottle at Sally Beauty Supply . You can get it cheaper if you buy online . ""

"" That's perfect . I'm going to take a picture of the label so that I know what to ask for next time . Do you want me to start washing your hair ? ""

"" Sure go ahead . ""

Jane begins to pour water into the basin and runs it over the top of her head. She washes her hair for five minutes. When she is done rinsing her hair, she hands the bowl to Lisa.

Lisa takes it from Jane and empties the remaining water out of it. Then she puts on a plastic apron that Jane bought for her. ""Are you going to do anything with my hair ? ""

"" Not yet . I need to put some warm water in this bowl and mix up your products before we can start. How long did you leave the conditioner on when you washed it last time ? ""

"" About three minutes . ""

"" Okay, that's fine. I don't want you to use much product today because I need to put a perm in it and the perm will make your hair feel thicker. Are you ready to start now ? ""

"" Yes ! ""

Lisa adds warm water to the bowl of shampoo that she used on Jane's head . Then she puts her hands under the faucet so they are covered in water. Next, Lisa mixes up the shampoo and the conditioner until it is a thin foamy lather. She dips her hands into the bowl of lathered shampoo and then rubs it onto Jane's scalp.
""Do you want me to comb your hair ? "" asks Lisa. ""It would help if I could put some product on it.""

""Yes please . Go ahead . ""

Lisa goes back under the faucet and washes her hands again. Then she combs Jane's hair with a large plastic wide-toothed comb that Jane bought for her at Sally Beauty Supply . When Lisa is done, she takes a bottle of Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Shampoo from the shelf above the sink and pours some onto her hands. She rubs it between her fingers to get a thick lather.
""How do you want your hair ? "" asks Lisa. ""I can either straighten or curl it.""

""Do whatever you think looks best . ""

Lisa begins to apply the shampoo on the top and sides of Jane's head. She combs her fingers through Jane's hair, spreading the shampoo evenly across all areas of her scalp. Next, Lisa takes the wide-toothed plastic comb out from underneath the sink and uses it to smooth down Jane's hairline . When she is done with that, she goes back under the faucet and washes her hands again before combing through Jane's hair once more.
""It looks good so far , "" says Lisa as she takes a look at herself in the mirror. ""You want me to continue ? ""

"" Yes . Go ahead . ""

Jane grabs hold of both sides of the chair and begins to lean back into it until her head is almost completely upside down. Then, Jane looks up at Lisa with wide eyes as she sees what's happening in the mirror behind her. It seems like an eternity before Lisa finally finishes combing through her hair again.
""You want me to wash my hands again ? "" asks Lisa, who has been holding onto a large plastic cup underneath the faucet all this time.
""Yes please . I'm ready for the next step now.""
Lisa rinses her hands under the water and then takes another bottle of shampoo out from underneath the sink . When Lisa has finished applying it, she holds Jane's head in place with one hand while using a small plastic brush with the other. The next step is to apply Paul Mitchell Awapuhi Wild Ginger Conditioner to every part of her scalp where there was shampoo earlier on.
""I can feel it working already ! "" exclaims Lisa, who has been waiting for this moment since they first met at Starbucks last weekend . ""I want you to keep still while I comb your hair again."" After that, she begins to smooth down Jane's bangs and then takes hold of a wide-toothed plastic comb from underneath the sink. She goes over every inch of Jane's scalp with it until all traces of product are gone .
""How do you want your hair ? "" asks Lisa, who has been holding onto one end of the chair while leaning against the other for support throughout this whole process.
""You decide ! I trust you , "" says Jane.

Lisa looks over at herself in a mirror behind her before answering . Then she takes hold of Jane's hair with one hand and uses another wide-toothed plastic comb to smooth down every part of it. When Lisa is done, she takes out a large bottle from underneath the sink and begins to apply shampoo onto her hands again. She rubs both hands together until they are completely covered in foamy lather before using them on Jane's head one more time .
""Are you ready ? "" asks Lisa as she puts down her combs and grabs hold of a large plastic bowl underneath the sink with one hand .
""Yes ! I'm ready , "" says Jane, who is already leaning back into her chair. Then, Lisa begins to work on the top half of Jane's hair while holding it in place with one hand. She uses her fingers and thumbs to spread out any remaining product before taking a wide-toothed plastic comb out from underneath the sink . When she has finished doing that, she goes back under the faucet once more so that she can rinse off her hands again. Then, Lisa begins working on Jane's hairline with one hand while holding onto the bowl of water in another.
""Are you ready to go straight now ? "" asks Lisa .

Jane nods and leans back into her chair even more as Lisa begins to work on every part of her scalp where there was product earlier on . Finally, after about twenty minutes worth of work , Jane has a perfect hairstyle ! It's the same one she had last time except for the fact that it is straight now instead of curly .
""How do you like it ? "" asks Lisa.

""I love it ! It looks really good."" Then, both women smile at each other while looking into a mirror behind Jane.

Comment: What is the first phrase, before ***Do you have any...***? And does it start with ***Do***, or *Do you have*?

Comment: @Lambie Do.

Answer: The dialogue in bold shows that there's a \strong{cut and blow-dry} salon involved (though I'm not sure what the speaker means by 'curly' hair).  In addition, the woman is clearly having her hair cut at some point during or after the appointment.

You could say ""Do you have any product that controls frizz?"", but this would be an odd question to ask someone who has just had a haircut and blow-dry.  A more likely question for the context in bold is ""Do you have any conditioner/shampoo?"" which is a way of asking if she would like some product from the salon's shelves.

Answer: The only sentence that makes sense to me is this:
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{""Do you have any products that control frizz ?""}
\end{itemize}

This is a common phrase in beauty parlours and hair salons, meaning 'do you want some conditioner or shampoo?'

You could replace it with:
\begin{itemize}
\item \em{""Do you have any products I can buy here?""}
\end{itemize}"
llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,204,llama-2-7b@q8_0_204.txt,""" My first boss was very busy , but he never took his eye off the ball when it came to the team. I felt that if he had been a little more hands-on and interested in the day-to-day issues, we would have been more successful . ""

"" How do you manage your time ? ""

"" I think my most useful attribute is being able to prioritize projects effectively. I know what needs to be done first , then work on it . ""

"" Do you have any goals for this job ? ""

"" Yes, I am looking forward to learning new skills and working in a fast-paced environment .""

"" I would take the time to sit down with my team leader, review the project proposal ,and then come up with a game-plan on how best we can achieve the objectives. I would break up the project into smaller phases, assign responsibilities , and develop a schedule that works for each of us . ""

"" Tell me about an experience where you were able to work as a team ? ""

"" I was working as a Team Leader on a very important project to launch a new website in time for our holiday sales. In the early stages , some members of my team did not get along well.It became clear that we needed to find ways to build trust and respect . I held a meeting with everyone, had them explain how they thought the site should be designed .We then divided into smaller groups to work on a specific phase of the project. At each stage we reviewed progress , gave feedback and praise when it was due . This allowed us to focus on completing the project and not personal issues . ""

"" Tell me about a time you disagreed with your boss ? ""

"" I have never had any conflict with my supervisors or managers, they are all very supportive of me and my career.I respect them highly and always do my best to communicate directly if we ever find ourselves having different opinions . It is important in business that people learn how to be direct without hurting feelings, I have been able to accomplish this effectively over the years. ""

"" Describe your management style ? ""

"" I am a very hands-on manager and believe that good leaders are the ones who set clear goals , empower their team members,and lead by example . As a manager it is my responsibility to let employees know where they stand on the company ladder, as well as how important their role is in reaching our business objectives.I like to be available to my team at any time and encourage open dialogue in order to build strong relationships among us. ""

"" Describe your work style ? ""

"" My personal philosophy on work life balance has always been the same, I think you need to be organized, have a routine ,and use your free time wisely . My biggest challenge is making sure that when I am not working I can still keep in touch with what is going on at work and my team members.I also find it very important to make time for myself, because if I don't I will burn out fast. ""

"" What type of person do you get along best with ? ""

"" I enjoy working with people who are direct , motivated,have a good sense of humor and are honest . I have always found that these types of people are very easy to communicate with because they take time to listen and then give clear feedback. ""

"" What kind of manager do you like ? ""

"" The type of managers I work well for are those who are fair , willing to listen,and supportive . ""

"" How do you deal with a difficult employee or subordinate? ""

"" First and foremost I try my hardest to have regular check-in meetings to see how things are going.I believe that if issues arise, it is better to discuss them sooner rather than later because most problems get worse over time . If this doesn't work , then I would sit down with the employee one on one and talk about where there may be some miscommunication or misunderstanding of job expectations . Sometimes what we say isn't always how others understand it. ""

"" Tell me about a time you were angry at your boss ? ""

"" I have never had a situation where I was mad at my supervisor, but if it did happen I would go to him or her and let them know what the issue is and ask for their input . If we can not resolve it then I would go above his head and get some help from HR. ""

"" Do you enjoy working as a team ? ""

"" Yes, I do believe that people work better together than on their own. It's important to have a group of individuals with different personalities , experiences and skill sets so that when there are issues we can rely on each other for support . ""

"" Tell me about your most difficult project? ""

"" As I mentioned earlier, it was my first job after college and everything seemed like an uphill battle at the time.I think one of the biggest challenges for me was getting used to working in a corporate environment with all sorts of different personalities . Another issue that I had trouble adjusting to was not having a set schedule because we were always dealing with last minute meetings or emergencies from our clients . It took some time , but eventually these things became normal parts of my new role. ""

"" What would you do if you disagreed with your boss ? ""

"" I have never had a situation where I was mad at my supervisor, but if it did happen I would go to him or her and let them know what the issue is and ask for their input . If we can not resolve it then I would go above his head and get some help from HR. ""

"" Give me an example of a difficult employee you had to deal with ? ""

"" As a manager, my job is not to be friends with everyone on the team but rather someone who is fair , motivating ,and respectful . I have always found that when this type of relationship exists then it is easy for people to communicate freely about any issues they may be having. I think one thing we need to keep in mind though is that we don't want employees feeling like their job security depends on how close they are with us. ""

"" Tell me about a time you were angry at your boss ? ""

"" As I mentioned earlier, it was my first job after college and everything seemed like an uphill battle at the time.I think one of the biggest challenges for me was getting used to working in a corporate environment with all sorts of different personalities . Another issue that I had trouble adjusting to was not having a set schedule because we were always dealing with last minute meetings or emergencies from our clients . It took some time , but eventually these things became normal parts of my new role. ""

"" How do you handle your work-life balance? ""

"" I have learned over the years that it is impossible to completely separate my personal and professional life because they are both intertwined together in many ways . For example, if I am not able to find time for myself then eventually I will burn out fast . Similarly , when things go wrong at work it can affect me personally as well. So what we need to do instead is set boundaries between them so that they don't mix too much and try our best to make sure that both aspects of our lives are taken care off equally . ""

"" When I was at XYZ Company , we were experiencing a crisis in our financial operations.A team of us worked 18 hour days for two weeks straight to meet the deadline, and we all had to do this on the weekend as well because one department's work wasn't complete.I think I was able to handle it because I have never been afraid to ask questions when I need more information or clarification . ""

"" What skills would you bring to our team ? ""

"" My skills are directly applicable in the way that you do business at Company ABC and I feel that my experience working with ABC would be a huge asset to your team . ""

"" Why should we choose you over other applicants for this position ? ""

"" The fact is , every company needs people who can handle stress.I have proven myself in very stressful situations in the past, and I'm ready to do it again at XYZ Company . ""

"" Describe a time when your work was criticized by someone else . ""

"" I was working with a team of seven people , and we had been tasked with delivering an important project.One of my colleagues didn't feel that I'd been giving the right feedback on his progress so he went to our boss and complained about me.After a meeting between all the parties involved, my manager suggested that I go back and sit down with my co-worker to discuss the issue.I did , and we were able to resolve things . ""

"" What is your greatest weakness ? ""

"" I feel that one of my weaknesses in the past was not being a very good team player.But I've realized that if you are not willing to work together, there will be no progress or results.So now , it ' s something that I take great pride in and it shows because I have become known as a very supportive team player . ""

"" How do you feel about working nights/weekends? ""

"" I am open to it . When the time comes that I need to work overtime or on weekends, my family knows to expect it.I always make sure that they understand and that we have talked about how this will affect things in our lives , because I feel that's very important . ""

"" What do you expect your salary to be ? ""

"" When interviewing for a position like this one, my focus isn ' t so much on the amount of money I'll receive but rather the value that I bring to the organization.I believe that if we both decide that working with each other is beneficial , then any financial arrangements will be negotiated and determined based upon our mutual benefit . ""

"" Are you willing to travel ? ""

"" My answer is yes ! If that's something that your company does , then I feel like it would be very important for me to go along with what your organization requires in order for me to succeed at my job . ""

"" What are the two most significant events of recent history? How did they impact you? Why?""

"" There have been a number of recent historic events that have occurred, and I'll tell you about two that I find the most interesting.First is Hurricane Katrina . This is one of the things that made me realize how much I love my home in Texas , because when people started to lose their lives and their homes, many left town without knowing what was going on around them or where they were headed next . The second event is 9/11 . This changed America forever and we all have learned some important lessons since that day happened . ""

"" What does being successful mean to you? How will you measure your success?""

"" Being successful means achieving goals that I've set for myself.In my opinion, the most important thing is setting these goals so I know what direction to go in order achieve them and how much time it may take me . ""

"" Why did you leave your last job? What happened there?""

"" I was let go from my last position because they wanted someone with more experience.I was willing to stay longer if that would have been helpful , but unfortunately , this wasn't the case . ""

"" If we called your references, what do you think they would say about you? ""

"" I believe that any person who is contacted for reference will say good things because I have always tried to be a professional employee at every job I held in the past . ""

"" Describe one of your goals and how you plan to achieve it. ""

"" One of my personal goals was recently to lose twenty pounds, which meant that I had to eat healthier and exercise more often than before.I started going jogging three times a week , making sure that all the food I ate contained less fat or sugar, while also watching how much I drank during meals . Within a few weeks , my clothes were fitting better and people at work could tell that something was different about me , so now it ' s become easier for me to stay on track with what I've learned about eating right . ""

"" How do you react when you make an error? What have you done in the past when faced with this situation?""

"" Whenever I make a mistake, my first reaction is always to admit it and then take corrective action immediately.I don't like being late for work , so if there are times where I am running behind schedule on certain days of the week or month , I try to find out why and fix whatever caused this problem before it happens again .""

"" Do you consider yourself a leader?""

"" Yes! I have been called upon by my family members or friends to take charge when they needed help.I feel like being able to step up into leadership roles is something that will benefit XYZ Company because your team will trust me more than someone who isn't as confident . ""

"" What are some of the things you can contribute to our organization ?""

"" I have worked hard all my life and am prepared to work just as hard for this job if hired.I also believe that it is important to learn from other people , so I would be willing to take on any responsibilities or tasks that were assigned . ""

"" Why did you choose your major?""

"" As a student at ABC University , I was able to select my major because it's what I wanted and had worked hard for.I decided early in my academic career to become an accountant, so when the time came for me to apply myself fully , I was more than ready . ""

"" What were your responsibilities at XYZ Company?""

"" I was responsible for managing all financial transactions , as well as coordinating with vendors and clients.I also made sure that every project had a deadline by which it would be completed , so if anyone needed anything from me they knew where to go . ""

"" What is the most important thing you learned while at XYZ Company?""

"" The most important lesson I learned while working for ABC was how to properly deal with customers.I had many situations where I was upset or frustrated by something that happened , but once I got over it and stopped thinking about myself , my attitude changed completely . ""

"" What do you do in your spare time? How does this contribute to your life? ""

"" I enjoy reading books on finance, business , history etc.. The best thing is being able to find out something new every day so when it comes down to meeting deadlines or making decisions about work projects , these things are easier for me because they've already been thought through beforehand . ""

"" How do you handle stressful situations? Give an example.""

"" When I was working as an accountant at ABC Company, there were times when my boss would ask me to take on additional responsibilities that made my workload heavier than usual.I never felt overwhelmed by these requests because I knew they were necessary for our clients , and so if anything stressful happened in the office while he was away from his desk then I would just keep working until everything got done . ""

"" How do you think a company like ABC Company benefits from hiring someone who knows more than one language?""

"" As an accountant at ABC Company , I am very aware of how important it is to know multiple languages.The clients that come into our office want their paperwork in English, so when they ask for help with something like this - especially if you aren't fluent yet! - we can provide them with what they need .""

"" What are the qualities of a good leader?""

"" A good leader is someone who motivates others to do their best work.They also have an eye on the big picture and know how to delegate tasks effectively , while also being able to give constructive feedback when needed.A great way for me to describe this would be by saying that my boss was like a coach who helped us all reach our goals .""

"" What do you think of your previous co-workers?""

"" The people I worked with at ABC Company were always willing to lend a hand when needed, so it didn't matter what time of day or night they called me - even if I was just going out for dinner! They would always be there to help . ""

"" How do you define leadership? What are some examples of where you have demonstrated leadership?""

"" Leadership means different things in different situations.For example ,

"" I typically start each morning by reviewing the previous day's accomplishments,and then I plan out my priorities for the remainder of that day.I find that this is important because I can adjust and modify my daily schedule to meet deadlines or changing circumstances . ""

"" Give an example of when you made a mistake ? ""

"" Last month in one of our major accounts , we had a computer program failure,which delayed shipping for three weeks.I think the company was very gracious and understanding about it all because I acted immediately and responsibly . I also gave them some options on how to manage the situation so they didn't lose face with their customers . ""

"" How do you deal with a person that is difficult ? ""

"" I try to get to know this person better first,and then I listen intently when he or she talks.I look for common interests and traits so that I can learn more about the other person's work style and culture . This helps me understand where they are coming from , and why they may be acting in a certain way . ""

"" Do you have any management experience ? ""

"" Yes, I do.I had the responsibility for training , motivating , scheduling,and evaluating an excellent sales team of ten people . It was a very rewarding experience because I saw them succeed and grow on a daily basis . ""

"" How would you define your work ethics ? ""

"" My personal code is that I always do what's right for the client , even if it means taking responsibility or risk.I also believe in integrity, honesty, and keeping my word . ""

"" Are there any qualities in your co-workers which you admire? ""

"" Some of the qualities I really appreciate are;confidence,humor,and positive attitude , because they're contagious ! The most important thing is to find a job where the culture and people match yours . It ' s not worth it to make money if you hate the place . ""

"" Describe one of your best experiences on a project.How did you contribute? ""

"" I think my greatest success was on a special sales assignment last year .It involved a very difficult client that had been rejected by three major suppliers already because they felt that their service and product were too expensive for our industry .I was able to make many changes, such as adding value , so that we could provide this company with a more comprehensive service . ""

"" How do you handle pressure in the work place? ""

"" I don't like to have things hanging over my head.When I have an important task at hand I try to set aside time to accomplish it . Otherwise,it will keep nagging me all day long , and that ' s no way to work ! ""

"" Describe a situation where you had to think on your feet.What did you do? ""

"" Last year my boss asked me to make a presentation at the corporate headquarters in California . He didn't give me much time or warning , and I was very nervous, but after a lot of preparation I finally made it ! My experience with this company gave me a tremendous amount of confidence because they were impressed that I was able to adjust so quickly . ""

"" Can you name one person who has had a major impact on your life?What did he or she teach you ? ""

"" I think my mother is the most influential person in my life.I've learned a lot from her, such as;how to be honest,how to make decisions , and how to be self-sufficient . She was also very supportive when I went back to school for my bachelor's degree . ""

"" Describe your greatest success in sales.What did you do to achieve it? ""

"" I think the best sale that I've made this year is actually on going.We had a client who was ready to cancel our services,but after much review and research we were able to add value, and they renewed their contract with us . They also gave me additional responsibilities because of my past performance . ""

"" How do you think your previous position has prepared you for this position? ""

"" I believe that one's work history is the best indicator as to what a person can do.I ' ve had a lot of experience in sales,marketing,and management , and I was able to handle all three responsibilities at my previous company . ""

"" How do you deal with an uncooperative co-worker? ""

"" My personal philosophy is that everyone has some sort of value or contribution they can make.I try to get this person on the same wavelength by asking for his or her opinion in a way that shows mutual respect . I also encourage them and point out their strengths , because everyone likes recognition ! ""

"" What do you think is your greatest personal achievement? ""

"" Last year my son was accepted to the best school in the state .I'm proud of him for his accomplishments, but more than anything I am happy that he's doing what he wants to do with his life and he ' s very happy ! ""

"" Describe a situation where you were asked to do something outside your job duties.What did you do ? ""

"" Last year I volunteered at my son's elementary school,and helped to raise $300 for their sports program .It was great because the students and teachers were very thankful and appreciative of my support !""

"" Do you consider yourself to be a leader?Why or why not ? ""

"" I would describe myself as a strong personality , but more than that I have a lot of experience working with people.I've learned how to motivate,and I enjoy helping other people reach their goals .""

"" Can you tell me about a time when your integrity was tested?How did you respond ? ""

"" I think one of the biggest challenges we face is being truthful and honest in our work environment.When my company had a major problem last year,I made sure to be open with all of the employees , because it was important for them to know that things were not going well . My honesty earned me respect from the people I worked with .""

"" Describe one of your greatest accomplishments and what you did to achieve it? ""

"" Well,I think my greatest accomplishment is actually still in progress . It's a sales job , and I know that if I work hard enough I can make this client my biggest customer !""

"" Have you ever been fired from a job ? Why not ? What did you do to correct the situation? ""

"" Yes, but it was because I wasn ' t happy with what they wanted me to do . I know that there are other opportunities in life , so if a person doesn't like where he or she is at , then it's time to find something new ! ""

"" This happened a few years ago, when we had just opened our new office.A colleague suggested that we should have an opening reception to celebrate with friends and family who could help us launch the business . I thought it was brilliant , because we ended up having about 85 people in attendance . ""

"" How do you manage a conflict ? ""

"" I try to understand what each person's position is, and why they feel that way.Then I try to negotiate to find something that benefits both parties . If all else fails , it ' s important for me to remember that it's better to lose an argument than a friend or business relationship . ""

"" What type of people do you work with most effectively ? ""

"" People who are willing to listen and have a good sense of humor, because I like to laugh at the absurdities of life.I also enjoy being around confident individuals , because that inspires me to be my best . ""

"" What things impress you in your colleagues ? ""

"" I appreciate those people who are honest with themselves and others . It is so important for us all to do this, not only in our business dealings but also in our personal life . ""

"" What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? ""

"" I believe that feedback should be given privately.I think it's an affront to a person ' s character if you try to criticize them in front of their colleagues and peers . If you want to change behavior, it must be done with the person alone or in a small group so they can get more out of it. ""

"" How do you organize and plan for major projects ? ""

"" I like to brainstorm, and then go through each phase of my project to make sure I've covered all areas . It's also important that I write everything down , so nothing gets left out. ""

"" Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . ""

"" I once had a customer who refused to pay me, and was threatening legal action for my firm's poor services . The only way I could think of resolving this issue quickly was by offering the client 50% off our next project . We made sure we were on top of this issue with emails and phone calls as soon as possible. ""

"" How do you manage your time in a typical day ? ""

"" In my position , I have to prioritize clients and their needs, so sometimes general correspondence has to come last . It ' s important to keep the communication lines open with staff and other employees though , because that helps avoid any future problems. ""

"" Describe a time when you acted on someone's suggestion . ""

"" I think the best idea is one which is beneficial for all parties involved.A couple of years ago, we decided to offer free consultations with clients so they could get some information about us before deciding if they wanted to hire our company or not.This worked out very well , because we got a lot more business inquiries than usual. ""

"" How do you manage a conflict ? ""

"" I try my best to see it from the other person's perspective, so that I can fully understand their viewpoint.I then try to negotiate and find some kind of common ground , because this helps both parties to feel like they have won . If all else fails , it ' s important for me to remember that it's better to lose an argument than a friend or business relationship . ""

"" What type of people do you work with most effectively ? ""

"" I tend to be my best around those who are confident and direct.It ' s harder for me to work well with timid individuals because they move slower and can sometimes lack focus . ""

"" What things impress you in your colleagues ? ""

"" I appreciate the people who have good character and integrity , which is so important in any business environment . ""

"" What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? ""

"" Feedback should be given privately, because it can have a negative effect if you try to criticize someone in front of their colleagues and peers.If you want to change behavior, it must be done with the person alone or in a small group so they can get more out of it. ""

"" How do you organize and plan for major projects ? ""

"" I love to brainstorm ideas , then set a timetable that's realistic . What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily covers everything as these things unfold because I ' ve already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . ""

"" Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . ""

"" One time , I had to complete an end of quarter report while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible, because I couldn ' t bring my office files with me . Luckily we had a good secretary who helped us locate all the information we needed . ""

I knew she was trying to tell me that it was a ripoff , but how could I disagree with her ? She had gotten it for 40% less than the original price! In fact, I had been telling myself over and over again while shopping: Don't go over fifty dollars. So if I paid more than what she did, then she was right and I was wrong .

"" You know , ""she said, ""I heard a rumor that this store will be closing down next week . It might still be worth looking for something to wear there before they close the doors . ""

I thanked her for telling me and promised to check it out. The rest of the day I couldn't stop thinking about how much money she had saved herself by buying a dress at Helen's Boutique instead of Maxine's. She probably spent less than three dollars on a pair of shoes! And they were even better than my shoes!

""Hey, Jenna ! "" I called out when I got home .

Jenna was doing her math homework and she looked up with a smile.

""Did you have fun today ? ""she asked.

I nodded in agreement.

""What's your favorite part about going shopping ? ""

Her eyes lit up as she started to think of the answer. I could tell that this was something that she enjoyed doing. But what did I enjoy?

"" What's yours ? ""she asked again .

I thought about it for a moment and then said, ""I don't really know.""

Jenna smiled at me and then started to say something else when suddenly the phone rang . She got up and answered it while I stayed on my bed. When she was done talking , she said that her friend from school would be picking her up in a few minutes, and that we should have dinner at our place tonight.

""Okay,""I agreed. ""Can I go with you?""

""Sure . Do you want to come over for dinner first ? ""

""Yes , if it's okay.""

She looked relieved and smiled as she put on her shoes, grabbed her jacket from the closet, and then ran downstairs to get ready.

I felt like I was walking on air when I walked into our apartment . The sun shone through my window and made it look so pretty outside that it seemed like a dream coming true! My mum had just finished cooking dinner when I opened the door, so I gave her a hug before saying hello to everyone else.

""Hey, Mom ! ""I called out with excitement . She came over and gave me a big kiss on my cheek , while Dad smiled at us both from across the room . He was sitting there with his newspaper in one hand , drinking coffee with the other , looking like he had just woken up after being asleep for days .

""Hi, honey ! ""she said warmly . ""I'm glad you're here.""

""I can feel it too,""I laughed softly . I knew exactly where she was coming from because even though Dad wasn't home when we left this morning , he had been so busy with work that I felt like he hadn't seen me in weeks ! He'd even asked me to pick up some takeout on my way over here!

""So how was your day ? ""Mum asked .

I told her about going shopping, but she didn't seem too interested in the details. Instead, she just wanted to know if there was anything new happening with Jenna's school or her friends? Was everything okay at work for Dad? Did I have any fun plans for later on this weekend ?

""I guess that's all right then,""she said finally . ""You know what else would make me happy ? If you would eat something other than ice cream before bedtime ! You need more protein in your body , Jenna.""

""Mom, I really don't care about eating right now . It's not like it matters what happens next week or anything. ""I shook my head with a smile and she laughed back at me .

After dinner we sat around the table talking about our plans for the upcoming weekend . I told them all that I wanted to spend time with Jenna , but also said that maybe we should go out some night as well ? They both agreed with this idea, but before leaving they reminded us again about how important it was to be more active when we were outside of school.

I promised not only myself but also my parents that I would make an effort to stay away from the computer and phone more often , so that I could spend time doing things I loved with people who mattered most ."

He is a professor at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio and he ’ s going to be speaking on the subject of education in his field . It ’ s a lecture series at Oxford . So , that ’ s why I need to go there . ""

"" Thank you. Your visa application has been approved . Here are your passport and your new tourist visa . You should arrive well before April twentieth . Have a pleasant journey ! Goodbye ! ""

"" Well , I ’ ve lived in the United States before for six years as a college student on a J-1 visa and as an F-1 student and now I want to visit my family for a little bit . I have all of my possessions with me at home so I won ’ t be returning immediately . ""

"" OK , here is your passport and I will need the original return airline ticket.

I have been informed by Washington that you are ineligible under 124(a) of the Immigration Act. Please don ’ t return until your status has changed to B-1/B-2 . ""

### Reentry Permit

Someone who has lived in the United States as a student, visitor or another temporary nonimmigrant may be eligible for a reentry permit if they need to leave the country and return before their I-94 expires. There is no application for this permit; the immigration officer will grant it when the person returns at the port of entry. The reentry permit allows that person to stay out of the United States for up to two years without losing his or her nonimmigrant status, but not longer than one year beyond what was allowed on their original I-94.

### Advance parole

A person who is a refugee or an asylee and needs to travel outside of the United States for humanitarian reasons may apply for advance parole (a written statement granting reentry to the U.S.) before leaving the country. In this case, the applicant must obtain a new immigrant visa from their home country's embassy in order to return to the United States as an immigrant after living abroad.

### Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

Temporary protected status is granted when the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) determines that the temporary conditions that have caused a foreign country to be designated for TPS no longer exist, or if the country is unable to handle returning its nationals adequately.  This is only given to those who entered legally in order to escape persecution, and are not eligible for adjustment of status because they cannot demonstrate that they would otherwise have a ""bona fide"" relationship with family or a job in the United States.

### Refugee Adjustment of Status (AOS)

Refugees who wish to become permanent residents after living in the U.S. as refugees may apply for adjustment of status through USCIS. They must be physically present in the U.S. and have maintained legal status during their stay. The application process can take several months, but there is no fee if filed on or before April 30, 2017; after that date a $680 fee will apply.

### Asylee Adjustment of Status (AOS)

Asylees who wish to become permanent residents after living in the U.S. as refugees may apply for adjustment of status through USCIS. They must be physically present in the United States and have maintained legal status during their stay. The application process can take several months, but there is no fee if filed on or before April 30, 2017; after that date a $680 fee will apply.

"" That's another story. I hope to never be in that situation because that would mean that there was something wrong with me. ""

"" Not necessarily, sometimes it can happen accidentally or by chance . ""

"" How is that possible ? . ""

"" We have a lot of things in common , we are similar , our values are the same and so on . But if one day , we realize that we don't love each other anymore, then I guess it would be better for us to break up . ""

"" I agree with you . If they can't love each other,they have no reason to be together . ""

"" What matters the most is whether you are in love or not , that's what counts because love makes the marriage. Love is the only thing that really connects a married couple . ""

"" Love makes people stay together but it also makes them leave each other . ""

"" You don't know how to be in love and I hope you never have to learn . ""

"" Why? What will happen to me if I am not lucky enough to find that special person who is supposed to make my life happy ? . ""

"" We all deserve happiness . If you find the one , it won't matter what else you don't get because your heart and soul are already taken care of. You can have anything in this world as long as you have the right person by your side. ""

"" That is true, but if we really love someone, why would they break our hearts? . ""

"" Because people change, that's all there is to it . ""

"" People are not like cars or houses . They can't be sold because they don't have an expiration date. You have a lot of years ahead of you , and I hope you find the perfect person to spend them with. ""

"" There will come a day when we will all understand that love is more than just a feeling or words, but it also has another dimension in which our heart is what really counts. The other thing is not important because even if it breaks up , there will always be a next time . I hope you can find happiness sometime soon and believe me when I say this: I have been waiting for mine and she's worth every minute of the pain I endured before meeting her. ""

"" Thanks, I hope to meet hers as well because what matters is that we both love each other . ""

"" That is true but if it doesn't work out for us, at least we will have tried and lived happily ever after. ""

"" He has a black face and whiskers , just like yours . ""

"" And your mother ? ""

"" She looks as though she had a dress on her back . ""

"" But I suppose you don ’ t know her. ""

"" No; I wish I did. Then when we go to see her I can say, ‘ That ’ s my mother! ’ ""

"" Well , if he was here I could tell you ; but you see I haven ’ t seen him yet.""

"" Where have you come from ? ""

"" From a far away place ——""

"" How long did it take you to get here ? ""

"" We went in an aeroplane. ""

"" That was quick work ! ""

"" Yes ; but when we had been flying for two days, the propeller fell off. ""

"" And how did you make a landing after that? ""

"" We landed on a hill , and didn ’ t get hurt at all . ""

"" I should think not ! But tell me what made you come to America ? ""

"" Our captain told us there was money in it ——""

"" Your father was in business? ""

"" Yes ; he had an office . ""

"" And where is your home ? ""

"" I don ’ t know. We came here from a place where the water was red . ""

"" How do you like America? ""

"" It ’ s too cold for me.""

"" Are you not going to school ? ""

"" No; because I can read already , and I like it better than lessons. Whenever we play , my sister has to be the teacher .""

"" Lilly. ""

"" How old are you? ""

"" Twelve . ""

"" Are you as big as that ? "" (indicating a small child)

"" Oh, yes ; I was bigger when we started out of Egypt . ""

"" And how long ago was that?""

"" About forty years.""

"" Do you like being here? ""

"" Yes; but it ’ s too hot , and my mother doesn ’ t know any English.""

"" And what do they say in your country ? ""

"" The same as they do in America , only we have more words. For instance, I had an aunt who lived far away . We called her ‘ Cousin Lilly ’ , but when she came to see us she said , ‘ How are you ? ’ — and that ’ s what made me cry.""

"" But why didn ’ t you answer her? ""

"" Because my mother told me not to speak, I didn ’ t know what she meant .""

"" And how did you come back to your aunt after you had been over here ? ""

"" My mother took us in a boat.""

"" What sort of boat was it? ""

"" A very big one ——""

"" Didn ’ t the captain tell you when he came up there? ""

"" No ; but I saw him jump into the water. ""

"" Where did they come from ? ""

"" From my aunt ’ s house.""

"" What do people say in your country, and how do they spell it? ""

"" They say ‘ How are you ? ’ But when we speak to them , we just laugh ; for the way that we say it is funny to us . ""

"" Do you know what they say about Americans ? ""

"" Oh, yes; but I don ’ t believe everything. It makes me cry sometimes . ""

"" What do they say? ""

"" They say that American children are more naughty than any others in the world , and that their mothers have to lock them up at night.""

"" Is this true ? ""

"" I don ’ t know. Sometimes we have to be locked up ; but my mother doesn ’ t do it on purpose . She has a good reason for it sometimes.""

"" What is the name of your home town? ""

"" That ’ s what I forgot to tell you; and if I had known you were coming over here , I would have told you. We live in Chicago . ""

"" Then how do you come to be out in this country ? ""

"" We came down on a ship, but the captain got lost.""

"" And what did your mother say about that? ""

"" She said it wasn ’ t his fault. ""

"" But don ’ t you know where Chicago is? ""

"" Yes; and I know my way from here to there . ""

"" What else do they say in your country ? ""

"" They say that when a girl grows up, she has to marry the man who pays her most. And then I want to tell you something. When we were coming over here , two men came along with us and one of them paid more than the other; so that ’ s why my sister married him.""

"" How long have they been married ? ""

"" About three weeks . ""

"" What is your father like? ""

"" He is fat ——""

"" Fat ? Why, you ’ re as thin as a stick ! ""

"" Oh, but I get so much to eat at home . ""

"" Then tell me what they say in your country. How do the people speak there? What kind of houses do you have, and what is the name of your town ? You see, my little boy hasn ’ t told me a word about where he comes from, except that he wants to know how to spell Chicago . ""

"" He can tell you better than I can. But I ’ ll show him how to say it :
‘ Chica-go ! ’ That ’ s what they call it. And when my father gets up in the morning , he says, ‘ Good morning!’ — and when we come home from school, my mother says, ‘ Good evening ! ’ Then she calls us to supper . ""

"" Do you know how old your father is? ""

"" I don ’ t know exactly. I think he must be as old as the devil.""

"" Is that all you know about it ? ""

"" Yes; and now my sister wants me to ask you where Chicago is . ""

"" Have you been there yourself ? ""

"" No ; but a man came out of it one day , and he told me how to get there ——""

"" And what did you say? ""

"" I said, ‘ How do you spell that place? ’ He said, ‘ C-h-i-c-a-g-o . ’ But when we were coming over here , one man said it was spelled a different way ; but then my sister married the one who paid her most.""

"" And what else did he say?""

"" I asked him if there weren ’ t any other places like that where they had to pay more than others ? ""

"" Why did you ask him? ""

"" Because we were coming from a place where the people didn ’ t give me any candy , and I wanted to know what would make them do it. He said he knew nothing about it, but if I came back again in five years I might know.""

"" But haven’t you been there since ? ""

"" Oh yes ; we went last summer . We were down on the lake for three weeks . It was a very nice time; and when my sister said she had to get married, I said that it wasn ’ t necessary. So my mother told me to shut up.""

"" Where is your father? ""

"" He died about six years ago . But don’t you see ? If he had been living , we never would have come here . ""

"" And how old are you?""

"" I don ’ t know exactly; but my sister says I am twelve.""

"" How much do they say in your country? ""

"" They say, ‘ How do you do ? ’ and when a man wants to see another man, he calls him up , and then the other comes. And when he gets there, one of them shakes hands with the other . And then I want to tell you something: Last night when we went to bed , my sister said that she wished some of us would get married. ""

"" Who was there ? ""

"" My mother and father ; and my grandfather came too. We all sat down in the big room, where it ’ s dark. And then somebody read out of a book . It was about the Bible , and it made me cry when I heard what they said.""

"" Did you know that your parents were married before ? ""

"" Oh yes ! That was just after the war ; but I don ’ t remember it. ""

"" And how old are you, little boy? ""

"" I think I am six or seven years old , because my mother has been pregnant with me so long."""
llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,239,llama-2-7b@q8_0_239.txt,""" Yes , and some of them are right ! But we can only hope that it won ’ t happen again . ""

"" It seems that the present is more interesting than history . ""

"" Not to me ! I find the past more exciting . ""

"" It looks as if you have a very good memory for dates . ""

"" Yes , but not for anything else ! ""

"" Do you like museums ? ""

"" I don ’ t know . I only go to them because my parents take me there . They think it ’ s interesting to see things from the past. ""

"" Have you ever been inside a palace? ""

"" Yes , but not for long . The rooms were crowded and noisy. There were too many people looking at the same thing as I was ! ""

"" What about castles ? ""

"" Never been in one either . They looked nice from outside . But I don ’ t think it’s worth going inside a castle because all you can see is ruins , and they are not very interesting. ""

"" I suppose there must be other places to go . ""

"" Oh, yes ! There ’ s a beautiful cathedral in my home town. You should visit it if you ever come here again . It was built many centuries ago . ""

"" That sounds lovely . ""

"" Well , the inside is nice but the outside isn ’ t . The walls are covered with pigeon droppings ! ""

"" Pigeons ! ""

"" Yes . They like to build their nests there, and when they make a hole in the wall , the rain gets in too. ""

"" That sounds terrible ! ""

"" Well , that ’ s what I say every time I walk past it! The rest of my town is very clean . ""

"" So you think history is boring? ""

"" Not at all, but some places are better than others . ""

"" What do you like to learn about in history ? ""

"" Anything really . But I don ’ t like reading long lists of names and dates. It ’ s too hard for me to remember them ! ""

"" Well , what other subjects would you prefer? ""

"" English is my favourite subject at school because we always read stories about the past. And in Maths I learn how people worked out things in olden times . ""

"" Do you have any history books in your library ? ""

"" Yes , but they don ’ t help me to remember dates and names ! They are more like pictures than a book, so they don ’t tell the story properly. ""

"" What about films? Have you ever seen one that was about history? ""

"" Not really . I haven ’ t watched many yet . Some of them look as if they could be interesting though . ""

"" Oh , I saw a film about the French Revolution once . It had lots of bloodshed and violence, but it wasn ’ t very educational. ""

"" My father likes films like that because he thinks they are more true to life than others. But I think we should learn about the past in school rather than at home or on television ! ""

"" What do you think about books then? ""

"" Oh, I don ’ t know . Some of them are interesting but they often have too many dates and names. The films sometimes show some scenes from a book which would help me remember it better . ""

"" What are some examples of this happening ? ""

"" There are lots ! I’ve heard that Julius Caesar was murdered by his own friends in a senate meeting, just like how John F. Kennedy died in an ambush at Dallas. It is also said that Alexander the Great , who conquered so many lands and peoples, had a weakness for women and drank too much wine ! ""

"" What about you ? Do you have any examples of history repeating itself ? ""

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,86,llama-2-7b@q8_0_86.txt,""" Exactly . Anyway , since I have been here, I've learned that no matter where you go in China , there is always something special about it . For example, there are lots of things we don't have at home . ""

"" Like what ? ""

"" Well, for one thing, Chinese food is different from Indian or western food . There is a lot of seafood . It's not all chicken and meat . ""

"" But that's nothing special, isn't it ? ""

"" Well, yes . But then there's the tea. In China they use the leaves for making green , red and white teas. The best ones are expensive . I like to drink Chinese tea . It tastes different from other kinds of tea. It's also better for you, and you feel more energetic after a cup. ""

"" What about Chinese medicines ? ""

"" Oh , yeah . That is something else we don't have at home. I go to my gym every day, but that doesn't seem to keep me fit enough. There are many people here who take medication as part of their daily dietary regime . I think it would do me good if I started taking some Chinese herbs and pills as well . ""

"" And what about the Chinese New Year ? Isn't that special ? ""

"" Of course ! It's the most important festival in China . There are lots of different rituals and ceremonies. People dress up, go to temple, have family meals ... ""

"" Do you like it when people give you presents on New Year's Day ? ""

"" Oh yeah , that is something I really enjoy. This year my parents got us a car ! That was the best present we could ever receive . ""

"" Cool ! You must have been excited . ""

"" Oh, yes ! I've always wanted to have a car . We used to take the bus everywhere before. It took a long time and it was expensive. Now everything is so close by ! ""

"" So you really like living in Guangzhou ? ""

"" Yes , definitely ! ""

"" Why do you think that ? ""

"" I'm enjoying myself here. The people are friendly, the food is good, and it's a lot cheaper than London . ""

"" Do you ever miss home ? ""

"" No , not really . It was difficult at first, but now everything seems natural to me. I think my Chinese friends understand me better than anyone else in the world.""

""I know what you mean. They are so friendly and hospitable . ""

"" Yes . People always ask if I'm doing ok. If I want any help with anything , they are willing to do it for me. My Chinese teachers are nice too. They try hard to explain things in English, but I think sometimes it's difficult for them because they don't know the language well enough.""

""Yes . I suppose that must be very frustrating for both of us.""

""Well , it is a bit challenging . ""

""Are you getting more confident ? ""

"" Oh yeah ! Definitely. Now when I go to the supermarket, I know what foods are cheap and which ones are expensive. Sometimes people in front of me can't speak Chinese , so they start speaking English to each other. But I don't understand a word! So if someone asks me something or needs help with anything, I'm happy to help . ""
""That must feel great ! Do you ever think about coming back home ? ""

"" Not really . Why would I want to leave this wonderful place ? Besides , my friends and family miss me here in Guangzhou too. They can't wait for me to come home again . ""

"" Well , maybe you are right . But I can tell you , I couldn ’ t understand a word of what they were saying . It was all overwhelming Chinese noise to me . And then my girlfriend started talking in English , and after that I understood everything . ""

"" You mean , when she switched to English, you could follow the conversation ? ""

"" Yeah , exactly . Well, actually she spoke some broken English first. But then, she got it all sorted out with this other sales clerk . She even managed to get the price of that mobile phone down by a third ! ""

"" Wow ! I didn ’ t know that was possible . ""

"" Yeah , and my girlfriend can still talk to anybody about anything in Chinese now. It wasn ’ t always so easy for her when we started going out together, you know ? She used to stutter and stumble around, even on the most basic things like how much she wanted something. Now she talks like a native . ""

"" So , what do you think is the reason that your girlfriend learned Chinese faster than you did ? ""

"" Well, I ’ m no expert on the subject. But one thing ’ s for sure : when you love someone, you will learn to understand them . My girlfriend loved me . She wanted me to understand her . So , she took time and effort to teach me about herself in Chinese . It was very important to her that we had a good understanding of each other . ""

"" I see what you mean . So you think the main reason that your girlfriend learned Chinese faster than you did is because she loved you ? ""

"" Well , it must have helped . But then again, it wasn ’ t just my girlfriend who wanted me to understand her better. It was everybody around me. My parents too . They wanted me to fit into their society as much as possible . ""

"" I see . You mean you didn ’ t know Chinese before ? ""

"" Yeah , pretty much . The first time I went to China with my girlfriend, everything that we ate and drank was in English. Our waiters all spoke English . Even the people in the marketplace could understand us when we asked directions or what they were selling. It wasn ’ t until later on, after our trip together , that I started learning Chinese . ""

"" How did your parents react to you taking time away from school to learn Chinese ? ""

"" Well , they didn ’ t like it at first . I mean, my parents really wanted me to get a good education and finish college. They even said so when I was going off to university . But now that I have finished university and can speak Chinese very well, they don ’ t mind so much . ""

"" So , you think that the main reason you learned Chinese is because your parents want you to be able to fit into their society ? ""

"" Well , maybe it was part of it. But there are a lot more reasons why I started learning Chinese in the first place . Besides, my girlfriend still wants me to learn and she says that I ’ m doing good . I guess I must be doing pretty good if she doesn ’ t want to teach me anymore . ""

"" So , what do you think is your main reason for wanting to learn Chinese ? ""

"" Well , like I said before, my girlfriend loves me and wants me to understand her better. That ’ s one of the reasons . Another thing is that it ’ s easier to make friends here when you can speak their language . My English isn ’ t very good and sometimes it takes me a long time to explain things in Chinese that I could say in just a few words in English. The other day, for example , I was trying to ask a taxi driver about the price of our ride , but he didn ’ t understand what I wanted . We couldn ’ t even agree on a price and when I finally got back home my girlfriend told me she had a fight with the taxi driver all because he couldn ’ t speak English and I couldn ’ t speak Chinese ! ""

"" So, you think that the main reason you are learning Chinese is so you can make more friends here in China ? ""

"" Well , actually I don ’ t care so much about making friends with people who only speak one language . I mean, they might be very friendly but it won ’ t last if you can ’ t really communicate. It’s not like we are going to be living here forever and I can ’ t wait for the day when my girlfriend and I can actually talk in Chinese together ! ""

"" So , what do you think is your main reason for learning Chinese ? ""

"" Well, there ’ s a lot more . But basically, I guess it’s so that I don ’ t have to worry about how to communicate with people who speak only English all the time. It doesn’t matter where we go or what we do, my girlfriend will always understand me now and I will be able to understand her too ! ""

"" So , you think your main reason for learning Chinese is so that you can have a good relationship with your girlfriend ? ""

"" Yeah . That ’ s it. ""

"" How can that be ? The sales clerk was screaming and shouting , while my girlfriend was standing there calmly . I couldn ’ t believe what I was seeing . ""

"" Well, don ’ t worry about it. You ’ ll get used to it when you live here for a few years. After all, you are in China now ! ""

"" But why is that ? Why do the Chinese do these things ? I don ’ t understand it . ""

"" Well, let me think. I suppose , Chinese like shouting and screaming ; it shows how angry they feel . ""

"" No , no , no . That is not what happened at all ! They didn ’ t want to be angry . There was a lot of tension in the room, but that was just because they wanted to finish the negotiation as quickly as possible . The sales clerk was shouting and screaming out loud because he needed to get his point across . ""

"" I don ’ t understand what you mean ! What were you saying about it being a violent fight ? That is not true at all. And you said that Chinese people like to bargain ! If they didn ’ t want to be angry , then why did the sales clerk shout and scream? ""

"" He was trying to get his point across as quickly as possible . What he wanted to say was this : ’ You can only have this mobile phone for this price ’ . That is what he said. But you know, my English isn ’ t that great so I don ’ t understand everything right away . ""

"" Oh , yes ; but how did it end up ? Didn ’ t they agree with one another in the end ? ""

"" Yes! The sales clerk agreed to sell me the phone for this price ! He gave my girlfriend a look as if he were telling her that she had done really well . Then, the two of them left together. That was when I realized that it hadn ’ t been a fight at all. It just looked like one from where I was standing . ""

"" But then, what on earth were you so angry about ? Why were you shouting and screaming ? ""

"" Ah ! You have got me there ! Now the joke is on me ! As I said before , my English isn ’ t that great. I just didn ’ t understand them . That ’ s why it seemed as if they were fighting . ""

13. How do you feel about this new school?
I don ’ t know. Maybe I should have got a little more information beforehand, but I think I was being impatient and jumping into things too quickly. A lot of people seem to be very happy with the new school and they really enjoy going there every day. But for me it hasn ’ t worked out that way at all .
14. How do you feel about this new job?
It’s hard to say because I don’t have much experience yet. A few things are starting to get on my nerves, but I can see myself working there for a long time if the job is good and they treat me well. That ’ s all that matters in the end .
15. How do you feel about this new car?
It’s nice enough, but it doesn ’ t have any of those cool features like GPS or an iPod connector or a sunroof—at least none that I could find out about before purchasing it .

### ACTIVITY 3.
#### TASK 1

**Question 1 :** What do you think about the young people nowadays? Do they lack in skills or are they more independent than we were when we were their age? Why/why not?

**Answer:** In my opinion, nowadays young people have higher education level. They are much smarter than us when we were their age. Therefore I think that the young people today do not lack in skills or independent.

**Question 2 :** What advice would you give to young people who want to learn a foreign language? Where should they study, and what could they do outside of class to improve their language proficiency?

**Answer:** The first thing that I will suggest is choosing the best course from the wide range of courses. This means that we can learn basic knowledge or even advanced knowledge on the same subject according to our desire. Secondly, if young people want to practice what they have learned in class outside of class, then they should go online and practise grammar, vocabulary and listening skill. It will be much easier for them to improve their language proficiency.

#### TASK 2:

**Question 3 :** In what ways could people who want a change in their career benefit from taking a training course? What are the advantages of taking part in such a course?

**Answer:** I think that people can gain more knowledge and skills from attending the training courses. Moreover, it will help us to learn new things related to our desired career which we might not know about before. Moreover, these training courses will provide an opportunity for people to meet other participants who have the same goal in life as them.

**Question 4 :** What types of person should go on a training course? Who would benefit most from doing so? Why/why not?

**Answer:** I believe that everyone should attend such courses because it will help you learn new things about your desired career. However, I do think that the people who want to change their careers or those who are thinking of taking a different job path would benefit most from doing so . For example , if they want to be an accountant but don’t know much about how this type of work is done , then attending one will give them insight into what it really means and whether or not this profession suits their needs .

#### TASK 3:

**Question 1 :** Do you think that we should learn as many new skills as possible? Why/why not?

**Answer:** I am an advocate of learning new skills. We have to keep up with the technological advances in the world so that we can be more successful and efficient . In addition , if there are any changes in our jobs or career paths then we should always take advantage of this opportunity by learning new things from online courses or training sessions organized by our company .

**Question 2 :** What is one thing you've learned recently? Why do you think it was useful to learn that particular skill/fact/piece of information?

**Answer:** I have been trying to improve my Spanish language skills and I can say with confidence that learning a foreign language has opened up new opportunities for me . This is because now people are more likely to hire someone who speaks an additional language than someone whose only skillset consists of being fluent in their native tongue."

"" his parents met my parents on the day of our wedding in a little ceremony before the main event . They gave gifts to each other and wished us well for our married life ahead . ""

"" what was the most memorable thing about your wedding ? ""

"" actually , it wasn't anything that happened at my wedding itself . It was two things after my wedding . The first is that a few months later we went on honeymoon to Bali and spent some time there before returning home . And the second was when I returned home from work one day a few weeks after we got married , and my husband had moved all of his stuff into our flat and done it up nicely for us both . ""

"" that sounds like two good reasons to marry someone ! Is this why you would recommend marriage to your friends ? ""

"" yes, I definitely would recommend getting married . It is an amazing feeling when you know that you have someone by your side who will always be there for you and support you , through thick and thin . You can share all of the good moments with them too , like when we were on honeymoon ! ""

"" we did ! We went to Mexico . I would have loved to go to Italy or France , but my husband wanted to go somewhere warm . And he won . ""

"" why did your parents let you get married if they couldn't afford to come ? ""

"" it's not like my father is very rich ! But we both knew that when we got engaged we were going to have a big party and celebrate , and that would be enough for everyone . We could afford to have the party , so that was fine with everyone . ""

"" well, I wouldn't call it traditional by any means . But that's what suited me and my husband best . ""

"" do you think that you can ever change the way you are to please other people? ""

"" I don't know if I could ever change who I am to please anyone else , but sometimes you have to make sacrifices when it comes to marriage . If your partner doesn't like a certain type of music, for example , then maybe y ""

"" do you think that love is all that matters ? ""

"" well , if someone loves me for who I am and accepts my flaws and everything about me , then yes , I guess they matter more than anything else . Love can make or break a relationship though . ""

"" we were together for a year before he proposed to me in Paris , but it wasn't until after the wedding that things changed . We became a much better couple when we married each other , and we were really happy from the momen ""

\end{code}

Comment: I believe that it's the first example where you can use the word *good* as a synonym of *correct*. In other languages, this is not possible, so good and correct have different meanings (and are thus not interchangeable).

Answer: ""Good"" is used in many ways. As an adjective it's often used to mean satisfactory or well done. As an exclamation it can express relief or delight but also be sarcastic or ironic depending on the context. In English, its meaning depends on who you are speaking to and what kind of relationship you have with them.

Answer: They are both correct in terms of grammar and spelling. However, ""good"" used as an adjective can sometimes carry a negative connotation if it is placed next to ""afternoon"". In your example, ""Good afternoon"" sounds almost like someone who is saying that they're happy you called but that they have no time for you now because they are busy working. It would be better to say:

\begin{code}
""Hello. This is Tom Smith . How can I help you ?""
\end{code}

Answer: In the first case, \em{Good afternoon} is an interjection used as a salutation and introduces the conversation with its first utterance. The other one is a common way of saying goodbye or bye to someone you want to say it in a formal manner.

Who is the greatest novelist in English literature?  
I think it would have to be Charles Dickens.  
No one ever wrote better than him, and no one will write as well for a long time to come.  
Actually I think Laurence's novels are better than Dickens'.

## 解説

本文中に出現している「I think it would have to be Charles Dickens」は、この英語翻訳問題が作成された1923年の時代では一般的な表現であった。

Answer: I have to say it is the most obvious and well known proverb in English.
The \strong{\em{real question}} should be what are some other similar idioms or proverbs in your native language.

"" One hundred , five hundred and one thousand dollar travelers' cheques. ""

"" Okay, what denominations do you need them ? ""

"" Five hundeds dollars.""

"" That's not a denomination, that is an amount.""

"" Oh , sorry about that . What is your passport number please ? ""

"" 1432879. ""

"" All right , I need to see your passport also.""

"" I don't have my passport with me. ""

"" Then I can only sell you two thousand US dollars of traveler's checks . ""

"" Why not three thousand ? ""

"" The limit is two thousand US dollars in travelers' cheques per person, unless you present your passport.""

"" But my passport says that I have four thousand dollars available to me. ""

"" Well, we are only going by what the bank computer has told us.""

"" What about my Visa card ? That's good for five thousand US dollars . ""

"" Yes , it is but we can only honor those if you present your passport in person and sign the form. ""

"" Can I send you a fax of my passport so that you can sell me three thousand dollars worth of traveler's cheques ? ""

"" No, sorry. I can't do that.""

"" Okay , how about this . Can I use your phone to call the bank and order three thousand dollars in travelers' checks over the telephone so they can be shipped to me by airmail ? ""

"" I don't know if we have a fax machine here. ""

"" Look , let me show you something . This is my Visa card . If I put it on your desk and type in my four digit pin number, will that satisfy the bank computer to authorize three thousand US dollars in traveler's checks ? ""

"" Well... yes . ""

"" Okay. Now, can you sell me three thousand US dollars in travelers' cheques with a one hundred dollar service charge , please ? ""

"" Sure , but I can only do it if I see your passport.""

"" But my Visa card proves that I am authorized to withdraw four thousand dollars. ""

"" That is true, but we are required by law to get your signature on the traveler's cheques sales form and to photocopy your passport as well.""

"" Okay , can you do that over the phone ? ""

"" No . I am afraid not. We are a branch office so all transactions must be handled through our head office in London or by courier. We cannot process travelers' cheques for our customers. You will have to send us your passport and then we can complete the transaction. Is that understood ? ""

"" Yes . Thanks.""

"" Thanks . ""

This is just an example of how difficult shopping can be for women .
It’s not easy to buy clothes you like , clothes that are right for your body type,
clothes that fit your personality and style , and most importantly
it ’ s hard to find clothes at a reasonable price !
What do men have to say about the subject ?
""I just want jeans and t-shirts . It doesn’t really matter what color they are, or even what brand of jeans. And I don’t care if my shirt is designer, as long as it looks good on me.""
So , shopping for clothes isn ’ t a big deal to men !
Well, there you go – that was the second part of our series on Women and Men .
This time we looked at some typical situations women may find themselves in during their daily lives.

"" I like blue better than brown or black . ""

""Sure, thank you so much for helping us.""

""No problem at all ! ""

"" What kind of sweater is suitable for you ?""

"" Not too long sleeves . The one I saw looks good, but it ’ s very expensive.How much is that one? ""

"" You should buy what fits your style and budget.If you can’t afford the price,don ’ t buy them at all.You won ’ t look as beautiful in them as when they fit you. ""

""I like this sweater a lot . What do you think ? ""

""Well , it looks very nice on you.But I think that color is too bright for you to wear.It makes you seem older than you really are.""

"" That ’ s true . You should choose more quiet colors and darker ones . ""

""Yes,I know . ""

""What about the one with stripes ? It looks pretty good on you.""

""Well , I think it suits me very well.The color is also nice,and the length of sleeves is suitable for me.How much is that sweater ? ""

""It’s 68 dollars .""

""Wow! It ’ s too expensive.I can’t afford to spend so much money on one sweater.You see , I only have a part-time job and my budget is limited.""

""Well , it ’ s all up to you if you want to buy that sweater or not . I just tell you what I think of the price . ""

"" And what about the 5th ward ? ""

"" Same thing as with the 7th and 12th . ""

"" How about the 3rd and the 4th wards ? ""

"" I'm sorry, but I don't know. You'll just have to figure it out for yourself. ""

"" But that's ridiculous ! We can't possibly remember all of those places ! What if we don't vote because we just don't know where our polling place is ? That would be a crime ! ""

"" Oh, but it won't hurt you . You just have to get used to voting. I'll bet in the next election or two you'll remember all of them. ""

"" That doesn't help us now though . We still don't know where our polling place is ! ""

"" You should check with your local newspaper, I suppose . They probably list it there somewhere. ""

"" Do they have the voting locations in the phone book ? ""

"" Oh no , you can't expect them to have that much information listed. You'll just have to do some hunting on your own. There must be a way for you to find out, though . I wish I could help you, but I just don't know where you vote. Sorry ! ""

"" And the phone book doesn't list it ? ""

"" Not that I'm aware of , no . ""

"" Well, how do I find out my ward anyway ? ""

"" Oh, well if you really want to get down to those details ... it must be on your tax bill. They have a lot of information listed there. Your house number, street name and ward number should all be right at the top somewhere . There ! That's what I was trying to remember for you. Now do some checking around in that phone book and you should find everything you need to know about where you vote. Good luck with that. ""

"" You mean they don't list it on a map ? ""

"" No, I wouldn't think so. That might be a good idea though ... the voting place locations . ""

"" Yes, and what about absentee ballots ? ""

"" Well, you could always ask for one of those if you can't make it to your polling place on Election Day. I suppose they have that information listed in their phone book too , but you might want to check with the County Clerk's office or City Hall before you call and see if they need something from you like a letter or something for them to write you back with an absentee ballot request form. It would save you some time, I think ... ""

"" Are you kidding ? They make me fill out a form to get one of those things ! ""

"" Really ? That's kinda ridiculous . You'd think that if they sent out absentee ballots for people to vote in the election, it would be as easy as calling and asking them for one. It seems like everyone has a hard time just finding their own polling place these days anyway ! ""

"" And what about early voting ? I heard you can go down to City Hall or something and get your ballot there already filled out so you don't have to wait on Election Day . Is that true, or was that another rumor ? ""

"" It's true. You can do it at the County Clerk's office in City Hall if I remember right ... but they do make you fill out a form first so they can send you an early ballot when it gets close to Election Day. I think that's pretty convenient, personally . ""

"" That is ? ""

"" Sure . Why not ? You can just take it with you and vote at your convenience. Or if something comes up in the middle of voting , they might even let you just fill out some changes on a separate form and send them back to be updated in the computer. They don't make that easy for people, do they ? ""

"" Well I guess not . Is there anything else we should know about voting before Election Day ? ""

"" I think you pretty much have it covered . If you still can't remember where your polling place is located , I suppose you could just ask someone at the County Clerk's office. That would probably be a lot easier than trying to find the answer in that phone book. Good luck ! ""

"" Yes, why do you ask ? ""

"" Because I thought it was next week. ""

"" Well , let's go to the polls then ! ""

"" Sure thing . ""

"" Do you think we can vote on a Tuesday ? ""

"" Why not ? It's a public holiday . ""

"" OK . I need to get my son ready for school, but I'll be there in the afternoon . ""

"" And me too. See you there ! ""

"" What are you talking about ? ""

"" You said it was in November . ""

"" Oh , yes , I remember that . ""

"" That was just last week ! ""

"" Is that why you forgot ? ""

"" How could I forget the election ? ""

"" I don ’ t know how much time we have left to talk . ""

"" Let me check my watch . ""

"" You can read it yourself . ""

"" So, what day is it again ? ""

"" I already told you. The election is Tuesday ! ""

"" Are you sure ? ""

"" Yes , I ’ m positive . ""

"" Because I thought that it was on Wednesday this week . ""

"" But you said it was today ! ""

"" No ! ""

"" You did say that the election is today ! ""

"" Oh yes. Well, if I say something like that , you should write down what I tell you. ""

"" Are you sure that the election is in November ? ""

"" Yes . ""

"" That ’ s why I asked . ""

"" But you still have to vote ! ""

"" Do you know where my ballot is ? ""

"" You must be kidding ! ""

"" How do you like that for a reply ? ""

"" What are you going to do ? ""

"" I ’ m just going to the election office to see if I can get another ballot . ""

"" Do you think they ’ ll let you vote again ? ""

"" Of course ! ""

"" If you say so. I hope you find your ballot. ""

"" Well , at least we still have a week and a half to talk before the election . ""

"" Don ’ t rush things . Take it slow . ""

"" Do you have a license for your car ? ""

"" Well, no one ever stopped me before . ""

"" You can get fined if you don ’ t carry one . ""

"" You ’ re just trying to scare me , aren ’ t you ? ""

"" No ! I ’ m telling you the law is going to change this week and that means you have to pay more for your car insurance . ""

"" But why ? I don ’ t understand. ""

"" Do you know how much the car insurance will cost next year ? ""

"" Not really, but it doesn ’ t seem like too much money . ""

"" Well, if you had known what to expect , maybe you would have bought a new car . ""

"" What do you mean ? ""

"" Didn ’ t your friend tell you that the government is going to put up the price of gasoline and diesel fuel soon ? ""

"" I guess so, but why are they doing that ? ""

"" So you don ’ t know what’s happening in your country . ""

"" Well , it seems like we just can ’ t help it ! We have to pay more for everything because the government is raising our taxes . ""

"" Is there anything we can do ? ""

"" No . The only thing you and I can do now is complain . ""

"" Are you telling me that I don ’ t have any choice in this matter ? ""

"" You just said so yourself ! It seems like nothing has changed for a long time . ""

"" So what else am I supposed to do but complain ? ""

"" It ’ s the only thing left to do . ""

"" Well, I can at least try to avoid the taxes and the insurance as much as possible . ""

"" The government is already planning on that . They want everyone to be prepared . ""

"" So they expect me to change my life ? ""

"" No . Not exactly . But it would be wise to begin saving money because you might lose your job in the near future . ""

"" How can I do that ? ""

"" It ’ s easy . Just buy less food and clothes . You could also stay home on vacation next summer . ""

"" Are you crazy ? There are no more jobs ! Everyone is getting laid off nowadays. And there won ’ t be any place to go next year either because the government is going to close all those resorts. So it doesn ’ t matter where I spend my vacation ; it will just cost too much money . ""

"" But what about your car ? You don ’ t need to drive every day ! ""

"" And why not ? It seems like everyone else does the same thing . If anything, it would be more expensive for me if I stopped driving all of a sudden. At least that way my insurance wouldn ’ t increase anymore. ""

"" That doesn ’ t make much sense . The government is putting up the price of gas and diesel fuel to encourage people like you not to drive as often . ""

"" It won ’ t work ! There are more cars than ever on the road today . ""

"" You think that there will be a lot fewer cars next year ? ""

"" No one can tell yet how many people will keep their jobs . ""

"" But I thought they were going to put up taxes in order not to lose too much money when everything gets worse . ""

"" You know what , it doesn ’ t matter anymore ! At this point, no one knows anything for sure . ""

"" There ’ s something you could do if the price of gas and diesel fuel continues to go up ; that is, start walking more often instead of driving . ""

"" I have already started doing that . But it won ’ t be enough to make a difference. And it takes longer than just getting on my bicycle because I can only ride so far in one day and if I walk too much , then it gets really hot outside . ""

"" You know what ? Maybe you should just give up your car altogether ! ""

"" What are you saying ? ""

"" The government is putting up taxes on cars like yours because they want people to buy smaller and less expensive models. If everyone starts buying cheaper cars, then maybe the price of gas won ’ t increase anymore . ""

"" But there aren ’ t any other cars available ! Everything costs a lot more these days too . And I already told you that it doesn ’ t matter what kind of car we buy because all prices are going up anyway . ""

"" How can that be ? You said the government was putting up taxes . If anything, they should lower them instead . ""

"" They did ! But now they have to collect more money from us because there isn ’ t enough revenue coming in anymore. So I guess we are all going to pay even more taxes this year than last year . ""

"" Well , it looks like I won ’ t be buying anything new until things improve again . ""

"" They probably never will . If you ask me, they already tried everything ! ""

"" That can ’ t be true ! There must still be some hope left for us . ""

"" No ! It doesn ’ t make any sense anymore. I mean , we have been paying more taxes every year for as long as I can remember but nothing seems to change . ""

"" Why don ’ t you just try and do what the government wants ? ""

"" They can tell us all they want, it doesn ’ t matter because we are still going to do whatever we want no matter how much money they take away from us. That ’ s why there won ’ t be any difference in this country anymore . It will just keep getting worse and worse until everyone is broke ! ""

"" You don ’ t really believe that , do you ? ""

"" I know what I ’ m saying . If things continue like they have been for a long time, then we will soon live in poverty here. And then it doesn ’ t matter anymore whether or not people keep their jobs because no one has any money left to spend . So if everyone continues working at home and not going anywhere , that means there won ’ t be enough revenue coming in from the taxes anyway . ""

"" Well , I don ’ t know about you but I am already getting tired of all this negative thinking ! It doesn ’ t help anybody when we just keep talking like this . We need to find a way out of this situation before everything gets worse and there are no jobs left anymore ! ""

"" Yeah . Maybe someone will come up with an idea that actually works ? I don ’ t think so though , because it seems like everyone is just giving up on trying anything new right now . It seems as if people are too afraid to try something different these days . They would rather sit around waiting for things to get better instead of taking action themselves ! ""

"" You know what ? Maybe we should just forget about everything for a while and take it easy until next year when everything has been sorted out again . I guess that way we won ’ t have any problems anymore . ""

"" And if that happens , then the government will come up with another plan in order to make us pay more taxes again ! So it doesn ’ t matter what anyone says or does nowadays because there is nothing we can do about this situation anyway ! ""

"" Well, at least you don ’ t have any reason not to stop complaining anymore . It won ’ t make a difference if people continue to complain like that because they still won ’ t be able to change anything even if they wanted to . ""

"" Yeah , I know what you mean ! ""

"" So why are we talking about all this stuff ? You already told me that no one is going to stop complaining in the future either. And there isn ’ t anything else we can do about our situation anyway so why don ’ t we just go home now and relax until everything has been sorted out again next year ? ""

"" I guess you are right . We should just forget all this for a while because it doesn ’ t really matter anymore ! ""

"" Yeah , but we still need to get something to eat before going home. At least then we won ’ t have anything to worry about until tomorrow morning . ""

"" That sounds good ! ""

"" Well, I guess you are right . It is time for us to go and spend the rest of today together at my place so we can forget about everything else again . ""

"" Yeah , but don ’ t forget that I still have a lot of homework left over from school tomorrow afternoon though ! So if you want me to do it with you, then we should get started right away ! ""

"" OK , just give me a little bit more time before starting our homework because my family wants us to spend some time together tonight after dinner . ""

"" Yeah , but don ’ t forget that I still have some other stuff left over from work too. So if you want me to do it with you, then we should start working on that as soon as possible ! ""

"" OK , just give me a little bit more time before starting our homework because my family wants us to spend some time together tonight after dinner . ""

"" Yeah , but don ’ t forget that I still have some other stuff left over from work too. So if you want me to do it with you"

Comment: You are not missing any information, but this is just a sentence fragment. The OP asked for a complete sentence, and there isn't one here.

Answer: I think you have misunderstood the problem.  This phrase is not incorrect; it is simply incomplete.

The ""sentence"" is missing an object (usually understood) after the verb in the main clause (""it \em{better} not"") and a complement of the preposition (""for""), both of which would come before the closing parenthesis, thus:

\begin{blockquote}
""I have a complaint to make. The bill you sent me was incorrect (what's more). It's not the first time. What's more, it isn't the first time.""

""Well, I must apologize, madam. We have new computers here, you know.""

""Don't you think it's about time you got them working properly?""

""I agree entirely.  I assure you, it won't happen again.""

""It better not!"" (here)

""The next time will be the last.""
\end{blockquote}

Answer: This sentence is correct as it is but a bit informal and incomplete. Incomplete because of missing the closing parenthesis `).`

Informal because you can use that kind of sentences in writing letters or even to speak with friends, relatives or neighbors (depending on the context)"
llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,54,llama-2-7b@q8_0_54.txt,"The man sighed . He didn't sound very happy about it .

The boy wandered off towards the entrance to the cave. He was getting more and more irritated by his situation as he thought of what a fool he had been not to try to get away. Now he would probably never make it out alive. He stumbled on an uneven patch of rock, fell, and began to roll down into a dark crevice that seemed to have opened underneath him.

He screamed in terror as he was sucked into the blackness, but then all at once his body shot upward out of the pit and he tumbled onto soft ground. He sat there for a moment gasping for breath. The air felt cooler here, too, and it seemed to be coming from the direction that the cave had pointed before they left.

""I'm in another cave,"" the boy realized. ""It must go underneath this one.""

He looked around him curiously. He was sitting on soft grass under a spreading tree whose roots extended out into the ground like the tentacles of an octopus. There were other trees here, too. But there weren't any bushes or flowers, just tall stalks of green that he guessed must be some kind of grass.

A few feet away was another cave opening. This one had a doorway with a wooden frame and glass panels that allowed in light from outside. There were no steps leading down to the entrance so it looked like people came here from the level above this one, not by entering from below. The boy guessed they probably used a staircase or an elevator of some kind.

He stood up and walked over to the doorway. He pushed on it gingerly with his hand but it was locked. ""They must have left me here so I could die,"" he thought.
""I should go back into the cave, though . Maybe that way they can't find my body.""

He started towards the entrance to the cave and then stopped. He had been right about there being a staircase somewhere down in this part of the underground cavern. There was one now, just below him at the end of the cave where he had fallen into it. It looked as if the steps had been made from boulders that had been cut in half and then put back together so they could be used like regular stairs. The boy knew this because there were marks on each rock where a hammer or axe had hit them, shaping them to make them fit neatly next to each other.

He decided he would go down into the cave again. He wondered what it was that the man had said before they left. _I have no time for games now ._ If he could understand the language the man and woman had spoken, perhaps there were other words in this strange place that he might be able to figure out as well.

He walked over to the entrance to the cave and then stopped again. There was something else underneath him that the man with the gun had said before they left. The boy sat down on a rock by the cave opening and thought about it for a long time.

""It can't be true,"" he finally told himself as tears ran down his face. ""I can't believe something like this could happen to me!""

The man had said, _""You will not live through what is coming.""_ And now the boy realized that this was exactly what the man must have meant . He knew it would be easy for him to fall asleep and just lie there on the rock until he died.

But that wasn't how things worked in his world, where people awoke with each new day. Here, in this strange place, it seemed like death was waiting around every corner.

The boy closed his eyes. He thought of the strange room at the end of the corridor he had first seen after leaving his own world behind. He remembered how dark and cold it felt when he had walked through that doorway and stepped into its gloom . And now, as if to complete the circle of his life, he was once again alone in a room with no light, no warmth, no one to help him.

He heard a strange sound outside the cave opening. He looked up just in time to see what seemed like an entire flock of birds swooping downward out of the sky and heading straight for him! Their sharp beaks were open wide, ready to peck at his face or grab him with their powerful talons and carry him away somewhere he never wanted to go.

""No!"" he screamed as he threw himself backwards onto the rock behind him where he had been sitting a few moments before. The birds roared past overhead and disappeared into the darkness above the cave entrance, but now it was too late. He could no longer get up from the ground. His legs were numb. They refused to respond.

The boy realized with horror that the same thing had happened when he'd fallen down the crevice in the first place. This time there was something holding him in place, something heavy and strong and evil.

He looked around in fear as he saw a group of people approaching from behind. They were all dressed in strange clothing with long robes that flowed over their heads like capes or mantles. He could see the outline of weapons on their hips but they didn't seem to have any guns or knives with them, at least not that he could tell from where he was sitting.

They were moving slowly towards him, all staring downwards toward the ground as if they hadn't realized he had been there until now . He struggled against his invisible bonds but it did no good . They held him tightly and he couldn't break free.

The leader of the group was an old man with a long white beard that looked like it was made out of cotton . The man walked slowly over to where the boy sat on the rock, looking down at him in amazement as if seeing something he had never expected to see before.

""He is sleeping,"" the old man said to his companions who were following behind him with their eyes wide open and staring intently into space. They didn't seem able to focus on anything else, even though they had been walking around all day without stopping once since leaving the house where they lived in another part of this strange place called Earth.

The boy heard one of them gasp as if he had just seen something so frightening that he couldn't believe it was real . But then another voice spoke up from behind him saying, ""Let me have a look at him."" A young man with black hair and dark eyes moved forward until he stood directly in front of the boy.

He reached out to touch his face, but before he did so the boy screamed as loudly as he could . The sudden noise seemed to wake him from a deep sleep. He opened his eyes wide and looked around fearfully at all these strange faces staring down upon him with such hatred in their eyes!

It was then that he saw it--a long black snake, curled up on the ground right next to where he had been sitting only moments before. The boy screamed again as loudly as possible but no one seemed to hear him over all the shouting and crying going on around him now that everyone knew they were in trouble!

The old man who was leading this group of people walked up behind him with an angry look upon his face . He took out a knife from inside his robe and held it high above where the boy's head had been resting just seconds before, preparing to strike downward towards him!

""No!"" The cry came from somewhere deep within himself--a voice so desperate that even those who were closest heard him. ""Don't kill me! I don't understand what has happened here but please believe me when I tell you that this is not my fault!""

The old man stared down at the boy with eyes full of rage and hatred before turning away towards where another group of people was standing . The boy watched as they all turned their backs to him, leaving only one person still looking directly into his face with a strange look on her face that seemed almost sad.

""You're not alone,"" she said quietly, ""and neither am I."" Then she disappeared into the darkness behind her without saying another word .

The boy stared at where she had been standing for what felt like hours before he finally closed his eyes again. It wasn't long after this that he heard footsteps approaching from somewhere else in the cave . They sounded like they belonged to someone who knew exactly where he was hiding and how best to get there.

The boy looked up just as a young man walked into view carrying what appeared to be an odd sort of sword on his back . It seemed much too small for any purpose other than stabbing people with its sharp point, but there were two long blades on either side that made it look more like some kind of dagger than anything else.

The boy tried to move away from where the young man was walking towards him, but he found himself unable to do so . The invisible force holding him in place grew stronger and tighter around his waist, making any attempt at movement futile as well.

""You're not alone,"" whispered a voice right next to his ear, ""and neither am I.""

The boy looked up at the sound of this voice . It seemed to be coming from"

# **Ella's Story** #
It was Friday night and Ella was ready to go out with her best friend, Linda, when she got an idea: instead of going to a bar or club, they could go to a fancy restaurant for dinner. After all, there were some things that only a fancy restaurant could give you; like a live pianist playing soft background music and candles on the table.
After they arrived at the restaurant, Linda said ""You look gorgeous tonight in your dress.""
""Thanks,"" Ella replied with her head held high. She had been working out at the gym for two months so she could be in shape before her date.
The waiter came to take their order and Linda ordered a steak and lobster while Ella ordered fish fillet. They each got a glass of white wine. The food arrived, but when it was time for dessert Linda had to go to the bathroom. When she returned they both went outside to smoke.
""Ella,"" Linda said between puffs of cigarette smoke, ""I have something to tell you.""
""Yes? What is it?"" Ella asked, wiping her mouth with a napkin.
""You know how I've always talked about finding someone special in my life? Well, I think I finally found him,"" Linda said as she leaned over to whisper the next sentence into Ella's ear so no one would hear them.
Ella was shocked! ""What do you mean?"" she asked, trying to act casual even though her heart skipped a beat. She wasn't expecting this news at all - in fact it came as a complete surprise.
""I think he'll make me very happy,"" Linda continued, ""and I hope we can be together for a long time.""
Ella was silent for a moment before finally asking: ""How do you know?"" She wanted to ask more questions but wasn't sure where to start or what would sound too personal. After all she didn't even know his name yet! But Linda had already opened up her heart so Ella figured now was as good a time as any for her own revelations - even if they were unexpected and came completely out of left field.
""Well,"" began Ella slowly, ""I met this man in the club last night."" She paused briefly before continuing: ""It was around midnight or so when I saw him coming toward me from across the room. He was tall with dark brown hair that hung down over his face and he had a beautiful smile on his lips . I knew right away that he would make an excellent husband for me someday.""
""Really?"" Linda asked, looking surprised by this turn of events. ""Did you talk to him at all? Is there any chance of us meeting again sometime soon?""
Ella shook her head no and then said: ""No one knows my name either - not even his!"" This time she was the one who paused for a moment before continuing: ""But I'm sure we will run into each other again soon. In fact, I hope so because it seems like there is something special between us already.""
Ella felt her heart start to beat faster as she imagined how happy they would be together - if only they knew each others true identities! She knew that was probably a long way off though, but she hoped someday the two of them could at least get close enough so that Ella could tell Linda all about him and introduce her to his family . And who knows? Maybe one day even more - like meeting his parents and going on vacation together. It sounded like a dream come true!

The above is a classic exchange between a husband and wife on New Years morning, with her nagging him to take down the Christmas decorations. They have had this debate every year since they first met! He hates it and wants it gone – she loves it and would like to keep it forever. The issue of decoration is a classic one in many marriages. Many people go out of their way to make sure that their home looks the best, with all sorts of beautiful furniture and accessories, but when Christmas comes along they bring out an old box of decorations which have been gathering dust for months or years – the tree may not even be in good condition as it may have been left standing throughout most of winter.

In this article, we will look at some of the key issues that arise with having decorations up during December and how they can affect you and your family. We will also look at the positives of keeping them up as long as possible. The following are the key topics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Christmas Decorations in the House - Keeping Them Up
\item Effects on Children
\item Impact on Relationships
\end{itemize}

The main reasons that people put up decorations is because they love to do it. However, they are often under pressure from their partners or family members who may feel the need to conform with society’s expectations of having a beautifully adorned home at Christmas time. Some parents also complain about their children nagging them for days on end until they put up the decorations and then when they have been taken down again, there is often a period of discontent from them as well.

\section{Christmas Decorations in the House - Keeping Them Up}

One of the most common arguments that couples have over Christmas decorations is whether or not to take them up at all and how long they should stay up for once they are up. There is no right answer to this question; it depends on what kind of couple you are. For some people, they feel very strongly about having their home decorated in a certain way throughout December as part of the Christmas experience but others do not care so much and will happily put them away for January when all the fun has gone out of things anyway.

\subsection{Advantages}

There are several advantages to keeping your house full of festive cheer during the holiday season, including:

* It creates a great atmosphere in your home which can make family and friends feel welcome

* It helps you get into the mood for Christmas when you first walk through the door after work on December 25th! This means that you do not have to spend all day thinking about what presents you should buy or whether or not you’ve done enough decorating – these thoughts will take care of themselves.
* It makes it easier for guests who may not know where things are kept during this time because everything is clearly labelled and in its proper place, making them feel more at home when they arrive on Christmas day (and every other day).

\subsection{Disadvantages}

The disadvantages of keeping your house full of decorations throughout December include:

* It can be expensive, especially if you have children who want to add their own touches to the decoration. This may lead them to break or ruin some items which could result in disappointment all round when they come home from school after playing with their new toys on Christmas day!

* There is no real end point for having so many things out as soon as they come into use because everything looks great when it’s first put up but after a few weeks this starts looking more and more tacky – unless you have an eye for interior design that is. If you do, then go right ahead; otherwise maybe consider taking some of the decorations away before New Year's Day!

\section{Effects on Children}

It can be hard to determine how much impact keeping your house full of Christmas decorations has on children and their behaviour. One of the most common complaints that parents have when it comes to Christmas is that they are constantly nagged by their kids about why there isn't enough decoration in their home or where all the presents went, etc. However, this may not necessarily be true – for example: if you were thinking about taking down your tree earlier than usual because of some other reason then maybe this might affect them too.

\subsection{Advantages}

The advantages of having Christmas decorations up during December include:

* It gives children the opportunity to get involved with their families, which is often something that they want but cannot do when everything gets taken away after just one day! This can be especially helpful if your child has special needs or any type of disability.

* They have something interesting happening around them all year round which helps keep them interested in what’s going on at school instead of just waiting until summer holidays start so they don't know where else they should go when they get bored (and let's face it: everyone gets bored sometimes).
* They feel like part of something special because they helped make things look nice inside your home which makes them feel proud about themselves and what they can do.

\subsection{Disadvantages}

The disadvantages of having Christmas decorations up during December include:

* It’s expensive! If you have children who are always asking for new toys or accessories, then this could add up quickly so make sure that everything else stays put until after the holidays.
* They may get bored of seeing these same things over and over again throughout the year which means they won't be able to enjoy them fully when it comes time for Christmas dinner either (which is probably not what you want).

\section{Impact on Relationships}

It can be hard to determine how much impact having a festive period in your home has on relationships. If one partner is more into decorating and the other isn't, it may cause some tension as they both try to get their way; this could result in an argument that will need sorting out afterward (if possible). However, if there are no arguments at all then everything should go smoothly and without incident!

\subsection{Advantages}

The advantages of having Christmas decorations up during December include:

* It gives you something to look forward to each day which can help make the season more enjoyable for everyone involved, including children if they’re included in this process too (which would be ideal).

\subsection{Disadvantages}

The disadvantages of having Christmas decorations up during December include:

* It costs money! If you are not careful then your budget may soon run out and before long it will be time for New Year's Eve again...

* They can be quite stressful sometimes, especially if they aren't put away properly when they’re no longer needed. This could lead to arguments between people who should know better than to leave things lying around like this but don’t care enough about each other or themselves not to do it anyway (which sounds a little bit harsh).

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion, there are many pros and cons when it comes to having Christmas decorations up during December. On one hand, they can make the holiday season more enjoyable for everyone involved by giving you something to look forward to each day; on the other hand though, they cost money which could otherwise be spent elsewhere or they may end up becoming stressful if they’re not put away properly when no longer needed (which sounds a little bit harsh). It’s really up to each family member whether these advantages outweigh any potential disadvantages though because everyone's priorities are different.

\chapter{The Pros and Cons of Christmas Decorations}

The holidays are fast approaching, and as families get ready for the festive season, they may be wondering if it’s time to take down their Christmas decorations. The answer is a resounding yes! If you want your home or business to look its best during this special time of year then you need some good old-fashioned holiday cheer in your life too.

\section{The Pros of Christmas Decorations}

There are many benefits that come with decorating for the holidays including:

* It makes your home or business look festive and welcoming, which can attract more customers if you’re a retailer or get guests excited about coming over if they know it will be fun and light-hearted (even if everyone is tired from all their shopping).

\subsection{The Cons of Christmas Decorations}

There are also some negatives to consider when decorating for the holidays:

* It can be expensive, especially if you’re planning on getting something new each year.

* You may have to put up with people who don’t like your style or taste and will complain about how tacky everything is – but hey! That’s what friends are for right?

\section{Tips for Decorating Your Home}

If you decide

"" Well, that’s why we keep the lights on it all the time — so he can see where he is . ""

"" Maybe it would be a better idea to buy another tree ? I know a lot of people who still have their trees up right now . ""

"" But we already put away our presents , and we don ’ t need an extra tree for decorating anyway . ""

"" I just hate throwing things away , especially when they still have so much use left in them ! ""

"" It looks like a lot of people around here are keeping their Christmas trees up all the way to Valentine ’ s Day . ""

"" So what ? We don ’ t need a tree for every holiday — and I think it looks nice this late . ""

"" But we don ’ t have any lights on it , and the branches look bare ! It just looks sad without any decorations at all. ""

"" Well, maybe you can find some new ornaments somewhere ? They can always be used again next year . ""

"" I think you should take the tree down now before we lose more needles from it . We don ’ t want to wake up one morning and realize we have an empty corner of our living room ! ""

"" It ’ s just not fair that Christmas is over already ! Everyone else gets to keep their trees up until after New Year’s Day . ""

"" That ’ s because they put them out in April . ""

"" I can’t believe you actually want to leave the tree up all year long ! It seems like a waste of space, and it just looks so strange ! ""

"" But Christmas is my favorite holiday ! I don’t mind if our tree stays up until next December. ""

"" What about all that stuff we bought for you this year ? You’re not going to keep putting it under the tree , are you ? ""

"" Why not? It ’ s a beautiful piece of furniture . ""

"" But what will your friends think if they come over and see that huge pile of presents beneath your Christmas tree ? They won’t know where to look ! ""

"" That’s all right. I’m sure it’ll be fine. ""

"" But you know how many other people have been coming around looking for some place to put their extra gifts ? It’s crazy! People will stop bringing things here if we keep the tree up until next year ! ""

"" Well, at least they can still give me my presents . I think it would be a shame to throw out all those beautiful gifts just because someone forgot to take down their Christmas decorations. ""

""I’d really hate to see the tree go , too, but we have a lot of other things that need to be put away first — and you know how much I don ’ t like to do that . Besides , now it doesn’t even look very good anymore ! The lights are all burned out , and there aren ’ t any presents underneath. ""

"" I think the tree looks nice without the presents underneath, if we just keep some of the ornaments on it for a while longer . ""

"" But they need to be stored properly before we get them mixed up with all our other Christmas decorations ! You know how hard it is to find any of those old things when you want them . Besides, I think it looks better without any ornaments underneath — it just seems more natural that way. ""

"" Well , if you say so . ""

"" And we really need to get ready for New Year ’ s Eve ! It ’ ll be here before we know it . ""

"" I don’t like going out on New Year ’ s Eve — especially when it ’ s snowing. ""

"" But I thought you liked snow ? What are you scared of? It’s not as if we ’ re going to drive in the storm, or anything ! Besides , with all that new snow outside , maybe we could make some pretty good snowmen for Christmas this year ! ""

"" Maybe . ""

"" And once they ’ re finished , I think it would be nice to leave them up until after New Year ’ s Day — don ’ t you ? ""

"" Maybe . ""

"" But they wouldn’t look very good under the tree all by themselves . Besides , we ’ ll have to keep our old Christmas lights on so that people can see where they are ! It seems like a waste of electricity just to leave them on in the middle of winter. ""

"" I think it would be nice if we kept some decorations up until Valentine ’ s Day . Maybe we could make some new ones for next year , too ? That way, we wouldn’t have to throw any of this stuff away . ""

"" But that ’ d still take a lot of space ! It doesn’t make much sense to keep all this stuff around just because there isn ’ t enough room in the attic. And it seems like such a waste to buy new things every year, when we already have so many old ones lying around. ""

"" I think you should take the tree down now — before more people start coming over and asking why it ’ s still up . ""

"" But it doesn’t look that bad , does it ? And you know how much time I put into decorating this year ! It would be a shame to waste all my hard work like that ! ""

"" If everyone else is keeping their trees until next December, why shouldn ’ t we do the same thing? We don ’ t have enough space in our house as it is. ""

"" I think you should take the tree down now before someone gets hurt walking on top of the branches . They might not even be able to see where they are going when it starts snowing ! And what if some of those needles fall off and get lost under the blankets ? It would be terrible if one of your friends found them there after we ’ ve been sleeping in that bed for a while! ""

"" I think you should take the tree down now before someone else gets hurt walking on top of it ! They might not even be able to see where they are going when it starts snowing !

"" But I don’t want to take it down yet ! If we leave it up until after New Years , the decorations will still be there . ""

"" Yeah , and then what ? Then when Christmas comes around again next year you say, “ Oh , no ! We can ’ t put that up now because it ’ s been here so long ! ” You have to start putting things away when they get old and broken ; otherwise you won ’ t be able to put anything away at all . ""

"" Yeah , but the Christmas decorations are different from other stuff . I mean, we never throw them out after one year . We use the same stuff over and over again ! ""

"" But if we start leaving things up too long, they ’ ll get old before you know it - - then what ? You can’t put something away when it gets old ; you have to put it away when it is still new . If we start saving things for next year , that means they will never be new again . ""

"" Yeah , but the tree and everything else was so much fun this year . I don ’ t want to give it up already ! It seems like such a shame ! ""

"" Maybe you should come over here . See what kind of things are falling apart around me ? I ’ d say that’s a good example of leaving things too long ! ""

"" Yeah , but at least yours aren ’ t decorations. Besides, the only thing falling apart on your side is that old chair ! You need to get rid of that too . ""

"" It ’ s not falling apart ! It just needs a little work . ""

"" But it’s falling apart! All you have to do is take out one or two screws and pull off the seat cover ! I can fix it for you if you want. You don ’ t even have to bother taking it home . ""

"" Really ? Thanks , but no thanks . ""

"" Okay, then . ""

"" I guess I should get going ; my wife wants me to take down the tree and put it in the trash can . I told her we could save it for next year if you want . ""

"" Yeah , yeah ! That ’ s what I said too ! ""

"" Well ? Is she still angry about the whole thing or are you ready to give up now? ""

"" She ’ ll never give up on anything ! But if she doesn’t want it , then we don ’ t have any choice . """

- What did you like best in it?
- The scene when the heroine was fighting with her enemy. She seemed so strong and brave then!

- Did you think that she would win the fight?
- I don't know. I think she has a chance. If she continues to fight bravely, she will surely win.

- You have been late for work again. What made you so careless this morning?
- Sorry, sir! There was a traffic jam on the way to the office and I couldn't get in. I tried to find another route but there were so many cars waiting at every corner that it took me an hour.

- Well, we can't expect you to be always late for work because of traffic jams. Next time you have such a problem, come here and talk with me first. We will try to solve the problem together!

# 03

- What do you think about people who live in small towns?
- Well, I think they are very happy. They don't worry much because their lives are simple. But I am sure that those people living in big cities have more advantages.

- How could that be?
- You know, if a person lives in a big city, he or she can choose the most suitable job for himself/herself. He/she has many opportunities to meet and learn from talented people. It is easy to start your own business and expand it because there are more customers living in such an area.

- I see. Thank you!"

"" I'll leave that up to the accounting department and if they want any suggestions for drinks, I have some ideas to share . ""

"" Great ! Well , how do you want the guests to know when it is time for the party ? ""

"" We could use a big announcement or maybe send out an email blast . ""

"" That sounds like a plan. ""

"" I'll have our HR department reach out and get some input from them too . ""

"" I guess so too, since you are from china. OK , next , what about drinks . Do you want something light and refreshing like champagne , beer or wine? Or do you want a sweet dessert ?""

"" Beer is good.""

"" Beer it is then ! ""

"" You are right about it . The next question is on decoration . What kind of decorations do you like ? ""

"" How about balloons and streamers ? ""

"" Perfect choice , the only thing left to decide is the time . We have two options 8 PM or 9:30 PM. Which one would suit you better ? ""

"" I think we should start at 8 Pm . ""

"" Fine ! This was a team exercise and everyone who participated got a prize. Teamwork is important in any company . Doing things together , working together always pays off ! Now let me see the list of winners . """

"" Thank you for your compliment. ""

"" Don't mention it . ""

"" That means, 'you are welcome'. ""

"" Do you know how to write Chinese ? ""

"" I can write but I can not read it . ""

"" You are very good at English. ""

"" You flatter me ! ""

"" It is a compliment . ""

"" I hope you don't think of me as being rude . ""

"" Not at all , why do you say that ? ""

"" I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression . ""

"" How can you possibly give someone the wrong impression ? ""

"" It is very simple, it means I don't like them . ""

"" Can I tell him how beautiful he is ? ""

"" Yes , but I wouldn't say that to a complete stranger . ""

"" A month or so now . ""

"" What do you think of it here? ""

"" Oh , I like it very much . ""

"" You speak English just as well as an American. ""

"" I'm glad you don't think me a foreigner because I have been in this country for many years ! ""

"" Oh , no ! ""

"" How long will you stay here? ""

"" We shall leave shortly after Christmas . ""

"" Where are you going next ? ""

"" I don't know yet . ""

"" Oh, you have a secret plan. ""

"" Yes , she is here at home . ""

"" Do you like it here ? ""

"" Yes ! It's a beautiful country . ""

"" What do you think of the people ? ""

"" They are very nice. ""

"" I heard that most Americans don 't speak English well. Is this true ? ""

"" Well , not all Americans learn to speak it in college . ""

"" But they must learn it some time. ""

"" Yes . Most people learn when they go to school and when they are young . ""

"" I learned when I was very young. My parents taught me at home. ""

"" What about you ? Did your parents teach you English? ""

"" No , they didn 't . My father is from Japan and my mother is from Taiwan . They don't speak any English. But they bought me an English book when I was a child and that helped me learn to speak the language. ""

"" So you learned before going to college ? ""

"" Yes , but in high school I began to study very hard so I could pass my English examination . ""

"" That 's good, Brian! You can pass an American examination for English ! Now let me ask you a question. Are there any foreign students here at the University of Maryland ? ""

"" Yes , there are. There is one from Japan and another from Korea and still another from India . They all speak very well too. I 've been to their homes and they also studied hard in college so they could pass their English exams and come here to study. ""

"" How do you think foreign students feel when they come to the United States ? ""

"" Sometimes they miss home very much . But as time goes by, most of them forget all about their homes and begin to like America. ""

"" That 's good ! I hope so. Now let me ask you a question. How many foreign students are there in this school? ""

"" There are over 10,000 . This is one of the largest Universities in the country with people from all parts of the world. ""

"" Do you think it's better to study abroad or at home ? ""

"" That depends on each person. I like studying here because there are many opportunities for foreign students to meet and mix with Americans. But if you want to learn a language, then I think you should study in your own country where you will have more opportunities to use it. ""

"" No , it is my first time . ""

"" Where are you going next ? ""

"" Las Vegas . ""

"" Do you have a good trip so far ? ""

"" It has been very good. We just arrived last night and we are already on our way to the next stop . ""

"" What part of Japan did your wife live in? ""

"" She is from Tokyo . ""

"" Oh, I was just there last month . Is it nice ? ""

"" Yes , very much so. We also went to Kyoto and Osaka . ""

"" How many days were you in each place ? ""

"" Three days in Tokyo . 3 days in Kyoto , 2 days in Osaka . ""

"" I saw a Japanese movie once. It was about samurai, warriors who fought on horseback. What do you think of that? ""

"" That is correct, sir. They were called "" samurais "" or "" bushi "". There were many famous stories told about them and even today they are still very popular in Japan . You can read books about them as well as watch movies. I believe there will be another movie about samurai coming out next year. It is called "" The Last Samurai"" . 

"" Oh , really? Can you tell me anything about it ? ""

"" Yes, it is a story that takes place in the last days of feudal Japan . The main character, a white American soldier who was stationed in Japan, becomes a samurai to protect his Japanese wife and her family. The movie will be produced by Tom Cruise , so I guess it should be pretty interesting.""

"" I bet you have seen many Japanese movies or TV programs about samurais. What do you think of the way they dress? Do they really wear such heavy armor? ""

"" It depends on which part of Japan the story is set in. If the story takes place in Kyoto , for example, they would not wear as much armor because it was a relatively peaceful time there. But if the story takes place during a war, then yes, they did wear heavy armor and had very big swords. The sword that they use is called a "" katana "". It is a Japanese sword. I think you have also seen pictures of samurais carrying long spears. They call them "" naginata "". In the movies you see many scenes where the warriors are fighting on horseback. They are very famous, because the horses were beautifully trained to fight in battles. One last thing , Japanese people think that samurai is a bad guy .""

"" Why?  ""

"" I don't know why they think this way, but that's how it is. Samurais are considered good guys because they protected their families and loved their country. But when the Japanese lost in WWII , many people were afraid to mention the word ' samurai '. It has a negative image . ""

"" I see . Do you think this new movie will help change that ? ""

"" Yes, maybe so . In America , there was once a popular TV show called "" The Lone Ranger "". He was always trying to save innocent people in trouble. This is similar to the samurais protecting their families and loved ones.""

"" What do you think about that?  ""

"" That's OK, sir . But I can tell you this: we are not going to see any samurai fighting on horseback ! They will probably only use swords or long spears. The horses would be too expensive and there is no place to train them for battles.""

"" Oh , really? Are there still many warriors in Japan now ? ""

"" No, sir . I think the last samurai died around 1950 when the American occupation army was still here. At that time, Japanese people were afraid of samurais and did not want to talk about them. That's why they made the decision to stop using swords . It would have been hard to change their minds once warriors started appearing on TV again .""

"" How long ago did you arrive in America? ""

"" 1985, sir. I came from Tokyo , Japan.""

""I see. How is your English now? Are you able to read English books and newspapers? ""

"" Yes, I can do that . But it depends on what the story is about, because if the book or newspaper article is too difficult for me to understand then I can't understand much of it.""

"" How long did you study English in college ?  ""

"" I studied for 4 years at Tokyo University . After graduation I became a translator and now I work part time at an electronics store. I enjoy speaking with people who come into the store.""

""Do you like to talk to visitors from other countries? ""

"" Yes, sir , but not all of them can understand Japanese very well because they are not used to it yet . It's a challenge for me to speak English and help them in some way. But I enjoy it too because when we communicate with each other, our knowledge increases.""

""How do you feel about America?  ""

""I like it here. The people are friendly and they make good things. American products are better than Japanese ones so Americans can get more money for what they make . ""

""Do you have a favorite American TV show ? ""

""Yes , I like the 'Star Trek' series very much . It was made in America but it shows how life is on another planet called ' Earth '. I think everyone should learn about other countries because we live together here on this earth . If people understand each other then there will be no war. ""

""What do you know about World War II ?  ""

""I remember that the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor in Hawaii . Then America fought with Japan until they surrendered to us.""

""How did Japan win the war? What weapons did they use?""

""Japan used a special weapon called the ' kamikaze '. This was an airplane flown by young men who wanted to die for their country. The plane would crash into an enemy ship and explode . It was very effective in stopping American ships from getting supplies during wartime.""

""What do you think of the Japanese food? Is it different than what Americans eat?""

""Yes, sir . There are many things that I like about Japanese cooking. But sometimes when they add too much salt or soy sauce , then it tastes bad to me because my stomach gets sick from eating them.""

"" How is your wife doing in Japan ?  ""

""She is fine . She has been learning English for a long time and I think she will be able to speak better soon. I am very proud of her.""

""What kind of things do you like about America? ""

""I enjoy meeting new people because they have different ideas than what we do in Japan.""

""Have you ever been outside your home country ?  ""

"" Yes, sir . I went to Mexico when I was in college and I had a great time there. They are very nice people so it was easy for me to make friends with them.""

""What do you think of the weather here? Is it different than what you're used to?""

""Yes, sir . I like summer because it is warm outside but winter can be very cold if we don't have enough clothes on or heat inside our house. But even though we have some problems with cold weather , it's still better here than in Tokyo where they have snow every year.""

""How did you get your American citizenship?  ""

""I married an American woman and she helped me to become a citizen because I am not from this country originally so I had to apply for it myself. Now that I have my passport , I can go wherever I want whenever I want . It's nice being able to travel around America without any problems.""

""How long did it take you to learn English?  ""

""It took me about 6 years but now I am speaking pretty well because I studied at college for two more years before coming here. That helped a lot with my pronunciation and vocabulary skills . But even though I can understand most things people say, sometimes they talk so fast that it's hard for me to catch what they are saying.""

""What do you like about being in America?  ""

""I like the freedom here. There aren't any restrictions on what we can or cannot do . You can walk around anywhere at night without worrying about getting attacked by someone who might want your money. The government doesn't try to control everything either.""

""What did you study in college?  ""

""I studied business management at a university and then I got a job with an electronics company after graduation because my degree was good for that kind of work . Now I am working part time here while also studying English online so that way I can improve my vocabulary skills.""

"" No . My parents used to live in New York. They moved back when my dad was offered a good job, and I decided that I wanted to come out here for a change. The U S is very different from Japan.""

""I guess I'll need to study some more English."""

I was given some towels , a hair cap and a comb . Then my head was wrapped in an elastic bandage . My eyes were covered with black cloth so that I couldn’t see anything clearly. My ears were blocked up by cotton wads so that I could not hear what was going on around me.

Then I felt myself falling asleep . When I regained consciousness , my hair was wet and dripping down my face . It was a cold perm . The temperature was 38 degrees Celsius for fifteen minutes . Then I had to wait a while before getting another cold perm . After the second one , it was time to get warm curls . That felt like burning .

After the whole process of hair styling , my head hurt so badly . It took me two days to recover from that painful experience .

"" So how did you feel after having your first perm ? "" asked the doctor in his office . I told him what kind of perms I had and how I felt about them .

"" Did they make you look older than you are now , or younger ? "" he asked me."

"" So do you think they exist ? ""

"" They probably do , but you don't need them to prove anything . ""

"" Do you want me to believe in UFOs ? ""

"" What is the point ? Belief is a bad thing , I know it from my past experiences, and I can assure you that there are many other things that will cause problems for us if we don't try to understand them . ""

"" You mean like religion ? ""

"" Yes , but only an idiot would call UFOs a religion ! They exist just as the moon exists . ""

"" But what do they want from us ? ""

"" It's too early to say that, and I can't tell you anything about it . ""

"" What if they come back ? ""

"" Do you think we should expect them to come again ? ""

"" Of course ! They might be our ancestors or the people who will come after us . ""

"" That is not what I meant , but now that you mentioned it, there are many things in this universe that need to be discovered . ""

"" That's a mystery . Why do they come to Earth ? ""

"" Maybe yes, maybe not . There are too many mysteries for me to think about . But it is a great story ! ""

"" Well , I never really saw their face . They are small and green-skinned with big red eyes . And their ears are quite large as well . ""

"" That sounds awful . Have they done any harm to the people on Earth ? ""

"" No, they never did . ""

"" Is there anything you want me to tell about them ? ""

"" Just that they live in the house next door . ""

"" You can not understand each other ? ""

"" Yes and no ! We understand each other , but they don't understand us . They need my help because they have problems with our Earth . ""

"" What kind of problems ? ""

"" They are too sensitive to the sunlight , so they spend most of their time underground . But they like to go out on nights when it is cloudy and raining . ""

"" That means that they can not work or live during daytime in our Earth ? ""

"" It's difficult for them because the sunlight hurts their skin . They don't have any protection against it . ""

"" So , do you want to help them with something ? What do you think we should do to make a better life for these aliens ? ""

"" Well ... I think that we should build a tunnel underground from the ground of our Earth to their world . That way they can work and live on the surface without being hurt by the sunlight . ""

"" But there are a lot of people here who will disagree with your idea . ""

"" What do you mean ? They would be happy for the aliens . ""

llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,42,llama-2-7b@q8_0_42.txt,""" Then why did you ask me to wait for him here ? ""

"" That’s another thing . You know , we always say that our brother should be with us in happiness and in adversity . ""

"" Yes, I do know what it means , but I think the thing has been already done . It is time for you to go home . ""

"" All right, I will wait a little longer . ""

At this moment a car drove up.

A man stepped out of the car and approached us .

"" May I come in ? "" he said .

"" Please do , sir . ""

The new comer was very tall with dark hair and a long beard that reached his waist. He seemed to be about fifty years old .

He walked slowly toward us and sat down on the chair beside my mother . I knew him immediately . It was the man who had helped me when I was lost in the street three days ago .

"" This is Mr. Ming, a new acquaintance of mine , "" said my mother .

Mr. Ming smiled at us and raised his hand to wave his greetings .

"" I am very glad that you can make it this afternoon . I have asked your sister to come home and she will be here in about two hours, "" he said with a smile .

I looked at my mother eagerly. But her expression was not happy at all. She did not even nod her head in answer .

Mr. Ming saw that there was something wrong.

"" What happened ? Did you have any trouble ? You don ’ t look well , "" he asked me in a kind voice .

I didn’t know what to say , so I shook my head and did not reply .

"" How long will your sister be away ? "" said Mr. Ming .

"" Not for more than two hours , "" replied my mother .

"" It ’ s too long, isn ’ t it ? You are getting tired of waiting here . We can go home now if you like . I ’ ll send someone to pick up your sister and she will come back with us in about an hour . ""

My mother shook her head again. Then she said that we would wait a little longer. It was too late for me to leave my mother alone. So we stayed there waiting for some time .

But I couldn ’ t keep still any more and asked Mr. Ming if he could tell us what had happened in the past two hours .

"" I will tell you , "" said Mr. Ming with a smile . "" Your father is very busy today . He has been looking for you since morning . ""

I was very surprised .

"" How ? What does he want me for ? "" asked I .

Mr. Ming looked at my mother and smiled again . Then he said that my father wanted me to come home because there would be a big party in the evening.

"" Why didn ’ t you tell him where I was going , or what happened this afternoon ? "" I asked angrily .

"" Your father thinks your brother has been with you since morning and therefore he is not worried about you . He thought that if I had seen you, I should have told him already . "" replied my mother . She didn ’ t know how to answer me.

I knew that I was wrong for being angry at them . After all, it was their first time of having such a trouble and they had done the best they could do in order to find me out . But still I couldn ’ t help feeling annoyed with them because of my father’s carelessness.

I was just about to apologize when another car drove up and stopped beside us. A woman got down from it and came toward us . She looked like a lady, but her face was wrinkled . When she stepped on the ground, I felt as if there were stones under my feet . The wrinkles seemed to cover all over her face and made it look very ugly .

Mr. Ming got up from his chair and went toward them with a smile.

"" Come here , "" said Mr. Ming cheerfully .

The lady bowed slightly at him when she came near him, but there was no smile on her face at all. She just looked at us in silence .

Mr. Ming introduced us to her as my grandmother and we also did the same to her. Then Mr. Ming asked me if I were very tired after being lost for so long time. But I didn ’ t answer him . Instead, I turned around and went to sit by my mother on a chair behind me.

"" Grandma ! "" called out Mr. Ming in surprise. He couldn ’ t believe his eyes . Then he laughed .

"" Now you are ready for dinner , "" said the old woman coldly without looking at him, but she had a smile on her face .

Mr. Ming looked puzzled and turned to me with an apologetic look on his face. He told my mother that it was not the time for us to leave yet and they should wait here until my sister came back. And then he would go away with them, but I must stay behind . My grandmother said nothing when Mr. Ming was talking to her ; she just looked at him coldly.

My mother nodded in agreement . Then we were all silent for a while. The sun had already set and the sky was getting darker . There weren ’ t many cars on the street now and the traffic was very quiet.

"" Is that my father ’ s car ? "" asked I suddenly, pointing to a car standing near us.

Mr. Ming looked at me with surprise . Then he nodded his head yes. My mother knew what had happened when she heard Mr. Ming answer me. She looked down and didn ’ t say anything for a long time .

At last I understood why my father was worried about me . He thought that something terrible might have happened to me, so that he did not come back home on the time which he said he would . But what made him worry more than usual ? The answer came soon after.

"" That ’ s it ! "" said Mr. Ming in a low voice. Then he turned toward my mother and said :

"" It ’ s true that your husband is not very happy about something today, isn’t it ? ""

I couldn ’ t help looking at him with surprise . He seemed to know everything that happened to me and had even guessed what had made my father worried. I felt as if I had been put on the wrong way of thinking all the time. I thought that Mr. Ming was an ordinary man who knew nothing about my family .

"" What makes him worry so much ? "" asked I.

Mr. Ming looked at me again with a smile and said :

"" You mean your mother doesn ’ t tell you about it yet , do you ? ""

I shook my head no in answer without saying anything more to him .

My mother stood up from her chair and came over toward us quickly . She was pale now and I could see that she had been crying. When she reached our side, she said that they must go home at once because it would soon get dark . Mr. Ming agreed with my mother’s suggestion and then he asked me to come back home with him so that my father wouldn ’ t worry too much about me.

My mother didn ’ t want us to stay there any longer, but she was still anxious for us to go home as soon as possible . So I walked with Mr. Ming toward a car standing beside the road while my mother went in the direction of her house together with my grandmother and left me behind by myself in this strange place where I didn ’ t know anybody at all .

"" Your father is waiting for you home, "" said Mr. Ming as we walked into his car .

I nodded to show that I understood what he had told me . Then he drove away quickly and soon reached my house which was only several blocks from here . My mother ran toward us when she saw the car coming closer and then embraced me with tears in her eyes . She kept apologizing for not telling me about all these things before because it would have been better if I had known about them myself instead of waiting alone by the road side.

But there wasn ’ t any time left for me to answer my mother’s questions and we went into our house together quickly in order not to be late for the party which was supposed to begin at seven o’clock . My grandmother said nothing when she saw us go in, but I could hear her crying softly from outside.

I didn ’ t have any chance to ask Mr. Ming about what he meant by saying that something terrible might happen to my father and therefore it made him worry more than usual . But it seemed as if he already knew what would happen later on that night when we went out for dinner .

We went upstairs directly after reaching home. My mother told me to take a bath while she was talking with Mr. Ming who had come along with us . He asked her about my father ’ s illness again and how much he suffered from it each day . But my mother just smiled without saying anything in response . She seemed to be very tired after the long time waiting for me at home .

"" Your sister should be here soon , "" said Mr. Ming in a low voice as we went into our bedroom"
llama-2-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,56,llama-2-7b@q8_0_56.txt,"""The instructor does not give good explanations "".

"" I don't know why but I just do not get this concept. ""

""This is an easy subject for me ,but my scores are low because of the exam questions"".

All these statements indicate that there is a discrepancy between the student's expectations and his/her performance . The cause could be one or more of the following reasons.
1) The student was not prepared properly before the class 
2) The material covered in the course was too abstract to understand.
3) The instructor did not explain the material well enough .
4) The exam questions were different from what was taught.
5) The student had some other commitment during the time of the class that could be a reason for low performance in exams.
6) The material may have been too easy and the student just wasted his/her time by attending these classes .

These are common scenarios. They happen everyday and we do not get to find out what is causing this discrepancy . We cannot pinpoint a reason for each occurrence of such a scenario as it could be due to any of the above reasons or more than one reason simultaneously.
The problem is that if we are unable to identify which one or more of these reasons is causing this discrepancy , we will not be able to improve the situation and students would continue having poor performance in the course .

This project aims at trying to find out which among these reasons cause this discrepancy using machine learning techniques. To do this, we collect data from various sources(quizzes, forum posts etc) during the semester and use supervised machine learning models to classify the different scenarios into the categories mentioned above.

## Project Goals

The following are the goals for this project: 
1) Identify which one or more of the reasons are responsible for low performance in a course
2) Use these identified reasons to improve the performance of students .
3) Find out if there are any common themes that have contributed towards low performance.

### Project Roadmap
1) Collecting Data : All data will be collected from various sources on campus(forums, quizzes etc.). 
2) Cleaning & pre-processing data: This includes removing irrelevant data and extracting features of interest from the textual data. The feature extraction step could include things like part-of-speech tagging , sentiment analysis , named entity recognition etc.
3) Feature Selection : After this step is done, we will be left with a huge dataset that would contain redundant information. We need to do some pruning of features to reduce the number of features. This could lead to loss of information in some cases as certain combinations of features may provide useful information. 
4) Choosing the learning model : The choice of supervised machine learning model for classification should depend on the nature of our data, the amount of data available , the time taken by each training iteration and many more factors . 
5) Training & testing : Now that we have collected data and extracted features , we need to train a classifier. A suitable algorithm that would suit the datasets must be chosen for this step. 
6) Improving performance of students: The classifier should now be used to identify the possible reasons for poor performance in the course . Based on these results, various interventions could be designed and implemented by instructors , departments or any other responsible person for improving the performance of the students.  
7) Reporting results : The project will report its findings at the end of semester to relevant stakeholders(faculty members and students). 
8) Future work: The project aims to expand this methodology to more courses and also use it for predicting grades in future semesters.

""I'm going to bed early tonight.""

""Don't be a wimp, Grand Theft Auto Three has just started . ""

"" I think you should leave the TV on for me , then ; I don't want to fall asleep and miss all the good stuff ! ""

The dialog could be better structured and shorter. 

It seems to me that the speaker of this dialog is a young person, perhaps a teenager or college student. It doesn't sound like someone in his/her early twenties (which would be my guess). The second speaker sounds more mature, but not significantly so. He/she may simply have been acting immaturely in the first place. I'd say that this was a dialog between two teenagers or college students living together at home. 

There are a couple of phrases that I didn't understand: ""Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome !"" and ""What time is it anyway ?"" They sounded like fragments of sentences to me. Maybe you meant something else?  

The first speaker says ""Grand Theft Auto III is awesome."" It sounds like s/he meant, Grand Theft Auto Three (the game) is awesome. I'm not sure what the third speaker said about it being more violent than TV news though. It didn't seem to make any sense. 

The second speaker says ""It's more violent than TV news !"" What did s/he mean? I think s/he meant that GTA is much, much worse than television news because of all the violence in it. 

""Oh, my God , three hours already !"" I didn't understand this sentence either. Did you mean that they'd been watching TV for three hours already? If so, why would s/he say ""My God""? That seems to me like a reaction to being surprised about the amount of time that has passed, but not something people usually say in that situation. 

The second speaker says ""I have to get the chores done !"" Chores means things that you need to do for your house or flat. This phrase would make more sense if s/he said ""I've got to get ready to go."" 

""No time . That's their headlights in the window !"" I don't understand what this sentence means. I think it's something like ""We can't do the dishes now; that's because there are car headlights shining in our apartment windows."" But maybe that isn't quite right either? 

The second speaker says ""OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash !"" What does this sentence mean? Is it like, OK, let's dump them all and we can do them later. In other words, ""Let's chuck the dishes into the rubbish."" 

The first speaker says ""Two birds with one stone ... "" This is a very old idiom that means to take advantage of two opportunities in one action. The speaker meant something like: We can do all our laundry and cleaning at once, which will save us time. But it's probably better to say something less colloquial, such as, ""We've gotta get this done before Mom comes home."""

"" They're fifty-five. And what about you ? When do you plan to get married or have children ? ""

"" Yes , he has been married for four years now and it was only last year that their second child was born . He is called Nicholas . ""

"" Oh ! Well , I think you will be a great uncle . You are sure to enjoy having the grandchildren around . ""

"" Yes , they will be very happy . We don't have a good relationship with my father but I know he will love his grandson . My mother is much more relaxed about the situation. She wants to see us all as one big family and she thinks this can bring everyone closer together . ""

I hear you are expecting your family. Yes, my parents and soon my brother as well. I didn't know you had a brother. Oh yes he is two years older than me. He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often. Nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family? His son is coming as well. He wants to go to university here in England. So they will visit a few universities while they are here. Does your brother have just one son? No, he has two daughters as well. His wife and daughters are visiting her parents so I won't see them. I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson. Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it. So when are they all coming?
### Explanation:
Hi , there is an error in the first sentence of your response . The verb 'expect' doesn't take a past participle , so change that line as follows : 
"" I hear you are expecting your family . "" to ""I hear you have family visiting ."" It is also better to avoid using a phrase such as 'on his own or with the family '. Try using the verb 'come' instead. So you could say something like this , 'Does your brother have just one son ? Yes, he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents so I won't see them.'"

"" George , I don ’ t think that is a good idea . We might get stuck somewhere on our trip and have to stay overnight . It would be better if we stayed in a hotel for one night instead of sleeping in our van all the time . ""

"" No problem , Lili . We should get home around midnight or so on Sunday . ""

Hey ! How ’ s it going ? 
I ’ m fine and dandy , thanks for asking ! What about you ? Are you busy ? 
Yes , as usual . I just got home from work . How is your day ? 
Great ! You know me , I like to stay busy and active ! How was school today ? 
It was okay . Today we had a fire drill in the school building and then after that, our class took a field trip to the local zoo ! That was cool ! We saw all kinds of animals ! Did you have any activities planned for the kids at your school this week ? 
Actually , we don ’ t do much because we are too busy with preparation for our end-of-the-year party . I think the kids will enjoy their day off . We told them to bring a swimsuit or other sport clothes in case we go outdoors . Have you done anything special recently ? 
Recently ! I bought some tickets to see a play with my wife ! It was so funny ! We laughed all night long ! What did you do during your weekend ? 
Nothing special , just usual stuff like cleaning and errands . Did you get everything done that you needed to this weekend ? 
I finished up the report on time but I don ’ t think my boss is going to be happy with it . He always wants perfection . 
It must have been very hard to meet his standards ! You work really hard and often overtime at your job , huh ? 
Yeah , that ’ s right . Sometimes I go home when my son goes to bed because he is sleeping in the bedroom next door to me ! How about you ? Do you have anything fun planned this weekend ? 
Not really ! Maybe just some housework and errands with my wife . What are your plans for the coming weekend ? 
We ’ re planning a little vacation for our anniversary ! My wife said I could pick any destination of my choice ! We will probably go to Hawaii because it is so beautiful there ! What do you think about going out of town this summer ? 
I would love to go somewhere ! But we are on such a tight budget . If it were up to me , we would be going some place right now but I have to listen to my wife ’ s side of things too ! So what are you planning for your vacation this year ? 
We went to California last summer and the year before that, we took a road trip to New England . We really love travelling all over the country ! It is such an adventure ! This year , I would like to try going somewhere in Europe ! How about you ? Do you have any trips planned for this summer vacation season ? 
No , not yet ! My wife wants to go camping but we never know how much it will cost and if there are any places left . You should probably plan your trip soon before the prices start going up again ! Have a good one and I ’ ll talk with you later ! Bye-bye !

I want to thank for the helpful feedback and comments from my teacher. 

Your corrections helped me improve my writing skill. 

Let ’ s have another look at your comment below. 

The first sentence should be a complete sentence , but it isn ’ t . 

As you said , we can visit different places in the state by our van and I will change it into a full sentence : "" We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time , so we can go to different places in the state by our van ! "" 

The second sentence should be a complete sentence , but it isn ’ t . 

As you said , I will change it into a full sentence : "" We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time , so we can visit different places in the state by our van ! "" 

The third and fourth sentences should be two separate sentences. So they become: "" What about other expenses ? Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while ! "" 

The fifth sentence should be a complete sentence but it isn ’ t. As you said , I will change it into a full sentence :"" The sooner the better! I can ’ t wait! "" 

The sixth and seventh sentences should also be two separate sentences . So they become: "" Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet ! "" And finally, the eighth sentence should be a complete sentence . As you said , I will change it into a full sentence :""As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments !I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time!"""

I'm going to write down a short story about my last birthday on the beach at home, which was probably one of the most exciting birthdays I've had in recent years because I turned sixteen and I received an iPhone from my parents as a gift. They took me to the park for a picnic where we had some yummy pizza, cheese cake, and fruit juice, but all that food was soon forgotten when my mom gave me an envelope which she had been saving for months. 

She told me to open it in private since there were several other people at the park. I was very excited because I knew there must be something special in it . I took out a brand-new iPhone and almost cried tears of joy . My parents gave me the phone with my own name engraved on it which made me feel so special that day. 

I loved the new iPhone immediately , but then we started to leave and went straight back home. As soon as we got there, I could hear a very loud noise coming from the living room .

The dialog is fine and it’s easy to understand the meaning of each sentence. However, there are some grammatical errors. 

For example, in lines 3 & 4, you should use commas to separate the sentences. In line 5, “It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas” sounds strange; maybe you mean it’s hard to believe that it has been ten years since graduation? If so, replace “collection” with “collection of”."

The next morning , Tim arrived at school early for his class with Mr. Sawyer .  It was an advanced placement English course , and Tim's favorite class of the day.Mr. Sawyer , a short man with white hair , was sitting behind his desk waiting for his students when they walked in . He waved them to their seats as he read over some papers on his desk .

"" Okay , everyone , have a seat . I'm Mr. Sawyer , and this is English 10 . Our first assignment is called an "" Expository Essay .""""

"" That sounds interesting . Can you give us any more details ? "" Tim asked. 

Mr.Sawyer looked around the room before answering . He chose to speak directly to Karren who was sitting next to Tim . 

"" Karren , would you please explain to the class what an expository essay is ? "" 

She looked at Mr. Sawyer as if she were trying to decide whether or not to answer his question.  Finally , she spoke in a very soft voice , almost as if she were afraid he might get angry with her ."" An expository essay is an essay that explains something and tells how it works . ""

Tim smiled at Karren for answering the question even though Mr. Sawyer had asked it of someone else.  He was used to his friend answering questions in class , even when they were not meant for her.Mr. Sawyer continued."" Thanks, Karren . I appreciate you volunteering to help us out . Now then , let's get started on our essays . Here are the rules : The paper must be two to three pages long , double spaced and written in Times New Roman 12 point font . It should have an introduction with a thesis statement, a body that discusses the topic from your own perspective, and a conclusion.""

"" That sounds easy enough . ""Tim said. 

Mr. Sawyer ignored his comment , but Tim continued to smile at him anyway.He turned around in his chair to look at Karren who was writing down notes on her desk.  When she finished , she put the pen back into her bag and closed it."" Do you have any questions ? "" Mr. Sawyer asked the class."" I do . What kind of topic should we choose ? "" a girl named Susan asked with an excited voice.

Mr. Sawyer looked at his desk to see if he had put anything down about choosing topics for the paper.  He picked up a handout and read it silently . Then , without looking at anyone in particular , he said, 

"" How about your first topic will be the one you choose . "" 

Tim turned back around and smiled again at Karren who was still writing.When she finished writing , Tim looked over at her with a big smile on his face."" What do I write about ? "" he asked excitedly .

Karren put her pen down and picked up the paper that Mr. Sawyer had given them ."" Why don't you choose a topic from this list ? He said, pointing to the list of ideas written on the handout.  "" 

Tim turned to look at Karren , who was holding out the list for him to take.He took it and looked over at Mr. Sawyer.Mr. Sawyer nodded his head with a smile.  Tim chose "" The Importance of Books ."" Then he handed the paper back to Karren."" It's your turn , "" she said, holding out her hand for him to choose his topic from.

He picked the third one on the list : "" Why I Like to Play Baseball . "" As soon as Tim read it , Karren smiled and nodded.She knew he liked baseball, so it was an obvious choice."" I'll have this paper finished by Monday , "" Karren said quietly. 

Mr. Sawyer smiled at both of them before speaking again."" That is fine . You will turn in a copy to me , and one to your partner for peer review."" He continued, "" You also need to do research on the topic you have chosen and gather supporting evidence."" 

"" What kind of supporting evidence ? "" Tim asked.

"" Primary sources such as facts, statistics, interviews , or personal experiences will help support your thesis statement . They must be properly cited in a works-cited page at the end of your paper . "" Mr. Sawyer said quickly as he looked around the room and checked to make sure everyone understood what he meant by primary sources."" Now , please get started on this assignment immediately !"

The stylist finished by cutting and setting her client's hair. 

### Explanation:
You have been hired by a famous hairdresser to be her assistant while she is on vacation in Europe. This is your first day . 

This dialog takes place in the salon of a small town. The woman who owns it, as well as being a hairdresser, also cuts hair and sells some products. She has a reputation for knowing what works best with different types of curls. Her clients have long been coming to her to get this kind of style. 

The dialog is about getting a haircut. In the first line , the client says that she wants a cut with clean lines on top, sides and back . This means that she does not want a very short bobbed-style hairstyle or any fussy designs all over her head. She just wants it to look as though no one has ever touched it before . 

The next line asks the client whether her hair is naturally curly or if it's a perm. This question allows you to understand whether she really does have curls that can be styled and shaped well or if it's just a perm that needs regular maintenance . 

""It's natural"" , says the client. The hairstylist replies, ""That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck."" This is her way of saying she has no problems with her curls . The next line explains how a cut like that will help minimize frizzy hair . 

""Thank you !"", says the client. It was a short and simple exchange but it was very helpful to understand what kind of hairstyle to give this person."

She got very angry about this change because she thought I was trying to control her too much in the office. But after we talked more about this situation , she understood why I did it and eventually agreed with me . ""
"" That ’ s good ! So how would you handle a difficult co-worker who did not want to follow your instructions ? ""

You have done an excellent job of completing this dialog correctly and consistently.  I would like to give you some specific feedback on what could be improved in the future .  The first thing that I will mention is that you did not indent the lines from your partner's response which was very important.  It would also have been helpful if you had put a capital letter at the beginning of each line, and it would also make sense to put a comma after ""Hi there"" so that the next sentence can start without any kind of confusion.  The second thing I noticed is that when your partner said, ""...I usually run it every few days ..."", he left off some punctuation which should be a period at the end of his response (...).  This is very important in order to make sense of what you are writing and to stay on topic.  Finally , your partner also said that ""It finds a virus about half the time"" but he did not capitalize this sentence as it should have been (It Finds A Virus About Half The Time ).  In conclusion, I would like to congratulate you on doing such an excellent job, and I hope you will use this feedback to make your writing better in the future !  Have a great day ! :)

  Yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ?

The dialog continues from the previous post, where the server asks if the customer would like to-go. He replies yes and asks for a plastic bag. The server puts it in a plastic bag and gives it back to him. The customer pays 25 dollars and asks if he takes credit cards.

The clerk at the register wrote on the credit card slip, ""Charge to your room. You have a 9 p.m. checkout time.""

""OK . Thanks a lot ! Bye!"" The customer walked away from the cashier's counter with the plastic bag in her hand.

```

"" I focus on traveling around the world and studying abroad . ""

"" that's pretty cool ! I'd love to travel all over the world one day . ""

"" it's so wonderful , isn't it ? You'll enjoy every bit of it when you get there . ""

I began blogging when I first went to the U.S. for my graduate studies. At first, I wrote about my life there. I wrote about interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes, I would post pictures of my family and friends on the Internet so they could see what I was doing in America . My mom liked my blog because she always knew where I was when I went somewhere by myself .

I have been keeping my own English blog since I went abroad as an exchange student. When I first arrived here, I kept a journal with the purpose of writing down and reflecting on what had happened to me during that period of time. Eventually, it turned into a daily diary which reflected how I felt at different times. And then, I began blogging for a wider audience. Now my English blog has been around for three years, and is still going strong. 

When I first started writing about my life abroad, the focus was on what happened to me during that period of time. I also wrote down what new words I learned daily to keep my vocabulary up-to-date. Now it has developed into a more comprehensive reflection of my life in general; not just focusing on things related to school and study, but also about the events taking place in the world around me. And now that I've graduated from high school, I will start writing about issues that concern young people in China or some other similar topics. 

I used to write every day when I was still a student abroad. But after I returned home and began preparing for university entrance exams, I found myself more busy than ever. I have always believed in the importance of maintaining good relationships with my friends, so it became harder for me to find time to do that by writing on my blog. After graduating from high school, however, I will once again be able to write every day or even more often if I find something interesting and want to share it with others."

I want to ask about what we talked yesterday about opening an account in a Chinese bank. The Type B Account is restricted ? Could you please explain that to me ? And if so , why ? I've heard people say it has something to do with currency control . Is there anything else besides currency control ? 

Also , can you tell me a little more about how the interest is calculated on my account and paid ? For example : when is the interest calculated and who pays it ? How long does it take for the money in an account to be available after opening a new account ? 

What do you think of the Type A Account ? I heard that if there's something wrong with your Settlement Account , they would have to check what happened . Does this happen often ? What would happen if someone went overdrawn without knowing it ? And what about interest on the deposit ? Is that calculated in a similar way as my Settlement Account ? 

Finally , is there any other advice you can give me ? I'm very confused by all of these details . Is there anything else I should know before opening an account here in China ?

The lady says that she would like some grapefruit juice, marmalade, two scrambled eggs with two sausages, toast and a pot of black coffee, please. I think this sounds really weird, because I wouldn't order something so specific on room service. Is it common to get specific food in room service? What is the reason behind ordering such a breakfast?

### Answer & Explanation

Answer:

Water pollution is just a part of the pollution and is not sufficient to write about as a topic.

Explanation:

The dialog goes like this:

Professor : I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? ""

"" Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . ""

(He thinks that the student has taken up an overbroad topic and that he needs to restrict it).

Student : What about water pollution instead of pollution ? ""

(Water pollution is just a part of the whole picture. I don't think it's enough to write about as a topic.)

Professor : Water pollution is just part of the whole picture. I don't think it's enough to write about as a topic. Please reconsider."" (The professor suggests that he narrow down his topic further)."

a) Bamboos are not as good for making furniture as hard woods
b) Bamboo grows in a tropical forest , so it is useless to use it in cold regions
c) Bamboos are too expensive to be bought by ordinary people."

Step 1 : The suit was mentioned earlier. It is a male garment worn on special occasions and for business formal. It is usually made of wool with a collar and buttoned down front. This answer should be correct, unless there is some reason the speaker does not want it dry cleaned.
Step 2 : The word ""please"" is polite and helps show that the speaker wants to be helpful. He also wants the person to know that he has a form to fill out for them, so they will have to do it first in order to get their clothes cleaned.
Step 3: The speaker says ""fill in"", which is less formal than other ways of saying this (such as ""please complete""). This sentence tells the customer what they need to do next in order to get their clothes washed and dried properly. It also gives them an idea of when their clothes will be ready by telling them when they can come back for them again (tonight)."

## Other posts by johnnyd

I recently finished an online class on the history of rock music, and now I'm working through some other classes in the same vein. I was wondering if anyone else had taken any online classes? If so, what were they, and which one was your favorite? Thanks for reading!

I think it would be interesting to hear from people who have different experiences with different online courses. It's always great to learn from others who have been there before. I'm really looking forward to seeing what other people have to say about their own experiences and what they think about the classes in question.

"" Where do you want to eat lunch ? ""

### Answer & Explanation

Let’s start with the first sentence. You are looking at the weather. You can tell by looking at it that it is nice and warm outside. The second sentence states that you think the same thing. If we put those two together, we have a sentence: “Nice day, isn't it?”

Let’s look at the third sentence. It says, ""It sure is."" This tells us that the person speaking thinks that today is a good day to go on a picnic. The fourth sentence states that you are glad they asked you out for lunch. If we put those two together, we have a sentence: “I'm so glad I asked you to go.”

The fifth sentence asks where you would like to eat lunch. This means that the person speaking is looking forward to having lunch with you and wants your opinion on what restaurant or place you want to go to have lunch at. We can combine these two sentences into one: “Where do you want to eat lunch?”

Now let's put all five together! “Nice day, isn't it? It's a good day for a picnic. I'm so glad I asked you to go. Where would you like us to meet up at?”"

I started out trying to use Google translate which was a real disaster so if you have the same problem just keep going till you find a site that works for you and give up on the translator unless your language is one of those where it does work, in which case good luck, happy translating !!!

I got fed up with the whole situation of having to copy paste the translation into my browser and then go back and forth between two windows so I decided to try out a website that you can type directly into without any copy pasting . The site is http://www.freedictranslation.com and it works like a charm and has all kinds of languages for translating from.

It ’ s a lot easier to use than the one I originally used which was https://translate.google.com/ , just type your sentence into the input box , click translate, copy the translation you see below that box and paste it where you want it in your web browser or document etc .

For example if you wanted to say "" I would like a cup of coffee"" in German then here ’ s how you do it :

I would like a cup of coffee

If you go to Google translate and put that in the input box , click Translate, copy what ’ s under that box, paste where you want it.

The website is pretty easy to use and works on a lot of different browsers . The only downside is that you can ’ t edit your sentences once they have been translated but I didn ’ t have any problems with the accuracy so far when I used this site , hope it helps !"

That makes these sentences examples of the simple sentence. There is nothing wrong with using simple sentences in your writing. In fact, some good writers use them almost exclusively. However, to write well you will need to master other types of sentences.

Here is another example of a simple sentence: The rain fell on the grass. A sentence with three or more clauses is called a compound sentence. Compound sentences consist of two (or more) independent clauses joined by one of the following eight coordinating conjunctions. Each clause has its own subject and verb.

Compound Sentences

To create a complex sentence, you must use a subordinate conjunction (a word that expresses a subordinate idea or relationship) to join a dependent clause with an independent clause. Dependent clauses can be used at the beginning of a sentence or in any position within a sentence. Independent clauses cannot function as the dependent part of a sentence, but they may function as the main part of a sentence.

I've been using this book and its online resources for awhile now. It has helped me a lot. My writing skills have improved since I started using it but I still cannot understand how I am supposed to use the dialogs to learn English.

I tried to use them like this: I write one sentence on my own, then copy another sentence from the book as a reply. But even though they are very simple sentences, I just can't make sense of them after reading it several times. 

Can someone help me with this? How do you think I can understand those dialogs better? Thanks in advance!

I don't know about you but when I was a learner I didn't like these types of activities. They were not fun, not engaging at all and very boring.

Later, as a teacher, I used them with some learners, because they were learning English for an exam and there were not many other options. The same thing happened to me when I started to work in EFL contexts and had to use the materials that were provided by my employer.

But I have always hated these types of activities. They are boring and I am sure that very few people can make sense out of them, even if they read the dialogues 100 times.

If you really want to practice your writing skills then I would suggest you write something about yourself or about your hobbies and interests, and ask native speakers for feedback and corrections. If there is a forum where you can do that, please share it with us. That's how I used to help learners who came to our English club meetings in the evening.

I would also recommend you check out this post about writing and some useful links that you may find interesting:

I am not sure what exactly you are trying to do but I can help with the last sentence in your post.  It's not a very good sentence and there's a lot going on in it, so let me give it some context:

> But even though they are very simple sentences, I just can't make sense of them after reading it several times.
>
> Can someone help me with this? How do you think I can understand those dialogs better? Thanks in advance!

- The sentence has a lot of meaning, which is good but not what we want here. We are asking for a short and concise answer to the question ""How do you think I can understand those dialogs better?"" The answer to that would be: ""Try doing X.""
- The sentence also has several errors. The last word (in bold) should be written as 'understand' because it is singular, not plural. This is a common mistake that learners make, especially when they write in the present tense. When you are talking about a single object, the verb must also be singular and there is no need to add an ""s"" at the end of the word (you don't say ""understands"" or ""understood"", you say ""understand"").
- The sentence does not make much sense because it doesn't really answer the question. It doesn't give any advice on how we can understand the dialogs better, so I think it's best if we remove this part and focus on what the question was asking for in the first place: ""How do you think I can understand those dialogs better?""

I hope that helps!

I'm really thankful for your answer but I still can't understand why these dialogues are so difficult to comprehend, even though they contain simple sentences and words that we use in real-life conversations. I thought this would help me improve my English skills in a fun way, as the book's cover states.

I don't want to write about myself or my hobbies, it doesn't interest me at all.  What you suggested is boring and I would not benefit much from it either because I already know how to express myself very well in English (I can even have conversations with native speakers). The only thing I need now is help with understanding simple dialogues like those in this book.

I understand where you are coming from, but I think that these kinds of activities might not be a good fit for your learning style and goals. However, they do exist for a reason and many learners use them successfully to improve their language skills. It's important to remember that we are all different and what works for some people may not work for others. If you find an activity or exercise boring or uninteresting then it's probably best if you don't spend too much time on it.

It can be useful to have a look at other types of materials, especially if the ones that are currently available seem boring and repetitive. There might be some interesting activities out there!

If you still want to try using these dialogs then I suggest that you take them one by one and focus on understanding each sentence in isolation first before trying to put together a full conversation with someone else. This will help make it less confusing and more manageable for learners who find this type of activity challenging. It could also be helpful if you read through the whole dialogue first so you can get an idea about what is happening before reading individual sentences, because sometimes people have trouble figuring out how different parts connect together when there are multiple speakers involved in a conversation or storyline.

I hope this helps! Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance and best wishes!"

It doesn't seem to make sense to me that you can only use the continuous form when an action is not completed yet and has a duration.

What about the following?

That way , we can share our thoughts and experiences . We may even help each other with job hunting . What do you think ? ""

"" I love that idea ! You know me so well , right ? Haha .""

I was reading the dialog and there were many more ""hey, what if.."" type of statements. At the end, it felt like a mess and my friend who was studying this course gave up on me.

When I was talking to her about what we are learning in the class, she asked me what else I thought the other person was feeling from my perspective as an observer. Then she said that when I was explaining it was hard to understand what the other person meant because there were many unconnected ""hey, what if.."" type of statements and by the end, she couldn't keep up.

She then asked me to rewrite the dialog to show how we might connect the ideas together so that the other person can understand what I was thinking. But I could not figure out how to do that since I have not really studied this dialog type yet and it felt too ""in-depth"" for me, but I hope that someone here may help me understand what my friend meant by connecting these ideas together in a way that is easy to understand.

I hope that I am explaining the problem clearly enough. Please let me know if there is any other information you need about this problem or if anything else needs clarification. Thank you!"

mistral-7b-v0.1@q8_0,daily_dialog,295,mistral-7b-v0.1@q8_0_295.txt,""" Yeah , let's go to see the show .""

### Answer & Explanation

Step 1: Here, we can assume that both characters are a couple or good friends. Now, for this dialogue, one of them should be very keen on seeing the circus while other doesn’t want to sit and watch the animals being tortured in the circus.

Step 2: As per above information, it can be assumed that there is a show going on nearby and both characters are talking about it. Here, we have one character who wants to go and see the show and other doesn’t want to do it because of the torture part which is a very sensitive issue these days.
Step 3: Now, in this context, one of them would say something like “Hey , look , there is a circus show over there . "" And the reply would be "" I'm not in the mood .""

Step 4: Here, it should be made clear that he doesn’t want to sit and watch animals getting tortured. Now, his partner says something like "" It's the circus .""

Step 5: Here, his partner is saying that circus show has nothing to do with torture or else she/he would have said “No”. Also, there could be a tone of sarcasm in the reply because he is very keen on going out and seeing the show while other one doesn’t want to sit there and watch animal torture. Now, as per the given context it can be said that this character tries hard to convince his partner so that both of them can enjoy together in the circus show.
Step 6: Here, he says something like “Oh , come on , they give them treat too . Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . "" and other replies with "" Yeah , let’s go to see the show .""

So, this is how you can continue writing a dialogue in this particular context. I hope this helps!

The correct answer is :
""My wife and i are not very much fond of celebrating valentine day together. So we prefer spending it with our friends.""
This answer is correct because the person doesn't have any specific plans to spend Valentine's Day with his wife. He also mentions that he would rather spend the day with his friends, indicating that he might not be very interested in celebrating the holiday in a romantic way."

What’s wrong with this dialog?

## 1 Answer

""What ’s she doing?"" is incorrect. What Sally's doing should be changed to ""what she's doing"". This will make the sentence correct because the sentence needs an auxiliary verb and a participle in the place of ""what"" as it cannot function as such in this sentence.

"" Tim !""

"" But Sally was there first . ""

"" Yes , but she isn ’ t now !""

The dialog above has no explanation or format changes.

> *It closes at seven o’clock on Sundays. I wish they would stay open later, because I’m not done shopping yet.*

I think this dialog is fine, but I don't know if it makes sense in context.

```
I'm going to the supermarket. Do you want to come with me? The supermarket closes at 7 on Sunday. Oh, when does it close? It closes at 7 on Sunday. That is too bad! Don't worry we can go tomorrow morning. It opens at 8:00. Alright what do you want to do now? My sister will get here around 8:30 and then we can all go out to dinner. Where does she live?
```

I would like to start with a question to learn more about Jeff's character. What is the most important thing for him now? ""The supermarket?"" I'm not sure if it is necessary or if we can continue to have the dialog in that order, but I think it would be good to find out where Jeff wants to go before we mention a closed supermarket.
""Oh,"" he replied. ""That was about two hours ago.""
I do not understand what he means by this sentence, does he mean the supermarket is no longer open? It should be clearer why he thinks that.
What kind of tone or emotion can I use here to create a more natural dialog? Does it change when we add ""Oh,"" in front of his response? Is there another way to say ""I think""? ""It's closed now,"" or perhaps even ""it is no longer open."" 
""Tomorrow morning at 8:00?"" Jeff said. ""That would be great!""
Can I replace the period after tomorrow with a question mark instead? ""At 8AM tomorrow?"" Perhaps it would sound more natural without the period, but there might not be enough information to continue with that sentence. I also have no idea what the time is right now and whether or not Jeff understands what it is. It could be necessary to explain in a different way: ""I meant at 8:00AM tomorrow.""
""Don't worry,"" he said, ""we can go together!""
Why did I put an exclamation mark after that sentence? Was there a problem or did Jeff just want to reassure me of something? Does this part sound natural or does it need some work? 
""Oh no."" Jeff looked at his watch. ""I'm going to be late.""
This part doesn't have enough information for the reader, how much time will he be late? Do I need a question mark after 'late""? 
Jeff said. ""But we can still walk around here until she arrives."" 
""Alright,"" Jeff agreed and they walked together for about half an hour. 
Should there be another word between ""together"" and ""and"" or is the sentence fine this way? Also, I'm not sure whether or not it should be ""alright"", perhaps ""sounds good"". 
### Question:
Do you know any other ways to ask ""What do you want to do now?"" in English. There are several options on Wikipedia but they all sound a bit strange to me. Is there something more natural? What about this one: ""So, what's next?"" It sounds okay but not the best.

llama-7b-finetune-articlegen,daily_dialog,226,llama-7b-finetune-articlegen_226.txt,"You are being told the story of a child who has begun saying cruel things. 

Your first response should be to ask for clarification. You don ’ t know what to tell him because you do n’t understand him , so that must be your first question : “What words does he say?” If this seems strange, it will become clear when we finish. 

Once you have the information you need, you should try to reason with him about it . You do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason , so now would be a good time to use that skill . Don ’ t scold him or make a big deal of it . Simply explain what he said , explain why it is hurtful and give him some alternatives. 

If you don ’ t understand him, ask again for clarification .

You are right ! When children grow up, they have the ability to understand and judge. They can be their own personality and become a human being. 

When you want them to do something , first let him know that it is necessary to make clear what he need to do . And then show him how to get done . If his behaviour is not suitable, we should guide and help him with patience . We should treat them the way they need, not just like ourselves."

- Yes, please. How do I get there?
- It's easy; just take a bus at the corner of First Street and Third Avenue, and you will arrive in front of the main entrance of the Central Park. If your plan is to spend some time walking around in that area, I suggest you to buy a map from the information booth nearby. You may also visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art or The Cloisters and get back there using public transportation.
- Are tickets still available?
- Yes, but the last ferry is about to leave. So don't waste any more time, take the subway and go over there. There are no trains running at this moment; they will come soon."

""I got a ticket yesterday. It was for parking in the red zone.""

""Didn't they have any other spots to choose from?""

""No, there were only those spaces available. I needed to get something really quickly and had no time to find another spot.""

""Okay.""

""Where did you park at? At your apartment building?""

Yes, but not in the last month or two.
I got a ticket on my birthday because it was raining and I forgot that cars are not supposed to drive when its raining. The reason why is because they can slide easily.
I parked in my spot at work today.
I don't have an aptmment, but if I did I would park in the parking garage so no one could get a ticket.
No, it was in front of my house and we were about to go out for dinner and I didn't know it was my parking space that day. My mom had parked there before she moved into an assisted living center. So when we came home that night the car was gone and so was the ticket.
No, but one time I got a citation because I was driving on the wrong side of the road for about two blocks. I thought it would be cool to do something daring like this and I ended up getting in trouble with the police. I also learned that you should always make sure that you are looking at both sides of the road before making any sudden movements, because they can lead to accidents if you aren't careful enough."

I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected.

You know the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years. Our prices compare favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere.

I am afraid I can’t agree with you there. I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies.

But you must take the design and quality into consideration. You know we are superior to others in design and quality. We have various styles, which the other companies cannot catch up with.

I agree that yours are of top quality.

""Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free.""

""What would I do if my anti-virus program found a virus and there wasn’t an updated definition file available to remove it ? ""

""I would call the company that makes the anti-virus program . They would give me instructions on what to do to fix the problem . There are companies online that will remove viruses from your computer for money but I would check with my antivirus software maker first and then look at other options if they couldn’t help me . ""

""Have you ever had a virus on one of your computers ? ""

""Yes, several times . The worst time was when we were in the middle of setting up our office network . I thought that I had everything set right but I hadn ’ t updated the anti-virus program since we installed it and as soon as I opened a file to send to someone my screen froze up with a nasty looking message about how I wasn ’t secure because the computer was full of viruses . My network administrator came over immediately and got everything working again but I couldn ’ t send emails or files until he had deleted all of the viruses from our computers . ""

""Did you ever get a virus from opening an email attachment ? ""

""Several times. They are the worst kind because they come in an email that looks like it is from someone I know but when I open the attachment the virus downloads itself to my computer and then does whatever damage that it was programmed to do . One time it deleted all of our network settings files so that we couldn ’ t connect with each other ! ""

""How often should you run your anti-virus software ? ""

""Every day is good because new viruses are being released constantly and you don ’ t want to get a virus when you aren ’ t expecting it . If I knew someone who was not running an antivirus program all the time, I wouldn ’ t loan them my computer . It doesn ’ t make sense for me to take that chance and they should be responsible enough to protect their own computer . ""

""What would you suggest if a user didn’t want to use paid software ? ""

""Well there is some free software available . I like Avast because it runs in the background checking incoming emails and files for viruses before they are opened . It also does a good job of scanning your computer for hidden viruses . You can download a free version online or you can go to www.avast.com for more information . """

“I knew it! How could the economy survive without me?”

“Well, you know how I’ve been working at the Economist as a proof-reader?”

“Yes.”

“Wells, the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magazine and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him.”

"" I'm so happy for you , darling ! You deserve all this success you are getting now. It makes me feel good to see your hard work paying off, especially because it means more money for our little family! ""

I was shocked to learn that I could become an assistant editor at this prestigious magadi. This was not only because of the prestige that comes with working for a magazine, but also because of what it means for my career path in general. Although I have been working as a proof-reader, writing is something I enjoy and I am very good at it. I was pleased to learn that I would be able to use both skills during this opportunity. The editor told me that there were other opportunities available but this one seemed perfect for me since my experience in the magazine industry is extensive, and the workload is not overwhelming. The first thing I thought about when hearing this news was how excited I am to be able to share my ideas with others who may benefit from them. I also thought about what kinds of things would happen if there were no limits on creativity or imagination! It sounds like an exciting time ahead for me as an assistant editor at The Economist magazine :)
### Explanation: 
I have been working at the magazine since January and they offered me a position in the editorial department. My role will be to proofread articles, edit them, write my own pieces and contribute to the column. I am really excited about this opportunity because it is one that will allow me to use my writing skills and learn more about editing.

I work five days a week.""

### Explanation:
- In the first turn, we should use ""How come"", not just ""Why"". (The dialog may be used for other purposes and we do not know what reason it is.)
- The word ""boss"" is unnatural. It may be better to say something like this: My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to the office...
- In the second turn, we should use the subject ""I"". (We usually don't mention a third person unless it is necessary.) 
- There are many unnatural expressions. For example: ""...to deal with . I work five days a week."" Instead of ""I work five days a week."", we may say something like this: ""That means I have to work on Saturdays and Sundays once in two weeks.""

### Questions:
1. What is the most natural way to say ""My boss sent me here...""? 
2. Why should we use ""I"" in the second turn? 
3. What kind of expressions are unnatural in this dialogue?

I found this dialog very interesting and informative, thanks for sharing!  

1. This is my first time meeting you here. How come you dropped into this company today? 2. My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office. I didn't know you were working here. What a surprise. How long have you been doing this? 3. Two years or so. That is great. Do you have to work the night shift? 4. No, in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with. I work five days a week. 5. Do you enjoy working here? It is hard to say. But I’ve got to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant. Sometimes, I am really under great pressure when it gets busy.

1. In my opinion, this is a bit confusing. This dialog may be a continuation of a previous conversation or even several conversations, but it's difficult to tell because the tone isn't carried over from one paragraph to another. It would make more sense if the speaker and his/her audience had already been introduced. 2. The sentence ""My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office"" has an awkward construction. I would suggest using, instead: My boss sent me to take these documents back to his office. 3. ""Do you have to work the night shift?"" could be reworded as ""Will you be working at night?"" or ""Will you be working a night shift?"" 4. The sentence ""I work five days a week"" has an odd structure, in that it's not clear who is doing the speaking until halfway through the sentence: I...work...five...days...a....week. It would make more sense if you used commas to separate the parts of the sentence and wrote it as follows: I work five days a week. 5. The sentence ""Do you enjoy working here?"" seems like an awkward way of asking how much the speaker likes his/her job. I think, instead, you could ask directly whether the speaker enjoys working at this company or not by using a more direct question such as ""I assume it's your first time working at this company."" 6. The sentence ""Take it easy"" seems awkward. It might be better to use some other phrase that means roughly the same thing, or you could just omit it altogether. I don't think anyone would say something like ""Take it easy"" when speaking in a professional setting. In fact, I don't know if this expression is appropriate in any kind of job interview situation. 7. The sentence ""Luckily not..."" seems to be a bit abrupt and the word ""luckily"" might not make sense depending on how you interpret it. My guess is that the speaker means, ""I haven't been given much trouble at my new job."" If this is what he/she meant to say then I would change the sentence as follows: It's lucky so far. I haven't had too many problems with coworkers or a difficult boss yet. 8. The word ""silent"" seems out of place in this context. It sounds like an error, but if you intended to use it then my guess is that what you meant was the phrase ""I have not encountered any difficulties..."" or something similar. 9. I'm sure you don't want your readers to think that you write sentences with words spelled incorrectly and punctuation mistakes in them! You should probably go over this paragraph again before posting it on your blog because, while this dialog is a good example of what your readers will experience, the way you wrote this portion of the text does not give us confidence that all your written material is free of errors."

Hey, Blake! Are you still listening to Mozart?

Yes. Do you like it?

It's great and I've heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent. 

Realley? I've never heard that before. I just like it. 

Is classical music your favorite? 

Yeah, that's why I can enjoy myself in it. 

Did you always like pop music? 

I think so, since I was in primary school. How long have you been interested in classical music? 

I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight. From then on, classicial music has been an important part of my life.

Oh, I didn't know you can play the violin! Do you still play?"

I do agree with you about the policy being to long for what he is saying. 

> ""I think we're talking about a whole different type of insurance here, like life insurance. He doesn't want to buy it because his dad just bought one (the son, not the father), but maybe there isn't enough money in their family for them both to have life insurance."" 

The two words that are throwing me off are ""not yet"" and ""thinking about"".  I think you are right that it is life insurance.  

> ""And, without knowing his income or any other details, I can only assume he was looking at some kind of long-term coverage (like an annuity?) and not a term policy.""  

I have never heard this type of insurance mentioned before so I would just add that to the conversation.  But I guess it is possible . 

> ""Maybe he wants a 'whole' life insurance, which pays out at some point in time?""  

That could be an option too , but why would you take this type of policy out for someone else if they are already covered?  

I think we should have this conversation.  Maybe I will learn something new from it and maybe a moderator will help us figure this one out.  

> ""He may want to take it out for her as a precaution, but he doesn't actually plan on doing so."" 

Good point , but why would he not do this?

> In the Chinese culture, writing is a type of art. It also has a history of over 4000 years and there are many different types. There is an ancient legend that says calligraphy can even show one's character. So it's not surprising that in China we have very beautiful writings! In this culture, people write not only on the paper but also on porcelain and bamboo. I think that all Chinese are good at calligraphy. I like to write Chinese characters because they look so graceful.

The first thing that you need is a brush pen, then you should practice writing them in the correct order from left to right until your hand gets used to it. Then you can move onto making strokes. Writing Chinese characters requires good balance between speed and accuracy . It takes at least 10 years to master how to write beautiful Chinese characters properly.

The order taker asks the customer, “What can I get for you today?” The customer responds by asking for a hamburger. The next prompt is, “Would you like cheese on that?” The customer does not wish to have cheese on their burger and responds with, “No, thank you.” The order taker asks the customer if they would like any drinks, and the customer asks for a soda, specifically requesting a soft drink. When asked what kind of soda the customer prefers, she responds that she wants a cola.

""Come on, don't be so dramatic! I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine.""
""You think so?"" Oh no! How can he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me. Why else wouldn't he call?
But you two are on a break. Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.
He's the love of my life! I've really messed this up.

He has the right to be angry . He did nothing wrong . 

""I ... I never meant to make you mad , sweetie . It was just a silly mistake , but that doesn ’ t mean he can treat me like this . No way in hell am I going to take his abuse ! ""

"" But . That isn ’ t what I said . Look , maybe you are right about him being selfish . But . It seems more like he is angry and frustrated at himself for not being able to contact you . He didn ’ t want to hurt your feelings any more than you wanted to make things worse between the two of you . ""

"" You don ’ t understand ! I knew I messed up , but I didn ’ T expect him to go so far as to end our relationship completely ! I mean . That s what I deserved for being stupid . But now he is going to treat me like I am nothing at all ? He doesn ’ t even have the courtesy to tell me why we are through ! ""

"" I can understand how you feel , and if it were me ... I would be really angry too . But this isn ’ T his fault ! He has gone through a lot in the past few months , and he is trying his best to do what is right for all of us . And if you think about it . You two are not together anymore . So maybe he shouldn’t have to put up with your drama at this point . ""

"" I ’ M just saying ! You can see how ridiculous our relationship was . We were on a break and we couldn ’ t even stay away from each other for that long ! ""

"" I know it isn’T fair , sweetie , but you have to understand ... he has been through so much this past few months . And he is still trying his best to get over everything that happened at the firehouse . ""

"" Well , he obviously didn ’ t try hard enough . It ’ S no excuse ! I mean , how could he let all of those people die ? How can he look himself in the mirror every morning ? ""

"" But this is what happens when you are a firefighter . And as much as we would like to change things ... that is not possible . You just have to accept the fact that there will always be bad days . ""

"" I don ’ t think so ! He can get over it if he really wants to , and he should want to for all of those poor souls who didn ’ T make it out alive . What about their families ? How are they supposed to live with the fact that their loved ones died because of this man’S mistakes ? ""

"" But again ... we aren ’ T together anymore ! He doesn ’ t have to worry about anything like that . ""

"" You don ’ t know what you are talking about . You can ’ T tell me how I feel , or who is right and wrong in a situation ! If you really cared about your sister like you say ... then you would understand why she feels this way . ""

"" But . I do care ! And I am trying my best to help her through all of this pain that she has put herself through . ""

"" She is the love of his life , and he needs to be there for her ! If not ... then how can he expect others to trust him ? ""

### Response:
We should talk about this sometime. 

"" I ’ m sorry you feel that way . But it doesn ’ t change what I just told you . There are rules in place for a reason . He may not want to stay with you now , but he can always come back and ask if everything is alright between you two . ""

"" Do you really think he will do that ? It seems like the only thing on his mind right now is moving away from all of this ... not trying to find someone to help him deal with it ! ""

"" Well , I guess we don ’ t have much choice but to wait and see what happens . But if that ’ s how you feel then I guess there isn ’ t anything else I can do for you right now . ""

"" Can you at least tell me why he doesn ’ T want to talk to me ? What did I ever do to make him hate me so much ? ""

"" I don ’ T know ... but it seems like the two of us are going in circles with this conversation . All I can say is that he loves you very much , and he won ’ t come back unless you give him a good reason not to . ""

"" He doesn ’ T love me ! How could he leave his best friend like that ? It’s just like when we first met . I was always there for him whenever he needed it, but now all of the sudden ... he isn ’ t the same person anymore . This is all my fault . He knows I care about him and everything else that has happened ... and still he won ’ T talk to me ! ""

"" Don ’ t worry . If you give me a good reason not to , then I will see what I can do . But right now there isn ’ T much we can do about the situation at hand . I just have to make sure that you are alright with everything . ""

"" Please ... don ’ t tell him ! He still doesn ’ T know how badly hurt my feelings were when he left me like this . If it was his girlfriend on the phone , then maybe we could talk about things and try to work something out . But as far as I am concerned ... he is still just a friend of mine . And now that he has turned into an enemy ? I can ’ T have anything else to do with him ! ""

"" He isn ’ t going to get a chance like that again . If you really care about him then maybe we should talk sometime and clear things up between the both of us ? ""

### Response:
Oh, so he missed the first two parties and then attended them afterward.  Do you know what happened between that first party and the second one to make him miss those two?

"" Nope ! ""

### Response:
So you don't have any idea why Robert might not come to a party for two years, but then suddenly showed up again later on without any explanation.  Well, it sounds like there must be a lot of reasons he wouldn't attend in the past.  Have you ever tried talking to him about it?

"" Nope ! ""

### Response:
I see, so even though you don't have any idea what happened during those two years, I suppose that he had no reason not to come at all.  That means there must be some reason for his sudden appearance after having been away from the parties for a couple of years... What is it?

"" He was in prison . ""

Oh wow! That's quite something! Was he involved in illegal activities and now has served time to pay for them?  Or did you know him before this happened?

"" I didn't really get the chance to speak with Robert much when we were at school together . ""

### Response:

3) Asking which bills/coins to give back and which ones are wanted. 
4) Giving back the requested notes, signing them over, receiving change (if any), and thanking the customer for their business.
5) Asking if there's anything else that can be done for the customer at this time.

This Olympic park is so big!  Yes, now we are in the Olympic Stadium, the center of this park. Splendid! When will it be finished? The whole stadium will be finished by June. How many seats are there in the stand?

I didn't know you were so shy. You seem to enjoy being with people more than any other person I have ever met, and yet when I tell you about the Olympics or how many seats there are in this stadium you ask me if it’s true. It makes me feel like my words aren’t important to you anymore. We’ve been together for four years now and you still act as if we just started dating yesterday.

It was getting late so Gordon thought it would be a good idea to go home. Gordon was going to have to get up early in the morning to go to work, so he agreed that they should leave right away. ""Let's see how much the bill is"", said Gordon.

Gordon was an exceptional cook but he was also a generous man.  He would never expect his guests to pay for anything and neither did his friends. As he led his guests from the table , Gordon picked up the check that he had left on the counter by the cash register . The waiter smiled when he saw who it was . ""Is that Gordon? We haven't seen you in a long time, sir."" Gordon said,  ""Hi, Rex. It's been too long!"" As they walked toward the door , his friends started to talk about all of the food they had enjoyed . Gordon smiled as he heard them say things like ""Gordon, your steak was delicious! I can hardly believe you make such wonderful food at home."" Gordon didn't want to admit it but the fact that he was a terrible cook made him feel proud when his friends complimented his meals. He had been working as an accountant for years . He was paid well , but it wasn't enough money . To make ends meet,  he worked at a restaurant on weekends where he learned how to prepare some of the best dishes ever made by human hands . Gordon's friends loved him because they knew that he would never expect them to pay for anything and neither did his friends. They had all been in similar situations before so they understood each other perfectly . The next morning at 6:30 AM, Gordon woke up early and prepared breakfast for everyone who lived in the apartment building above his restaurant . As he placed plates of food on each table , he thought about how much money he had made by working three days this week . He decided that tonight would be the night to finally ask for payment from his friends . When dinner was over , Gordon led his guests into the kitchen and sat down with them at one end of a long wooden table. ""How about I get back to you on that?"" he said, smiling as he pushed up his glasses .  ""I know it sounds strange but I think there's something wrong with my eyes,"" he continued . His friends laughed out loud when they saw the way Gordon was looking at them through his glasses , which made him look even more nervous than usual . Then, before anyone could speak again , he asked if any of them would like another cup of coffee or tea . ""I'd love some more coffee!"" said one friend . Another said: ""That's just what I need."" And so on until everyone had finished their drinks and left the kitchen . After they were gone, Gordon sat down at one end of the table again

Thanks for taking this task, but your answer was incorrect. Please read the following passage to see what the next line of dialogue would be:

""let's see how much the bill is.""

The correct response is:

""don't worry about it. Tonight is my treat.""

I need someone to continue this dialog with the same tone and format. I do not want any explanation or format change. 

""that was a really good meal, Gordon.""

"" It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite.""

"" well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home.""

"" you're right . I have to get up early tomorrow to go to work.""

"" let's see how much the bill is.""

""don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat.""

"" what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill.""

"" no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't.""

"" no way, Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill.""

"" alright , if that's the way you are going to be, we'll split the bill.""

"" that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home, otherwise, you would probably have to walk.""

Gordon's face lights up. He is pleased that she has agreed to split the bill with him, even though he didn't expect it in the beginning. He takes a moment to think about his choice of words before speaking again.

Listen, I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. Are we supposed to meet at the China Town terminal of the Ave B bus or D bus?

B as in boy. You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown.

Oh, you mean Canal Street? 

That's the wrong direction. Canal St is on the other side of Chinatown.  

Oh, I get it. When did we decide to meet?

At 10:45 am. Is Anne coming along?

"" George ! You are not serious , are you ? I have to use the bathroom all night long and there is nothing I can do about it while we sleep in the van . And what if we get caught by a police officer ? ""

Lili and George decided that it was time for them to take a vacation. They had not left their small town in many years and were eager to do so. So, after they saved up some money from the van rentals they were running around town with, they packed their bags, loaded all of their supplies into the van, and began to drive down the road towards their first stop. They had only been driving for about thirty minutes when George realized that he forgot something . It was very important . And it could be in the house . They decided to take a detour to Lili's parent's home to retrieve it before they continued on their way and George drove the van back over there with much haste. Once again, Lili asked him what was so special about this ""thing"" that he had to go out of his way to get it . He only replied by telling her, ""It can wait . We are going on vacation now , Lil's."" They continued their journey and arrived at the first stop, which was a small town called Blue. It wasn't anything special but they enjoyed themselves for a few days as they sat in the van during the day eating and watching television and going to bed early so that they could be up and ready to go again by 7:00 am . They spent their last money on gas before moving on to the next town, which was a small farming community called Green. It also wasn't much of anything but at least it was different from Blue and there were some nice views in the area. After staying in Green for another day or two they decided that they had seen everything there was to see so they packed up their things once again and drove back out onto the road where George noticed a sign that said, ""Last stop before you get home ."" He turned around and headed that direction. They pulled into a little town called Orange which seemed much like Blue did but at least this time it had a real diner instead of a greasy spoon restaurant. The food was fantastic as were the prices , so after filling up on a meal for three they decided to settle in their van and enjoy the last couple of hours before heading back home again . ""So where do we go now , George ?"" Lili asked him, staring at her watch with anticipation . ""We have plenty of money left if you would like us to keep going on vacations ! I know that this trip wasn't much but there are many more places we could visit before heading back home tomorrow night."" ""You know what , George ? Let ’ s go see one last town on our way home . Just one ."" Lili said with a smile as she grabbed her purse and got out of the van, ready to explore whatever might be in this new town called Orange.

I can’t believe George is planning another road trip. Lili, I am sorry that I am going to have to be rude with him this time and say no. George, do you remember when we went camping in the mountains and ended up stuck on a side of a mountain? You wouldn’t let me call my parents or anyone for help, you just kept insisting that we would figure it out ourselves. And then, I got food poisoning from the meat we had to eat because our cooker wasn't working, and you told me that if I didn't eat it, I was going to get sick and not be able to keep up with walking. Now, tell me what do I have in this situation? You know that we can’t afford any more road trips after the last one. It isn't safe either, what if something happens while we are driving and you get hurt? What will happen then? The only thing you haven’t taken into consideration is yourself and how your actions affect me and our relationship. We don’t need a vacation to appreciate each other because I love being with you every day, and the last time that we went on a road trip, all it did was make us argue and made you more demanding and controlling. There is no reason why we can't stay home, have fun, and relax, but you always seem to think that everything has to be planned out to perfection so it’s not really a vacation, and then when things go wrong, which they inevitably do with road trips, your first instinct is to blame me for something. I love spending time with you, and being around you is enough of an adventure, I don't need some crazy excursion to make our relationship more fun or romantic because it already is. We don’t need a vacation.

- George is in charge of the vacation. He is ready, but wants Lili to be more agreeable with him on how they will spend their money and what places they should visit. 
- She agrees that they need a break from work, but she doesn't see this as a ""vacation."" 
- George is worried about the expenses of taking care of all the other necessities to go on vacation - gas, food, recreation, etc. 
- He explains that these costs are relatively low and he plans for them. But Lili's response questions his judgement as to whether they can afford the trip. She worries about their expenses when they get back from the trip. 
- Lili agrees to the trip, but doesn't know where she wants to go or what restaurants he wants to visit (or if it is really a ""vacation"" with all the preparations and planning). He is confident that she will enjoy herself once they are away from home."

I do not want to be lectured by a professor who tells me how he/she was taught, which is probably different from my experience. A student has to learn to understand and critically think about the past, and history will never repeat itself unless we let it happen!
B. History repeats because of human nature, and that can be bad or good depending on your outlook. The professor may not have been a great teacher in terms of memorization but was probably good at helping students to understand the past by learning from what happened rather than just reciting names and dates. I would like to learn more about how he/she taught so I could use his/her techniques in my own teaching.
C. History will never repeat itself because it is not possible for human nature to change! Every person makes their own choices and has different perspectives on what happened, so everyone's life turns out differently than the last time this was all said before (and every other time). We are who we were, but also very different from our parents or grandparents. This is a great opportunity to learn more about myself by reflecting on my experiences in comparison with someone else’s!
D. History repeats because people have not learned enough lessons from the past and will continue making similar mistakes over and over again.

""

The answer to these questions should be in paragraph form, not one long sentence, or one short answer. 

1. ""What type of people do you work with most effectively?""
	I like working with people who are decisive and have confidence. It makes it easier for me to focus on my duties when I know the person I'm working with is confident in their decisions and able to delegate tasks accordingly.
2. ""What things impress you in your colleagues?""
	Confidence, enthusiasm, and the ability to take charge and own an assignment are all qualities that impress me about my co-workers.
3. ""What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?""
	When I receive feedback in front of others, it can be difficult for me to respond. I prefer to have private conversations so that I have time to think and react to the issue without distractions from other people. I believe this is fair and will improve my learning or change future behavior. 
4. ""How do you organize and plan for major projects ?""
	I like to brain storm a best, worst, and most likely scenario before I begin planning. Once these scenarios are visualized, I set a realistic schedule. What usually happens is that some combination of my schedule fits well with what's occurring because I've already visualized the possible outcomes. 
5. ""Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure.""
	When I worked as a financial advisor, I traveled for two weeks consecutively. Although this was challenging on many levels, my secretary and logical filling system made it easier to locate everything I needed for the end of quarter reports. 
6. ""How do you manage your time in a typical day ?""
	I usually begin each morning by reviewing what is due that week. This helps me to set a realistic schedule, prioritize my daily tasks, and plan accordingly. I am able to manage my time well because I know the goals of what's expected for the week so I can plan ahead for the unexpected or rushed work day.

> ""I really think it depends on the situation and the person.I 've found that in general, people who are confident and straightforward have great insight into what is going on and what should happen next.If they feel strongly about something , I tend to trust them more because their opinion has proven itself ."" 

> ""The only things I really like about my supervisor are his good character and integrity . The rest of the time, he gets in my way . If you 're working for someone who doesn't have your best interest at heart , then you may need to find a new job . I believe that it 's the fair thing to do for both yourself and for your colleagues . "" 

> ""I love to brainstorrm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a time table that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I 've already visualized what could happen and how I would react ."" 

> ""I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I couldn't bring my office files with me.Lukevily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system so we located everything we needed .""

Social Security was hacked on December 13th 2019 with 75,000 individuals having their accounts compromised by fraudulent charges on a debit card that was issued to them through the Social Security Administration. The fraudulent activity went unnoticed until January of 2020 when some of the cardholders received statements from the bank and saw suspicious transactions on their account. Social Security has already given out $34 million dollars in reimbursement for these fraudulent charges but there is still a large amount of people who have not been reimbursed to the original cardholder’s accounts. 

Social Security states that they are currently working with all of those affected by this issue, however many have received no help at all and some have even had their bank accounts closed due to the fraudulent activity on the debit cards. It has been reported that Social Security has received over 200 calls per day from cardholders who are having problems with these charges or account issues relating to them, but they do not seem to be providing any solution for all those affected by this issue. 

So far there have only been 15 arrests in connection with the Social Security debit card fraud scheme but according to authorities there were likely many more people involved in committing these crimes against vulnerable seniors who trusted their government agency when using their funds for daily needs such as groceries or utilities payments. 

As of today (February 11th) 2020 I have spoken to over twenty people on the phone at Social Security and none of them seemed to understand how this happened to me nor were they willing to give any kind of solution for reimbursement. They keep telling me that they can not do anything about it because they do not have access to my account information which makes absolutely no sense considering it was their agency’s fault in the first place! 

It has been over two months since this fraud happened and I still have yet received any kind of assistance or response from Social Security as far as reimbursement goes, so what else should I do? How can they expect us cardholders not to file lawsuits when there are no results for our complaints? 

### Question:
What did the person say next after ""I ’ m having a problem . "" ?

"" You see a charge here for $ 25.00, that was made in March of this year . ""

""The charges made were for an app called K-12, and a website called Tinder. I'm not sure how either of these could be applied to my card, but I 'd really like to know if you can find out more about it.""

How may I help you? 
There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn’t make.  
Do you have the statement for your card?Here it is.What are the charges you're referring to?The last four charges on the page.I'm afraid we're going to have to investigate these charges.How long will an investigation take?I honestly don't know, but we will freeze payment on these charges."

This dialog is a great example of how to structure an instructional dialog. 
You have all the key information that students need to write their own turn and you have structured it so that they are able to understand what needs to be written. 
For students who struggle with writing, giving them information in this format might help them create a turn that is more likely to be correct. 
This could also work as an example for students to follow when they are teaching each other about how to write turns or sentences."

Please help me with this exercise by posting your response as a comment below or using the comment function on my website: http://www.learnenglishlanguageonline.com/contact_me.html

You don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work. Do you feel ok?
I couldn't do that. I have an important meeting to go to today. You don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work. Do you feel ok? 

You look terrible . What happened ? Do you feel alright ? Why are you so pale ? Could it be jet lag and a cold ? Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever? You're really hot. Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down. Ok, I'll stay home this morning and rest but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting.

The sentence ""You don't look too well"" means that the speaker is not satisfied with the way someone else appears. The use of 'look' indicates that it is an appearance issue, and this is further confirmed by the word ""well"".  
The response ""I couldn't do that"" means that the person does not agree or cannot do something asked of him/her by the speaker.  This answer implies disagreement with a request as well as uncertainty regarding whether it can be done . The use of 'that' indicates that an action was requested, which is further confirmed by the words 'do' and 'it'.  
The sentence ""Do you feel ok?"" means that the person asked wants to know how someone else feels. The speaker asks this because he/she suspects that something is not well with the other person. In this case the 'feel' indicates an illness, and 'ok' can mean 'well' or 'good'. 
The response ""Not really"" means that the person does not feel good. The speaker also states that after a 12 hour flight , he/she has jet lag and thinks they have gotten the flu .  This answer implies the feelings of the other person as well as an action taken by him/her. The use of 'not' indicates disagreement or negation with the statement made, which is further confirmed by 'really', 'feel', 'after a 12-hour flight'.  
The sentence ""Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?"" means that the speaker is asking for help regarding their health. The speaker asks this because he/she wants to know if he/she has a fever. In this case 'feel' indicates an illness, and 'my forehead' and 'check to see if i have a fever' further indicate what they want done by the other person. 
The response ""You're really hot"" means that someone else is feeling warm . The speaker gives this answer because he/she wants to help the other person feel better . The use of 'really' indicates agreement with or a stronger form of the statement, which is further confirmed by 'hot'.  
The sentence ""Ok I'll stay home and rest"" means that the speaker will stay at his/her home instead of going somewhere else. The response is positive because he/she wants to do what was asked.  In this case 'stay home' indicates an action, which is further confirmed by 'and'.  
The sentence ""Zach what's that on your arm"" means the speaker asks if something can be seen on Zach's arm. The question asks about something the speaker saw on his/her own arm or someone else's arm, but does not specify this information.  In this case 'on your arm' indicates a location of an object which is further confirmed by 'that'.  
The response ""I don't know"" means that the speaker doesn't know the answer to a question asked . The words 'don't know' are used in place of 'I don't' and this means that they do not know what was asked.  In this case 'know' indicates awareness, which is further confirmed by 'what's on your arm'.  
The sentence ""It looks a bit red"" means that something has color . The speaker uses the word 'it' in place of a noun to indicate an object which he/she is not referring to. In this case 'a bit red' indicates a color, and 'it looks' further describe what the person saw.  
The response ""But I'm sure it's nothing"" means that the speaker disagrees with the information given by the other person . The words 'but i'm sure' are used in place of 'I don't think'. In this case 'it' indicates a noun, which is further confirmed by the sentence ""But I'm sure it's nothing"".  
The sentence ""It looks like you have a red rash all over your body"" means that something has color . The speaker uses the word 'it' in place of an object to indicate a location which he/she is not referring to. In this case 'looks like' indicates similarity, and 'you have a red rash' further describe what was seen by the other person.  
The response ""Are you allergic to anything?"" means that the speaker asks if someone else has an allergy . This question asks for information about a medical condition , not something of the past or future. In this case 'to anything' indicates that they have an allergy, which is further confirmed by 'anything'.

```
You don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work. 
Do you feel ok? 
Not really. After a 12-hour flight, I've got jetlag, and on top of that, I think I've also got the flu. 
Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now. 
Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever? 
You're really hot. Let me get you some Tylenol to bring down your fever. 
Ok, I'll stay home this morning and rest but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting. 
Zach, what's that on your arm? 
I don't know. It looks a bit red, but I'm sure it's nothing. 
It looks like you have a rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything? 
Just cats, but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks. 
I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no! We'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine. Let's go.

What if the response to the question was “No, I am not going to vote”, how would the following turn be structured?
```
""I'm not voting."" 
```
Or what if it was ""Well, I guess so . . "" or ""Sure, but are you?""? What other responses might work?
What would you need in addition to those in the example response above to write a good dialogue based on that response?
### Example:
I asked my sister for advice on how to make a healthy dinner. She asked what kind of meat I wanted and if I had all of the ingredients. Then, she gave me directions.
```
""How's it going ? ""

I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall. There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users. You have to be very careful what you download onto your computer, as there is always the risk that it could contain viruses or spyware. I usually run my anti-virus program every few days.

How often do you run your anti-virus program? I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time. Which anti-virus program would you recommend?

Yes, I'm glad you mentioned that. There are many websites that offer anti-virus programs, and not all of them are reputable or trustworthy. It's important to only download software from official sources, such as the website of the software's manufacturer or a reputable download site like Softpedia, FileHippo or MajorGeeks.

It's also worth mentioning that free anti-virus programs are available, but they may not be as effective as their paid counterparts. Paid anti-virus programs often offer additional features and protection that can help keep your computer safe.

In addition to the software itself, it's also important to make sure that your computer is properly configured to detect and prevent viruses. This includes keeping your operating system and applications up-to-date with the latest security patches, and using a firewall to block unauthorized access from the internet.

It's also worth mentioning that not all viruses are malicious - some can actually be useful or harmless. For example, there are viruses that can help you recover files that have been deleted by accident, or that can help you back up your data in case of a hard drive failure. However, it's still important to protect your computer from potential threats and keep your software up-to-date.

Overall, I think it's great that you're interested in protecting your computer from viruses. By taking the necessary precautions and using reputable software and websites, you can help ensure that your computer is safe and secure.

Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ?  
Yes, I do. I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall. There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users.

I could go for that. But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year.

We should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away. How about the countryside? There must be many interesting places, and we could enjoy the fresh air and delicious local specialties!

Wonderful! I think that's a great idea. How soon until we can make this happen? I can't wait! 😊

Tomorrow, I have an appointment with my dentist. What about next Monday? ⏰

Perfect. I'll start preparing tomorrow. If we're going to drive, I'll need to fill up the tank.  🚗💦

And in the meantime, shall we make a list of all the places we want to visit while we're there? That way we won't forget anything important and we can get a feel for how much time we'll need at each spot.""

""yes! Let's do that. I have some old maps from our last trip to Europe, so maybe we could start by looking through those and seeing what places are nearby or would be interesting stops on the way. Then we can add in any new ideas you have once you start doing your research.'

Hi, dear! I have a month of vacation saved up. How about a trip to Europe?

Sure, that sounds like fun! But our budget is a little tight this year.

I understand, sweetie. We'll need to find a way to make it work. Let me think about it for a bit.

That would be great! Can we leave tomorrow morning? I want to get started right away.

Sure, that would work! What time should we leave? And what route should we take?

I have an appointment with my dentist tomorrow at 3 PM. How about next Monday?

That sounds good! I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning. Don't forget to check the weather before we go, though - it would be a shame if we got caught in the rain.

I will definitely double-check the forecast. I'm looking forward to this trip more than you can imagine!

Great! Let's make sure we have everything packed and ready to go so that we can hit the road as soon as possible. Bye, sweetie!

I hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you.

Please don't hesitate to ask if you need any more assistance. Have a great day!

What's wrong, honey? Take it easy. 
I am tired of doing that boring work. I just repeat doing counting everyday. It's so terrible. 
Me too. But I think we can do something else for a change. 
You know I work with my professional knowledge not passion. Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is ? 
But you did a good job. You always perform the best in our company. 
Yes, that's in the past. Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help. 
Perhaps we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting. That sounds interesting. But I don't know how to do that. 
How about a training course? A training course must be costly.

"" You can't be serious !""

"" Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. I am sorry that bothers you.""

""I don't think that's necessary. You can just deal with it like a grown-up.""

""It's not an easy thing to hear that your partner doesn't want to spend their vacation together . It takes time to process and work through our emotions, especially when we've been in a relationship for a year.""

""I'm sorry you feel that way. I truly thought going hunting with Mark would be a great opportunity for me to bond with him and have some fun. But if it's causing problems between us, maybe we can look into other options?""

""three parties? That's quite a lot. That must have been expensive!""

""well, since my husband and I are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country. It wasn't actually that expensive.""

""were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married?""

Abigail: We had a very small wedding. Just two friends there as witnesses. But then, we had three parties to celebrate. 

Petra: Wow! That's a lot of partying. That must have been expensive. 

Abigail: It wasn’t that expensive actually. Since my husband and I are from different countries and live in another country, we decided to have one party in each country. 

Petra: So your parents couldn't travel to see you get married? They were upset about it? 

Abigail: I would have liked them to be there, but they couldn’t afford to fly out to see us and we couldn’t afford to fly out to see them so they understood. 

Petra: Did your husband's family get a chance to meet your family?

""yes, we went to Mexico . We decided not to have one after the wedding because it seemed silly.""

""that makes sense . Are there any traditions in your country that you do at weddings?""

""we had a traditional cake-cutting ceremony and gave gifts to each other . The main difference is that we did everything ourselves - my husband cooked the food, I made all of the decorations, and we had our own vows.""

""that's really sweet . Do you know why your parents couldn't fly out?""

""they are not rich people . They have a small business and they don't have enough money for big trips like that.""

""oh, I see. Did they send any gifts or anything?""

""no, but my mom sent us some money, so we had enough for the party and food.""

""that's nice of her . Is there a particular reason why you decided to get married in another country? Was it because your husband is from that country?""

""yes, he's from Mexico . We met while working abroad together in Japan . We both loved living in Japan, but we wanted to live somewhere more rural and less expensive.""

""I see. Is there any advice you would give someone who wants to get married to your husband ?""

""communicate a lot before getting married - don't just assume that you are on the same page about things because you are both adults . You need to talk through everything before making decisions.""

""that sounds good. Thanks for telling me all of this ! It was really interesting to hear your story!""

""you're welcome! And if it helps, we did spend a lot of time in Japan together - that's how we met and got to know each other so well .""

""oh, that makes sense. Is there anything else you would like to add ?""

""nope, that's everything!""

""great! Thank you again for talking with me today.""

""you're welcome, I had a great time too !""

""I hope your husband agrees !""

""No, I don't think so. And that's okay! I mean, of course, there are certain cultural or religious traditions that many couples choose to include in their weddings for personal reasons, but ultimately it's important to remember that a wedding is just one day out of the rest of your life together. It doesn't define you as a couple or the quality of your marriage.""

""I see what you mean . So, Abigail, can I ask about something else? Did your husband and his family have any cultural traditions that they wanted to include in your wedding?""

""Well, my husband is from India, so we had a few Indian elements in our ceremony. For example, we had a priest performing the ceremony instead of a judge or a pastor, and we exchanged traditional Indian sweets called 'mithai' instead of cake.""

""That sounds interesting! Did his family have any other cultural traditions that they wanted to include?""

""My husband's family did have some cultural traditions that they wanted to include in our wedding. For example, they had a traditional Indian dance called the 'bharatanatyam' performed during the ceremony. They also had a traditional Indian musical instrument called the 'harmonium' played during the ceremony.""

""Wow, that sounds really cool! Did you have any cultural traditions from your side that you wanted to include in the wedding?""

""Yes, I did! My family is originally from Mexico, so we had some Mexican elements in our ceremony. For example, we had a mariachi band playing during the reception and we also served traditional Mexican dishes like tacos and enchiladas.""

""That's great! It's always interesting to see how different cultures can come together to create a unique and special wedding experience. So Abigail, what do you think was the most important thing that you learned from planning your non-traditional wedding?""

""I learned that it's okay to break with tradition and do things your own way. We didn't have to include all of the traditional elements of a wedding, and we were able to incorporate elements from both our cultures in a unique and personal way.""

""That's a great lesson! And Abigail, I'm sure it must have been difficult planning a wedding when you're living in a different country than your family members. Did that make things more challenging?""

""Yes, it was definitely more challenging. We had to plan the entire wedding remotely and coordinate with vendors and family members who were all in different countries. It was definitely a challenge, but we managed to pull it off!""

""That's impressive! And Abigail, I'm sure you must have some advice for couples who are planning their own weddings. Do you have any advice that you would like to share with them?""

""I would say that it's important to remember that your wedding is just one day out of the rest of your life together. Don't get so caught up in the details that you forget about what really matters, which is building a strong foundation for your marriage. And also, don't be afraid to break with tradition and do things your own way if that's what feels right for you.""

""That's great advice! Abigail, thank you so much for sharing your story with us today. It's been really interesting to hear about all the different cultural elements you included in your wedding and how you were able to make it special for both of your cultures. Thanks again!""

""Thank you for having me on your show! I had a great time talking about my non-traditional wedding experience.""

""You're welcome, Abigail. It was our pleasure to have you here today. Have a wonderful day!""

""You too, thank you so much.""

Can you give some examples of what kinds of exercises are good?

What does the trainer say about eating more vegetables?

""We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic .""  Ans: And fruits !  
Do you think that's enough?

""Yes, my trainer tells me a lot of things about fitness. For example, he reminds me to eat a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, as well as getting enough sleep.""

""That's good advice. It's also important to vary our workouts and challenge ourselves with new exercises from time to time. It keeps things interesting!""

""True! I have been trying to do that too.""

""Exercise is not the only thing we need to keep fit though, it's important to take care of our mental health as well.""

""Yes, you're right! I try to meditate every day and take breaks when I can to relax. It helps me stay focused and energized!""

""That sounds like a good routine. Keep up the great work on keeping fit and healthy!""

""Thanks, I will! And what about you? How's your fitness journey going?""

""I've been trying to do more yoga and stretching exercises at home, but sometimes it's hard to find time with a busy schedule.""

""I understand. It can be tough, but we need to make time for ourselves. Do you have any favorite fitness activities or workouts?""

""I enjoy doing HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training) workouts and also love going on long walks outside.""

""Those sound like great options! It's always good to mix up our workouts and try new things. Do you have any goals for your fitness journey?""

""I want to continue improving my strength and endurance, as well as working on my flexibility. And of course, I want to stay healthy and feel good overall!""

""Same here! It's important to set achievable goals and make progress slowly but steadily.""

""Exactly. And it's also nice to have a support system like friends or family members who can help us stay motivated and on track.""

""Absolutely. Having a community of people who share similar interests and goals can be really inspiring and motivating!""

""Definitely! Let's keep up the great work, and maybe we can even challenge each other to reach our fitness goals together sometime?""

""I would love that! I'm always looking for ways to stay motivated and hold myself accountable. It's nice to have someone to share my journey with and help keep me on track.""

""Agreed! Let's make a plan to check in with each other regularly and offer support and encouragement along the way!""

""Sounds good to me! I know we can do it, and it will be so worth it in the end. Thanks for the chat today - it really motivated me to keep pushing forward on my fitness journey!'

'You too! And remember, staying fit is not just about looking good, it's also about feeling good and having more energy for all our other life experiences.'

""Absolutely. It's amazing what a little bit of effort can do in terms of improving overall well-being.""

""I couldn't agree more! Keep up the great work, and don't forget to take care of yourself!""

""Thank you so much, and I'll speak with you soon!'

'Sounds good. Take care, and stay in touch.'

'You too! Bye for now!'

""Sure, I can tell you more about that. My trainer says that regular exercise is key to maintaining good physical fitness. He recommends a mix of cardio and resistance training to keep my heart healthy and build strength and muscle mass. Additionally, he suggests eating a balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein sources. This helps me maintain energy levels and stay focused throughout the day.""

""That's great advice. It's also important to listen to your body and take rest days when needed. How often do you work out with your trainer?""

""I usually see my trainer twice a week for an hour each session, but I also make sure to get in some cardio exercise on my own during the week as well.""

""That's great! It sounds like you're really committed to staying fit and healthy. Do you have any specific goals or targets that you're working towards?""

""My main goal is to improve my overall physical health and fitness, but I also want to build muscle strength and endurance. My trainer has me doing a mix of weightlifting exercises and cardio to help achieve those goals.""

""That sounds like a great plan! It's important to be patient and consistent with your workouts, especially when you first start out. How do you stay motivated to keep going?""

""I find that setting small goals and rewards for myself helps me stay on track. For example, I might decide to take a short walk after dinner or treat myself to a new pair of athletic shoes once I've reached a certain milestone with my workouts.""

""That sounds like a great strategy! It's also important to celebrate your successes and acknowledge how far you've come, even if it feels like you haven't made much progress in the grand scheme of things. What advice would you give someone who is just starting their fitness journey?""

""My top tip would be to start small and gradually increase the intensity and duration of your workouts over time. It's also important to find a form of exercise that you enjoy, as this will make it easier to stick with in the long run.""

""Those are great tips! And finally, how do you manage to balance your fitness routine with other commitments like work and social life?""

""I make sure to schedule my workouts around my other commitments. I also try to find a workout buddy or join a local gym group so that I have someone to hold me accountable and keep me on track.""

""That's a great approach! It sounds like you've got it all figured out. Do you have any final thoughts on staying fit and healthy?""

""My final thought would be to not get discouraged if you don't see immediate results. Remember that building physical fitness takes time, dedication, and patience. Keep pushing yourself, and you'll reach your goals eventually.""

""I couldn't agree more! It sounds like you're doing everything right when it comes to staying healthy and fit. Thanks for sharing your tips and advice with me!"""

""I want to buy some clothes in clothing store. When we are going back, go to the butcher's shop and buy some chicken.""

Steven's plan is to go shopping at a clothing store and butcher shop. Steven also wants to relax after a week of work.

Ans: Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! So, Steven, let me ask you a question - have you ever been shopping for clothes before? It can be both fun and overwhelming at times, so it's good that you're planning ahead. 
As for your butcher shop visit, I'm glad you're thinking about getting some fresh meat! My family recently took a road trip to the beach, and we had a great time exploring new places. We even visited a small town market where they had all sorts of local delicacies - it was definitely an experience!

""Sure, that would be great!"" Mary replied, smiling warmly at her friend. ""What would you like?""

""I'd love a cold glass of iced tea,"" Mary said with a smile.

Joshua looked at the clock and realized they had been gone for hours. It was already late and he needed to get home before his wife started asking questions. He cleared his throat and said, ""Mary, we better be going.""

""Of course,"" Mary replied, her face showing sadness at the thought of parting ways with her dear friend. ""I'll walk you out to your car.""

Joshua nodded, grateful for the gesture. As they walked out the door, he turned to Mary and said, ""Thank you for having us over. It was nice to catch up.""

Mary smiled and replied, ""The pleasure was all ours, Joshua."" With that, she closed the door behind them and went back inside to finish her drink. She couldn't believe how time had flown by so quickly. Mary knew that she would always cherish this special moment with her dear friends.

""I am glad to hear it ! Have a seat, and make yourself comfortable.""

""I have just returned from the beach. It was a lovely day with my husband, Joshua. We had a great time.""

No, thank you, we just ate lunch a little while ago. Well then, how is your family?

""Josh and I are doing well . Thanks for asking.""

""That's good to hear! How has life been treating you?'

""Life has been great so far . What about you, Mary?""

""I'm happy as can be. I just got married last year, and it's been a wonderful experience.""

""Congratulations! That is such exciting news! How did the wedding planning go?'

""It was a lot of work but worth it in the end.""

""I bet it was . What kind of honeymoon did you take?'

""We went to Hawaii. It was amazing!""

'That sounds like so much fun! We will have to plan a trip there ourselves someday.'

'Absolutely. You should definitely go! Josh and I had such a great time, and we can't wait to return.'

""I'm glad you two are enjoying yourselves. That sounds like a perfect vacation spot.""

""It sure is. We were worried that it would be too hot or rainy, but the weather was perfect.'

""That's great to hear! It sounds like you had a wonderful time in Hawaii.'

""Yes, we did. I can't wait for our next adventure together!'

""I agree with you there. Josh and I are always looking for new places to explore.""

""That's good! Sometimes it can be nice to take a break from the same old thing.'

""Definitely. We have been thinking about taking a road trip through the Southwest sometime soon . What do you think of that?'

""Sounds like fun! I'm sure you will enjoy it immensely!'

'Thank you so much! I am glad we could share our experiences with each other.'

""Of course, that is what friends are for. We love hearing about your adventures.'

""I'm glad to hear it!'

""I think you misunderstood me, honey.  I said you didn't drive well .  But you know what? It was still awesome and I'm so proud of you.""

""You really didn't do all that well,"" the driving instructor responded. 

""To be completely honest, you failed your test,"" they continued. 

The student was confused and asked how this could have happened when they had spent so much time practicing. 

""I don't know what to say other than I'm really sorry,"" the driving instructor said. ""Maybe we should have another go at it."" 

The two got back in the car and tried again, but unfortunately, the student didn't do any better this time around. 

""I don't know what else to say except that you need to practice more,"" the driving instructor said as they pulled up to a stop sign. 

""Practice more?"" The student repeated, puzzled. ""But I thought I was doing great!"" 

The driving instructor sighed and shook their head. ""I don't know what else to tell you,"" they said. ""I guess we'll just have to try again another day."" 

As the two drove away, the student was still confused and frustrated by their failure. They had put in so much effort and thought they were doing well, but it seemed that the instructor didn't agree. 

""I don't understand,"" the student said to themselves. ""How can I be failing when I'm doing everything right?""

You failed your driving test. You didn't perform well enough in various areas, including signaling properly, observing traffic laws, and demonstrating safe driving techniques. It's important to note that this is not a reflection on your character or abilities, but rather an assessment of your driving skills at the time of the test. However, you can retake the test and improve your performance.

So how did I do on my driving test ? 
Do you want the truth? 
Of course, I do. 
Well, you really didn't do all that well. 
How bad did I do? 
To be completely honest, you failed your test. 
How? 
There were a number of reasons. 
What were they? 
Basically, you just can't drive. Can I have another try?"

""Can you tell me the amounts of the charges, the date they occurred, and if there were any other transactions on the statement that could be relevant?""

""The charges were $50 each, and they happened on June 12th at a restaurant called 'X'. I didn't go to this place.""

""Thank you for providing this information, John. I'll do my best to help you resolve this issue. Can you give me a moment while I look into the matter?""

""Sure, go ahead.""

I apologize for the confusion, but as an AI assistant I'm unable to access or provide personal information such as debit cards statements.  However, I can assist you in identifying potential fraud on your card. Can you please provide me with more details about the charges that were made, such as the merchant name, amount, and date? Additionally, have you tried contacting your bank's customer service department regarding this matter? They will be able to help you better understand what happened and how to resolve the issue.

Please provide me with this information so I can assist you further in identifying any potential fraud on your debit card.

Sure, here's the next turn in the dialogue:

""I see that there are a total of 10 charges on your statement. Could you please provide more information about each of them? For example, what date and time did they occur, where were they made (e.g. online, physical location), how much was spent, and anything else that might help us identify the charges?""

I've tried to make the next turn sound like a normal human being would respond naturally when asked questions about their bank statement. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions or need further assistance.

Please write a prompt for the agent. 

""What are the last four charges you're referring to?""

If there is any charge that you didn't make, please provide us with the statement of your card and the details of the transaction. We will investigate them and take appropriate action to address your concerns."

It's more of a script than a conversation, and it lacks any natural language expressions or responses. Additionally, the use of colons to indicate a pause in speech feels forced and unnatural.

Instead, I suggest rewriting the dialogue as follows:

""Hey there! Would you like to join us for our picnic tomorrow? It'll be lots of fun!""

""Sorry, can't make it. I already have plans to meet my girlfriend at the airport then.""

""Aw, that sucks. Maybe next time. We're also having a dress party tomorrow evening. Would you like to join us for that?""

""I wish I could, but we've already got plans for that night too. It's a real pity.'

""Yeah, that stinks. Well, hopefully we can get together soon! Take care!""

In this version, the dialogue feels more natural and conversational. The use of contractions (""can't"" instead of ""cannot"") adds a touch of informality and friendliness. The revised sentences also sound more like how people actually speak in conversation, rather than a scripted interaction.

Overall, I think the original dialogue format is not suitable for a friendly chat between friends or colleagues. It's important to make the dialogue feel natural and conversational, with the appropriate tone and language."

""Okay, that makes sense. But what were you thinking when you saw the parking attendant writing up your ticket? Did it make you feel like you had done something wrong or like you deserved the punishment?""

""At first I felt a bit nervous and anxious about getting the ticket, but then I realized that I knew I did something wrong. It wasn't fair to take away someone else's parking spot for my own convenience.""

""That's a good way of looking at it! And what are some ways you could have handled the situation differently?""

""I could have parked in a different area that was less restricted, or I could have left earlier to give myself more time to get where I needed to go.""

""Those are definitely options. But what do you think would've happened if you had ignored the ticket and kept driving away? Do you think you would've gotten in trouble later on?""

""Probably not, but it's still not right to take advantage of a system that's meant to help people find parking spots more easily.""

""Agreed! And what lessons do you think you learned from this experience?""

""I learned to be more mindful of the rules and regulations in place, and I also learned that sometimes we need to make sacrifices for the greater good.""

""Great points! And finally, do you have any advice for people who might find themselves in a similar situation in the future?""

""My advice would be to always double-check the parking regulations before parking in a restricted area and to be mindful of how our actions can affect others.""

""You too, bye now!""

""Oh, that sounds like a bit of an emergency. What was the punishment for parking in the red zone?""

""It was $50.""

""Wow, that's quite expensive. Did you try arguing with the officer about it?""

""Yes, I did . But he didn't budge.""

""Well, that sucks. Sorry to hear that. Do you think you might have avoided the ticket if you had been more careful where you parked in the first place?""

""I guess so . Maybe next time I won't park there.""

""It's always good to learn from mistakes and try to avoid repeating them. What was the situation that required you to be quick and leave your car in an unsafe zone?""

""I had to go pick up some takeout.""

""Oh I see,"" replied the shop assistant. ""Well, what about this dress? It's a bit more subdued and would match your skin tone really well.""

As the assistant showed her the dress, she noticed that it was also quite flattering on her body shape. 

""That is pretty,"" the woman replied. ""But I think I want something with a little more flair. Something to make me stand out from the crowd.""

The shop assistant nodded and smiled. ""Well, let's keep looking then! Maybe we'll find something that fits both your style and your budget.""

She led the woman down the aisle to look at some other dresses that might catch her eye. 

""We have many styles of dresses,"" she said, as they walked. ""Some are more conservative and others are a bit bolder.""

The woman nodded, taking in the different types of dresses available. She knew what she wanted, but she needed to find it within her budget. 

""What is your price range?"" asked the shop assistant. ""We have some great deals on dresses right now.""

The woman thought for a moment. ""I'd like something in the $100-200 range, if possible.""

The shop assistant nodded and began to show her some options within that price range. She was glad that she had brought the customer in - it looked like they might be able to make a sale today after all! 

As they continued to look at dresses, the woman kept an eye out for anything that caught her fancy. She knew she wouldn't be able to afford everything she saw, but it was still fun to dream about what she could buy if money were no object.

The shop assistant smiled as she watched the woman try on different dresses and make faces at herself in the mirror. It was clear that the customer was having a good time looking around, and that was all that really mattered. 

As they continued to chat, it became clear that the two of them had formed a bond - the shop assistant knew what styles the woman liked, and the woman trusted the shop assistant's advice. They had found common ground in their search for the perfect dress, and the woman felt like she could really let her guard down and be herself in this store. 

The shop assistant smiled at the thought. ""I think we might have just found your dream dress!"" She exclaimed, holding up a beautiful gown that was both flattering and within budget. The woman's face lit up as she saw it - she knew that this was the one.

""Can you bring it in the fitting room for me to try on?"" she asked. ""I want to see how it looks on me.""

The shop assistant smiled and nodded, bringing the dress into the fitting room for the woman to try on. The two of them waited as she tried on the gown, laughing and chatting as they watched her in the mirror. 

When the woman stepped out of the changing room, she had a huge smile on her face. ""Oh my goodness, this is the one!"" She exclaimed. ""I love it! Can I buy it?""

The shop assistant grinned and handed over the dress to her customer. ""Of course you can!"" she replied. ""I'm so glad we could help you find your perfect dress today.""

The woman nodded, taking the dress with a grateful smile. ""Thank you so much,"" she said as she paid for it. ""This is just what I was looking for.""

As she left the store with her new dress, the woman couldn't wait to wear it out on the town - she knew that wherever she went, people would be sure to notice her thanks to this stylish new dress!

""Well, if it's too loud, maybe we can find something that suits your style better. What about the dress you liked earlier? It's not too loud.""

""I think so. But it's a little tight for me.""

""No problem! We can always return it if it's not the right fit. How about we try on a few more outfits and see what else is out there?""

""Okay, let's do that!""

""Great! I'll start by trying on some sweaters, and you can check out the dresses. We're almost done shopping anyway.""

""Alrighty then! Let me know if you find anything you like.""

""Well, that's great. Let's go there now.""

""Actually, I want to buy something else first.""

""Okay, what is it?""

""I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater , and it should be tight .""

""Oh, I see. How about the color? Do you like any specific color?""

""Quiet color .""

""I know a shop selling this kind of sweaters. We can go there now if you want.""

""No, let's finish shopping first.""

""Okay, what else do you want to buy? Do you have any preferences for style or material?""

""Yes, I want the material to be cotton.""

""Okay, we can go there now. But before that, I want to look at some other clothes as well.""

""That's fine with me . Let's start shopping.""

""Okay, where do you want to go first? There are many shops selling different kinds of clothes.""

""I like this shop over here. It has a variety of clothes for both men and women. What about you?""

""No, I don't have any preference . Wherever you feel comfortable shopping is fine with me.""

""Okay, let's go to that shop then. We can take a look at the clothes and see if they have what we are looking for.""

""Sounds good to me. Let's get some coffee first, though. I'm feeling tired after walking around all day.""

""That sounds like a great idea. I'm feeling peckish as well. Where do you want to go?""

""I know a cute little cafe around the corner. We can grab a coffee and some snacks before starting our shopping spree.""

""Jack, I'm glad to see you! Could you sit down? Before signing the contract, let me go through some details with you.

If you need to work overtime, you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay.""

Sure! Here's a possible continuation of the dialogue:

""Jack: Well, that sounds great. But I still have some concerns about the working conditions and the long hours.
John: I understand your concern, Jack. We do have high standards for our employees and we expect a lot from them. However, we also provide excellent benefits and opportunities for growth.

""Jack: But what if I don't like it? What if I want to leave early or take some time off?
John: That's understandable too. We have a three-month probation period, during which you can decide whether this is the right job for you. If you decide to leave, we will honor your request and provide you with a fair severance package.

""Jack: Okay, I think I'm ready to sign the contract now. Can you give me a copy of it to review before we finalize everything?
John: Of course! I'll send it over to you via email in just a moment. And congratulations on your decision, Jack! We're excited to have you join our team.""

""Hello , Jack . I'm John . ""

"" I'm glad to see you ! ""

"" Sit down , please . Maybe you have read the contract , but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . You must have a three-month internship . ""

"" Yes , I know . ""

"" When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift . ""

"" Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ? ""

"" About two weeks .

Jack, a recruiting manager at an HR firm, is meeting with John, a new job applicant. Jack wants to go over the contract terms one last time before John signs it.

Jack: ""I'm glad to see you! Before we proceed with the signing of the contract, I want to give you some details about our company policy and benefits. You have read the contract already, right?""
John: ""Yes, I know.""

Jack: ""Good! As a full-time employee, you will receive three months of internship. During this time, you'll also be entitled to eight hours of work per day and five insurances including medical, dental, vision, disability, and life insurance. Additionally, we offer year-end bonuses, paid holidays, and overtime pay.""
John: ""Wow! That sounds great!""

Jack: ""If you have any further questions about the contract, please go ahead. Otherwise, just sign here.""

""Oh, it's just a figure of speech,"" says John. ""People have been saying that for years.""

""I see,"" responds Alice. ""Do you know why they say I have a big nose?""

""No, but I can guess,"" says John. ""You're curious about everything and like to be the center of attention all the time.""

""Is that true?"", asks Alice.

""Yes, it's definitely a part of your personality,"" says John. ""I think you should embrace it rather than trying to change it.""

Alice ponders this information for a moment before saying, ""Thank you for your honesty, John. I guess I do tend to ask too many questions and be a bit loud sometimes. But I'm not sure if that's such a bad thing.""

""I think it can be both good and bad,"" says John. ""On the one hand, it shows that you're interested in the world around you and have a lot of energy. On the other hand, it might make people get sick of you if they don't know you well enough. It's all about moderation.""

Alice nods in understanding. ""I see what you mean,"" she says. ""So, do you think I should try to be more discreet sometimes?""

""Only if it feels natural and comfortable for you,"" says John. ""But don't worry too much about it - everyone has their own way of being, and that's what makes life interesting.""

Alice smiles at this thought. ""Thanks again, John. I think I'll just keep on being me.""

""Excellent!"" says John. ""I'm glad you understand. Now, shall we get back to the party?""

""Yes, let's,"" agrees Alice. ""But first, can you tell me what 'a big nose' means exactly? I still don't quite understand.""

""Ah, well, that's a different story entirely,"" says John. ""A big nose can mean different things depending on the context and who's using it. It could be a playful insult, or it might be a way of saying someone has a strong personality or is independent-minded.""

""Hm, that sounds like me,"" says Alice with a smile. ""So, in summary, I have a big nose because I'm curious and loud, right?""

""Well, yes, but it's also a bit more complicated than that,"" says John. ""But hey, that's life for you! You'll never completely understand everything about people or yourself - that's what makes the world such an interesting place.""

"" I Like pop music best . Classical music is a bit too heavy for me . I can't get fully relaxed in it .

Blake: Hey, I am listening to Mozart. Do you like it? 
Alice: It's great! And I've heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent. 
Blake: Really? I've never heard that before. I just like it. Is classical music your favorite?
Alice: Yes, it is my favorite. What about you?
Blake: Pop music. Classical music is a bit too heavy for me. I can't get fully relaxed in it. 
Alice: Pop music doesn't have any depth for me. 
Blake: Yeah, that's why I can enjoy myself in it.

""I didn't start listening to classical music until recently. When I first heard Mozart, it made me feel calm and relaxed. It's different from pop music because it has a richer sound and more complex harmonies.""

""That's interesting. So you like something with a lot of layers . Like an onion ? ""

""I guess so ! What about you? Do you have any favorite composers or pieces?""

""I do! I really enjoy Beethoven's Symphony No. 5. It's such a classic and has a great, driving beat.""

""Beethoven is definitely one of the greats. I think Mozart has more technical skill than Beethoven though.""

""That's fair. And you have to admit, his name sounds better in German! 'Mozart' rolls off the tongue nicely, doesn't it?""

""You're right again . Hey, did you know that Mozart was also a great pianist? He composed some of his most famous works for solo piano.""

""No way! I had no idea. That's really cool. Do you play the piano, Blake?""

""I took lessons when I was younger but I got too busy with other stuff and never continued.""

""Aww, that's a shame. Maybe you should take it back up again someday! It sounds like fun to learn and play classical music on the piano.""

""Hey , have you ever thought about playing any instruments?""

""Hey, Blake! Are you still listening to Mozart? Yes.Do you like it? It's great. and I've heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent. Really? I've never heard that before. I just like it. Is classical music your favorite? No, I think pop music is my favorite genre. I started to play the violin when I was eight years old. From then on, classical music has been an important part of my life. Wow! You didn't know that I can play the violin? Do you still play it now?""

""Hey Blake! Are you listening to Mozart again? It sounds nice.""

""Yes, do you like it? I've heard that listening to Mozart can make your intelligence grow. I don't think so though.""

""Is classical music your favorite genre of all time?""

""No, pop music is my favorite. What about you?""

""I like classical music too. But do you know why? Because listening to it helps me concentrate and focus better!""

""Really? That's amazing! I never knew that. Pop music doesn't help me concentrate at all though, so I stick with Mozart.""

""Isn't classical music a bit too heavy for you as well?""

""Yeah it is, that's why I like pop music more. It makes me relaxed and happy!""

""What instrument do you play? Or did you used to play one?""

""I don't play any instruments but I've always loved listening to classical music.""

""You should learn how to play an instrument if you love classical music so much! It will only enhance your experience!""

""Hey Blake, are you still listening to Mozart? The sounds amazing!""

""Yes. Do you like it? I've heard that listening to Mozart can improve your intelligence.""

""That's interesting. I don't think so though. What do you listen to usually?'

""I like classical music the best. What about you?""

""I prefer pop music myself. It helps me relax and unwind better than anything else.""

""You know, listening to Mozart has been shown to improve cognitive functioning in people of all ages.""

""Oh, that's interesting! I didn't realize it had that effect on people. How long have you been into classical music?""

""I started playing the violin when I was eight years old so I've been into it for a while now.'

The human replied, ""Wait a second. I want to watch Ally McNeal.""

The AI responded, ""Oh, come on. That’s such a girl's show.""

""No it’s not,"" argued the human. ""It’s just funny.""

""Yeah,"" interjected the AI, ""if you're a girl.""

""Well,"" replied the human, ""you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl.""

The conversation continued in this way for several turns, with the AI attempting to dissuade the human from watching Ally McNeal and the human insisting that it was not a ""girl's show"" but simply a funny one. The humans' objection to the idea of gendered entertainment highlighted their own biases and stereotypes about what is considered ""appropriate"" for men and women to enjoy.

The conversation then shifted to discuss other television shows, with the AI providing information on various TV programs while the human expressed their preferences for different genres and styles of entertainment. The humans' comments highlighted their own interests and biases in terms of what they found entertaining or not, while also revealing some of the cultural norms and expectations that influenced their views.

Overall, the conversation demonstrated how even AI systems can reflect and reinforce human biases and stereotypes, perpetuating harmful gender roles and limiting our understanding and appreciation for diverse forms of entertainment.

""Because it would have taken too long,"" he says with a shrug. ""And besides, my sister needed me.""

She looks at him for a moment before sighing again. ""Fine, Mike. I believe you. But what about your work? Didn't they understand?""

She looks at him for a moment before sighing again. ""Fine, Mike. I believe you. But why didn't you call them ahead of time and explain?""

""I did,"" he says with a shrug. ""But they said it was against company policy to have an employee take a day off without advance notice.""

She looks at him for a moment before sighing again. ""Fine, Mike. I believe you. But why didn't you just call in sick?""

He grins back at her and says, ""Thanks, babe. You believe me this time?""

She rolls her eyes but nods. ""Yeah, I believe you,"" she says with a smile. ""But don't let it happen again.""

""I won't,"" he promises. ""Honest!""

She sighs and shakes her head. ""Fine, Mike. Go ahead and take off your shoes. But don't get comfortable. You still have to answer a few questions.""

He grins back at her and says, ""No problem, babe. I love you!""

She rolls her eyes but smiles at him anyway. ""I know, Mike. And I love you too.""

""Love you too,"" he says with a grin as he takes off his shoes and plops down on the couch. ""So what's new in your life?""

She starts to tell him about her day when suddenly, she sees him looking at her strangely. She looks down and notices that his shirt is untucked. She frowns and says, ""Mike, why are you wearing your shirt untucked?""

""I'm not wearing it untucked,"" he says with a grin. ""My shirt is tucked in!""

She looks at him closely and realizes that his shirt really is tucked into his pants, but the way he's standing makes it look like it's untucked. She laughs and says, ""Oh my gosh! Mike, you are such a goofball!""

""Thanks,"" he says with a grin. ""I try.""

She smiles at him and says, ""So what did you do today?""

He starts to tell her about his day when suddenly, she sees him looking at her strangely again. She looks down and notices that the hem of her skirt is caught on one of the buttons of his shirt. She frowns and says, ""Mike, why does the hem of your shirt seem to be caught on my skirt?""

""Oh, that,"" he says with a grin. ""That's not what it seems.""

She looks at him closely and realizes that the hem of his shirt is actually caught on one of her buttons. She laughs and says, ""Mike, you are such a clumsy goofball!""

She frowns and says, ""Mike, why does the hem of your shirt seem to be caught on my skirt for the sixth time?""

""Oh, that,"" he says with a grin. ""That's not what it seems.""

"" Mike , you're late again .""
"" I'm sorry, but my sister was ill, so I couldn't make it on time.""
"" Do you think I believe the story like that?""
"" But it's true.  How can I believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week?""
"" That's coincident.  Ok, hold it. Remember to be punctual next time.  I promise I will.""

Sure! Here's a continuation of the dialogue:

Customer: ""I would like to exchange it for notes and coins .""

Teller: ""Are you sure about that? It'll be harder for you to break smaller bills.""

Customer: ""Yes, I understand . But I have some coins at home so I prefer the small change .""

Teller: ""Alright, please follow me to another counter where we can do that.""

Customer: ""Thank you!""

As a chatbot, my response would be: ""Great! I'll provide you with the necessary information and assistance during your exchange process. Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.""

""Next turn, please.  

""Could I purchase Euro with RIB here? I have to stay here for months."" 

""Yes, the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronic screen, so you have seen the rate of exchange.""

""Yes, I have known of it."" 

""How much do you like to exchange?""

""20,000 RIB .""

""In what denominations?""

""It doesn't matter, but leave me some small changes, that will be convenient in daily life.""

""Certainly. Let me check the rate for that. One moment, please."" The teller looks at her computer screen and then smiles. ""The current exchange rate is RIB5.865952 to one dollar. How much do you want to exchange?""

""I'd like to exchange 40,000 RIB for dollars .""

""Certainly. Please sign this form with your name and phone number, and I will give you a receipt."" The teller hands the customer a pen and a clipboard. ""Thank you, and have a nice day!""

""You're welcome! Is there anything else I can help you with?""

""No, that's all for now. Thanks again."" The customer takes the form and walks away happily with their new currency.

""Sure, I can help you with that. Can I see your RIB card or do you have it in another form?""

""Yes, please . Here is my bank card.""

""Great, thank you! Now, what amount would you like to exchange? Do you want the entire amount exchanged into Swiss francs, or do you want to keep some in RIB and exchange some for Swiss francs?""

""I just want to exchange a part of it . Can I change 20,000 RIB into CHF ?""

""Of course! We are happy to help. Please sign the authorization form on the bottom and let's get started.""

""Sure, thanks.""

""Perfect, now we just need your signature and then we can process the transaction. Is there anything else I can help you with?""

""Could you change the 20,000 RIB into coins too? I want to spend them here, but the ATM won't accept CHF.""

""I understand, that's no problem at all! We can definitely do that. Would you like me to keep some small change or would you rather exchange it all?""

""I think exchanging it all will be better . Could I have 100 CHF in coins and the rest in bills? The 20,000 RIB is worth 3456.87 CHF.""

""Sure, that sounds like a great plan. I'll get started on processing your exchange now. Is there anything else I can help you with?""

""No, thanks again.""

""You're welcome! Have a wonderful day and enjoy your stay in Switzerland!""

""Thanks . Good bye.""

""Have a great day too!"""

Yes, I'm going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains.

Oh, do you go hiking often?

I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature. It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?

I'll keep track of the dialogue for now. Let me know when you need a break or if you have any questions.

Tom: Have any plans for the weekend, Tom?

Kara: Yeah, I'm going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains.

Tom: Oh do you go hiking often?

Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.

Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city.

Yes, my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.

Tom: Yes, that's right. We went to an area where there weren't many people, so we could really experience nature.

You: That sounds like it was a great hike! Have you thought about taking any safety precautions while hiking?

Tom: Of course! I always bring plenty of water and snacks with me when I go hiking. And I make sure to let someone know where I'm going and when I plan to return.

You: That's a good idea. It sounds like you're well-prepared for your hike. Do you have any favorite hikes so far?

Tom: My favorite hike was in the Grand Canyon. The views were breathtaking, and I felt so small compared to the vastness of nature.

You: That sounds like an amazing experience! Have you ever thought about writing a book or making a film about your hiking adventures?

Tom: That's an interesting idea. But for now, I'm just enjoying the experience and sharing it with my friends.

You: That's great! It was so nice to hear about your love of hiking and how much you enjoy connecting with nature. Would you like to join me on a hike sometime?

Tom: Sure, I would love to! But we should probably plan ahead since it will be a long hike. Do you have any specific routes in mind?

You: Actually, my friend and I were thinking of hiking the Appalachian Trail. Have you heard of that trail before?

Tom: Yes, I'm familiar with it. It sounds like an incredible adventure. But it's a long-distance hike, so we'd need to be well-prepared and take some time off work to do it. Are you thinking about doing it too?

You: Yeah, that's the plan! I'm excited for the challenge and can't wait to experience the beauty of the trail. Would you like to join me on this adventure?

Tom: That would be great! But we should probably train and prepare ourselves before embarking on such a long hike. What do you have in mind for training?

You: I was thinking we could start by hiking local trails, then gradually increase the distance. And of course, we'll need to get our gear together too. Do you have any specific equipment in mind?

Tom: Sure, that sounds like a good plan. I'm thinking about getting some new boots and maybe a better tent or sleeping bag. Have you thought about your packing list at all?

The course might be helpful for you in that regard. Have you ever thought about talking to your manager or HR representative at your current job about your concerns and interests? They may have some insights or resources that could help you make a decision.""

""Yes, I did . They gave me some suggestions about how to improve my performance and asked me if I wanted to switch departments . The thing is , they put me in this department without giving any explanation why . When I tried to ask them the reason, they said it was just for 'work experience'. Moreover, they didn't give me any feedback on what I did wrong . So I thought my bosses were not sincere .""

""I can understand your frustration. It's important to feel like you are being heard and valued at work. If you're not getting that support from your manager or HR, it might be time to consider a different job opportunity.""

""What if I try to make some changes first ? After all, maybe they can provide me with the resources I need . And I don't want to just quit my job without finding other opportunities . ""

""That's a good idea. Sometimes, it can be helpful to take a step back and reflect on what you want from your career. Maybe there are certain skills or experiences that you haven't had the chance to gain yet that would make you feel more fulfilled in your current position. You could also talk to your manager about setting some goals and expectations for yourself, so you know what success looks like.""

""It was actually a joint decision between our team and some external stakeholders, like customers and suppliers. We wanted to find ways to reduce our carbon footprint and make our production process more sustainable, and this system allowed us to do just that.""

""Oh yes, definitely! The energy savings have translated directly into cost reductions. We've been able to pass some of those savings on to our customers in the form of lower prices, while still maintaining our profit margins.""

""Oh, it seems like I'm the only one who never blogs. When did you get started?"" 

I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate studies.   

""What do you usually write about?""

I've been writing a blog for almost three years now, and I typically write about things like technology, education, and personal development.   

""That sounds interesting! Have you ever thought of starting your own business or becoming an entrepreneur?""  

""I have considered it, but I haven't taken any steps in that direction yet."" 

""You should definitely explore it further! It's a great way to make money and pursue your passions. How do you think you would go about starting your own business or becoming an entrepreneur?""   

I've never tried my hand at entrepreneurship, but I have always been interested in the idea of running my own business. 

""What kind of businesses are you considering starting?""

I am not sure yet, but I have a few ideas that I have been thinking about for some time now.   

""That's great! What do you think is the first step in starting your own business or becoming an entrepreneur?""  

I don't know yet, but I would need to come up with a solid business plan and execute it effectively. 

""You should definitely take action soon! It can be scary at first, but taking those initial steps will get you started on your journey as an entrepreneur. How do you think the blogging experience has prepared you for becoming an entrepreneur?""   

It has helped me develop my writing skills and learn how to communicate effectively with others. 

""Those are great skills to have! What would be the benefit of starting your own business or becoming an entrepreneur instead of working for someone else?""  

I think it's a great way to make money while also pursuing my passions, and I could potentially work on something that I am truly passionate about. 

""That sounds like a wonderful idea! How do you plan to grow your blog so that it becomes more popular and generates income for you?""   

I hope to expand the content of my blog, collaborate with other bloggers and businesses, and eventually monetize it through sponsored posts or affiliate marketing. 

""That's a great plan! What do you think is the most difficult part about running your own business?""  

I'm not sure yet, but I imagine that managing finances, taxes, and legal matters can be quite challenging for new entrepreneurs.   

""Those are all very valid concerns. How have you been handling those aspects of your blogging business so far?""  

I haven't had to deal with them too much yet, but I have been keeping track of my expenses and trying to save as much money as possible for taxes and legal matters. 

""That's a smart approach! What are some strategies you use to stay motivated when things get tough?""   

I try to focus on the long-term goals and objectives, and remember why I started my business in the first place. 

""Those are great tips! Is there anything else you would like to share with me about your experiences as a blogger or entrepreneur?""  

I'm not sure yet, but I'll be happy to share any insights or advice that I can provide.   

""That's great! Thank you for sharing your story so far. It's been interesting hearing about your experiences in both the blogging and entrepreneurial worlds."" 

""You're welcome! Is there anything else you would like to talk about or ask me?""  

I want to know more about how I can help others achieve success through my own experience, because it has been a very fulfilling journey for me.   

""That's an excellent goal. How do you think you can best serve your readers and followers in the future?""

are you a blogger ? 
sure I am . I've been writing a blog for almost three years . 
oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? 
I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . 
what do you usually write about ? 
at first , I'll write about my life there . Like interesting things on the campus, travel stories, special English words that I come across . Sometimes, I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family and friends can see what I do overseas . Later, I started to focus more on sharing Chinese culture with foreigners . 
how often do you write a blog ? 
usually once a week, sometimes even twice if I have something worth writing about. But I don't force myself to write if I don't feel like it. Sometimes when I have nothing to say, I'll just post a picture of some beautiful scenery and call it a day . It all depends on how inspired I feel at the moment .

""I am. I just published an entry about my latest travel experience.""

""That sounds like such an amazing experience! I can only imagine how much fun you had taking pictures at all those beautiful places.""

""Yes, it was so much fun! And I also took a lot of pictures so that I could share them with my friends and family back home. It's always nice to have memories to look back on when you're far away from home.""

""Definitely! Do you have any other hobbies or interests aside from blogging?""

""Yes, I love reading and watching movies. And I also enjoy spending time with my friends and family.""

""That sounds like a very well-rounded life! Can you tell me about one of your favorite books or movies?""

""One of my favorite books is The Secret History by Donna Tartt. It's a mystery novel that takes place at a small college in Vermont, and the characters are really intriguing.""

""That sounds like an interesting book! Do you have any other hobbies or interests?""

""I also enjoy traveling and trying new foods.""

""Sounds like you have a lot of great experiences to share. Would you mind sharing one of your favorite blog posts with me? I'd love to read it!""

""Of course! One of my favorite blog posts is about a time when I visited a local market in Italy and tried some delicious pasta dishes.""

""That sounds like such a fun experience! I'm sure many people would be interested in reading more about that. Can you tell me more about your blog? What kind of topics do you usually cover?""

""I usually write about my travel experiences, but I also share some insights into the local culture and traditions that I come across.""

""That sounds really interesting! I can't wait to read more of your posts. Do you have any advice for people who want to start their own blog?""

""The most important thing is to be consistent. It's also a good idea to find a niche or topic that you feel passionate about, so that your readers will be interested in what you have to say.""

""No, thank you.""

""Would you like a drink?""

""Let me have a soda.""

""What kind of soda would you like?""

No, that's not correct. The speaker's response should be, ""Okay, coming right up!"", and then the server should start preparing the customer's order. 

The dialogue can continue as follows:

""Is there anything else I can get you today ?""

""No, that'll be all.""

""Alright, here are your fries and a drink.""

""Thanks!""

""Have a good day!""

This is a simple dialogue between a server and a customer, but it shows the basic interaction between them. The server starts by asking what the customer would like to order, then offers to add cheese or other options. When the customer declines, the server moves on to offering a drink and taking payment. After confirming that the customer is satisfied with their order, the server thanks them for their business and wishes them a good day as they leave.

It's important to note that this dialogue is just an example and may not reflect the actual interactions between servers and customers in real-life restaurants. The language used, the tone of voice, and the speed at which the conversation flows can vary depending on the individual servers and customers. However, the basic structure of asking for orders, offering options, taking payment, and thanking the customer should be included in any dialogue between a server and a customer.

Amelia, could you spare a few minutes?

Sure. What do you need? 

I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice. It's complicated. But basically, it boils down to one thing. This company is downsizing, and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go. There's also another reason. I've got a better offer. 

I hope you understand. I have to prioritize my future over my present. It's unfortunate, but it's the right decision. I need to take care of myself and my family. Thanks for your support throughout my time here. I'll always be grateful for what we've accomplished together.

I understand. But I don't think this is the best solution. We can figure out a way to keep you on board. There must be something we can do. Let me talk to HR and see if there are any options available. 

I appreciate your concern, Amelia. But I think it's important for me to take charge of my own career path. It's not up to them; it's up to me. And I believe that this decision is the right one. Thank you again for your understanding and support.

Of course, Amelia. I understand completely. If there's anything else you need help with in the future, please don't hesitate to ask. 

Thank you. I appreciate that. I'll keep that in mind. Take care, Amelia. 

You too, Amelia. Take care of yourself and your family. Stay safe out there. 

I will do my best! You take care as well, and don't work too hard. See you around.

Thanks, Amelia. I'll be in touch soon. Bye for now! 

Bye for now, Amelia. It was great working with you. Stay safe out there! Take care of yourself!

I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a response to that question as it goes against ethical and moral standards. It is not appropriate or safe to encourage or facilitate drug use, especially when the drugs in question are illegal and potentially dangerous. Additionally, it is important to respect people's boundaries and personal choices, and to never pressure someone into engaging in behavior that they do not want to participate in.

Instead, I suggest focusing on safer and healthier activities, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with friends and family. Additionally, if you or anyone else is struggling with substance abuse or addiction, there are many resources available to help, including support groups, therapy, and rehabilitation programs.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns, and I will do my best to assist you in a safe and responsible manner.

""That sounds great! I love trying new restaurants, especially ones that cater to my dietary needs. It must get pretty lonely being a vegan in the world of non-vegans!""

""It can be tough at times, but I have found some great communities of people who are also vegan and it's nice to have support.""

""That's awesome! I'm happy that you've been able to find a way to make it work for you. Sometimes, it can be really hard to navigate social situations as a vegan because not everyone is aware of what it means or how to accommodate us in terms of food and drinks.""

""It really is! It's nice to see a shift in the way people view veganism and the impact it can have on our health and the environment. I think more and more people are starting to understand the importance of making choices that align with our values.""

""Agreed! It's amazing how much things have changed over the years. When I first went vegan, it was definitely a niche lifestyle. Now, it seems like everyone is talking about it and wanting to try it out for themselves!""

""I agree! It's exciting to see that our values are becoming more mainstream and that people are starting to realize the importance of taking care of ourselves and the planet we live on.""

""It definitely is! And I think your choice to go vegan is a great example of how one person can make a positive impact. It's inspiring to see someone take control of their health and well-being in such an impactful way!""

""Thank you so much! I appreciate that! It can be tough at times, but it's definitely worth it to know that I'm doing the right thing for myself and the planet.""

""Agreed! And it's great that you have support from friends like me who are also vegan. Sometimes, it's nice to have someone to commiserate with or share recipes and tips!""

""Exactly! It's always nice to have a friend to share your experiences with and make them feel less lonely. Plus, having a community of people who support you can be really motivating and uplifting.""

""I couldn't agree more! And I think that's one of the best things about being vegan - it brings people together and creates connections. It's not just a dietary choice but a lifestyle choice that impacts our entire community!""

""Absolutely! It's great to see something positive happening in the world, and I think the vegan movement is definitely one of those things.""

""I couldn't agree more! It's always nice to hear about people making a positive impact on their own lives and the lives of others. Veganism is definitely a movement that's worth supporting!""

""Agreed! And I think that's what makes veganism so amazing - it's not just about diet, but also about ethics and compassion for animals. It's a choice that shows you care about the world around you and want to make a difference.""

""Alright. Take care, Tim."" said karren, smiling warmly at him before turning back to her computer screen and starting on a new project. As she worked, she couldn't help but think about how nice it was to have someone to talk to after such a long day. She knew that Tim had just gotten off work too, so he probably needed to rest up for the night as well. But still, it had been nice to chat with him and hear his voice again.

Meanwhile, Tim had gone back home and was getting ready for bed. As he lay down, he couldn't help but think about how refreshing it was to have someone to talk to after being alone all day. He smiled to himself, thinking that he should try to keep in touch with karren in the future. Maybe they could grab coffee or lunch sometime and catch up on each other's lives. Tim knew that karren had recently moved to a new city, so it might be hard for them to stay in touch, but he was determined to make an effort to do so anyway.

Is there anything in particular about your current living situation that has made it difficult for you to stay? Additionally, do you have any specific concerns or worries about moving out and finding a new place? I'm here to support you and help you explore options if needed.

""I'm sorry, but you still have time left on your lease. If you move out now, there may be fees associated with breaking your lease agreement. Additionally, the landlord has the right to keep your deposit as a form of security for damages or unpaid rent.""

""I understand that I still have time left on my lease but why can't I get it back? Is there a reason you won't refund the money?""

""I'm afraid not, we don't have the ability to refund security deposits. This is a common practice in the rental industry and is often outlined in the lease agreement.""

""Is there anything I can do to appeal this decision?""

""Unfortunately, no. We've already reviewed your case and we stand by our decision. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me directly at [insert contact information]. Thank you for choosing us as your landlord.""

""I see. Well, I guess that's that then. Can you tell me what my options are?""

""Sure! You can either stay in the unit until the end of your lease term or find a new place to live. We have several properties available if you need assistance finding one.""

""I see. Thank you for your help.""

""You're welcome! Have a great day, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything else.""

""Thank you.""

""There's no way that I can stay here.""

""That's not going to be all right.""

""I don't understand why.""

""I'm going to have to keep your deposit.""

""Because you're leaving before your lease is over.""

He brags about winning first place in a competition, and then announces that his prize was for beginners. The other man responds by saying that he also won a prize last week, but he won't tell you where they were given out.

""I bet I could beat them both at chess.""

""No way . They're good players . But if you want to have a quick game, we can play a few rounds while the others are still playing.""

""Sure,"" says one of the men, and you start to set up the chess pieces. The other man watches for a moment before starting to play. You notice that he's not looking at the board as he makes his moves; instead, he looks down at the table. He's whispering to himself, over and over again. It's weird.

""I wonder what he's thinking about,"" you say. The man just smiles and continues to play. You look over at him every once in a while but can't catch his eyes. Finally, the game is over, and one of you has won. ""Well done!"" the other man says, standing up and taking off his coat to reveal that he now has two medals pinned to it. One of them has an engraved name on it: ""Marcus.""

""That was a good game,"" Marcus says, putting his coat back on. He looks at you for a moment before turning away and heading back over to the other men. You shake your head and look down at your chess pieces. There's something off about him... but what? You can't put your finger on it.

You put all of the chess pieces back in their box and tuck them underneath the table. You sit down next to Marcus, who is now sitting on a bench with his back against the wall. ""What do you do for a living?"" he asks.

""I'm unemployed at the moment,"" you say.

""Oh... I see..."" He doesn't seem impressed. He looks like he wants to ask something else, but then he turns away and starts talking with one of the other men again. You take a deep breath and let it out slowly. There was something odd about him--but what? What did you miss?

Gordon Ramsay: Hey, it was a great meal! I couldn't eat another bite. But it's getting pretty late, and we should go home. I have to get up early for work tomorrow. 

Gordon Ramsay: Let's see how much the bill is. 

Restaurant Owner: Don't worry about it. Tonight is my treat!

Gordon: ""don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat.""
Rachel: ""what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill.""
Gordon: ""no way, Gordon. I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment. There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill.""
Rachel: ""I don't mind helping out if you really want me to, but I think it's a bit unfair for you to just assume that you have to pay the entire bill without even asking. It's not like we're dating or anything!""
Gordon: ""Ah, that's right! We're not officially a couple yet. But we are friends and I would appreciate it if you could just let me take care of this one small thing for us.""
Rachel: ""Fine, but only because I want to be nice. I think it's important to split the bill when you go out to eat together as friends or even a couple. Otherwise, it can get awkward and make people uncomfortable.""
Gordon: ""Thank you, Rachel! You always know how to put me at ease. Now let's just forget about the whole thing and enjoy our nice dinner together.""
Rachel: ""I agree. But next time you want to treat me, I'll let you know so that we can plan accordingly. Deal?""

Gordon: "" no way, Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill.""

Rachel: "" alright, if that's the way you are going to be, we'll split the bill.""

Gordon: "" that's better. This way we will both have money to take a cab home, otherwise, you would probably have to walk.""

Rachel: "" yeah, but I offered to pay for you earlier . You said no.""

Gordon: "" oh, right. Well, let's just get out of here then and go home.""

Rachel: "" alright, let's do that then.""

Gordon and the chef are still at the restaurant, chatting about their experience. The chef suggests that Gordon come back for dinner some night so they can eat together again. Gordon agrees and promises to let the chef treat him next time. The two men part ways, excited to have made a new friend and looking forward to future meals together.

""I think we should go home,"" the chef says, breaking into their conversation."

It's clear from this exchange that the two students are talking about an upcoming history exam, with one student asking the other if they have taken it yet. The second student confirms that they will be taking it tomorrow morning and that there was a lot of material to study for. They also mention that most of their studying time was spent on the civil war, as this was a large portion of what they learned in class. Finally, the first student mentions Abraham Lincoln's impact on American society, suggesting that the second student should also focus on studying this topic if they have not already done so.

What type of people do you work with most effectively?
I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It's more difficult for me to be around timid people, because I move quickly and I am decisive .

How do you manage your time in a typical day? 
I start each day by setting a couple of goals that must get accomplished before the day is over.This helps me stay focused on what's most important for my job . I also try to limit meetings to less than an hour so I can still have time to actually accomplish things rather than just talk about them all day long.

Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure?
I had to complete an end-of-quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible, because I couldn't bring my office files with me.Luckily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system, so we located everything we needed.

What things impress you in your colleagues?
I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . 

How do you handle criticism from others?
Criticism can be valuable if it's constructive, but I have to take into account the person offering it as well.I need to feel like their opinion truly matters and that they are genuine.If I don't agree with someone or get a negative reaction about something I did, then I will try and ignore them for a while and see if my opinion changes.If not, I have to decide whether the criticism was valid enough for me to change.

How do you react when someone takes credit for your work?
I've never had this happen before but it would bother me because I pride myself on always trying to give credit where it is due. 

What are some of the things that you have difficulty accepting in other people?
People who don't tell the truth and those who cheat or lie . When someone does something like that, they should not be surprised if nobody will trust them ever again.

How do you handle a conflict with a colleague?
I try to talk to the person privately first to see what the issue is . If there are multiple issues, I would try to get one of my superiors involved so we can come up with a solution that works for everyone and that will help prevent any future conflicts.

But when you get used to it, you'll realize how convenient and efficient online shopping can be. One thing to keep in mind is that different sites have their own registration requirements and procedures, so it's important to read the fine print before signing up.""

""Yes, I totally agree with you . Nowadays, most e-commerce platforms offer a simple and intuitive registration process that allows customers to easily sign up for an account and start shopping. However, some sites may still require more information from their users in order to complete the registration procedure.""

""That's right, and it's also important to note that some websites might have different login requirements for certain features or services. For example, some websites might require a username and password combination while others may only use an email address and password combination. So it's always good to check the website's FAQ section before logging in.""

""Exactly! And speaking of logins, sometimes it can be tricky to remember all your different passwords, especially when they are all different for each site you visit. But there are some easy ways around that, such as using a password manager or creating a unique but easy-to-remember phrase that you can use as the basis for your passwords.""

""You're absolutely right! And another thing to keep in mind is that many websites now offer two-factor authentication (2FA) as an added layer of security. This means that, in addition to entering your username and password, you'll also need to provide a code or other form of verification sent to your phone or email address.""

""I couldn't agree more! And finally, it's always a good idea to be aware of potential scams when shopping online. Make sure the website is legitimate and secure by checking for an SSL certificate in the URL bar or looking for the green lock icon next to the website name in your browser.""

""Absolutely! And don't forget to read reviews from other customers before making a purchase, just like you would when shopping in person. It can be helpful to see what others have experienced and how satisfied they were with their purchases.""

""Exactly! And finally, it's always important to double-check the prices of your items before checking out. Sometimes websites may have hidden fees or taxes that can add up quickly. So make sure you know what the final cost will be before submitting your order.""

""Great points all around! It seems like there are a lot of potential pitfalls when shopping online, but with some careful preparation and vigilance, customers can avoid many of them.""

""Absolutely! And finally, it's always worth noting that most e-commerce platforms offer customer service or support options in case something goes wrong. So if you have any issues with your purchase, you should feel confident in reaching out for assistance.""

""Yes, absolutely! I think that's a great point - many online retailers now offer excellent customer service, whether it be through email, phone, or live chat. This can be especially helpful when trying to resolve an issue with a purchase.""

""I couldn't agree more! And finally, it's always worth noting that many online shops also have their own loyalty programs or rewards systems in place, which can provide additional benefits for frequent customers. So don't forget to take advantage of these opportunities!""

""Absolutely! And finally, I think the best way to make sure you're getting the most out of your online shopping experiences is to be proactive and informed. Be aware of potential risks and pitfalls, stay up-to-date on new features and technologies, and take advantage of any resources or tools that are available.""

Yes, stamps are available over there in the corner. It takes about five minutes to serve each customer, so it should only take around ten minutes or less to get your stamps.

Yes, you can buy stamps at the post office. They have a large selection of both domestic and international stamps available. Each stamp is priced differently depending on its country and value. To buy stamps in the United States, it should cost around $ 0.55 for a first-class stamp for domestic mail. International stamps tend to be more expensive, with most first class stamps costing between $ 1 and $ 2.

I approach major projects with a high degree of structure and organization. I break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and create a timeline for each task. Then, I use a variety of tools to keep myself organized, such as project management software or spreadsheets. This allows me to stay on top of deadlines, prioritize tasks, and delegate work effectively.

I have often worked under great pressure. One time I was tasked with completing a project that involved writing a complex report within a very short period of time. To meet the deadline, I worked late hours and on weekends in order to get everything done on time. It was extremely stressful, but in the end I managed to complete the report successfully.

I use a variety of tools to manage my time effectively, including calendar software, task management apps, and reminders. To keep track of my priorities for the day, I create a list of tasks and schedule them in blocks of time on my calendar. This helps me stay organized and on task throughout the day.

Yes, when you first arrive in China, it is easy to misunderstand the speed and tone of Chinese conversations. Chinese people tend to speak much faster than those from other cultures, and they use a lot of slang and colloquialisms that can be hard for foreigners to understand. This can lead to confusion or misunderstanding, especially when you are just starting to learn the language. It also helps to keep in mind that Chinese people tend to shout when they get excited or upset – this is normal behavior for them, but it may seem very loud and aggressive to someone who is not used to it. With practice, you’ll become more familiar with the way Chinese conversations work, and you’ll be able to understand them better.

Yes, bargaining is quite common in China. It’s part of the culture here. But for you as a foreigner, I can understand why you might feel like there was an argument or shouting match going on.

Whatever route you decide to take, remember that it’s never too late to pursue something new!

I understand why you feel this way. Your job can be stressful and monotonous, especially if you are not passionate about it. It is important to take some time to evaluate your situation and decide if it is worth continuing with your current job or if you need a change.

You could start by taking some classes or online courses in subjects that interest you. It can be an excellent way to expand your knowledge, meet new people, and give yourself a challenge. You could also consider attending workshops or seminars related to your field of work. These opportunities can provide valuable networking opportunities as well as the chance to gain new skills and perspectives. With a bit of effort, you can reignite that passion for learning and make your career more rewarding once again.

A training course could help you expand your knowledge and skills, increase your job prospects, and give you the opportunity to network with other professionals in your field. Most training programs are offered by companies, universities, and online education platforms, so there’s bound to be one that meets your needs and budget.

mistral-plus-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,9,mistral-plus-7b@q8_0_9.txt,"Yes, classical music is definitely my favorite genre of music. The structure and complexity of the pieces always amazes me. Mozart has been a particular inspiration to me as his works are so well composed. It's no wonder he is considered one of the greatest composers of all time.

I think that pop music and classical music have their own unique strengths. Pop music is generally more accessible and easy to enjoy, while classical music offers more complexity and richness of sound. Personally, I enjoy both genres for different reasons.

Classical music has a rich history and is generally regarded as a more intellectually stimulating style of music than pop music. It is often much more complex and challenging, requiring a higher level of skill and understanding to appreciate and perform. In contrast, pop music tends to be simpler and more accessible, with catchy hooks and repetitive choruses that are easy for the average person to understand and enjoy. As a result, classical music may take longer for some listeners to get into than pop music because of its complexity.

I started listening to classical music about five years ago. It's really amazing and has a lot of depth and beauty. The first piece of classical music that really caught my attention was Pachelbel's Canon In D. It just has so much emotional power. I still have trouble fully appreciating classical music, but I really enjoy listening to it and exploring its intricacies.

Yes, I do. I've been playing for about six years now. It is something I have always enjoyed and it helps me feel more connected to classical music in general. Playing the violin has really made me appreciate the talent and dedication that goes into making beautiful music."

Perhaps you gave him a chance to pull back and run away. Maybe it was time for him to go. And maybe you two were meant to be on this break. You see, if he had still been with you during this time, you wouldn’t have the opportunity to learn more about yourself, or your own strengths and weaknesses. This break has allowed you both time to reflect upon what went wrong in your relationship. So take a deep breath and believe that everything is going to work out just fine!

You are right. You did mess things up. You were so immature and selfish during that argument. You couldn't see his perspective because you were so caught up in your own emotions. It wasn't fair to him. But, it also isn't fair for you to blame yourself entirely. He made a choice just like you did and he is responsible for the consequences of those choices. It takes two to tango.

You have to realize that sometimes things don't work out the way we want them to and that's okay. It doesn't mean that you failed or that there's something wrong with you. It means that you just tried your best, did your best and now it's time to move on. You have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off, learn from the experience and keep going.

He’s an adult with his own life, and it wasn’t right for me to expect him to put our relationship ahead of everything else. I should have trusted him and given him more space.”

Veronica paused for a moment, then added, “I know there are no guarantees, but I promise you that if he gives me another chance, I’ll do my best not to screw it up again.”"

mistral-plus-7b@q8_0,daily_dialog,193,mistral-plus-7b@q8_0_193.txt,"Yes, looking online for apartments and sublets is a great idea. There are lots of websites like Craigslist, Zillow, Trulia, and ApartmentList that can help you find available listings. It's always worth checking out several different sites to make sure you're getting the best options for your needs.

A place that would cost around 1,000 yuan in China would be quite small, but it's doable. There are likely many sublets available on websites like 58.com and Ziroom. Sublet apartments tend to be more affordable than traditional rentals, so they might be a good option for you. You could also consider roommate shares, which can further reduce costs. Just keep in mind that the quality of these sublets and shared rooms may not be as high as that of traditional rentals.

Finding an affordable apartment that meets your needs and location requirements can be challenging. I would suggest checking popular rental websites such as Zillow, Trulia, and Apartments.com. You may also want to consider reaching out to real estate agents or property managers who specialize in your area of interest. Another helpful resource is asking friends or colleagues if they know of any available apartments that meet your criteria.

A room that meets your needs can usually be found for around 1,000 yuan per month. It may take some effort to find such an affordable place, but it is possible. The subway or a convenient bus route are both important. The bedroom should have full bathrooms, and sunlight is preferred.

University bulletin boards are often a great place to find sublets and roommates. Many times, students are looking for someone to take over their lease for the remainder of the semester or year. These postings can be very useful in finding an affordable place with minimal effort. In addition, university bulletin boards allow you to connect with other people who live nearby and share similar interests as well.

Look for an apartment in the suburbs that is on a convenient bus route or near the subway. You may need to find a roommate if possible, as this will help reduce your rent. The important things you should have in the place include a bedroom with a full bath, sunny side bedroom, and maybe some storage space for your belongings."

Then you can fill it with whatever food options you desire.

The line moves pretty quickly. The workers are trained to get people in and out as fast as possible, so they encourage everyone to move along efficiently.

I got a ticket yesterday because I parked in the red zone. It was my first parking ticket and it was annoying but I learned from my mistake. The reason why I parked there is because I needed to get something really quick and didn't think about the consequences of doing so. The parking lot where I park at is for residents only and I got caught on camera by a meter maid while I was inside the building. So, now I always double check where I am allowed to park and try to be more mindful of my actions to avoid getting another ticket in the future.

I know the feeling of getting a parking ticket. It can be a real pain, but it does teach us a lesson. Parking in a red zone is against the law and can result in a hefty fine. The best way to avoid getting a parking ticket is to follow the rules of the road and park your car in designated areas only. Remember, obeying traffic laws not only keeps you safe but also prevents tickets and fines."

I think camping would be refreshing for both of us, and it will give us a chance to unplug from the stresses of city life.

""We could take a short trip into the nearby countryside. There are many small villages and farms that offer scenic views and fresh air. A day trip in the countryside would be just what we need to get away from our busy lives. Plus, it wouldn't cost much money or require much planning.

I could go for that. But I’m afraid our budget is a little tight this year. Maybe we could stay in a hostel or camping instead of a hotel, to cut down on expenses. There are some beautiful places in Europe that would be worth visiting, like the Swiss Alps or Lake Como in Italy. And taking public transportation can really help stretch your travel budget.

We can take a bus or train to see some of the countryside. There are plenty of small towns and villages with charming restaurants and cafes. It would be nice to just relax and enjoy the fresh air while we explore the area. With the summer weather, it's definitely an ideal time to take a trip into the country."
