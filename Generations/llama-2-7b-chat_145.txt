Corinna Scofield couldn't help but feel a sense of unease as she stood in the dimly lit kitchen, staring at the clock on the wall. It was already 8pm and her husband, James, was still out with his friends from work. She had been expecting him home hours ago, but there had been no sign of him. At first, she had tried to brush it off as a simple delay, but as the minutes ticked by and there was still no sign of him, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was wrong.
