TalkTalk has finally shaken its title as the most complained-about broadband provider, having been toppled by Virgin Media in Ofcom’s latest league tables.

The telecoms watchdog published its quarterly complaints data today, showing that TalkTalk had 16 complaints per 100,000 customers for Q3 of this year, compared to Virgin Media’s 24.

This is the first time TalkTalk has not been at the top of the table since Ofcom started publishing its data in 2005.
