President Barack Obama has announced that he will not take any action on immigration reform before the upcoming midterm elections. In a statement released by the White House, Obama said that he believes it is important to let Congress have the time and space to work on this issue. He went on to say that he remains committed to finding a comprehensive solution that includes both border security measures and a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.
