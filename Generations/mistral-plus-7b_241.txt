The North Korean test of its long-range ballistic missile on December 12 suggests the reclusive Asian country has made significant progress in developing a nuclear warhead capable of reaching U.S. shores, according to South Korean government officials. The test launch demonstrated North Korea's ability to send a device over an estimated 6,000 miles, which would be enough to reach the continental United States.

The launch was seen as a provocation by the United States and its allies in the region, with U.S. President Donald Trump calling it "a big, big problem" for the world. North Korea has long been working to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of carrying nuclear warheads, but this is believed to be the first time it has demonstrated such a capability.

The test launch of the Hwasong-15 ICBM showed that North Korea now has the ability to deliver a nuclear payload to anywhere in the United States. The missile was launched from a site near Pyongyang, and flew for 53 minutes before falling into the Sea of Japan. It reached an altitude of more than 2,800 miles and traveled a distance of more than 6,200 miles.

This launch has raised concerns among U.S. and international security experts that North Korea is now capable of striking the United States with nuclear weapons. The Trump administration has vowed to take tougher measures against Pyongyang in response to its latest provocation, including imposing stronger economic sanctions.
