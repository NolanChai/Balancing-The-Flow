Sir Roger Moore, who played James Bond in seven films, was known for his love of martinis. He famously ordered them shaken and not stirred, just like 007 himself. In an interview with the New York Times, Sir Roger once said that he preferred his martini “very cold and very dry” and that he liked to sip on it slowly while enjoying a good book or movie.
