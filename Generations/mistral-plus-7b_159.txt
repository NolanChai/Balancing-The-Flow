The Battle of Britain took place over the skies of southern England and was a decisive victory for the Royal Air Force (RAF) against the German Luftwaffe. It involved intense air combat between the two forces, with RAF pilots defending their country from Nazi attacks. The battle raged from July to October 1940 and was a turning point in World War II.
