 It appears that the owner of Obie, the once-obese dachshund, is under investigation by the Charitable Activities Section of the Oregon Attorney General's Office. This investigation could be related to charitable activities connected with Obie or his weight loss journey, as there have been various fundraising campaigns and publicity surrounding the dog's transformation.

It is essential for the owner to cooperate fully with the investigators to ensure a fair and transparent process. If any allegations of misconduct are found, it could potentially impact the owner's reputation and any future charitable activities related to Obie or animals in general. It is crucial for all parties involved to approach this situation with honesty and integrity.

In the meantime, the investigation may bring attention to obesity in pets and the importance of responsible pet ownership, as well as raise awareness about charities that focus on animal health and welfare. The investigation might also highlight the need for proper oversight and accountability within charitable organizations.

As this is an ongoing investigation, it's essential to allow the authorities to complete their work before drawing any conclusions or making further statements regarding the situation.
