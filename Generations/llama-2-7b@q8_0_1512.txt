- [x] McCluskie was stabbed and beaten to death by her brother John Paul Massey after he became annoyed that she would not give him some money. The 39-year old from Acton, West London, was found lying face down in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor at her home in September last year. An autopsy showed that she suffered 25 separate wounds, including 10 to her skull and 14 stab wounds. McCluskie had been hit so many times with an iron bar that a coroner said it was fortunate he did not kill her outright. The court heard how Massey became angry when she refused to give him money to pay off his debts and that he had made previous threats against her life because of this. He also accused her of taking drugs in front of their father. Massey denied murdering McCluskie but was found guilty on Friday at the Old Bailey after a trial which lasted eight days. The jury were told that Massey had made a number of threats to kill her and had been warned about his behaviour by police earlier in the year.
- [x] Massey, who has a history of drug use and mental health problems, also denied two charges of burglary relating to an incident at his girlfriend's home in the weeks before he killed McCluskie. The 26-year-old, from South Ealing, West London, was found guilty of both offences by a jury on Friday after a trial which lasted three days. The jury were told that Massey had become jealous when his girlfriend Rachelle Kerrigan, 31, began an affair with one of McCluskie's boyfriends. Massey was also found guilty of two counts of threatening to kill Mr Kerrigan and a charge of causing actual bodily harm against her. 


### Direction:
- [x] He attacked Mr Kerrigan and his friend with an iron bar during the burglary and threatened to kill both women unless they left him alone. In another incident Massey had threatened to stab Mr Kerrigan's girlfriend, who is pregnant, because she would not leave a property he was living in on her own.
- [x] He also admitted breaking into the home of an elderly couple who were holidaying in Spain and stealing Â£130 from them. 

### Result:
- [ ] The jury were unable to agree on their verdicts relating to two further charges against Massey, and these will be retried at a later date. Massey was remanded in custody ahead of his sentencing on March 25, when he is expected to be jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years. The court heard that Massey had been on the receiving end of McCluskie's fists in the past and the jury were told she may have tried to defend herself by grabbing his iron bar which was lying on her kitchen worktop when he attacked her.
- [ ] In a statement read to the court, McCluskie's brother said that she had been "a beautiful, intelligent woman who was taken from us too soon." He added: "I cannot express how sorry I am for what has happened. There will never be another like her. She was my little sister and I loved her dearly."
