A five-year-old Ohio girl died Wednesday after she tried to get out of a moving Jeep, authorities said. Cameron Laughlin was with a three-year-old child in the parked car, the State Highway Patrol told WKBN. The girls were playing when they climbed into the vehicle and accidentally started the engine. They reportedly got stuck in the Jeep as it began rolling forward.

Cameronâ€™s mother and a family member tried to pull her out of the car, but she was pinned against the door, according to WKBN. She was rushed to a hospital where she died from her injuries. The three-year-old girl survived unharmed.
