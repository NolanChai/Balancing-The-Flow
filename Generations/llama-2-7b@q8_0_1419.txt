This is a tough time for the PCC, as they have been under-fire from all corners over the last few years. The Home Office has just released figures on serious violence and it shows a 13% increase in homicides and violent offences across the UK. In Kent alone this means an extra 275 people were injured by knife crime, gun crime and other forms of assault between April 2017 to March 2018.

The police in our county are working hard to keep everyone safe but with limited resources and a tight budget it is becoming harder to protect the public from violence on the streets. A report released by the NHS showed that 24 people were killed in Kent last year as a result of knife crime, 23 more than the previous year.

The PCC is doing all she can but as I said previously, we need to see a shift in funding so we can fight these criminals better and keep the streets safe for everyone.
