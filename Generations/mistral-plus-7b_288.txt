President Barack Obama has authorized the use of U.S. military aircraft to help return Egyptian citizens who have fled to Tunisia to escape the ongoing unrest in Libya. The move follows a request from the Tunisian government for assistance in returning these individuals back to their home country.

The U.S. military will provide transportation and logistical support to facilitate this process, working closely with Tunisian officials and international organizations. The goal of this effort is to ensure that these displaced Egyptians can safely return to their homes in Egypt as soon as possible.
