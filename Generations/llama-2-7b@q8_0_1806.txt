The homo sapiens have been the only human beings which are believed to exist but there is one other specie in the world called Homo floresiensis. The skull discovered from the island of Flores was found by Mike Morwood and his team. 

It's a new species that belongs to genus 'Homo'. There were only few skeletal remains discovered which suggested that it belonged to the extinct hominid family. This discovery has proved that the modern humans have been living with another type of human being for thousands of years. In 2013, the bones of a woman named LB-1 were found in cave of Liang Bua on the island Flores and it was claimed to be the oldest fossil remains from the species ever discovered. She lived about 48,000 years ago during the Pleistocene epoch and is now believed to have been a woman who had an enlarged brain as compared to other Homo sapiens of her time but she was extremely small in size because of genetic mutation.
