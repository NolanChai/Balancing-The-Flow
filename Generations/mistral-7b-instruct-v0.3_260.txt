 staff at the luxury department store in London's Oxford Street were left "shocked" when the group of thieves made off with the high-end timepieces on Wednesday, according to prosecutors. The organized crime gang, which reportedly included both men and women, allegedly used a combination of distraction tactics and physical force to snatch the watches from display cabinets.

The suspects were said to have worn burkas and sunglasses in an attempt to blend in with the crowd and evade detection. They reportedly targeted Rolex and Cartier watches, some of which are valued at tens of thousands of pounds each. The total value of the stolen goods is estimated to be over Â£1.4 million.

Detectives from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad are investigating the incident and have arrested four people in connection with the theft. They are being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary. Selfridges has released a statement expressing its dismay at the incident and confirming that it is cooperating fully with the police investigation.

This is not the first time that organized crime gangs have targeted luxury stores in London. In recent years, there have been several high-profile heists at department stores such as Harrods and Harvey Nichols. The Metropolitan Police has vowed to crack down on such crimes and has increased its presence in areas known for luxury shopping.
