          The boy was just five when he refused his mother&rsquo;s command to put on an extra jumper and walked away from her into the thick forest near their home in Denmark, about 10 miles north of Copenhagen.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Their argument had been brewing since Christmas Day in 2009 when the boy refused to wear a pink dress. That was the last straw for his mother, who left him by himself after an argument that morning.</p>
