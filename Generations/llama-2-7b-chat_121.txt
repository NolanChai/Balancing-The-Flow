ITV's decision to switch off the volume during its coverage of the Royal Wedding has sparked controversy, with many viewers complaining that they were unable to hear the vows and other key moments of the ceremony. Despite this, the network claims that it made the move in order to avoid any potential disruptions or interference with the event itself. However, some have criticized ITV for prioritizing sound quality over the overall viewing experience, particularly given the historic nature of the occasion. While the decision has been met with mixed reactions, one thing is clear: the Royal Wedding was a moment that will be remembered for generations to come.
