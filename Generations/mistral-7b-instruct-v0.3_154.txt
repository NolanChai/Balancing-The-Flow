 costs associated with UK weddings. According to a report by wedding planning website hitched.co.uk, the average cost of a wedding in the UK has risen to Â£27,161, an increase of 8% since last year. This has led many couples to consider tying the knot abroad, where costs can be significantly lower.

The report found that popular destinations for British weddings abroad include Cyprus, Italy, Spain, and Thailand. These countries offer a combination of sunshine, beautiful scenery, and lower wedding costs, making them attractive options for cash-strapped couples.

Couples who opt for a destination wedding can save money on a number of expenses, including venue hire, catering, and entertainment. In some cases, they may also be able to invite more guests, as the cost per head is often lower abroad.

However, there are also challenges associated with getting married overseas. Couples will need to ensure that their wedding is legal in both the UK and the destination country, and may need to undergo additional paperwork and legal requirements. They will also need to consider travel arrangements for themselves and their guests, as well as accommodation and other logistics.

Despite these challenges, the appeal of a destination wedding is clear. With the average cost of a UK wedding continuing to rise, it's no wonder that more and more couples are choosing to say "I do" abroad.
