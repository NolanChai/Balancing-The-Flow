Spirit will have to post a sign in its ticket lobby that reads "We charge for bags." [/INST]  

But is that enough? Spirit has been clear about its bag fees on its website and mobile app, and even includes a link to the policy from its homepage. Yet it isn't satisfied with the rule, saying in a statement Wednesday that "the agency is attempting to dictate how airlines inform consumers of their policies."  

The rules also apply to bags weighing 50 pounds or less and measuring up to 62 inches . Those fees will vary by airline, but the DOT says on its website that "all U.S. airlines charge at least $30 for a first checked bag."

### Response:
Spirit is taking issue with how the rule has been implemented, saying in a statement Wednesday that the department's guidance was "unworkable" and would have required it to "display a sign in its ticket lobby that reads 'We charge for bags.'"  

The DOT says airlines must display "prominent, clear and conspicuous signs at each airline ticket counter." Spirit Airlines had raised concerns about this part of the rule when it was first published.  

Spirit said in a statement Wednesday that "we disagree with these requirements because they are not based on science and they do not improve consumer information."  

But other groups say that consumers need more transparency around airline prices, given how complicated it can be to compare costs for multiple destinations.  

The Consumers Union, the advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, said in a letter sent Wednesday to the DOT that "it's not enough just to tell people about these fees -- you have to show them."  

The group argues that this will help consumers shop for tickets with more confidence.  

In its statement, Spirit also disputed whether the sign would be necessary on its website or in its app because the company has "a large amount of space" on those platforms where it already discloses bag fees. The company also questioned how much the signs would cost airlines to implement at their ticket counters and gate areas.  

Spirit said that by putting up a sign that says "We charge for bags," the government is misrepresenting its policies because the airline doesn't charge customers more for bringing on board items in addition to those that can fit under the seat, such as computers or carry-on backpacks.  

The DOT said it expects airlines to use a "variety of means" to inform consumers about their bag policies and "will monitor compliance with these requirements closely."  

Spirit did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Wednesday night.  

Airlines for America, an industry trade group that includes Delta Air Lines (DAL), JetBlue Airways (JBLU) and United Airlines (UAL), said in a statement sent earlier this week that the rule change would provide "significant transparency benefits" to consumers.

### Response:
Airlines for America declined to comment on Spirit's objection, but it has been pushing the DOT to implement these rules since 2014 . In a letter sent Wednesday to the DOT in response to the rule changes, Airlines for America said that "these rules are long overdue."  

The trade group has argued in past letters that the industry's current practices don't give consumers enough information about whether airlines will charge them for checked bags and how much they will pay.  

Airlines for America also cited research by JD Power and Associates, a consumer-focused marketing firm, which found that the industry could benefit from providing better pricing transparency to consumers who are booking their tickets online . The trade group said that "increasing transparency would be beneficial for both passengers and airlines."  

Airlines for America says that its members have been implementing these changes on their own, but it still wants the DOT's rule to apply across all carriers.  

The trade group has also asked the DOT to reconsider whether it should require airlines to include a bag fee disclosure in their advertised prices, rather than just displaying a sign at the ticket counter or gate . It argued that this would allow airlines to be more flexible with how they display this information.

### Response:
Airlines for America did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Wednesday night.  

Spirit Airlines, meanwhile, is calling on the DOT to reconsider its sign requirement altogether. The airline argues that "these rules are unnecessary and unworkable."  

The company also claims it already provides customers with enough information about its bag policies on its website and mobile app. It says the signs required by the rule will be costly for it to implement at all of its ticket counters and gate areas, which it says it would have to do if the DOT were to enforce this requirement.

### Response:
Spirit Airlines said in a statement sent earlier this week that the rule change "could cost $10 million or more," but the airline declined to comment on how much of that figure was due solely to implementing signage at its ticket counters and gate areas.  

It's unclear exactly what the DOT had in mind when it required signs to be displayed at airlines' ticket counters and gate areas, and whether the agency anticipated this level of pushback from airlines on that particular part of the rule . In its original announcement, the DOT said the sign would have to be "large enough so that a customer is likely to notice it before purchasing a ticket." It added that it expects airlines to use other methods, such as signs at their check-in desks or in their advertised fares, to inform passengers about their bag policies.

### Response:
The DOT has not yet responded to CNN's request for comment on Wednesday night.  

Airlines for America did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Wednesday evening .  

It's unclear whether airlines will be able to delay implementing these rules or how much it will cost them to comply with the DOT's requirements. The agency has said that airlines that don't comply could face fines of up to $25,000 per violation, but it hasn't yet provided more details on this part of the rule.

### Response:
The DOT's rules will go into effect in November . Spirit Airlines said Wednesday that "we do not believe it is necessary or appropriate to display signs at ticket counters and gate areas."  

Spirit did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment on the agency's requirements.

### Response:
Airlines for America declined to say how much airlines might have to spend on this new rule . It said it expects the changes would be "costly" and that it is still analyzing all of its options.  

The trade group did not immediately respond to CNN's request for comment Wednesday night.  

But a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, which has been pushing for these requirements since 2014, said earlier this week that the rule change would be "minimal cost" compared with some of the other changes airlines have had to make in recent years.

Spirit Airlines Says DOT Bag Fee Rule is Unworkable

Spirit Airlines has been vocal about its displeasure with the US Department of Transportation's (DOT) new rule requiring airlines to inform consumers of their bag fees. The low-cost carrier claims that the signage requirement, which mandates that airlines post signs at ticket counters and gate areas, is "unworkable" and would cost it millions of dollars.

In a statement released Wednesday, Spirit Airlines criticized the DOT's decision as being "dictatorial" and not based on science. The company added that it already provides customers with enough information about its bag policies through its website and mobile app, and that displaying a sign at ticket counters and gate areas would be unnecessary and costly.
