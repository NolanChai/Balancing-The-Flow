According to the Orange County District Attorney's Office, the parents of the 11-year-old boy were taken into custody on Tuesday after authorities discovered the child living in a cage inside their home in Anaheim, California. The boy was reportedly found in a "small, dark and confined space" with no food or water, and was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. The parents, whose names have not been released, are facing charges of felony child abuse and are being held without bail.
