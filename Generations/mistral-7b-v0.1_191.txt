In the video, they talk about a lot of different things. One thing that stood out to me was when they were talking about how much money the federal government gives to the states. They said that they give more than $500 billion dollars to the states each year. I think it would be interesting to see how much money we spend on all kinds of different things like this.

### Connection:
The connection between this video and my learning goal is that it shows how we have a lot of problems with our government.
