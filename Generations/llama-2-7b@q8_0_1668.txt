> The following day, Colbert's new show debuted on Comedy Central, and it was as much about Iraq as any other program on TV, said Tom Shales of the **Washington Post**. In the first episode, Colbert introduced viewers to his crew, which included a "bearded, beanie-wearing" videographer named Michael Moore. He also spent two days taping at Camp Victory and interviewed various people involved with the show; they were all very complimentary of him.

> And during those interviews, Colbert demonstrated that his newfound patriotism extends to Iraqis as well as Americans. At one point in the episode, he sat down for dinner at a chow hall with the troops and asked what they would tell President Bush if they had the opportunity. A sergeant responded: "Bring our boys home." But then Colbert asked: "What if there are still terrorists there?" And another soldier answered: "That's when you have to say, 'You know what? I guess we need a few more troops.'"

> Those soldiers might as well have been talking about the Bush administration. It was an odd exchange because it showed that many of these kids are not only patriotic but also intelligent and thoughtful. And it was also the perfect illustration of the problem with our mission in Iraq: The troops want to leave, and so does a majority of Americans back home. Yet, for all intents and purposes, they're stuck there until Bush says otherwise.
### Commentary:
> It is not surprising that Colbert is playing this game; it's how he makes money. He's been an advocate against the Iraq war since its start (and probably before), and now, with his show having become a ratings hit, he has to give it a shot at redemption. I just wish more media personalities would come out of the closet with their true political beliefs; Colbert is one of those few who have done so, and we'll all be better for it in the end.

> The show is clever and well made — but there is an obvious disconnect between what you are seeing on TV and what is really going on in Iraq right now. This episode was supposed to make fun of the Bush administration; however, by having Colbert in a place where he has no control over his surroundings or the people he interacts with, it makes him look foolish and naive at best and disrespectful to our troops at worst. It is clear that this show will not have much of an impact on Americans' opinion of Iraq because they already know what they think — there just aren't any other options available to them anymore than those available in Syria or Saudi Arabia, where American interests are equally threatened but not so heavily promoted by our government through media channels.
> 
> I feel like this is more about Colbert and his ego than it is about Iraq — a very dangerous place for any journalist to be at the moment considering how little control he has over what happens around him when filming these segments in such an unstable country. He seems to think that he's going somewhere where things are happening, but instead he finds himself surrounded by nothing more than chaos and destruction — a place where soldiers are dying every day from improvised explosive devices planted along roadsides by insurgents who want us out so badly they will blow up their own people just to get us gone.
