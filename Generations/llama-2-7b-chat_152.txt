For centuries, art historians have puzzled over why Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece lacks any trace of facial hair. But a new study suggests that the answer may be much simpler than previously thought. According to the researchers, the lack of eyebrows and eyelashes on the Mona Lisa is due to a common technique used by Renaissance artists to create a more lifelike appearance. The study, published in the journal "Art History," suggests that da Vinci likely applied a thin layer of wax or beeswax to the subject's face before painting, which would have melted and disappeared over time, leaving behind a smooth, hairless canvas.
