1. I think that this is a great use of technology because you can do things in real life and through VR it almost seems like you are there.
2. I would be interested to see the technology that allows for the user's hand movements to translate into catching butterflies as if they were in the scene themselves.
3. I wonder what else could be done with VR to create more realistic and interesting experiences than just games?
4. I canâ€™t wait to see how VR will continue to develop because it already seems like a lot is possible now that we have a better understanding of how our bodies react to the technology.
5. I think that this technology has great potential for helping people who are unable to experience life in the real world due to physical or mental limitations and want to explore different environments safely without leaving their homes.
