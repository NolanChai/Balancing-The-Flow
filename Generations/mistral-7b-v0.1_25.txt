I am able to pull all the data and display it in an html page. I have also added links to the photos to allow for user interactivity. I was unable to style the page how I wanted as I did not understand the styling sheet but I'll continue to work on that.

### Credits:
I used the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) website for help with styling and general understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also used a few different websites to learn how to add photos to my page.
