During an episode of "Man vs. Wild" when Bear was stuck on the mountain and had to fight for his life to survive, he managed to find a water hole nearby and filled it with water from the lake. The next day, there was a little boy who came over to fill up his water bottle and accidentally spilled some water while filling it. He immediately ran back inside the house screaming, "Mommy, I made bear Grylls mad!"
