##### What is CNN talking about?
"Spanking" and "paddling" are just words to describe violence against children.  They're used by adults who want to inflict pain on kids in an attempt to control them.

##### How can I help?
There are a few things that you can do:
- [Sign the petition](http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/stop-corporal-punishment).  It's easy, and it helps.
- [Share this on your social media accounts](https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fjameswgilmore%2Fcnn-spanking&t=CNN+is+lying+about+spanking).  This will help, too.

##### Why does it matter?
In the long run, violence begets violence.  We should never allow our children to become violent adults.  This is a simple issue with a clear solution: don't hit kids.

##### What about these other CNN articles?
There are several more [CNN stories](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Acnn.com+spanking) that say similar things.  They all use the same words to describe violence against children.  Let's stop this.

##### Why did you create this site?
Because I am disgusted by the lies that CNN is telling, and I think that more people should know about it.  If we can make it clear that this kind of thing is unacceptable to society, maybe we can stop it from happening in the first place.  Let's end corporal punishment.
