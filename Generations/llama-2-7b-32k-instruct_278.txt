The discovery was made Wednesday afternoon in the town of Baiji, Salahudin province, 180 kilometers (112 miles) north of the Iraqi capital.

A total of 75 bodies were discovered in five shallow graves. They appeared to have been dumped there after they were mutilated, the security official said. The victims apparently had their ears and noses cut off and a sign reading "Collaborator" was put on their chests.

The area is still controlled by al Qaeda in Iraq, which has tried to establish strongholds elsewhere in the country as well, especially in northern provinces where violence has been on the rise. ( 0 comments)
