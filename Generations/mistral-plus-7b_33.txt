A 22-year-old man who allegedly went on a gruesome murder spree has baffled cops as they try to determine what motivated him to kill. The man, who was arrested on Saturday, is suspected of killing four people in separate locations across the city over a two-day period. Police said he attacked three women and one man with a knife, stabbing them multiple times. The victims ranged in age from their 20s to late 60s. The man has not been identified, but police said he is being held on four counts of murder. They are still trying to determine what led him to carry out the killings and whether there was any connection between them.
