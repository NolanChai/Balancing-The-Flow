A few minutes ago I read an article about how the Czech Republic is under attack, as well as other places in Europe. The article states that “A powerful explosion has damaged a building in the centre of the Czech capital, Prague, injuring up to 15 people”. Now after reading this article I had my doubts and wondered if it was true or not. So I decided to go on to youtube and look for some video footage from news stations that would give me the truth about what really happened in Prague today.
The first thing I came across was an article titled “Explosion Rocks Downtown Prague”. This article says that there was indeed an explosion but it was not a bomb, but rather a car bomb. The article also states that up to 15 people were injured, and one person died. This article does not state if these injuries were caused by shrapnel or something else entirely. It also doesn’t say where the bomb went off exactly, but I would assume it was somewhere close to Vaclavske Namesti (Wenceslas Square).
The next video I came across was titled “Explosion in Prague”. This video is just a short clip of what happened when the explosion occurred and there are no other details given about the event. The video does show some damage to buildings around where the bomb went off, but it’s hard to tell how bad it really is because everything is covered up with debris from the building that was blown apart by this blast.
After watching these two videos I decided to check out CNN’s website for any more information on this event. On their website they have an article titled “Explosion in Prague”. This article states that there was indeed an explosion, but it was not a bomb but rather a car bomb. They also say up to 15 people were injured and one person died as well as stating where exactly the bomb went off (Vaclavske Namesti).

### Conclusion:
After reading all these different sources I would say that there was indeed an explosion in Prague today and it did cause some damage to buildings around where it happened. However, it does not appear like this was anything more than just another terror attack against Europe’s oldest democracy (The Czech Republic).
