[Ajit Pai - FCC Chairman](http://www.fcc.gov/about/blog/statement-chairman-pai-announcing-release)

The draft Order, released today by the FCC, is a major step in that process. It is our goal to return to a light touch approach where government simply doesn’t have much to say about how broadband providers operate. As we move toward that goal, I want to be clear that the order doesn’t change the FCC’s prohibition on paid prioritization. So long as I am Chairman of this Commission, the FCC will not adopt any rules or policies that allow fast lanes and slow lanes online.
