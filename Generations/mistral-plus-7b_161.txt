A team of senior Accident & Emergency doctors at Northampton General Hospital have resigned en masse in protest over the proposed closure of their unit and the loss of up to 60 jobs. The decision by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) to reject plans by the local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) comes as part of a wider campaign against NHS cuts across the country, which have seen thousands of staff leaving their posts in protest over proposed changes to working conditions and pay. The doctors’ decision follows similar resignations from junior staff at other hospitals across England, including Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London and the Royal Free Hospital in London.

The RCEM has criticised the CCG for its lack of transparency and consultation with staff over the proposed changes to A&E services at Northampton General Hospital. The college said that the proposals were “short-sighted and ill-conceived” and would have a detrimental impact on patient care. It called on the CCG to rethink the plans and consult properly with all stakeholders before making any decisions.

The doctors who resigned from Northampton General Hospital cited concerns over patient safety, staff morale and job security as their reasons for leaving. They argued that cuts to A&E services would lead to an increase in waiting times and a decrease in quality of care for patients. They also said they were worried about the impact that job losses would have on morale and retention of staff at the hospital.

The doctors’ resignation has been widely supported by other medical professionals, with many expressing their concern over what they see as an attack on the NHS by the government. Some have even called for a nationwide strike in protest against further cuts to public services and austerity measures imposed by the current administration.
