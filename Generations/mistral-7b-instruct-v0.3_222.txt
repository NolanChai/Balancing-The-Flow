 That's correct! In 2014, Theresa May, who was then the Home Secretary, proposed the Investigatory Powers Bill (later known as the Snooper's Charter), which aimed to give law enforcement and intelligence agencies greater powers to access electronic communications data. This included the ability to snoop on email and internet records.

On the other hand, Nick Clegg, who was the Deputy Prime Minister at that time, voiced concerns about privacy issues and the potential impact on civil liberties. He advocated for a delay in the bill's passage, arguing for more time to address these concerns and ensure a proper balance between security and privacy.

The Communications Data Bill, as it was initially called, faced criticism from various quarters, including technology companies and privacy advocates, due to concerns about its potential impact on individual privacy and the cost of implementation. Despite these objections, the bill eventually became law in 2016 after it was rebranded as the Investigatory Powers Act.
