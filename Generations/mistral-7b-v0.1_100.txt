Increase in STD's
In the article "The Number Of Sexually Transmitted Diseases In Teenagers Increasing" by Sophie Borland, it states that “the number of sexually transmitted disease diagnoses for under-25s has risen almost 50 per cent.” This is a pretty drastic increase. The reason why the number of STD's have increased so much could be because of a few reasons, for example, teenagers are more sexually active than they were before. Also, there are now different types of STD's that people can get.
In the article, it states that “the number of under-25s being diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases has climbed almost 50 per cent since 2008.” This increase is drastic and I am shocked to hear about how much this has increased. The reason for this could be because teenagers are now more sexually active than they were before. When teens have unprotected sex, they will most likely contract an STD. Also, there are a lot of new types of STD's that have come out recently. This is why the number of STD's has increased so much in such a short period of time.
In the article, it states that “the figures show under-25s account for almost half of all diagnoses.” This shows that teenagers are not taking care of their sexual health and not thinking about what could happen to them if they were to get an STD. Also, this is showing how more people are having unprotected sex, because the number of STD's has increased so much.
In conclusion, there should be some type of education that teenagers can take in order to prevent themselves from getting an STD. They could also teach the youth about ways to protect themselves if they were to have sexual intercourse. This would decrease the amount of teens that are sexually active and therefore lowering the number of STD's in under-25s.

### Reflection:
I believe I did a good job on this paper, because I was able to go into detail about what the article was talking about. Also, I was able to provide my own thoughts on the matter as well.
