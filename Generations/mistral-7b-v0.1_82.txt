##### The story is about a football player, nicklas bendtner. He was fined by his club because of showing his boxer shorts with the name of a betting company at Euro 2012.

##### It is stated that he will be fined by Arsenal, as they have opened an investigation. They are investigating him for breaking their contract rules.

### Question:

##### Why would Arsenal fine Nicklas Bendtner?

### Hypothesis:

##### I think that it is because of a breach in his contract. He may have signed a contract with the club which states that he should not be promoting another company other than them. Or, they have a policy whereby, no player can promote any other brand or company other than the one owned by the club.

### Method:

##### I will investigate this by getting in touch with Arsenal’s legal department. I will ask them about their policies and see if it is against any rules to be promoting another brand. I will also look into his contract, whether there is a clause which states that he cannot promote other brands or not. If there is no such clause then I will try to find out if he has signed anything separately with the betting company or not.
