Ms Keates claimed that the use of CCTV in schools was undermining teacher professionalism and creating a culture of fear. She told the BBC that the cameras were making teachers feel like they were "under constant scrutiny" and that the move towards surveillance was "a slippery slope".

"Teachers are being treated like ‘lab rats’ and it's creating a culture of fear," she said. "We know that CCTV can be useful in some situations, but it's not the solution to all our problems."
### Reaction:
The NASUWT has called for a halt to the use of CCTV in schools until a full review of its impact is carried out. The union said that it wanted to ensure that any surveillance measures were proportionate and did not undermine the relationship between teachers and pupils.
