I'd like to know what Michael Brown's definition of "broader" is. The people of New Orleans had been hit with a Cat 3 storm that dropped water over parts of the city for days before any help arrived. It is true, that the government needs to be held responsible for their failures, but it can never be as simple as Brown making a "fatal mistake."
