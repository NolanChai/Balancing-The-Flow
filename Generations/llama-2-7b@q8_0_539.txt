Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that if the trial of an Indonesian radical cleric is "politically motivated" it would be a "setback" for the country, state news agency IRNA reported Friday.
I think I agree with Mr. Ali Khameni; If this trial isn't politically motivated, then why was he detained in the first place?
