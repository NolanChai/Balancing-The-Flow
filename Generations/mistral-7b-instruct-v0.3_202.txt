 The new DNA analysis doesn't necessarily debunk the theory that the Minoans were refugees from North Africa. Instead, it provides evidence that supports a more complex migration history for the Minoan civilization.

The Minoan civilization, which flourished on the island of Crete between 2600 and 1450 BCE, was known for its advanced culture and artistry, including intricate frescoes like the one you mentioned depicting children boxing. The theory suggesting that the Minoans were North African refugees was proposed based on similarities in art styles and pottery between Minoan and certain North African cultures.

Recent DNA studies have indeed revealed genetic links between Minoans and populations from the Aegean, mainland Greece, and Anatolia (modern-day Turkey), rather than direct evidence of significant North African ancestry. However, it's important to note that these findings don't necessarily rule out the possibility of migration or cultural exchange between North Africa and Minoan Crete.

Migration and cultural exchange are complex processes with multiple layers, often involving interactions between various groups over extended periods. It is possible that the Minoans may have had connections with North African cultures at some point in their history, even if they did not originate from there. Furthermore, it's essential to recognize that DNA analysis only provides a partial picture of the past and should be considered alongside other archaeological and historical evidence.

In summary, while new DNA analyses have shed light on the Minoans' genetic makeup, they do not conclusively debunk the theory that the Minoans were refugees from North Africa. Instead, they support a more nuanced understanding of the Minoan civilization's origins and cultural influences.
