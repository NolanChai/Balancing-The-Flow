* I found this to be a very interesting topic. It makes me wonder how accurate these stories are. The author made some interesting points regarding the possibility of finding Bin Laden's remains. It is hard to know whether or not he did, however, there are many people who believe it will bring closure for so many families. I think it is also an interesting point that the Navy Seal Team Six may have found his body as well and kept this information secret.
