A French Foreign Ministry spokesman said a U.S. aircraft carrier was nearby during the collision on March 4 but that there were no injuries among the 130 men aboard both submarines. The two vessels collided when they were surfaced in the Atlantic Ocean, and officials stressed that no nuclear material was involved.
"It was a clumsy collision between two boats which have been operating together for four months," said a French official who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity. "They are not damaged enough to stop their missions." The official described the incident as being minor and said both vessels were returning to homeport Monday, a process that could take up to five days.
A source within the French Navy told CNN that there was no damage or casualties aboard either submarine. "We are not saying this is a very serious problem, but we are taking it very seriously," the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he did not have permission to speak publicly about the incident.
"It's been known in our Navy for more than a week and it's being investigated internally." The source told CNN that both submarines were on exercises at the time of the collision. He said they were located 20 miles apart, but didn't elaborate on the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Both vessels are nuclear powered -- meaning their propulsion systems run on highly radioactive material -- and both carry intercontinental ballistic missiles.
British Ministry of Defense spokesman Chris Vernon said in a written statement that the two submarines collided while operating together off the coast of the United States. He did not specify where they were, but said "the collision caused superficial damage to both ships."
He confirmed that nuclear material was involved and added, "The incident will be investigated as a matter of urgency by both nations' submarine forces. The submarines are currently on exercises with other British and French vessels in the area."
Lord West, Britain's former security minister, said the incident occurred because the French vessel was traveling too fast. "The collision was caused by a serious operational error," he told CNN affiliate Sky News. "That submarine was going far too quickly, and the other one had to avoid it."
The Royal Navy declined to comment on whether nuclear material was involved in the incident, saying only that "it is not unusual for nuclear-powered submarines to operate together, sharing information and carrying out exercises. The collision occurred during a joint exercise involving British and French forces."
Defense Minister Liam Fox said earlier this month he would visit France at the end of March to meet with his counterpart, Herve Morin, and discuss military cooperation. "I look forward to meeting Minister Morin on 27 March," he told CNN in a written statement Monday. "It will be an opportunity for us to reaffirm our longstanding defense partnership, including the importance we both attach to continuing close collaboration in the field of nuclear deterrence."
Vernon said "operational matters relating to this incident are being dealt with by the French and British submarine forces. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further at this stage."
The Royal Navy's current fleet of four Trafalgar-class nuclear submarines carry Trident II missiles, which are launched from U.S.-operated ballistic missile submarines that are based in the United States and Western Europe. They have an estimated range of 4,000 miles (6,400 km).
The French Navy's Barracuda class submarines were commissioned to carry nuclear warheads for France's new generation of M51 missiles after a contract was signed with U.S.-based Lockheed Martin Corp. in 2004. They have an estimated range of more than 3,600 miles (6,000 km).
