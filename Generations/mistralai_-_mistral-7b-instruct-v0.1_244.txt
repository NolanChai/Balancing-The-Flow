 The four Georgia teens accused in the beating death of a fifth teen at a house party are expected to face murder charges. They were arrested and charged with aggravated assault for their roles in the incident that occurred last week during a party in Fayetteville, Georgia.

The victim, 17-year-old Kendrick Butler, was found unconscious outside the home and later died from his injuries at a hospital. The other four teens, whose names have not been released, are accused of hitting him repeatedly with fists and a wooden stick during a disagreement at the party.

The case is being handled by the Fayette County District Attorney's office. It is unclear what kind of sentence the defendants could face if convicted of murder, as Georgia law allows for a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole for first-degree murder. The other charges of aggravated assault could also carry significant penalties, including lengthy prison sentences and fines.
