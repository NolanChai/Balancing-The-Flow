The street vendor, whose name is unknown, has been credited with helping to prevent what could have been an act of terrorism in New York City. He noticed the suspicious vehicle parked on 45th Street and alerted police, who found propane tanks, gasoline and fireworks inside. The suspect, Faisal Shahzad, was later arrested and charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.

The street vendor has now decided to run for Congress in the hopes of continuing his work and advocating for improved safety measures in New York City. He is running as a Democrat for the seat currently held by Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who is not seeking reelection. The street vendor's platform includes increased funding for emergency response services, better security at public transportation hubs and stronger regulations on explosive materials.
