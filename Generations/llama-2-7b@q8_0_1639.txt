* The Blades were not deterred and went out to attack the Saddlers from the very first whistle in front of a crowd of 5,547 (1,836 away fans) at Bramall Lane, but it would be Walsall who had their name on the scoresheet before half an hour was up.
* A flowing move by the visitors involving right-back Danny Coles and midfielders Lee Morris and Jamie Paterson ended with defender Sam Mantom cutting a pass back to Liam Kinsella, who drilled in a shot which went past George Long into the far corner of his net.
* Walsall continued to threaten as half-time approached. Kinsella's cross was headed towards goal by Andy Butler only for Long to intervene and Coles had an effort deflected wide by Harry Maguire, but the Blades were not going down without a fight.
* Shortly after the interval they equalised through their top scorer Matt Green, who latched on to Chris Porter's crossfield pass before coolly beating Neil Etheridge at his near post. The goal brought back memories of his last-gasp winner against Brentford in October.
* Walsall almost responded straight away when Bradley Orr's shot hit the underside of the bar, but the Blades took the lead just seven minutes later from their first attack of note after the equaliser. 
* Green fed Porter, whose low cross was turned into his own net by Etheridge as he scrambled back to stop Chris Basham getting in a shot on goal at the far post.
