 It seems like you're discussing the financial challenges some people might face when considering boating activities during the summer, and suggesting alternatives for those who can't afford to buy a boat. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Renting a Boat: Many marinas and boat rental services offer a variety of boats for short-term rentals. This is a great option for those who want to enjoy boating without the long-term commitment and expense of owning a boat.

2. Sailing Clubs: Joining a sailing club can provide regular access to boats at a lower cost than owning one. Plus, it's a great way to meet like-minded individuals and learn more about sailing.

3. Kayaking or Paddleboarding: These are affordable options that allow you to explore waterways without the need for a large boat. Many cities have kayak or paddleboard rentals available.

4. Ferry Rides: Taking a ferry ride can be a relaxing way to enjoy the water and see sights from a different perspective.

5. Water Parks: If you're looking for more thrill, visit a local water park for a fun-filled day of water activities.

6. Swimming or Picnicking by the Water: If you just want to enjoy the water without getting on it, find a nice spot for a picnic by the lake, river, or sea.
