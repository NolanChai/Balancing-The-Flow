Yes! And Tigers will play a game of their own soon. The Tigers are on a roll and have been for a while now. It's not easy to come back from 14-0, but the Tigers did that this year. They've got one more game left in the regular season before they kick off their playoff run. If you haven't caught any of these Tigers games yet, do yourself a favor and tune in.
