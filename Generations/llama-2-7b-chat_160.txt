An emaciated pit bull described by humane society officials in Louisiana as 'the most neglected dog they have ever seen' has been rescued and is now recovering at a local shelter. The 3-year-old dog, named Max, was found wandering the streets with no food or water for days, and his condition was so poor that he could barely stand.
