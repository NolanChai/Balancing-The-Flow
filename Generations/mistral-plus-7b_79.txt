U.S. officials at the Pentagon and State Department denied Friday knowing of any efforts to take down the WikiLeaks website or asking companies to do so.

The denial came as questions mounted about a cyberattack that briefly took down the anti-secrecy group’s website, as well as an online attack on PayPal and other sites that have cut off donations for WikiLeaks.

“We have not asked any companies to stop doing business with Wikileaks,” State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said.

Crowley also denied the U.S. government was involved in taking down the website, adding that it would be “inconsistent” for the U.S. to do so.

“We have a strong belief that WikiLeaks should adhere to the rule of law,” Crowley said. “But we are not engaged in any activity to take them down.”
