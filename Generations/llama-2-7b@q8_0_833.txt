Ivins' death makes it hard to say whether his involvement was merely a coincidence or if he had something to do with the anthrax letters. As FBI spokesman J.J. Klaver tells CNN, "We don't have any definitive proof that [he] did have anything to do with this."
But Klaver adds: "We are very confident in our investigation and we continue to work on it diligently."
The FBI was prepared for Ivins' death. He had been under surveillance at his home in Frederick, Maryland, and had taken an overdose of pills. When paramedics found him, he was unconscious. His death was officially ruled a suicide, but the FBI is not releasing details about how it happened.
The investigation into the anthrax attacks has been difficult from the start -- there were two different types of anthrax used in the letters. One type was common to Ivins' work at Fort Detrick in Maryland; the other type, more deadly and rare, came from an Army lab in Utah.
Another complication is that when authorities examined Ivins' home, they found no evidence of the bacteria used in the letters. And so far, authorities have been unable to find a link between any of his research and the anthrax spores.
However, Klaver says there are other reasons investigators suspect he had something to do with the attacks: "He has ties to individuals involved in this investigation."
That is all we know for now; authorities say they're not ready to reveal any more about Ivins or how his death might affect their investigation.
