Manchester United are at risk of losing yet another promising young player, as they have failed to open contract talks with midfielder Andreas Pereira, who is currently on loan at La Liga side Granada. The 19-year-old midfielder has impressed since his arrival in Spain, making 23 appearances for the club and scoring two goals. He is now set to become a free agent at the end of the season, unless United can convince him to sign an extension to his current deal.
