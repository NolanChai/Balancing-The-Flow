 Correct! The famous British actor Sir Roger Moore, who played the iconic character of James Bond in seven films, is known to have appreciated martinis. In fact, he was quoted saying that his preferred way to drink a martini was "just enough vermouth for the gin to pick it up on its way down." This mirrors James Bond's classic line from Ian Fleming's novels: "I always have my martinis served very dry - with a slice of lemon peel, not a twist, and a snow-cone full of ice."
