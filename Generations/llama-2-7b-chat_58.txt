Steve Jobs' decision to delay surgery for pancreatic cancer was a costly one, according to his biographer Walter Isaacson. In an interview with CNN, Isaacson revealed that Jobs put off the life-saving operation for nine months despite the urging of his medical team. "He tried this fad diet, this macrobiotic diet, and he was convinced it would cure him," Isaacson said. "But unfortunately, it didn't work, and by the time he finally had the surgery, the cancer had spread." Isaacson went on to say that Jobs later expressed regret over his decision, recognizing that he could have been cured earlier if he had listened to his doctors.
