The vendor, who wishes to remain anonymous, told CNN that he has been inspired by the response from the public and law enforcement following the incident on Saturday. "I want to continue to serve my community in a different way," he said. "I believe I can make a real difference in Congress." The vendor, who is originally from Pakistan, came to the United States as a refugee 15 years ago and has since become a naturalized citizen. He runs a small food cart in Times Square and sells hot dogs, pretzels, and other snacks to tourists and locals alike.
