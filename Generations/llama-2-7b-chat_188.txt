As the years go by, the legend of Wayne Rooney's mediocrity will only continue to grow. Despite his impressive goalscoring record for Manchester United and England, many fans will come to view him as a player who never quite lived up to his potential. The fact that he was able to score so many goals for two of the biggest clubs in the world will only serve to make his lackluster performances on the biggest stages all the more glaring. By the time Rooney retires, he will be remembered as a player who could have been great, but ultimately fell short of his lofty expectations.
