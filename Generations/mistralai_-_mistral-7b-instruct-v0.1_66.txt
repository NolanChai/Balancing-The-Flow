 However, their expectations of him have not been met and he has struggled to live up to his potential since joining the club. This has led to speculation about his future at Tottenham and whether the team should consider selling him in order to free up funds for other areas of need.

Despite this, it is important to remember that Soldado is still a relatively young player with a lot of potential left to develop. He may not have lived up to expectations in the past but with the right guidance and support, he could still become an integral part of the Tottenham team. Ultimately, the decision about whether to sell him will depend on the club's overall priorities and long-term plans.
