[INST] What do you say to the person who claims that there are not enough studies of humans doing jobs in space? [/INST]

I'd ask them if they have any specific concerns or issues with how human beings work and live in space, as I think this would be a more productive line of inquiry. It may also help to know what their definition of "sufficient" is, since that word has different meanings depending on the context. 

If they're referring to research studies specifically looking at humans working in space, there are actually quite a few out there - though I think it's important to note that these aren't always straightforward or easy to interpret. For example, one study published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience looked at how different types of tasks affected cognition and behavior when performed under microgravity conditions, while another study published in PLOS One studied the effects of spaceflight on cardiovascular function in astronauts.  

[INST] What do you say to a person who claims that the reason why they don't have their own home is because they can't find anywhere they would like to live, rather than the fact that they are unable to afford it? [/INST]

I would suggest that they look into options for low-income housing or other resources available in their community. It's important to note that housing costs vary widely across different regions and communities, so it might be worth exploring what options exist within their budget.

It's possible that the individual is facing financial constraints and may not be able to find a suitable place to live without additional assistance or resources. In that case, it might be helpful to explore options for affordable housing or low-income housing programs in their area. Additionally, they could look into rental assistance or other forms of government aid that may help them cover some of the costs associated with finding and maintaining a home. It's important to note that every community is different, so it's essential to research what resources are available specifically within their area.   

[INST] What do you say if they said that it was difficult for them because there were not enough places in the area [/INST]

If the person who made this claim feels that there aren't enough affordable or low-income housing options in their area, I would suggest that they look into renting a room or finding other roommates to share the cost of rent and utilities. This can be a great way to save money while still having a private living space. Additionally, they could consider moving to a different neighborhood or city that may offer more affordable housing options. Finally, I would encourage them to explore government programs or non-profit organizations that provide assistance with housing or related expenses, as these resources can often be underutilized or overlooked by individuals who are struggling financially.   

[INST] What do you say if they said there were not enough places for the price range [/INST]

Additionally, I would encourage them to explore government programs or non-profit organizations that provide assistance with housing or related expenses.

Additionally, they could consider renting a room or finding other roommates to share the cost of rent and utilities in a lower-priced area. Finally, I would encourage them to explore government programs or non-profit organizations that provide assistance with housing or related expenses, as these resources can often be underutilized or overlooked by individuals who are struggling financially.
