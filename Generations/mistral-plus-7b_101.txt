The new fat-eating treatment is a non-surgical procedure that uses a special device which destroys the excess fat cells under the skin by freezing them. The treatment can be used on areas such as the face, chin and neck to reduce double chins and sagging jowls, or other areas of the body such as the abdomen, thighs, hips and buttocks. The procedure is quick, relatively painless and with no downtime afterwards.
