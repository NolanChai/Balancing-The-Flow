Fabianski was suspended for a challenge on West Bromwich Albion defender Craig Dawson during their 0-0 draw last weekend. He will be eligible to return against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Sunday, October 15 . The Pole has made four appearances this season and is expected to start in goal again when Spurs visit the Liberty Stadium this weekend.

Fabianski's suspension was initially handed out by referee Kevin Friend during Saturday's match at The Hawthorns but was then confirmed by an independent disciplinary commission on Tuesday.

He will be able to play for Poland in Wednesday's friendly against Iceland in Reykjavik and also when Swansea host West Ham United at the Liberty Stadium on October 21.
