I think that it is wrong for him to say that. He should do what the courts say not just bc of how much tourism or money he makes. He needs to follow the rules and not try to bypass them so that he can get more profit from his land. Also, if I was a judge I would take into consideration everything including tourists visiting the place where it takes place but at the end of the day I have to make my decision based on the laws, not what other people think.
