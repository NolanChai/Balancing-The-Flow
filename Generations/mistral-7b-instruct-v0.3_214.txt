 That's quite an incredible catch! It seems this schoolboy has made a record-breaking catch, considering the average size of a giant catfish is around 3 to 4 feet long and their weight varies significantly but usually doesn't equal that of a champion boxer. This story reminds me of the tale of Angelo Villanueva from the Philippines who caught a massive freshwater fish in 2019, weighing an estimated 617 pounds (280 kg), making it one of the largest freshwater fish ever caught. It's always inspiring to hear about such impressive feats!
