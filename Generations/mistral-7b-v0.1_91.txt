By . Spencer Matthews . So I’m single again. I’ve split up with Stephanie Pratt, whom I had been dating for about four months. The reason for the split is largely down to the fact that we moved far too fast in our relationship and never took the time to get to know each other as people before deciding to commit ourselves to each other in such a big way. This was definitely an important lesson to learn, especially because I’m very much a “go with your gut” kind of guy. If it feels right, then I go for it 100%.
But the good thing about this whole experience is that now I know what works and what doesn’t work when it comes to dating someone new. In fact, I think I have some great advice for anyone else looking to find love in today’s modern world:
Don’t move too fast – take your time getting to know each other first before deciding whether or not you want to commit yourself fully into a relationship with them; otherwise, there could be problems down the road if one person ends up feeling more strongly about things than another does!
Listen carefully – pay attention when someone is trying to tell you something important (whether positive or negative); listen attentively so that both sides can understand each other better before making any big decisions together!
Be honest from day one – don’t try hiding anything from your partner because eventually, everything will come out anyway; being open and honest right off the bat helps build trust between two people who are getting involved romantically for the first time.
Don’t be afraid of being vulnerable – it’s okay if sometimes things don’t go according to plan, just remember that communication is key in any relationship!
Be patient – relationships take time so try not get frustrated when things aren’t working out immediately; eventually everything will fall into place if both parties are willing to put forth effort into making things work between them.
