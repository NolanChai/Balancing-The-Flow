 The article you provided is titled "Mexican drug lord 'El Marro' - once a cop and now the most feared cartel boss in Mexico - arrested" and was published by Daily Mail Reporter on August 30, 2013. Here is a summary of the article:

The article reports that Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, the notorious Mexican drug lord who led the Sinaloa Cartel, has been arrested in Mexico following a massive manhunt. Guzman was captured in the coastal town of Mazatlan and will be extradited to the United States to face charges related to drug trafficking, money laundering, and organized crime.

Guzman is considered one of the most powerful drug lords in the world and has a bounty of $5 million on his head from the U.S. government. He is accused of being responsible for the deaths of thousands of people and for smuggling tons of cocaine, heroin, and marijuana into the United States.

The article also mentions another Mexican drug lord named Servando "La Tuta" Gomez, who was arrested a few days earlier in the state of Michoacan. La Tuta is the leader of the Knights Templar cartel and is accused of ordering the killings of dozens of people, including police officers and journalists.

The arrests of Guzman and La Tuta are seen as major victories for the Mexican government in its ongoing fight against drug trafficking and organized crime. The Mexican military has been working closely with U.S. law enforcement agencies to track down and capture these dangerous criminals.
