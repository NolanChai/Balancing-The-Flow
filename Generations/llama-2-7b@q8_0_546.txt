(CNN) -- This was a fun problem! I chose the "Patrick Oppman" option because I was drawn into his story and felt like I knew him after reading about how he ended up in Seattle, which made me want to get a sense of the city that had captured his heart. I thought it would be nice for visitors to experience some of what Patrick did when they visit Seattle - eating at Pike Place Market or seeing the Space Needle.
