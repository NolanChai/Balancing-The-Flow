Michelle Rodriguez's close friend and fellow actor Vin Diesel is thrilled for the actress as she embarks on a new chapter in her life, with her relationship with Cara Delevingne. Speaking to Access Hollywood at the premiere of his latest movie, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Vin said that he thinks Michelle and Cara are a great match and that he's happy for them both.

"I think she and Cara make an excellent couple," said Vin. "They're both so passionate about their work and they're both very strong-willed individuals. They really bring out the best in each other."

Michelle and Cara first met on the set of Fast & Furious 7 back in 2013, and it seems that sparks immediately flew between them. They began dating shortly afterwards, and have since been seen together at a number of red carpet events and holidays abroad.
