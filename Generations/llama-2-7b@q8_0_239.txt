The Eiffel Tower has been viewed by many millions of people, and is a symbol of Paris throughout the world. It is named after Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed the tower for the 1889 World's Fair in France (an exposition). The tower was built to be the main entrance arch to the fair site, but it was so popular that it stayed and became a permanent part of Paris.
It is one of the most iconic structures on earth and is the tallest building in Paris. It has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983.
The Eiffel Tower is made up of three parts: a main structure, an antenna mast atop each tower, and two support towers which hold them together with steel cables that are attached to the main structure below ground level (where they are anchored). The metal used for this construction process was from Germany.
