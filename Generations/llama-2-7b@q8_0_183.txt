### Explanation:
In 2019, the House Democratic Party announced that Ilhan Omar would be appointed to its Intelligence Committee in spite of her history of anti-Semitism and pro-Muslim Brotherhood comments.

The decision came after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was under pressure from fellow Democrats to appoint someone from the Muslim community to the intelligence committee. In addition, Omar was selected for the position in order to provide "greater insight on terrorism and national security," according to a Democratic Party representative who spoke with the Daily Mail at the time.
