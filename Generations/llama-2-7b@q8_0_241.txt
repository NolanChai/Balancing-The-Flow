I disagree with the idea of North Korea being able to send an atomic missile to hit the US west coast, as stated in this article. The North Koreans are far behind the USA technologically and I do not see them becoming a threat anytime soon. They may be able to make rockets that could reach Japan but they will still be very far from the US and their accuracy is questionable at best.
