 The judge, Brock Coleman, made the ruling after hearing arguments from both prosecutors and defense attorneys. The jury had recommended the death penalty for Sowell following his conviction on 11 counts of aggravated murder in October.

Sowell, who has been dubbed the "Baker Street Killer," was found guilty of abducting, torturing, and killing 11 women between 2005 and 2009, with most of the victims being prostitutes. The jury deliberated for two weeks before reaching its recommendation, which must be approved by the judge before it can become final.

Defense attorneys had argued that Sowell suffered from severe mental illness and should not receive the death penalty. They also questioned whether the use of lethal injection as a form of execution is constitutional in Ohio.
