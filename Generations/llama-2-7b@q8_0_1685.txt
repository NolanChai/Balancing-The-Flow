Islamabad (CNN) -- Well, this is a difficult question. Pakistan has never had a proper democratic political system which has been a cause of so many problems in the past and still exists today. If we could have a system where all parties work together then I think it would be great for the country.
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Can you elaborate on how Pakistan will avoid a nuclear war with India?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- There are several measures we can take to avoid this, such as improving diplomatic relations and also making sure that both countries keep an eye out for any kind of provocative behavior from the other side. In addition to this there needs to be a strong deterrence system so if one country is feeling threatened or attacked by another they know how to respond properly without going into panic mode which could lead them down the wrong path.
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- What is your opinion on Pakistan's role in Afghanistan?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- There are some very positive things happening right now with the war against terror and our involvement in Afghanistan has been critical to these successes. We have helped train thousands of Afghan soldiers who are now able to protect their country without foreign assistance which is a major step forward for both countries as well as being able to provide support for many local initiatives aimed at helping people improve their lives through education and employment opportunities etcetera so it's definitely worth continuing our involvement despite any negative press we receive from time-to-time about certain issues such as drone strikes.
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- What is your opinion on the current situation with India and Pakistan?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Well, it's not a great situation to say the least but there are many things we can do to help improve our relationship. Firstly, both countries need to show more respect for each other by reducing any kind of rhetoric that might cause tension or anger between us which would make sense given how important this relationship is not only for both nations but also globally as well. Secondly, if there's going to be a war then I think it should come from somewhere else rather than between us because let me tell you - no one wins when two friends fight each other!
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- What are your plans for the upcoming election in Pakistan?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Well, as I said previously my party is working hard on getting ready to compete and I have already started campaigning by going around different areas of our country meeting people who will be voting so they understand what we stand for.
We also need to make sure that we don't neglect any specific group or region because this could cause issues when it comes time to vote since some groups may feel like their voice isn't heard if not included in the campaigns being done by other parties which is why I am focusing heavily on reaching out to people from all over Pakistan so they know what kind of changes will be made once we win this election.
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Can you provide any details about how you plan to address corruption in Pakistani politics?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Yes, I absolutely can! Firstly, we will make sure that everyone is held accountable for their actions no matter who they are and what position they hold. Secondly, we need to improve our system of checks and balances so there's more transparency in how things work because right now it feels like money just flows through some people's pockets without any real oversight or responsibility which leads us down an unhealthy path where everyone has their own agenda which isn't good for Pakistan as a whole.
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- What do you think about the recent influx of refugees from Afghanistan?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Well, I think that we should help them find somewhere safe to stay and also offer some assistance with finding jobs so they can start building lives for themselves again but if possible it would be better if they could return home rather than having thousands upon thousands come over here which could lead us into even more problems down the road.
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Can you provide some specifics about what your party stands for?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Yes! Our main goal is to create a better Pakistan where everyone has equal opportunities regardless of their race or religion which means we need more jobs and education as well as improving health care so that people can live happier lives without worrying about things like hunger or disease. We also want to make sure that our government works with other nations around the world instead of against them because it's not fair for us to have all these problems while countries like America are enjoying life without any worries at all which isn't right!
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Can you comment on how Pakistan is doing economically?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- I think we need to focus more on the economy because if this country doesn't have an economic system that can support itself then none of our other goals will ever be achieved. We must create better jobs for people who are currently unemployed so they aren't forced into crime just because they don't have anything else going for them; we also need to increase education levels which means investing more money in schools throughout the country so young children get proper educations instead of being left behind while other countries advance further than us over time.
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- What do you think about Pakistan's current relationship with India?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Well, I don't really like it very much but there are some good things happening too so we can't ignore those either. We need to improve our communication skills because sometimes when people speak in one language and another person hears them speaking a different language then things get pretty confusing for everyone involved which doesn't help us solve anything!
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Can you comment on how Pakistan is doing politically?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- Well, we have some very good leaders right now but there are still plenty of problems within our government system so I think this country needs new leadership to really make a difference in terms of improving everything from education levels and healthcare costs all the way down to crime rates which are too high for comfort at times.
### Question:
Islamabad (CNN) -- What is your opinion on Pakistan's role in Afghanistan?

### Response:
Islamabad (CNN) -- We need to be more involved than what we currently are but also make sure that everyone knows what kind of sacrifices our soldiers have made so they don't feel like their hard work isn't appreciated enough by either side which can lead people into dangerous territory if not properly managed!
