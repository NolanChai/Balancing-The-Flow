We will be creating a script that will read in all the matches from the Worldcup dataset. The script will then extract the teams that won their group and the teams that finished 2nd in their groups, and produce a table with these results.

The following is a sample of the results to be produced:

```
GROUP A

Runner-up: Germany

GROUP C
Winner: Argentina
