Former Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh Lord Hope allowed a paedophile priest to escape punishment for sex crimes, according to a dossier compiled by the late Lord Fraser of Carmyllie and submitted to Lord Hope in 2014. The report also claims that the church did not fully investigate complaints about Fr William Fitzmaurice and failed to inform police, despite knowing he had committed sexual offences against children. Fr Fitzmaurice was suspended by Bishop Joseph McGettigan in 1965 after a boy reported him for molesting him in St Andrews Cathedral. However, the complaint was dismissed following a hearing and Fr Fitzmaurice returned to ministry. (The Times) The Church of Scotland said it had "no comment" on Lord Hope's report but added: "We remain committed to responding to any concerns about our response to abuse as a matter of urgency."
