Whoopi Goldbergâ€™s remarks on spanking caused an uproar among her co-hosts during a segment on The View on Wednesday. She defended the practice of spanking children, stating that it had been used by parents for centuries and was not abuse unless done in excess or with malicious intent. Her co-hosts, including Joy Behar and Sara Haines, strongly disagreed, arguing that spanking is a form of physical punishment that can cause harm to children. They also emphasized the importance of providing alternative forms of discipline such as timeouts and talking to the child about their behavior. Ultimately, they urged parents to find ways to discipline their children without resorting to physical punishment.
