 The denial came after the Al-Jazeera news network reported that Libya's special security forces had arrested former spokesman Moussa Ibrahim, also known as Abu Bakr al-Siddiqui, at a hotel in Tripoli.

"This is Abu Bakr al-Siddiqui, the former spokesperson for Muammar Gadhafi," Ibrahim said in an audio message sent to reporters. "I am not even in Libya, and I have no idea where this false report came from."

Ibrahim fled Libya after the country's civil war began in 2011 and has lived in exile ever since. He was reportedly seen entering Tripoli on Friday under a false identity.

The Al-Jazeera report said that Ibrahim was captured while trying to enter a hotel room in downtown Tripoli. The news network later confirmed the story with sources close to the Libyan government, who said that Ibrahim was being held for questioning.

However, Ibrahim's denial cast doubt on the report and raised questions about his whereabouts.
