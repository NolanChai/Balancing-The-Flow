 That's an interesting take on the political climate during President Barack Obama's time in office. In September 2013, President Obama indeed faced opposition from several members of Congress regarding military intervention in Syria. The proposed action was to respond to Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians.

The political landscape at that time was complex due to various factors such as public opinion, concerns about the long-term consequences of military intervention, and previous commitments made by the administration. As a result, many congressional doors were closed to President Obama's proposed action, and ultimately, he chose not to pursue it without congressional authorization.

It's essential to remember that political situations are dynamic, and decisions like these are influenced by numerous factors, including international relations, public opinion, and the political makeup of Congress. While President Obama may have employed salesmanship tactics in advocating for his position, ultimately, the outcome was determined by a variety of factors beyond his control.
