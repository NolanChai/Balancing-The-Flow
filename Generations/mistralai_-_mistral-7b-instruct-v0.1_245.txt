 The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released its findings into the crash that occurred near Birmingham, Alabama, in July 2013, which killed all three crew members and injured one of the two passengers on board. The report found that the pilots failed to follow standard procedures and crashed the plane into a field while attempting an emergency landing.

In addition to criticizing the pilots, however, the NTSB also had some harsh words for UPS, stating that the company could have taken steps to prevent the accident. "UPS had specific information about this crew member's flight experience and training deficiencies, yet they continued to fly him with no additional training or oversight," said Christopher Hart, chair of the NTSB.

The report also found that UPS did not have adequate procedures in place for managing its large cargo plane fleet, which contributed to the crash. "UPS's failure to implement effective management controls and its lack of communication between crew members were significant factors in this accident," the report stated.

The crash was the deadliest in U.S. aviation history since 2003, and it prompted a review by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of its regulations governing cargo plane safety. The NTSB's findings are likely to be used as part of that review, as well as any potential legal action against UPS or the pilots involved in the crash.
