 That's correct! The Zapruder film is a 8mm home movie taken by Abraham Zapruder, a bystander, during the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. It captures the fatal shots that struck President Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally as they rode in an open-top car through Dealey Plaza. The film provides key evidence in understanding the assassination and has been analyzed extensively by researchers and investigators. While there have been other films or videos of U.S. presidents, the Zapruder film is historically significant due to its unique documentation of the JF Kennedy's assassination.
