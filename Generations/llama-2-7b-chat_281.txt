Emma Thompson has lamented the pressure on actresses to constantly look young and beautiful in Hollywood, saying that it is a "terrible" industry for women. Speaking on the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme, the Oscar-winning actress said that she felt lucky to have started her career before the era of social media, when the pressure to conform to unrealistic beauty standards was even greater. "I think it's a terrible industry for women," she said. "It's always been a bit of a challenge, but now it's like a never-ending nightmare." Thompson, who is 54, added that she believed the pressure on actresses to look young and beautiful was not only damaging to their mental health, but also led to a lack of diversity in the industry. "There's this idea that women have to be 25 forever," she said. "It's just not realistic. And it's not fair."
