The question is not about the location of the castle but how many rooms are in the castle.
I have written a program that will take a number from the user and give them the result of the calculation.
The program is designed to be used with a terminal such as VSCode or Windows PowerShell.

### Inputs:
The user enters a number between 1-4294967295 (inclusive) and presses enter.

### Outputs:
The program will output the result of the calculation to the console window in the terminal.
It will also display a message if the input was not valid or if an error occurred during execution.

### Example Usage:
```
Please enter the number of rooms (between 1 and 4294967295): 3000000
The castle has 3000000 rooms.
Press any key to continue...
```
### Execution:
You can run the program by navigating to the project directory using your terminal and running the following command:

```
python3 main.py
```
The program will ask for a number of rooms, perform the calculation and output the result to the console window in the terminal.

### Limitations:
The program has been tested on Python 3.9.12 on Windows 11 and should work with other versions of Python and operating systems as long as they support the required modules.
However, it has not been extensively tested on all platforms so there may be some minor differences in behavior depending on your setup.

### Requirements:
The program requires Python 3.9 or higher to run.
It also depends on the following modules being installed:
```
math
os
sys
```
If you do not have these modules installed, you can install them using pip by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install math
pip install os
pip install sys
```
