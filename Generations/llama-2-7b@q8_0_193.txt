### Explanation:

Cameron Hale had autism spectrum disorder (ASD). He had always been a sweet child, but by the time he was 7, he started having trouble speaking and interacting with other children.
His parents decided to enroll him in an intensive behavioral therapy program at Seattle Children's Hospital, which helps kids with ASD learn social skills -- including how to make friends at school. The treatment lasted two years; now 9, he has a group of close buddies and is a thriving fourth-grader.
