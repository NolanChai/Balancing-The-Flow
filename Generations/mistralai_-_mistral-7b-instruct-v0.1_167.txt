 The vote was 34-2, with only the United States and Canada opposing the move. Cuba had been suspended from the OAS since 1962 following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, which was supported by the U.S. government at the time. In recent years, however, there has been a growing shift in Latin American attitudes towards Cuba, with many countries seeking to improve relations with the island nation.

The revocation of Cuba's suspension is seen as a major step in normalizing relations between the two nations. The U.S. government has not yet announced any plans to change its longstanding policy towards Cuba, but there have been signs of increased engagement between the two countries in recent months. In December, President Obama announced that the U.S. would begin restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba, ending a more than 50-year standoff between the two nations.
