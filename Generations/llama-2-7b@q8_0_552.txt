- The report does not mention how Muslims feel about the NYPD’s approach towards them, only how New Yorkers feel
- The report only provides data on one aspect of the NYPD’s activities: their use of undercover officers to infiltrate and monitor mosques (among other institutions) and social gatherings. It does not address the other aspects that have been documented in court cases, such as “mapping” Muslim neighborhoods
- The report doesn’t say what Muslims think about the NYPD surveillance program; it only says most New Yorkers do. If it is true that most people approve of this practice, why even survey Muslims?
- The report says nothing about whether the NYPD treats all Muslims equally, or if they target some groups and individuals for surveillance more than others.
- The report does not provide any information on how often these undercover operations lead to an arrest (and conviction), if at all; it merely states that they have occurred 70 times between January and April 2012, which is a very short time period.
### Question:
In your opinion, are police acting appropriately in their monitoring of Muslims?
