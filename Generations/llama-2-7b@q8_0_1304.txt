The Dublin family has accused the carrier of discriminating against children with allergies after it allegedly refused a request for seats away from passengers who had ordered peanut products on their flights. The girl's father said his daughter was “shaking” when she got back to Ireland and needed three injections of adrenaline, but that United Airlines told him there were no free seats available to accommodate the family.

### Thoughts:

The child had suffered an allergic reaction on board a flight over the Atlantic Ocean after eating nuts served by the carrier. A letter from her doctor said she was at risk of developing anaphylactic shock and asked that she be seated away from any passengers who might have ordered peanut products in their meals or snacks. The family’s lawyer told the BBC that United Airlines refused to accommodate them on the return journey because it is not ‘a nut-free airline.’

### Analysis:

The girl's father, who was on board with her at the time of the incident, said he had raised his concerns with a member of staff. He added that he had been assured there were no seats available to accommodate the family. “We are in shock,” the father said. “There is nothing we can do.”

### Conclusion:

The Dublin-based girl's father has claimed United Airlines refused to move his daughter and her mother out of their assigned seats on the return journey because there were no free seats available for them. He alleged that airline staff had told him they were unable accommodate the family due to a lack of space, but he said this was not true as there was “plenty of room” elsewhere in the aircraft.
