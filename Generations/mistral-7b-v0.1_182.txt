I would write a program that takes as input the name of a celebrity and their occupation (actor/model/whatever), then returns whether or not they are awake. The program should output whether or not they are awake, based on the time of day, how many hours they have been sleeping that night, and how much caffeine has been consumed.

### Implementation:
The program will be written in Python using a command-line interface. It will take the name of the celebrity as the first argument and their occupation as the second argument. The program will then prompt the user to enter the time of day, how many hours they have been sleeping that night, and how much caffeine has been consumed. Based on these inputs, the program will determine whether or not the celebrity is awake and output a response.

### Data Structures:
The program will use Python's built-in data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and strings to store the celebrity names, occupations, and other input data.

### Algorithms:
The program will use an if-else statement to determine whether or not the celebrity is awake based on the time of day, how many hours they have been sleeping that night, and how much caffeine has been consumed. It will then output a response.

### Complexity Analysis:
The complexity analysis of the program is O(1) because it only uses basic data structures and algorithms.

### Sample Output:
Enter celebrity name: Liv Tyler
Enter occupation: Actor
Enter time of day (24-hour format): 0900
Enter hours slept that night: 5
Enter caffeine consumed: 1
Liv Tyler is awake

### Pseudocode:
1. Prompt user to enter celebrity name and occupation
2. Prompt user to enter time of day, hours slept, and caffeine consumed
3. Determine if celebrity is awake based on inputs
4. Output response

### Final Code:
```python
# liv_tyler.py
import sys

celebrities = {
    "Liv Tyler": "Actor"
}

def is_awake(name, occupation, time_of_day, hours_slept, caffeine):
    if time_of_day > 23 or time_of_day < 0:
        print("Invalid time of day. Please enter a valid 24-hour time.")
        return False

    if occupation not in ["Actor", "Model"]:
        print(f"{name} is not an actor or model. Please enter a valid occupation.")
        return False

    if hours_slept < 0 or hours_slept > 24:
        print("Invalid number of hours slept. Please enter a valid number between 0 and 24.")
        return False

    if caffeine < 0 or caffeine > 10:
        print(f"{name} has consumed too much caffeine. Please enter a valid amount between 0 and 10.")
        return False

    if time_of_day >= 6 and hours_slept <= 5 and caffeine == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    name = sys.argv[1]
    occupation = sys.argv[2]
    time_of_day = int(sys.argv[3])
    hours_slept = int(sys.argv[4])
    caffeine = float(sys.argv[5])

    if name in celebrities and occupation == celebrities[name]:
        print(f"{name} is {is_awake(name, occupation, time_of_day, hours_slept, caffeine)}.", end="")
    else:
        print("Invalid celebrity or occupation. Please enter valid inputs.")
```
