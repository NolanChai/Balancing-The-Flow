John Eccles, 35, was left with a concave skull and a brain injury after a brutal assault in Glasgow.

The father-of-three suffered a fractured skull and a bleed on the brain after he was punched to the ground outside a nightclub by a former bus driver.

Eccles was walking home from work when he was attacked by David McGuigan, who had been sacked from his job at First Bus for failing a drugs test.

He was convicted of assaulting Mr Eccles and jailed for three years after being found guilty of the attack in Glasgow Sheriff Court.

The victim said: ‘I was walking home when I heard some laddish banter behind me. The next thing I remember is waking up on a hospital bed with my wife at my side. I had no idea what had happened. My head felt sore and my face was covered in blood.’

He added: ‘I have been left with a permanent injury which has affected the quality of my life. I’m not allowed to lift anything heavy or do any strenuous exercise for fear that it could cause me further damage.

‘The attack was totally unprovoked and I can’t understand why anyone would want to do this to another human being.’
