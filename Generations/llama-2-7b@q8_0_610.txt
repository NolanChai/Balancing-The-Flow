- It was a mistake by an employee or volunteer and the employee/volunteer should be fired and the museum should publicly apologize to everyone who ever donated money or time to support the museum, and anyone else who might have been offended.
- The person who built it is too stupid to work in that environment so they should be fired. Anyone who did not see what was happening is a moron and should be fired for allowing their co-worker/boss to display something like this at the museum.
- It's art, get over yourselves.
