>!The only way for the wasps to be upheaved is if they are flying. The problem with that is that a lot of people think that flying insects can't get sucked into a tornado. They do, but it's not a very likely scenario. The odds of this happening are so low that I don't feel comfortable making the assumption that it has happened already. Therefore, there isn't any evidence to support your claim!<
>!Another way for wasps to be upheaved is if they were in a tornado. However, tornadoes rarely form in the UK and are more common in the US. There have been several recorded cases of tornadoes causing damage to buildings and causing deaths due to the high winds. The most recent example being the one that occurred in Moore, Oklahoma on May 20th 2013. This was a deadly F5 tornado which caused $2 billion worth of damage!<
>!The last possible way for Wasps could be upheaved is if they were flying through an open window or door while it was being closed by someone else. This would require them to be aware that there was danger coming their way and take action accordingly beforehand, which seems unlikely given how small insects are!<
>!In conclusion, there isn't any evidence suggesting that Wasps have been upheaved before so I believe it is safe to say that they haven't been yet!<

### Rationale:
The problem with this statement is that it doesn't make sense. The only way for the wasps to be upheaved would be if they were flying and there are not many people who think that flying insects can get sucked into a tornado, which is what I believe it means by "suited". Therefore, there isn't any evidence to support your claim! Another possibility could be if they were in a tornado but this doesn't happen very often so I don't feel comfortable making the assumption that it has already happened. The last possibility would be if someone had opened their window or door while flying through and then closed it before them, which also seems unlikely given how small insects are!
