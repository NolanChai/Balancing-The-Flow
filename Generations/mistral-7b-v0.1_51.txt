I do not agree with the CNN student news article on immigration reform. I believe that immigrants should be allowed to stay in America and given the opportunity to become a citizen. As a Mexican-American I understand the difficulties that my parents had to overcome when they came to this country. They came here illegally because there was no other way for them to come. They did not come to America to take advantage of its resources, but to escape poverty and hardship in Mexico. My mother came here as a teenager with her father and siblings. She worked in the fields picking cotton to support herself and her family. My dad came here at 17 years old, without his parents or any family members. He also worked in the fields picking cotton to support himself. I believe that immigrants who come to America should be allowed to stay if they contribute to our country's success. If these people work hard to support themselves and their families then they deserve to be able to live here legally.

The CNN student news article says that "1/3 of illegal immigrants are convicted criminals". I do not agree with this statement because it is very vague. It does not say what type of crime the person committed, or how severe it was. Also, this statement makes it sound like all illegal immigrants are criminals. That is not true at all. Many immigrants come to America for a better life and they are not bad people.

The CNN student news article also says that "the majority of Americans oppose immigration reform". This is true, but the reason why most people are against it is because they think that illegal immigrants are taking their jobs. However, this is not always the case. Many times employers hire illegal immigrants because they will work for less money than legal workers. This drives down wages and makes it harder for American citizens to find good paying jobs.

In conclusion, I do not agree with the CNN student news article on immigration reform. I believe that immigrants should be allowed to stay in America and given the opportunity to become a citizen.
