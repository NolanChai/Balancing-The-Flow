The son of former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling, who was convicted of espionage in 2015 and sentenced to four years in prison, was sentenced Tuesday to probation and community service for continuing his father's espionage activities after his father's imprisonment. The U.S. attorney's office in Portland, Oregon, said in a statement that the son, who has not been named, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit espionage in November 2018.
