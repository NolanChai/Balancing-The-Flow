Michael Pineda, a pitcher for the New York Yankees, was suspended for 10 games after Major League Baseball determined that he used an illegal substance to improve his grip on the baseball during a game on April 26th. The substance in question was pine tar, which is prohibited by MLB rules.

Pineda was caught on camera using pine tar on his hand during the game against the Baltimore Orioles. He admitted to using it after he was confronted by an umpire and suspended for 10 games as a result of this violation. Pine tar is commonly used to improve a pitcherâ€™s grip on the ball, but its use is strictly prohibited in MLB games.
