`This is a case of an English cyclist being killed in the Alps on a famous mountain road, where there are both cars and bikes sharing the same road, leading to the death of the cyclist. In this situation, it should be made more clear to all the drivers that they have to drive with caution as well as other rules such as having lights when necessary.`
