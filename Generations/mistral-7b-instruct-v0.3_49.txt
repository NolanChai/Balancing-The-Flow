 It's truly heartbreaking to hear about such a tragic situation. The pain and anguish that the son is experiencing can only be imagined. However, it's important to remember that even though he may feel this way, seeking professional help or support can be beneficial for him during this difficult time.

The thought of his mother suffering is indeed unbearable, but holding onto hope that she might be safe and eventually found could also bring some comfort. If the authorities are involved, they are working to find her and bring justice. It might be helpful for the son to focus on the efforts being made towards a positive outcome rather than speculating about his mother's condition.

Sending thoughts of strength and healing to this family during these challenging times.
