The seven sailors were on board an MV-22 Osprey when it collided with a CH-53E Sea Stallion helicopter at 9 p.m. Wednesday in the Yuma Proving Ground, said Lt. Cmdr. Matt Knight, a spokesman for U.S. Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk, Virginia.
"We extend our deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those who perished," Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery told reporters at a briefing in Washington on Thursday. "Their ultimate sacrifice will not be forgotten."
The sailors were all assigned to Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 361, based out of Camp Pendleton, California. They were on their way home after returning from deployment to Iraq when the collision occurred during a training exercise in the Gulf of California.
One Marine was initially reported missing and was later found dead near the wreckage. Knight said he could not release any further details about the incident or how it happened.
"I don't want to speculate on what caused this," Montgomery told reporters, "because right now we're focused on helping our fellow sailors and Marines that were impacted by this tragic event."
The helicopters involved in the collision were from a training squadron at Marine Corps Air Station New River in Jacksonville, North Carolina. The midair accident was the third for the unit since 2015 and is under investigation, Knight said.
"All of us are going to have to look ourselves in the mirror and ask if there's something that we could do better," he said. "It will be a time-consuming process."
