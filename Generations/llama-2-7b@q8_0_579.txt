- The man who helped researchers gain access to the highest canopy of the Amazon rainforest has now created the UK’s first treetop trampoline adventure park.

- With bridges, zip wires and rope swings, it’s designed for all ages – including children as young as five. 

- The park is located in a woodland near Staines, Surrey, and the company behind the project are hoping that it will attract as many as 200,000 visitors per year.
