The use of Tasers by police officers has been shown to be an effective tool in deterring and subduing violent suspects. Given the growing concern over the threat of terrorist attacks by lone-wolf individuals, providing all frontline police officers with a Taser would provide them with an additional weapon in their arsenal to help prevent and stop such attacks. Tasers are non-lethal weapons that can be used as a less-than-lethal alternative to firearms, and they have proven to be effective in reducing the risk of injury or death to both officers and suspects during confrontations. By making Tasers more widely available to police officers, it would ensure that they are better equipped to respond to any potential terrorist threat and help keep our communities safe.
