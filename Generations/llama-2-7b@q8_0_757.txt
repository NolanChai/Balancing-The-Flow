The suspect has been identified as 25-year-old Anthony Sneed. He is accused of stealing cars to sell the parts and was arrested after the shooting Wednesday afternoon in Atlanta's southwest quadrant.
Sneed had a warrant for his arrest on charges including vehicle burglary, carjacking, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, Atlanta police said Thursday morning.
Officers from both agencies were searching for Sneed because they believed he was involved with stealing cars to sell the parts, Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos told CNN.
Sneed was arrested without incident about an hour after the shooting, authorities said. He was hospitalized in good condition Thursday morning and charged with one count of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer. He is being held at Fulton County Jail pending extradition to Atlanta police headquarters for booking.
Another man, 26-year-old Brandon Burriss, was arrested Wednesday night after being seen throwing out a rifle in the area where Sneed was arrested, according to an incident report from Atlanta police.
Both men are charged with possession of stolen property and obstruction of an officer, Campos said. They were also taken to Fulton County Jail.
