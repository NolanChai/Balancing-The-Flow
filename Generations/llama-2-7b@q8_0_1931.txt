- [Professor] John Newton, from Cancer Research UK, said: "Men who take the pill may have a slightly higher risk of developing prostate cancer." The risks were very small though and "we don't think men should stop taking it on the basis of this study," he added.
- [The NHS] advises that taking the Pill could increase a womanâ€™s risk of developing breast cancer, but there are no similar warnings for men. However, Dr Newton warned: "It is still possible that taking the Pill may slightly increase prostate cancer risk in some people."
- [British Medical Journal] concluded: "While we have found a statistically significant association between use of oral contraceptives and subsequent development of prostate cancer, this finding needs to be interpreted with caution."
- [Professor] David Dockerty at the University of Edinburgh said: "The idea that prostate cancers are triggered by hormones is a longstanding one. But it was not until quite recently that scientists identified the role androgens play in stimulating tumour growth."
