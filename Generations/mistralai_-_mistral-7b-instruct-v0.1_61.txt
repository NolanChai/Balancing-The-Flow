 'zoo animals', according to a leading teacher union.
Chris Keates, the general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters' Union of Workers (NASUWT), has criticized the use of cameras in classrooms as an example of how teachers are being treated like "lab rats" and "zoo animals". He said that the cameras were stripping teachers of their professionalism, and that they were being used to "spy on" and "control" teachers.
Keates went on to say that the use of cameras in classrooms was a "violation of privacy", and that it was creating an hostile environment for both teachers and students. He called on schools to abandon the use of cameras in classrooms, and instead focus on creating a culture of trust and respect between teachers and students.
The NASUWT has been at odds with the government over a number of issues, including school funding, teacher pay, and workload. Keates has previously criticized the government for failing to listen to teachers' concerns, and for treating them as "an afterthought" in education policy.
