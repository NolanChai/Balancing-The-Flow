Yvette Cooper sparked a  furious row over immigration last night after claiming that the Government's policy on the issue is 'racist'. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time, the Shadow Home Secretary said that ministers have 'created a hostile environment for immigrants', and claimed they are only trying to cut numbers of people coming in from certain countries. She said: 'I think it is very important that we don't talk about immigration as if it was some kind of race issue. I think it is really dangerous and really wrong.' The comments were met with cries from the audience and she later said on Twitter: 'The right to live and work in any country should not be based on your skin colour or nationality - or a test of 'Britishness'.'
