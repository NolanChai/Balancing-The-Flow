As Yvette Cooper sparked a fierce row over immigration last night, her comments were met with outrage from some of her own MPs. The shadow home secretary sparked fury after she suggested that the government's net migration target of reducing numbers to 'tens of thousands' was unrealistic and could be scrapped. One Tory backbencher told MailOnline: 'This is a disaster waiting to happen. Yvette Cooper has just opened up a big can of worms.' Another MP said: 'This is political suicide. She will lose the support of her own party if she continues down this path.'
