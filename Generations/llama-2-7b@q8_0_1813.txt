The player was a bit part of our team. He was always injured and we had no use for him because his form wasn’t very good. But when the transfer window came up I said to David (Gold) “Why are you letting this guy go?”

He said “He wants to go to West Ham.” So, he went there. Then we got some more players in. And then I found out that I was actually going to lose Diafra Sakho because the manager wanted him back at West Ham and he wasn’t good enough for them but he was good enough to go with us!
I don’t understand how it works in England where if a player wants to move to another club, which is fine by me - that happens all over the world. But what I don’t get is why then you want to take my players because I haven’t used them. That doesn’t make any sense at all!
