Doyin Richards took to Facebook recently to post a photo of himself with his two young daughters, ages one and five. In the picture, he can be seen carrying both girls on his shoulders as they happily play in their stroller. The caption for the photo read, “Fathers are just as capable as mothers at multitasking!”

The post quickly gained traction online, with many people praising Richards for his ability to balance childcare and other responsibilities. However, some commenters took the opportunity to leave racist remarks about Richards’s parenting skills. In response to these comments, Richards took to Facebook once again to defend himself and his abilities as a father. He wrote:

“I am saddened that in 2016, there are still people who believe that fathers should not be taking an active role in their children’s lives. I am also upset at the racist comments that have been made about me and my daughters. My wife and I are raising our girls to know that they can do anything they set their minds to, regardless of their gender or race. We will continue to show them love and support every step of the way.”
