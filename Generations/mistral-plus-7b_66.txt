Roberto Soldado joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2013 from Valencia CF, where he had spent five years playing in La Liga. The Spanish striker was brought to North London as part of Andre Villas-Boas’s plans to bolster Spurs’ attacking options and provide competition for Harry Kane.

Soldado made an immediate impact at White Hart Lane, scoring 19 goals in his first season with the club. This included a hat-trick against Aston Villa and a brace against West Ham United. He finished the campaign as Tottenham’s top goalscorer, demonstrating his clinical finishing and ability to find the back of the net.

Soldado continued to be a regular goalscorer for Spurs in subsequent seasons, scoring 17 goals in all competitions during the 2014-15 campaign. However, he struggled to maintain this form in subsequent years, with injuries and lack of playing time limiting his impact on the team.
