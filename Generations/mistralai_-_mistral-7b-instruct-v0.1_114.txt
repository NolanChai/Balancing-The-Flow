 According to a recent survey by travel booking site Expedia, London was the top choice for romantic destinations in the UK, with Hull coming in last place. The survey found that over 40% of people preferred London for its combination of historical landmarks, cultural attractions, and world-renowned dining options.

However, many respondents also mentioned the city's lively nightlife and vibrant energy as contributing factors to its romantic appeal. Other popular destinations included Paris, Rome, New York City, and Edinburgh. Hull, on the other hand, was seen as lacking in charm and attractions, with few notable landmarks or cultural experiences. Despite this, some locals and visitors alike have praised Hull's friendly atmosphere, historic architecture, and stunning waterfront views.
