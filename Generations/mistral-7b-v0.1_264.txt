As a victim of sexual abuse I can tell you that there are no words to describe the pain that was inflicted on me as a child.  However, the one thing I do remember is how hard it was for me to be able to speak up about what had happened to me and then going through all those years of being questioned and having my character assassinated by the lawyers for the opposing side.

The fact that victims are not given any protection when they are in court testifying against their abusers is absolutely outrageous!  These victims should be treated with respect and dignity, not like criminals themselves.  They have already been through so much, it's time for society to step up and show them some compassion.

I believe that there needs to be an immediate change made when it comes to how sexual abuse cases are handled in court.  Victims should never have to relive their trauma by being questioned about every detail of what happened to them over again on the witness stand.  This is not only unfair, but also extremely cruel.

The only way we will be able to stop this type of abuse from happening again is if there are stricter laws put into place that protect these innocent victims from further harm.  We can't keep allowing perpetrators like Bill Cosby or Harvey Weinstein get away with what they did because our justice system wasn't strong enough to hold them accountable for their actions when it mattered most â€“ during trial time!
