In 2015 I was homeless. I had no money and nowhere to live. I didn't even have a phone or credit card. I couldn't afford to buy food or drinks; the only way I could get them was through food banks. It felt like I had lost everything, but somehow, I wasn't completely alone in my misery because there were hundreds of others like me on that same street corner - many with bags full of clothes, sleeping bags and blankets.
