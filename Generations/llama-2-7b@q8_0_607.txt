The answer to this question lies in a bit of history. When Codility was first created in 2015, we had only a handful of problems available and most were based on competitive programming challenges from Codeforces or TopCoder. This meant that our questions could be quite tricky â€“ not everyone was familiar with them yet.

But as time went on, more people started playing with Codility and new problem types emerged. Suddenly, we had a lot of users who were looking for simpler exercises to hone their programming skills. At the same time, many developers wanted something a bit more challenging in order to get better at competitive coding.

So what did we do? We decided to introduce double-points problems! These are questions that have both easy and hard versions (or variants), allowing our users to pick one according to their preferences: if they want an exercise that is simple but still fun, they can choose the easy version; on the other hand, if they're up for a bit more of a challenge, they can tackle the hard variant instead.

We've now added over 100 new problems with double-points variants (and counting)! You might find them in our Codility Pro subscription or you could check out our Codility Playground page.
