 The article discusses the findings of a study that suggests cheetahs use a combination of stealth, speed, and flexibility when hunting. It is described as a "killer combination" that allows them to catch prey such as antelope with remarkable efficiency.

The study involved tracking the movements of cheetahs using GPS collars and analyzing their behavior. Researchers found that cheetahs often stalk their prey for long periods of time, using their keen senses to detect any signs of movement. Once they have spotted a target, they use their incredible speed to catch it, often reaching speeds of up to 70 miles per hour.

However, the study also revealed that cheetahs are not just reliant on speed. They also use their flexibility and agility to maneuver around obstacles and avoid detection by other predators. In fact, researchers found that cheetahs are able to change direction quickly and make sharp turns, which helps them to stay one step ahead of their prey.

Overall, the study highlights the impressive hunting skills of cheetahs and suggests that their unique combination of stealth, speed, and flexibility is what makes them such successful hunters.
