It's no wonder they're so secretive when you consider just how much money is at stake in the sport. According to a recent report, the total value of the Premier League has reached an astonishing Â£3.5 billion, with clubs like Manchester City and Chelsea leading the way in terms of revenue.
As if that wasn't enough, the league's global reach is also unmatched, broadcast in over 200 countries worldwide. This means that Premier League players are not only fighting for their own personal glory, but also for a share of the vast riches that come with being part of one of the most successful and popular sports leagues on the planet.
It's little wonder then, that they're so guarded when it comes to discussing their pay packets. With millions at stake, the competition for places in the starting line-up is fierce, and players are determined to keep their earning power a secret from their rivals.
