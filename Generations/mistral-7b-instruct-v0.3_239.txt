 Indeed! Witnessing such a spectacle as a horizontal rainbow over the iconic Eiffel Tower in Paris must have been a truly memorable experience. A horizontal rainbow, also known as a circular or full rainbow, occurs when raindrops reflect and refract sunlight at the same angle, creating a circle or band around the sun or moon. This phenomenon is quite rare and adds an extra layer of enchantment to the already beautiful cityscape of Paris.
