Couples who want to tie the knot in Britain now need a special visa or risk being deported, under new government rules introduced today. 
  
 A spokesman for the Home Office said it is "perfectly possible" for non-EU nationals to be married in the UK but added: 
  
 "There may be cases where we decide that an individual should not be allowed into the country if their presence would be a burden on public funds." 
  
 The new rules will apply from today and follow months of speculation about whether the Home Office was planning to ban foreign brides and grooms. 
  
 Some British couples have already had to postpone their big days due to uncertainty over the new visa restrictions, which were announced in March but with no clear timetable for implementation. 
  
 They mean couples will now need an entry clearance visa from the Home Office before they can get married in Britain, regardless of whether or not they are non-EU nationals. The new rules also state that a British citizen who marries abroad must return to the UK within two months - which could mean a change in holiday plans for many couples. 
  
 Many critics have attacked the move as "sexist" and questioned why the Home Office is only targeting women by saying non-EU national men can still bring their foreign brides to the UK, without needing a visa. 
  
 The spokesman said there are no plans for EU nationals to have to apply for an entry clearance visa to marry in Britain. 
  
 A Home Office spokesman said: "It is perfectly possible for non-EU nationals to be married in the UK but we want to ensure that all couples who come here, regardless of their nationality, can support themselves financially and return home." 
  
 The change has been prompted by rising costs of benefits for newly-married immigrants. There were 26,547 overseas weddings in the UK in 2010 with a total cost to the taxpayer of more than Â£31 million, according to Home Office figures released this week. 
  
 The move has been welcomed by some MPs and campaigners who say it will help to reduce benefit fraud. But other have said that immigrants should not be subject to "quasi-marriage tests" before they are allowed to marry in the UK. 
  
 In March, Home Secretary Theresa May said: "It is right that we should consider whether individuals are able to support themselves financially and return home if things go wrong." 
  
 She added that while there would be exceptions for certain categories of people - including pregnant women or those with life-threatening conditions who need emergency treatment in the UK - it was not fair for everyone else.
