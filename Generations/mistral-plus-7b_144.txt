The pregnant daughter of a millionaire suffered a traumatic experience when she was brutally assaulted by a burglar who broke into their family home. The burglar, who had been caught in the act, viciously kicked her in the stomach, causing her to collapse and go into labour prematurely. Luckily, medical assistance arrived on time, and the baby was born safely with no major complications. However, the incident left both mother and daughter traumatised and in need of counselling.
