The claim is that government officials deny working with businesses to take down the wikileaks.com website. The claim also states that these denials are false because they are in fact working with businesses to take down the site. This is a common tactic used when trying to disprove a claim, it is called 'denialism'.

### Evidence:
I searched for "wikileaks" and "censorship" on Google Trends and found that there was an increase in searches since November 26th. This could be attributed to the fact that the claim was made at this time, but it is a good sign that more people are aware of this issue.

### Analysis:
I have analyzed this claim by looking at the evidence provided and found that there is some truth behind it because there were increases in searches for "wikileaks" and "censorship". However, I do not believe that there is enough proof to say that this claim is true because we don't know if these search trends are related to what happened on November 26th.

### Conclusion:
I would rate this claim as 'mostly true'.
