Put it on Channel 5, OK?

I do. Why, do you want me to change the channel? Yes, please. I can't stand watching the channel any more. I think they have pretty good programmes. But I'll change it if you really want. Put it on Channel 5, OK?

1. The TV is currently tuned into a channel that the speaker doesn't want to watch, and they ask if someone has the remote control.
2. The speaker responds by saying that they do have the remote control, but that they don't want to change the channel.
3. The speaker then asks why the speaker wants to change the channel, and the speaker says they can't stand watching the current channel any more.
4. The speaker offers to put it on a different channel, but the speaker says they hate that channel and would rather listen to the radio instead.
5. The speaker asks the person not to make such a fuss, saying that they're sure they will like today's programme.

The dialogue ends with the speaker asking who has the remote control again, implying that they want to change the channel back to what it was before.

Hi, who has the remote control?  
I do. Why, do you want me to change the channel?   
Yes, please. I can't stand watching the channel any more.   
I think they have pretty good programmes. But I'll change it if you really want. 
Put it on Channel 5, OK?  
Oh, I hate Channel 5. I'd rather just listen to the radio. 
Don't make such a fuss. I'm sure you will like today's programme.   
What's on today?
