I think that she is very pretty . 

Tell me how she looks . 

She's kind of short . 

What height is she ? 

She's probably about five feet .

There's a new girl in school, have you seen her yet?  I haven't seen her yet.  I think that she is very pretty. Tell me how she looks. She's kind of short. What height is she? She's probably about five feet. That's nice, but tell me what she looks like. The first thing I noticed was her beautiful brown eyes.

"What else did you notice?"

"She has long black hair and she's skinny . "

" How skinny is she? Like a size zero skinnier than the average girl?"

" Yeah, pretty much . "

" Does she have any freckles or moles anywhere on her face or body?"

" Nope . "

" What about her lips? Do they look full or thin ? "

" They're a little bit thin . But I think that she is just starting to grow into them."

"Do you think that she has any facial hair at all, like on her chin or upper lip?"

" Nope, definitely not ."

" How about her cheekbones? Do they look prominent or flat ? "

" They're pretty prominent . She's got really high cheekbones."

" I think that she is probably the prettiest girl in school . What do you think?"

" Yeah, I agree with you. I mean, she has a nice smile too."

" Have you talked to her yet ?"

" Not yet . But I'm definitely going to try to talk to her soon."

" I bet she is super nice and friendly . You should totally introduce yourself to her . "

" Yeah, I will definitely do that. What do you think I should say when I talk to her? Should I just ask her about school or something?"

" No, that's too boring. You should say hi first and then compliment her on her looks. You can say something like 'Hi there! It's nice to meet you. You have really pretty eyes.' Something like that."

" Okay, I will definitely do that. Thanks for your help!"

" No problem! You're welcome. So, how was your day? Is anything interesting happening at school today?"

"She has long black hair and a nice smile too."

"Wow, that sounds like someone I would like to get to know better. Do you think we could introduce ourselves today after class?"

"I don't know if that would be a good idea . We might have different friends and things to do."

"We both go to the same school so we must have something in common right ? Besides, I am pretty outgoing so it won't be too hard for me. What about you ?"

"I guess you could introduce yourself but I don't want to force anything . Just keep your eyes peeled and maybe you'll see her again tomorrow."

"Okay, thanks for the advice! Let's talk more later on this week after class. It was nice talking with you!"

"Same here! Bye."
