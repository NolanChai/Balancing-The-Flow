Yes, I am planning on visiting family in two weeks. 

Can you tell me what the latest time would be to make an appointment? 

I'm happy to help! The earliest possible appointment is at 3pm and it would be great if you could give us a call back when you get back to town so we can work on your hair and nails. 

Thanks, I will do that. 

How are you doing today? Would you like some tea or coffee?
