1. Yes, I can provide information on dental offices in the area. Can I confirm that you are looking for a dentist in the UK? Or do you have any other questions?

2. Of course! Here is some information on our office: We specialize in family dentistry and offer a wide range of services, including general checkups, cleanings, fillings, crowns, bridges, and extractions. Our team includes experienced dentists and hygienists who are dedicated to providing the highest quality care to all patients.

3. I'm sorry, but we don't have a dentist named "Tony" working at our office. Could you provide me with more information about the person you're looking for? Maybe their name or the city they're located in? That way, I can help you better.

Tony (Me): Hello. It's Tony calling from the dentist's office. Is Lily there?
No, Lily is not here at the moment.
Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in?
Sure. What's your number please?
519 367 8901.
