"I see . Well, Cindy, what kinds of things can we talk about today?"

"Today we will be talking about TV programs."

"OK. What do you like to watch on TV ? "

"I enjoy watching sitcoms and comedies a lot . They're great for relieving stress after a long day at work ."

"Cindy, why are most of the prime-time shows in America half an hour long? Aren't they too short?"

"Well, that is because Americans love sitcoms. A sitcom is a type of TV program that airs weekly and lasts 30 minutes. They usually feature ordinary people, but they still teach wholesome values."

"That sounds interesting! In Taiwan, the prime-time shows are an hour long, and some of them aren't comedies at all ."

"Hmm... that is different from what we have here in America. But I'm sure it must be just as enjoyable for people who watch those shows."
