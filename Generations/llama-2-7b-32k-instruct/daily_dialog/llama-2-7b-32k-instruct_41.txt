1 / 1I'm sorry, but there was a typo in my previous response. Here's the corrected version:

"Where is your current residence? (If you don't have one, just say 'None')"

"My domicile place is Hebei Province ."

"What is your nationality?"

"I am Chinese by birth."

Please let me know if there are any other questions or errors.
