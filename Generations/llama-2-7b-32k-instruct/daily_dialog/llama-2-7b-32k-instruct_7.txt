Yes, I am at The Westin Washington Dulles Airport . My flight got in late and my bags have not been sent up yet . 

I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number, please? We will check our system as soon as possible. Your bags are actually being delivered now. 

Thank you for checking! It took a while but it was worth the wait. 

You're most welcome ! Have a great evening.

Continue the dialogue: "I apologize for the delay, but there was an issue with our baggage system. We have since rectified the problem and your bags should be arriving shortly."

Please provide a response to my previous message that contains a follow-up question related to the topic of the baggage system's malfunction: "Can you give me an estimated time for when my bags might arrive?" 

This will allow me to gauge the hotel's level of service and responsiveness. 

I am waiting for your response, so please be prompt. Thank you!

1 / 1Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they ?  
Continue writing: "I apologize for the delay, but we just received your bag and will send it right up." 

Please provide a dialogue that is suitable for a hotel concierge assistant. You can ask follow-up questions based on my answers. For example, if I say I'm looking for a vegetarian restaurant in New York City, you might respond with "Would you like to know the address or phone number?" 

This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ?
