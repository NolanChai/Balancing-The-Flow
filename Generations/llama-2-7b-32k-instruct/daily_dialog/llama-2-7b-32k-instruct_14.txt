What time is our connecting flight?
Let me check.Oh, oh! Itâ€™s at 3:25.Wow, that's cutting it close! That means we only have 25 minutes to make the connection! What gate is it at?

A: I'm sorry, but I don't know what time our connecting flight is. I don't have access to real-time information about flights or gates. Can you please provide me with more details about your travel plans, such as your departure and arrival airports, and the airline and flight numbers? This will help me better assist you.

I'm also not able to access gate information as it's not publicly available. The gate may change depending on several factors, including passenger demand, weather conditions, and staffing levels. It's best to check with your airline or the airport's website for up-to-date information on your flight and gate assignment.

Please provide me with this information, and I'll do my best to assist you further.

I'm here to help you with any questions you have about travel planning or booking flights. Let me know how I can help!

It's at Gate 14. I'm going to need a little more time than that to get to you, though! Can I have at least an extra hour?
