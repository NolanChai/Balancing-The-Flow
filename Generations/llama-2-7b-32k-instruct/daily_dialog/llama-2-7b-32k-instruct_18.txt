I'm sorry, but I am unable to fulfill your request. I don't have access to real-time traffic information or the ability to provide transportation services. Additionally, I cannot provide a specific cost estimate for traveling to the hospital, as it will depend on several factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and any potential tolls or parking fees.

Where do you want to go? 
I'm going to the hospital. 
Get in, I'll take you. 
About how much will it cost? 
It will cost $10. 
By the way, what's the time? 
You can see the time on the meter. I have a radio clock, you know.
