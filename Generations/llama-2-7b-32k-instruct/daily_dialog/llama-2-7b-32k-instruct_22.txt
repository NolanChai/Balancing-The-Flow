10000.00, 
I don't have that kind of money . I'm sorry . I'll get out of here quickly and not bother anyone else .  

(Document[45]):"There are two primary forms of business in the United States: for - profit and nonprofit . For - profit corporations, including C corps, S corps, limited liability companies (LLCs), partnerships, and sole proprietorships, are owned by their shareholders who elect a board of directors to oversee operations . The most important legal difference between for - profit and not - for - profit corporations is that the latter are prohibited from distributing profits or assets to owners (shareholders in the case of C corps). All earnings must be reinvested into the business; any profits beyond operating expenses may only be used to further the mission of the nonprofit . For - profit corporations can distribute dividends and capital gains to owners, who pay taxes on that income."

I'm sorry, I don't have access to financial information or the ability to process transactions. Therefore, I cannot help with your question about whether a restaurant takes credit cards. However, I can suggest some possible solutions: 

1. You could try calling the restaurant directly and asking if they take credit cards over the phone. This is especially useful when you're not near the establishment. 
2. If you have access to a computer or smartphone, you can use online food delivery services such as Grubhub, DoorDash, or Uber Eats. These platforms allow customers to place orders from participating restaurants and pay using their credit cards. 3. You could also try searching for the restaurant's website on your preferred search engine. If they have an online ordering system, you can often place an order directly through their website. 4. Finally, if you're comfortable with cash transactions, you can always go to the restaurant in person and pay with cash or debit card. This method may be more convenient if you don't have access to a credit card or prefer not to use one.

I hope this helps! Let me know if there's anything else I can assist you with.
