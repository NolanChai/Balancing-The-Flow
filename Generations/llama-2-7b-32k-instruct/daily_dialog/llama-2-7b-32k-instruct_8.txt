Yes, I did. In my last semester, I won the Best Student Leader Award for my contributions to student life on campus. It was a great honor, and it's something that I'm really proud of.

Would you like me to elaborate?

Yes, I was president of the Student Council during my college years.

I got several honors and awards, including being named Excellent Party Member. I also participated in various clubs, such as the Student Union and the Debate Club, where I served as an executive board member.

During my senior year, I was elected to serve on the University Council, which is a decision-making body that represents students' interests at the university level. Additionally, I was involved in community service activities, such as volunteering for local charities and organizing events that benefited the university and its students.

I also had the opportunity to study abroad during my junior year, which broadened my perspective and helped me gain a global understanding of various cultures and societies.

Yes . I was president of the Student Council of our university .  

I'm sorry, could you repeat that? Did you say you were a leader while being a student at a certain school?  

Yes, I was elected as president of the Student Council of my university.  In addition to this, I was also an active member in several clubs and activities throughout college .   

That's awesome ! Do you still keep in touch with any of your classmates or professors from that time?  

Yes, I do. I am friends with many of my former classmates on social media platforms and occasionally exchange messages with some of them to keep up with their lives . As for the professors, a few of them still work at my university and I have kept in touch with them as well.   

That's great! It's always nice to stay connected with people you've had the chance to know so closely while studying. Anything else you want to share about your college experience or any specific memories that come to mind?  

I remember a time when we, as students, were asked to present our views on certain topics to the university management. I volunteered myself to speak in front of everyone and shared my ideas about how to improve the quality of education at our university. The professor who was moderating the event was very impressed with my presentation and said that it was one of the best ones he had ever seen. That moment made me feel proud and confident, and I realized that I could achieve anything if I put my mind to it. It was a valuable lesson that has stayed with me even after graduation.  

That's truly inspiring! You must have been quite a motivational speaker back then. Did you ever consider pursuing a career in public speaking or leadership?  

Yes, I did. After graduating from college, I started working as an educator and continued to deliver lectures at various institutions and conferences throughout my career. While I never formally trained as a speech coach or public speaker, I always found joy in helping others improve their communication skills and build confidence through speaking engagements. As for leadership positions, I served on several boards of directors over the years, which allowed me to continue using my problem-solving and critical thinking skills acquired during college.  

That's great! It sounds like you had a fulfilling career in education and public speaking. Do you have any advice for students who are interested in pursuing similar fields?  

My advice would be to focus on honing your communication and interpersonal skills. In today's world, where communication is crucial for success, it's important to learn how to effectively express yourself, listen actively, and work well with others. Additionally, I believe that building a strong network of professional connections can open up new opportunities in the future, so make an effort to build relationships with mentors, colleagues, and peers. Finally, never stop learning, as education is a lifelong process that can help us grow both personally and professionally.
