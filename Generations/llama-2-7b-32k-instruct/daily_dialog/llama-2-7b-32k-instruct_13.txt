You're not a hero, but you could be. There are many ways to make a positive impact in the world, such as by volunteering, donating to charity, or advocating for important causes. It's also important to remember that even small actions can make a difference, so it's important to do what we can and inspire others to do the same. 

I hope you have a great day!
