"No, he has never missed one."

"Really? That is so rare! Why do you think that is?"

"I'm not sure, but it might be because Robert doesn't like crowds or parties. He prefers to spend time with just a few close friends and family members."

"That sounds reasonable enough. But still, it's very odd for someone who used to come all the time suddenly stop coming for no apparent reason. Maybe something happened in his personal life that made him want to avoid our parties?"

"Maybe. Or perhaps he just got tired of them and wanted to do something else."

"That makes sense too. It's a shame we'll never know, really."

"I agree. Well, at least Robert still comes over sometimes for dinner or drinks. Maybe someday he'll tell us why he stopped coming to our parties, but until then, it's just a mystery."

"True that. Still, it's good to have him as a friend even if he does prefer his own company most of the time. You know what they say: variety is the spice of life!"
