Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal has revealed that he is still suffering from the knee injury that troubled him throughout the latter stages of the 2013-14 campaign. The midfielder was forced to undergo a surgery on his left knee in April and although it was thought that the Chilean would be fit for the start of the World Cup, he has revealed that he is still struggling with some discomfort.

Vidal said: “I am not yet 100 percent ready but I am getting there. The injury was serious. It has been tough to recover from it. It has taken a long time for me to feel better and get back on the pitch. But, step by step, I have returned.”
