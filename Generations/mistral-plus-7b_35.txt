The spate of terrifying night-time rapes in an isolated, orthodox Christian community went on for a long time before it was noticed. With the increased awareness and reports from residents, police were finally able to make arrests of several suspects who terrorized the women of their small town. The perpetrators were sentenced to lengthy prison terms and the community hoped that this would put an end to the violence. However, after a few months it became apparent that there was still a threat of rape in the area and the police had to be on high alert to prevent further attacks.

Despite the increased security measures, the rapes continued unabated. It seemed as if there were always men lurking around waiting for their next victim. The community grew more and more scared as time went on and the authorities did not seem able to stop the violence. They installed bright lights in the streets at night, but that only made it easier for the rapists to see their prey.

Eventually, the residents took matters into their own hands and formed a neighborhood watch group. This allowed them to keep an eye out for suspicious activity and report any potential threats to the police. The community also began taking self-defense classes in order to be better prepared in case of an attack. With these new measures in place, the rapes were finally brought under control and the residents felt a little safer once again.
