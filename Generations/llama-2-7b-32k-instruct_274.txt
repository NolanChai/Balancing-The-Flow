Alderman Richard Lewis, Mayor of Westminster in London, was caught exceeding the limit on two occasions when he travelled between meetings by taxi. The maximum penalty is Â£500 and six points, which means he would lose his driving licence if convicted . He has pleaded guilty to both charges and will be sentenced in February.
