The hugely-anticipated launch of the iPhone 5 is only two days away â€“ and speculation is mounting over what the must-have gadget will look like.

One popular rumour is that Apple will unveil a thinner, lighter device with an edge-to-edge screen and a new A5 processor.

The iPhone 4S is expected to include an improved camera and voice assistant called Siri.

It is thought the 5th generation of iPhones could also have near field communication technology (NFC), which would enable users to make payments with their handsets.
