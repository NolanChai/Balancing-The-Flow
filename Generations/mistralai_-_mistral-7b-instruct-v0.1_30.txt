 The Chilean midfielder, who signed a three-year contract with Barcelona in July, has been out of action since June 30th and had surgery on his left knee to repair ligament damage. He had initially hoped to return before the start of the new campaign, but now admits that he is still not fully fit.

"I'm working hard to get back to playing, but I don't know how long it will take," Vidal said in an interview with ESPN. "The knee is still sore and swollen, so we have to be patient."

Despite his setback, Vidal remains optimistic about his future at Bar√ßa and is excited to play alongside Lionel Messi and other world-class players on the team. He also expressed his gratitude for the support of the club's fans and staff during his recovery process.

"I feel very happy here and I'm grateful for everything they've done for me," he said. "The fans have been amazing, and the doctors and physios are working hard to help me get back to full fitness."
