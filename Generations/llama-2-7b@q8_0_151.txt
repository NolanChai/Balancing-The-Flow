* The brand is called Marlboro and it’s made by British American Tobacco (BAT) which is one of the biggest companies in the world. 
* It was started back in 1924 when a man called Philip Morris created them in America, but they were originally called “Marlboros” because he thought people would buy them if they knew they came from the Marlborough tobacco region in England (hence why they’re now called ‘Marlboro’s). 
* In 1935 when BAT started selling them under licence from Philip Morris, there was no health warning printed on them because they thought it would scare people off buying cigarettes altogether!
