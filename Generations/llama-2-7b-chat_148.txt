John Oddie, 78, who passed away last week, was born and raised in the small town of Stawell in western Victoria. After completing his secondary education, he joined the Australian Army at the age of 18 and served for nearly four decades, including during the Vietnam War.
'I grew up on a farm, working hard from a young age,' John told Daily Mail Australia in an interview last year. 'But I always had a sense of adventure and wanted to see more of the world.'
John's time in the military took him to many different countries, including Malaysia, Singapore, and Papua New Guinea. He also served in the Sinai Desert during the Yom Kippur War in 1973.
Despite the many challenges he faced throughout his career, John said he had no regrets about serving in the military. 'It was an incredible experience and I would do it all again if I could,' he said.
