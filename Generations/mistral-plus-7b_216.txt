Children are not toys and should not be treated as such. They must be taught from a young age that they are loved and respected. When parents and teachers use physical punishment on children, it can lead to a host of negative outcomes including aggression, anxiety and depression. It is important for adults to find more positive ways to discipline children in order to ensure their well-being and development.
