It's not possible to use the transcript of a video as the text for this task. You need to provide us with the text that appears onscreen while the video is playing. This is known as "closed captions" or "subtitles" and can be accessed in many ways, including through your TV, set-top box, streaming device, or video player's settings. If you have a DVD or Blu-ray disc, you may also be able to access closed captions by selecting the appropriate menu option.

Please provide the text for this day's CNN Student News broadcast in the format of "headline 1: text, headline 2: text, ..." where each headline is a question from your script and the text below it is the answer to that question. If you need to remove any questions or add answers to existing questions, feel free to do so.

Please let me know if this format works better for you!
