Nicklas Bendtner will be fined by Arsenal after the club opened an internal investigation into bizarre claims from a Norwegian journalist that he has been having sex with a prostitute on a regular basis.
Bendtner, 24, has been linked with a move away from the Emirates this summer and his behaviour could lead to him being sold by Arsene Wenger.
The Danish striker was reportedly warned about his conduct at the club's London Colney training ground last week following an article in Norwegian newspaper VG which claimed that he had paid for sex with a prostitute on a regular basis.
Bendtner has been fined by the club and is now expected to be disciplined again after Arsenal decided to take action.
