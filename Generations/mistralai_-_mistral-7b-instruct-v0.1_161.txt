 It's understandable that this would be concerning news for the patients and staff at that hospital. The shortage of senior medical professionals could potentially compromise the level of care provided to patients, as well as put additional strain on existing staff members. If you have concerns about your own health or are concerned about someone else's health, it's always best to speak with a medical professional who can provide personalized advice and guidance.
