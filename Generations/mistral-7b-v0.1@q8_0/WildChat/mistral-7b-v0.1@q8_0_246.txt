1.	Implement a function called iterative_binomial that computes the binomial coefficient using an iterative approach. The function should take two integer parameters n and k, where n is the number of trials and k is the number of successes. The function should return the value of the binomial coefficient C(n,k) using a for loop that counts from 1 to k+1.
2.	Implement a function called recursive_binomial that computes the binomial coefficient using a recursive approach. The function should take two integer parameters n and k, where n is the number of trials and k is the number of successes. The function should use the recurrence relation for computing binomial coefficients as follows:
C(n,k) = C(n-1,k-1) + C(n-1,k)
The function should return the value of the binomial coefficient using recursive calls until the base case is reached.
3.	Write a program that tests both functions iterative_binomial and recursive_binomial with different input sizes (n = 5, n = 10, n = 15, ...). For each input size, measure the execution time of both functions using Python's timeit module.
4.	Use Big O notation to explain the results obtained from your experimental analysis. Explain why one approach might be faster or slower than another for specific values of n and k.

        print("Recursive time:", recursive_time)
4.	Big O Notation Explanation:
    For n = 5, the execution times for both functions are similar because they perform a small number of operations. However, as n increases, the difference between the execution times becomes more significant. The iterative function executes in O(n^2) time, while the recursive function executes in O(n k) time.
    When n is much larger than k (for example, when n=15 and k=4), the iterative approach performs better because it requires fewer operations compared to the recursive approach. However, as k increases, the recursive approach becomes more efficient because it has less overhead associated with function calls.

I was trying to figure out how to add some subtlety to the sounds in my game, specifically by having each of the individual sounds be slightly different from each other. I had an idea that instead of having a bunch of individual clips for every sound and loading them into an array, I could have the computer generate it's own array.

I did this by using [CODE]randomize(100, 255);[/CODE] to get a random number within 100-255, which I use to create an array of clips in that range. Then I can access each clip with the numbers, and play them randomly for sounds.

I'm wondering if this is too much or not enough, and what else I could do to make the game sound more like it was recorded on a real machine?
