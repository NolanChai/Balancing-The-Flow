I'm sure the intent of that is to say "Partner no longer available..." but I've never seen it written that way. You can probably get away without the extra space between Partner and not. But the last word is "not" not "now".

[INTRPL]If you are not in the US, you can set up a Skype meeting with me, and then we can use Google Docs or some other online collaboration tool.[/INTRPL]

I'm available most weekends, as well as weekday evenings after 5:00 pm PST (8:00pm EST). The next weekend I am free is November 19th-20th. If you are not in the US, Skype works pretty well for international calls.

I'm working on getting my availability calendar set up; hopefully that will be online soon.
