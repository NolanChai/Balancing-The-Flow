[INTRO]When James entered the club, he was in awe at how packed it was. It seemed like all the hottest people in town were there and he felt like such a loser. He wasn’t even sure why he came to the club in the first place. But before he could get any further in his pity party, one of the bouncers approached him with a scowl on his face.

“Hey, what are you doing here?” The bouncer demanded.[/INTRO]

[RESPONSE_A]I’m just trying to have a good time.” James replied sheepishly.

[RESPONSE_B]I’m not leaving.” James said with a smirk.

[RESPONSE_C]Nothing, I was just looking for someone.” James lied.

[RESPONSE_D]None of your business.” James shot back angrily.[/RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C][RESPONSE_D]The bouncer looked at him for a moment before shaking his head and walking away.

James breathed a sigh of relief and headed towards the dance floor. As he got closer, he could hear the music getting louder and louder. He felt himself being drawn into the beat like a magnet. Just as he was about to reach the edge of the dance floor, one of the strippers approached him with a seductive look in her eyes.[/RESPONSE_D][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]"Hey big boy, want to have some fun?" She purred as she grabbed his hand and pulled him onto the dance floor.

James was in a daze as he followed her lead, moving his body to the beat of the music.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]He felt her hands all over his body and he couldn't help but get turned on.

[INTRO]Suddenly, one of the other strippers grabbed him from behind and started kissing his neck. She was so aggressive that he couldn’t even enjoy it anymore. He tried to push her away but she just wouldn’t let go.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]The next thing James knew, he was being dragged off the dance floor and into a dark corner of the club by two of the bouncers. They threw him to the ground and started beating him mercilessly.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]James was in so much pain he couldn’t even scream. He lay on the ground, battered and bruised, trying to process what just happened. He felt like such a fool for getting himself into this situation.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]He tried to get up but one of the bouncers grabbed him by his hair and pulled him back down.

"You're lucky we didn’t kill you." The bouncer spat as he kicked James in the ribs.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]James felt like his world was ending. He had always been so careful, always kept himself protected from harm’s way. But tonight he let his guard down and it cost him dearly.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]He closed his eyes and accepted his fate. He was going to die in this club, surrounded by all the people he thought were his friends.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]Suddenly, there was a loud bang and everything went dark. When James woke up again, he found himself in an alleyway.

They were standing next to a car with their hands on each other.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]They smiled at him mischievously as if they knew what he was thinking. Without another word, one of them got into the car and drove off while the other one stayed behind.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]"I'm sorry I couldn’t help you earlier." The stripper said as she reached out her hand to help James up. "But we had our own problems that night."[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]James looked at the woman in disbelief. She was offering him her hand, but he knew that it was too late now.[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]

[INTRO]"I’m going to die." James whispered as he took the woman's hand. "Please don’t let them take me alive..."[/INTRO][RESPONSE_A][RESPONSE_B][RESPONSE_C]
