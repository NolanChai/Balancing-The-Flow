This is why it's always best to not get mad until you actually have something concrete to get mad about, instead of just being mad because "you don’t like the changes". This way, when something that can actually justify your outrage comes out, you'll actually know how to react.

1) Try to identify the structure of the passage and its parts. What is it about? Why does it have to be like that?
2) Think what information you need to add or correct in order to make it logical, clear and persuasive.
3) Then you can use different techniques, for example:
a) You can refer to other experts: “As Peter Parker says…”;
b) You can use statistics: “According to the last report of WHO more than 350,000 people die each year because of smoking”;
c) You can also use a rhetorical question: “Is it possible to imagine that this is normal?”. It would be even better if you ask your own question.
