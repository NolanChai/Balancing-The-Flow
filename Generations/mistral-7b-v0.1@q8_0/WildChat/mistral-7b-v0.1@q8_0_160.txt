# Mindset

## Description

### By: Carol S Dweck

We are just one book away from the 2019 Top Ten List!
This week we feature Carol Dweck’s seminal work on mindsets.  As we start a new year, it is always good to reflect on our own mindset in relation to what we want to accomplish.  Our goal is not just to make some resolutions, but to set a growth mindset that will lead us down the road of success.  The book focuses on two mindsets – fixed and growth.
Fixed mindset people believe their intelligence or talent is static.  They see effort as fruitless and feel threatened by the idea that anyone could do better than them.  They think if they are not smart, talented or gifted they will never succeed.
Growth mindset people believe their talents can be developed through dedication and hard work – brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment.  Virtually all successful people have this mindset, they are more likely to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see effort as the path to mastery, learn from criticism and find lessons and inspiration in the success of others.
Mindsets are not innate – you can change them!
In her book, Carol Dweck shares many practical strategies on how we can develop a growth mindset, not only for ourselves but for those with whom we work.  As a parent or leader this is essential reading.
