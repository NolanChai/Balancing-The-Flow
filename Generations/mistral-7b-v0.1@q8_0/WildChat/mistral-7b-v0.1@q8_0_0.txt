Qualification to carry out Quality Assurance in accordance with the requirements of BS EN 1090-2 can be by one of two routes – a qualified engineer or technician, or an external QA body. The following are the requirements for each route:

BS EN 1090-2 states that a manufacturer is responsible for quality control and is to ensure that procedures are followed to achieve conformity with BS EN 1090-2; this can be done by either:

– Having a qualified engineer or technician in house to carry out the quality control role. This individual has to be trained by an approved body (currently the only one is BSI) and must also attend regular audits of their training, so as to demonstrate competency.

– Using an external body that is accredited under the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) to carry out QA procedures. This can be a quality management system, or an independent company such as QA1090 who only provide quality assurance services.

For all our clients, we will produce an audit report that clearly demonstrates your compliance with BS EN 1090-2 requirements. Our auditors are fully trained by BSI and our accreditation is through UKAS.
