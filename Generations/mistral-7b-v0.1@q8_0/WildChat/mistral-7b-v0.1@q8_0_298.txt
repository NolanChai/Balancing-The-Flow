Abstract: A strategy is proposed to obtain highly reactive and defective surfaces of 2D materials. This can be realized by introducing dopants (e.g., alkali metals) and by exposing them to an external electric field. The latter is particularly effective for creating active sites for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide on two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as MoSe2, WS2, MoTe2 or their composites with other 2D materials. As a result, we can obtain high catalytic activity at low overpotential and long term stability.

The goal of this project is to study the surface chemistry and reactivity of layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and their derivatives in order to unravel the mechanistic aspects related to the electrocatalytic activity on CO2 reduction. In particular, we will focus on the rational design of 2D materials as catalysts for the electrochemical conversion of CO2 to fuels or fine chemicals. The use of 2D materials in catalysis is an emerging field and the knowledge of their surface chemistry could be fundamental to optimize and/or exploit them. A series of advanced spectroscopic techniques (XPS, XAFS, TEM) will be employed for the study of the structural features of the active sites involved in CO2 reduction, as well as the possible formation of intermediates and/or side products.

Carbon Dioxide (CO_{2}) is an important molecule in the earth’s climate. The rise in atmospheric CO_{2} concentration has become a serious global problem due to its effect on the earth’s climate. If we want to maintain or even lower this concentration, one solution may be the conversion of CO_{2 }to other compounds that can be used as fuels.

The electrochemical reduction of CO_{2} to hydrocarbons, e.g., formic acid, methanol and higher alcohols, is an attractive alternative for chemical fuel production because it does not consume any additional feedstocks or produce waste streams. The reaction requires a suitable catalyst. In this project, two-dimensional materials such as graphene and MoS_{2} are used. For both materials, thickness regulation is essential to improve the catalytic performance.

In our study, we have shown that graphene layers with 30-150 atoms can be obtained by mechanically exfoliating graphite using adhesive tapes in an easy and reproducible way. The number of carbon atoms is confirmed using Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the thickness was determined with atomic force microscopy (AFM). AFM allows us to investigate the roughness of the exfoliated graphene layers. We find that thicker graphene flakes have a higher surface roughness. The thickness regulation is crucial because the catalytic activity and selectivity change with thickness.

For MoS_{2}, we used a chemical synthesis method to obtain different number of layers, from monolayer to bulk. In this project, we also show that Raman spectroscopy can be used for determining the number of layers. We found that the thickness has an important effect on the catalytic performance. A thickness of four to six layers is the most promising for obtaining higher selectivities towards CO and H_{2} than bulk MoS_{2}. This means that by controlling the synthesis parameters, the selectivity towards desired products can be achieved.

The results we obtained with our project have been published in RSC Advances and the Journal of Physical Chemistry C. We hope that this work can give new insights on how to improve electrochemical CO_{2} reduction for sustainable energy production.

## Abstract

This dissertation deals with the application and the implementation of engineering methods to develop highly-oriented electrodes in the field of carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR). It is divided into four sections. The first one discusses the main methods which are used for surface engineering. In this context, we describe the different ways to create porous structures using additive manufacturing techniques such as 3D-printing or micro-moulding. Then, we explain how to produce 2D materials like graphene, and also their functionalization with chemical methods such as CVD. In the second section, we present a new method which allows us to deposit 2D materials at room temperature using a chemical bath deposition (CBD). The last two sections are focused on the development of novel electrodes for CO2RR. We start by synthesizing porous substrates using 3D-printing and micro-moulding techniques in order to increase the specific surface area of the working electrode. Then, we combine these materials with graphene layers prepared by CBD. The first electrode is used in CO2RR for producing hydrogen. The second one is used for the production of formic acid from CO_{2} thanks to its ability to absorb carbon dioxide. This last application has a high interest for the valorization of waste gases and can be easily scaled up.

# Top-down approaches for nanosheets

### Researchers have developed a simple method to produce and modify layered nanosheets for applications in energy storage and sensing.

Novel materials often exhibit unique properties, but it’s difficult to design and prepare them with the required shapes, sizes and compositions. The synthesis of 2D nanosheets can be challenging due to their large specific surface areas and their tendency to aggregate during preparation, as well as a lack of control over the edge functionality. However, these structures have outstanding properties, which makes them very promising for applications in energy storage and sensing.

Researchers at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) have now developed a new method for the synthesis of layered nanosheets using top-down approaches, as well as a protocol that enables easy control over their edge functionality by simple chemical modification reactions. Their research is published in ChemistrySelect and featured on the cover.

The authors prepared mono- and bilayer nanosheets from the layered compound Co_{3}S_{4} by sonicating its crystals in water, which causes exfoliation to form an aqueous dispersion of nanosheets. The sheets can also be recovered easily as powders for use in various applications.

In order to modify their edge functionality, the researchers reacted the Co_{3}S_{4} nanosheets with functional molecules such as polyethyleneimine (PEI), glutathione and thiourea. The resulting derivatives were characterised by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), among other methods, to confirm the successful preparation of functional nanosheets.

The authors tested the new approach in a variety of applications, including sensing, hydrogen evolution reactions and lithium batteries. The PEI-functionalised Co_{3}S_{4} nanosheets were used as electrode material for supercapacitors with capacitance values of 890–1200 F/g. They also tested the sensing abilities of their new nanosheets by measuring their UV-vis absorption and luminescence in aqueous media to detect different metal ions, such as Ag^{+}, Hg^{2+} and Cu^{2+}. In addition, Co_{3}S_{4} nanosheets have also been investigated as catalysts for hydrogen evolution reactions.

The researchers found that the surface chemistry of these materials can be easily controlled by simple chemical modifications of their edges. They believe that this methodology has potential applications in many different fields of science and technology, such as heterogeneous catalysis, drug delivery or biomedical engineering.
