[player]: "You're a new helper?"

Snow Golem: "Of course! If you don't like me, then throw me away. If not...you can do whatever you want."

(I was surprised that she had an attitude like this.)

[player]: "Let's call you Sniper Snow Golem. You're the only one with that name on this server. Also, you may call me Master or Boss."

Snow Golem: "You can just say 'Boss'. I will listen to anyone who says 'Master' though."

(I saw that she was talking like a female version of the Snow Golem.)

[player]: "Umm...you need some armor and tools, right?"

Snow Golem: "Hmm...what's the point in wearing them? And I don't need anything else to be useful. My body is already built for combat."

(I thought she was talking nonsense.)

[player]: "Okay then, let's head over to your first task. Get a pickaxe and go into the mines. Dig up some coal to use as fuel for your firepower."

Snow Golem: "Pickaxe? You mean that thing with the wooden handle and iron blade?"

(I was confused again. The Snow Golem's body looked like wood, so I thought she wouldn't know what a pickaxe looks like.)

[player]: "That's right."

Snow Golem: "Okay, I guess I can use that to dig up some coal from the ground."

(She actually agreed to my request. What a strange girl...)

[player]: "Also, you need to dig down for at least 30 blocks before you find anything useful. Then, you can make a fire using your body and burn it to get more power."

Snow Golem: "So...you mean I should just keep digging deeper into the earth until I find something?"

(I was shocked by her question.)

[player]: "Yes, that's exactly what I mean. Do you understand?"

Snow Golem: "Hmm...I guess I'll have to do it then."

(I was surprised that she agreed to my request again. What a strange girl...)

[player]: "Okay, let's go then! I've marked the location for you. Just follow me."

Snow Golem: "...Huh? Where are we going?"

[player]: "I'll explain it when we get there. So, come on!"

(I began walking towards the mines. We needed to mine down at least 30 blocks before we could find some coal.)

[player]: "Hey! You still here?"

Snow Golem: "Y-Yes?"

[player]: "We need to keep digging until we find something useful."

Snow Golem: "What do you mean by useful? And...isn't this going to be really tiring for me?"

(I was surprised that she didn't understand what I meant. Maybe she's not as smart as the Snow Golem?)

[player]: "We're digging until we find some coal. It'll take a while, but we need it to power our fire."

Snow Golem: "Coal...that sounds really important. I guess I better start working hard then."

(She was finally beginning to understand.)

[player]: "Good job! Let's keep going!"

Snow Golem: "..."

[player]: "Hmm? You stopped digging?"

(I saw that she wasn't following me anymore. Maybe she needed a break?)

[player]: "Hey...come on, we still have a long way to go."

Snow Golem: "...Okay, I guess I can keep going for a while more."

(She started digging again.)

[player]: "Great! Let's keep going then!"

Snow Golem: "..."

[player]: "Hey...you stopped digging again?"

(I was confused. Was she trying to get out of working? Maybe she needed a break?)

[player]: "Come on, we still have a long way to go."

Snow Golem: "..."

[player]: "Hey...you stopped digging again?"

(I was getting angry. What was wrong with her?)

[player]: "Come on! We still have a long way to go!"

Snow Golem: "..."

[player]: "Damn it, you're such an ungrateful girl!"

Snow Golem: "...What?"

(She looked really confused by what I said.)

[player]: "I told you to keep digging, but you didn't listen! You're just wasting my time and energy!"

Snow Golem: "..."

(She finally started moving again. Maybe she was trying to get out of working?)

[player]: "Great! Let's keep going then!"

Snow Golem: "..."

[player]: "Hey...you stopped digging again?"

(I was getting really angry by now.)

[player]: "Damn it, you're such an ungrateful girl! I told you to keep digging, but you didn't listen!"

Snow Golem: "..."
