## In Altered Carban, what is the technology that enables resurrection?

The main technology in the book is a form of backup and transfer of consciousness. Consciousness is stored on the cortical stack that's located at the base of the spine. Cortical stacks are used to back up a person's mind so it can be transplanted into a new sleeve (body) when a person dies.

#### In Altered Carbon, what is the technology that enables resurrection?

The main technology in the book is a form of backup and transfer of consciousness. Consciousness is stored on the cortical stack that's located at the base of the spine. Cortical stacks are used to back up a person's mind so it can be transplanted into a new sleeve (body) when a person dies. The book takes place in the year 2384, and for this reason, most people have been transferred into new sleeves at some point. This is known as resleeving.

The technology that enables resleeving works by transferring the mind from one cortical stack to another via a port on the back of the neck. The port is connected to the stack through an umbilical cord-like cable and connects directly to the nervous system via the spinal column.

In Altered Carbon, people can also be resurrected from backup stacks that have been stored for many years. This process is called "resleeving." In order to do this, they need a copy of their cortical stack which has been stored in cryonic preservation and then transferred into a new body (or "sleeve").

In Altered Carbon, the main technology that enables resurrection is called "resleeving". Resleeving involves taking the consciousness from one body and transplanting it to another. The process of resleeving can be done by simply swapping out your cortical stack with a new one or by copying your mind onto an external storage device.

The main technology in Altered Carbon that enables resurrection is called "resleeving." It's a process where the consciousness of a person is transferred from one body to another. The only way this can happen is if you have two bodies, or sleeves as they are called in the show, and one sleeve has died while the other is alive.

#### How does the technology work?

The main technology that enables resurrection in Altered Carbon is called a "stack". A stack is a small cylindrical device that contains all of your memories, thoughts, emotions and personality. It's essentially like your brain on a USB stick. The stacks are implanted into the spinal column at birth, so when you die (or have your head chopped off) all you need to do is get a new body with a stack in it and boom! You're back online.

The technology works by transferring the mind from one sleeve to another. The mind is stored in a cortical stack located at the base of the spine, and when someone dies their body is discarded and they are resleeved into another body with a new cortical stack.

The process is pretty simple: You die, your brain is scanned and uploaded to the cloud (or whatever), then you get a new body and start over from scratch. It's not quite that easy though... The technology isn't perfect yet so sometimes things go wrong and people end up with personalities they don't recognize or even like!

The main technology that enables resurrection in Altered Carbon is called a "stack". A stack is an organic computer that stores all of the memories and experiences of the person. It's implanted in their spine at birth, so when someone dies it can be extracted from their body and placed into another one.

The technology works by transferring your mind (or consciousness) from one body to another through the use of a stack. The first time this happens is called "resleeving", which means you are resleeved into another body with your old mind intact. This process can also be done multiple times, so if you get killed again after being resleeved into another body, then that body will be killed and you'll need to be resleeved into yet another one (and so on).

This is something that has been on my mind recently. I read an article about how the United States Library of Congress was planning to preserve digital documents and then thought, “Wow, that’s great!” But then it occurred to me that perhaps there might be a more advanced method that will come up in the future.

A couple decades ago, people would have scoffed at the idea of preserving things on computers since we weren’t sure how long they would last. Now, though, it seems like people are confident enough about digital data to store it and make backups of it (assuming you can get around all the copy protection and other shenanigans that come with some DRMed games). But maybe this is a transitional state that will be replaced by something more permanent in a hundred years.

What do you think? Will digital data become obsolete when a more advanced alternative comes along, or will it always be the best method for preserving information?

I was recently reading an article about the increasing rate at which we’re able to sequence DNA. Sequencing is a process of determining the precise order of bases along a strand of DNA. For instance, if you have an alphabet made up of four letters A, C, G, T (the four bases in DNA), then “ACCGTTAAAAGG” would be a single sequence that consists of 15 letters.
The article states that scientists are currently able to determine the order of around a billion letters every second! Theoretically, sequencing technology will only get faster and more accurate, and it is likely that in the future we’ll be able to sequence entire genomes at a rate approaching a trillion per second! What might this hypothetical technology look like?
When you have a large volume of data, it becomes increasingly difficult to work with it by hand. Thus, people will likely have to employ machine learning techniques in order to make sense of the genomic data they collect. I think that the machine learning application that is most promising in this case is sequence-to-sequence learning:
The problem statement goes like this: we have a corpus of DNA sequences (each of which corresponds to some biological organism), and we want to build a model that will, given an unseen sequence, predict what kind of biological organism it belongs to.
As we collect more data about biological organisms, and as our sequencing technology advances, this problem will become increasingly easier for computers to solve (as the “data” column of the above table gets larger). This is just one example of how machine learning can be applied to bioinformatics.

Quantum physics, artificial intelligence, virtual reality, immortality - this is the world of the near future as seen through the eyes of Hannu Rajaniemi. He creates an exciting story full of puzzles that will keep you thinking long after you've closed the book. The Quantum Thief was published in 2010 and it was followed by two more novels from the series: The Fractal Prince (2012) and The Causal Angel (2014). In the beginning of May, Hannu Rajaniemi will visit us at Beta Book Fair.

The No Clone Theorem says that it is impossible to copy an unknown quantum state. This means that two objects with identical properties cannot be created from one object.

So if we were to try and copy the state of a living being, say a brain, in order to move that consciousness into another body, or even the same body, there would be no way to transfer the information onto the new brain.

This is because the quantum states are not identical. They may be similar, but they are never exactly the same. The original brain and the copied brain will have different quantum states, which means that their properties are different.

So even if we were to try and copy a human consciousness into another human being, it would not be possible because the new brain would have a different set of quantum states.

As far as I can tell the no cloning theorem has nothing to do with what you are asking.

No-cloning refers to the idea that for quantum information we can't just copy a state, because there is something about quantum mechanics that means we will always disturb it in some way. It doesn't have anything to do with how we reconstruct a person's mind, as far as I know.

If we assume consciousness is a product of the positions of neurons in the brain, then what you are asking is essentially whether "I" am identical to my own brain. In terms of identity you need to specify exactly what it means for two objects to be the same object; otherwise any statement about whether they are identical or not is going to be meaningless.

But as far as I know, there is no known theorem that would give you an answer to your question without specifying exactly how we should understand identity.

When the Enterprise wants to teleport a crewman from one planet to another, they have a computer in each place. They scan their destination planet and find all the things that can exist there: air, water, dirt, rocks, animals, plants etc., then they transmit this information to the computer on the other ship.

The computer on the second ship has this information, plus a full set of instructions for assembling everything that was sent from the first computer into an exact copy of what is in front of the scanner (the crewman). The two computers have both sides of the same conversation, and so they can work together to make sure the exact right atoms are where they need to be.

What happens if there's something else at that location?

Well, the computer on the second ship has no way of knowing. They have their set of instructions, but it might be wrong. In a worst case scenario, there is already a crewman on the planet in that spot. The new one will be an exact copy, so they both exist, and now you have two. If they're on top of each other, there is no more room for any atoms, and everything just falls apart.

What happens if it's not another person? What if it's a rock? The computer can make the crewman out of air molecules or dirt particles, but what if one of those rocks was already in that spot? That's a lot of atoms you'd need to remove and move out of the way.

What happens if it's not something physical at all? What if there is no life on this planet? The computer has no idea that someone could have been there, or would be there after the teleportation. It doesn't know what to do with air molecules already floating around, so it would just turn them into a crewman.

This isn't too bad. It would take some time to remove all those molecules and replace them with more of the right ones. However, the computer can't check for this problem before teleportation either! They don't know if there are already things in front of the scanner that might be affected by their actions.

It doesn't matter whether you want to create or remove something: either way, the computer can make a mistake because they don't have all the information they need to do it right.

There is no way for the computer on one ship to know if there are any other objects in front of their scanner, so they cannot tell if teleportation will create or remove those objects from existence. This means that even though we only want to make copies, it's possible for us to accidentally erase things out of our universe!

How do you think the computer on your ship would know which way around to turn everything? It can't see what's going on behind it, so it has no idea where anything is. In a worst case scenario, there could be another crewman at this exact spot! How would they know? They don't even know if there are any objects in front of their scanner...

This is why the Star Trek Teleporter Problem can never work in our universe. It would have to be a perfect replica with all of its atoms exactly where they should be, and it's impossible for one computer to know that without talking to another computer! We need two computers at either end to make sure everything works out correctly.

This is why we don't have teleportation yet: if someone made the wrong decision somewhere along their way through space or time (like when you accidentally set your alarm clock for tomorrow instead of today) then it could cause all kinds of problems for everyone else trying to do this too! It wouldn't take much for someone who isn't paying attention to end up erasing some important person out of our universe.

How would you feel if you were just sitting at home one day and your best friend appeared in the middle of your living room? Wouldn't that be awesome?! But what if they were an exact copy? What about their family, friends etc? They would all have been erased from existence! It wouldn't matter whether this was a good or bad thing because there is no way to know before it happens.

> According to the No-Cloning theorem, is the entity that is beamed down the same as the one that was in the teleporter booth? Is it the same consciousness?

This is a very good question and I have wondered about this for years. The reason we don't think of the possibility of the entity being changed is because quantum mechanics deals with quantum objects, like atoms etc. which are very small.
The only way that teleportation can work in real life would be if the subject were small enough to go through a worm hole and then come out another place in the universe. This does not happen when we see people or things "disappear" on TV or in movies. In those cases, it is just an illusion where a person or thing enters a room with one door and emerges from another room that looks like it was magically transported there. The door is only an entrance or exit to a stage set where the illusion is created.
I know of no experiment that would be able to determine if consciousness is duplicated in the teleportation process.

I don't think so. In the case where you have to create a copy of your brain in order to survive (if you want to believe this) you would not know that you are a clone, because you do not know what it means to be a clone. You would never feel yourself as a clone.

In another words: I don't think the no-cloning theorem has anything to say about consciousness. The no-cloning theorem is about information and quantum mechanics (as its name suggests).

The original question does not have anything to do with any of these two subjects.

It means that it is not describable by classical physics. If you want to understand how consciousness works, then you can look for explanations at the microscopic level of the brain (or whatever else), which may include quantum mechanics. But there are many other possible levels of description, e.g., emergent properties of a very large number of neurons or of the whole body, etc.

So if you want to understand consciousness then it is helpful to look at what happens in the brain. But that does not imply that the conscious experience is made up only by those neurons.

We are starting a new series of articles about consciousness. To do this, we will ask members of the AiThinker community to tell us what they think consciousness is and how it is formed. This is the first article in this series: What does the scientific consensus on how consciousness is formed? We hope that you like them.

To answer this question, I will share with you an article written by Steven J. Heine of the Department of Psychology at the University of British Columbia (Vancouver). The author’s article has been published in the scientific journal Current Directions in Psychological Science and can be found here.
