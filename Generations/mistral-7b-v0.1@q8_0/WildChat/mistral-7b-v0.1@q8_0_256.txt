(In the clubroom…)

Sayori: “So what did everyone come up with? I can’t wait to hear!”

Monika: “Well, I had an idea for a poetry reading event. We could get some local poets to come and read their work aloud, and then the members of the club could share their own poems if they wanted.”

Yuri: “I think that’s a great idea, Monika! It would be a really fun way to connect with other writers in our community. Plus, it’ll give us all a chance to showcase our talent.”

Sayori: “That sounds awesome! I can’t wait to get started planning!”

Monika: “Me too! Let’s start by reaching out to some local poets and see who’s interested in participating. And in the meantime, we should also start thinking about what kinds of poems we want to share.”
