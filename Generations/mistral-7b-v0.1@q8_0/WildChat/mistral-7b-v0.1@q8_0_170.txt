The main idea of this solution is that I try to make "blinking" block. When user types something after the word (which contains "â–ˆ"), the container width will be determined and it's width will be added to "gradient expansion" span, so the text will start blinking in the end of container width with animation.

But there is no actual effect, because I don't know how to translate block from the left-initial position strictly into the right side.
