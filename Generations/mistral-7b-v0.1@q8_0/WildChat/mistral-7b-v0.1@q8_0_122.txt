The idea was that Channel 4 is the ultimate destination for everyone's favourite festive films. We had an afternoon at the Pinewood studio filming some great people dressed up as elves and Santas, dancing around to Slade. As it was only a few weeks before Christmas we were under time pressure to make sure all the trees were decorated in plenty of time for the shoot.

We created a 3d environment which would be able to hold 28 TV's in perfect alignment, with a slight offset to create an illusion of depth. All the decorations were made in 3d and rendered out as separate elements. This allowed us to use multiple lighting conditions, giving the piece a more believable depth.

The final 90 sec piece was created from just one master shot which was then broken down into three separate sections for broadcast on Channel 4.
