[QUOTE=Grim;7250493]I would like to request a small favor from a fellow Gnoll. I'm writing up a fanfic, and I'd like to get some feedback from someone who knows what they are doing. If you have the time, I would love it if you could read my work.

My biggest problem is that the story starts out really slow... but it picks up a bit in Chapter 2. I'm not sure how to get around this, though.[/QUOTE]

When the ring is on your finger
You can say that you’re married
You may feel like you’ve done something wonderful
And yet it is just the beginning.

For you are not bound to each other by rings of gold;
But by a love stronger than any thing.
This love cannot be bought, stolen or sold,
Nor can it ever be broken.

That’s why,
As the witnesses here,
We pray that God will grant you strength and health,
For as long as you live upon this earth;
And even in Heaven together to dwell,
So you may continue your journey hand-in-hand.
