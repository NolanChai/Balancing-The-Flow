Hi,
I would like to ask a question related to the use of basemap. The documentation indicates that in order to create a map object you need to provide the longitude and latitude values (http://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/basemap_demo.html), but I am getting an error when providing such values.

The error message is:
“RuntimeWarning: divide by zero encountered in true_divide
  self._lats, self._longs = (lat - self.llcrnrlat) / self.dlat, \
    (lon - self.llcrnrlon) / self.dlon”

In the error message, it is not clear what is the issue and where it comes from… Can anyone help me?

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from rasterio import open

# open the dataset:
ds = open('/Users/marc/Desktop/TROPOMI-MERIS.tif')
print(ds)

# read in a band (in this case the top of atmosphere reflectance, band 7):
data = ds.read(7).astype('float32')

# convert to cloud top height:
height = data * 0.4 - 15 + 7
print(height)

# convert to masked array with missing values as NaN
masked_height = np.ma.masked_where(data == 0, height)
print(masked_height)

plt.imshow(masked_height)

# close the dataset:
ds.close()

I have a map that has a coordinate grid and a UTM grid overlay. I would like to add a basemap that uses the UTM grid as a reference, so that it looks like a blueprint drawing of the real world. However, since my base map is in a different projection, I’m having trouble aligning them both correctly.

I’ve tried using georeference and setting the coordinate system to WGS1984 / UTM Zone 13N, but it doesn’t seem to do anything when I run the georeference command. I can see in the log file that it creates a layer for the reference projection, but there is no visible difference in the map.

Is there something else I need to set? Or some other way to achieve this effect?
