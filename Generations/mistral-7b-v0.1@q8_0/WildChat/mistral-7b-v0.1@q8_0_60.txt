The form Ἑρμανουβᾶϲ (six instances: 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 20) is a common and popular form in Egypt, being attested over 200 times.[14] It probably derives from the Egyptian form Ḥrmnwbs (with a long vowel),[15] which may be interpreted as "Ḥr [i.e. Horus], protector of the Two Lands" or, less likely, as "Ḥr [i.e. Horus], son of Osiris."[16] It is therefore quite understandable that a name based on this Egyptian form should have been popular in Roman times. It was common enough to be used as a proper name by a person from Naucratis in the Arsinoite nome (l.38). It may, however, have also been popular because of its semantic content: Ḥrmnwbs ("son of Osiris") is related to Ḥr-mw ("the son of Horus," i.e. Harpocrates), which was a common name in the Roman period.[17]
