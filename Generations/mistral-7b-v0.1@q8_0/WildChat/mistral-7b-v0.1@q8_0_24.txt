James, who has missed 17 games this season due to ankle injuries, played through the first three quarters on Tuesday before he was removed from the game. The Celtics went on to lose by one point, dropping to 35-28 with four games remaining in their regular season schedule.

"I don't think that's a coincidence," James said after the loss. "You know, it was just tough, but we fought hard all night long and made some shots at times where we needed them."

The Celtics now have a 19-13 record without James in the lineup this season. They are 27-8 when he's played at least 30 minutes, with the only exceptions being an overtime loss to Philadelphia and a loss to Denver on Jan. 5 that was due to foul trouble late in the game for both teams.

In those 17 games without James, Boston has won 24 percent of its games by double digits. It's an ugly number by any measure -- worse than any team except Cleveland -- but it still represents improvement over last year's 3-19 record in similar situations.

The Celtics will host the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday night with a chance to clinch their playoff spot for the first time since 2017. James is listed as doubtful for that game with an ankle injury and coach Brad Stevens said after Tuesday's loss that he wasn't sure how much time his star would need before he could return.

The Celtics are currently fourth in the Eastern Conference, a full two games ahead of fifth-place Chicago.

## What You’ll Need

- 1 sheet of white craft foam
- scissors
- black paint
- brush
- masking tape
- 1 piece of cardboard or foam core
- hot glue gun and hot glue

## How To Make It

1. Trace a 3″ x 4″ rectangle on the sheet of craft foam. Cut out.
2. Use your scissors to cut along one side of the rectangle, to make the top portion slightly larger than the bottom. This will allow the foam piece to be easily rolled into a tube shape and attached together with masking tape.
3. Paint the outside of the tube black with the brush. Let it dry completely.
4. Cut a 6″ x 6″ piece of cardboard or foam core. Tape the end of the bronze bust tube to one corner of the foam core square. Roll up the tube and secure in place with tape on all sides. The top should be rolled so that the smaller side is at the top and the larger side is on the bottom. This will allow you to fit a label over it.
5. Using a piece of cardboard or foam core, trace around it to create a template for your label. Cut out a piece about 4″ x 6″. Paint this black too, and let dry completely.
6. Apply hot glue to the center of the top of the tube and carefully place the black label on top, centered over the tube opening. The end of the tube will be underneath the label. Let it cool and dry.
7. To use the bust in your Bronycon registration packet, use a hole puncher or paper cutter to create 4 slits along two sides of the square cardboard/foam core piece. This will allow you to insert your registration form into it and hold it securely.
8. Attach the entire label-tube-form package to the inside flap of your Bronycon registration packet with tape.
9. Now when someone comes to pick up your Bronycon badge, they can simply tear off the label-tube and leave you with a cool piece of swag.

Bronny James is going to be a force in the NBA. He has been working hard and it’s only going to get better as he continues to develop his skills. This blog post is about how Bronny will change the way we look at basketball when he gets drafted by an NBA team.

There are many people who believe that bronny james 82 point game can be a reality in the near future, but it’s hard to find evidence for this. It’s possible that if his skills develop and he becomes more disciplined with his training then this will happen sooner than later.

What do you think? Is Bronny James going to change how we look at basketball when he gets drafted by an NBA team? Let us know!

The post bronny james 82 point game appeared first on Daily Times.

> Bronny James, who is 17, scored 20 points to lead the North Coast Blue Chips on their way to winning the championship game of the Adidas Gauntlet Las Vegas Spring Break Showcase.
>
> LeBron and Savannah were in attendance and congratulated their son after his big performance.
>
> Bronny is a 6-foot-3 guard who has received interest from major programs including Kentucky, Duke, Kansas and Michigan State. He also has offers from Maryland and Ohio State.

If he averages at least 20 per game in college, it's basically guaranteed that he will be a lottery pick.

As of now I am not sold on his ability to contribute to a winning NBA team. That could change if the rest of his game comes along but right now it looks like he may have some Kwame Brown in him.

LBJ is a very talented athlete and a great player, but he's not the best all-around player of all time. He doesn't have the greatest defensive instincts or the most efficient offensive game. He relies on his athleticism more than any other player in NBA history. I'm not saying that's bad, just different from how many players have played before him.

He has been lucky enough to play with two great teammates (Kobe and Shaq), but he is still the one who gets all of the credit for his teams' success. That's why there are so many people who don't like him. They think that he should be given less praise than others because he hasn't won a championship without someone else helping out along the way.

The fact remains, however, that LBJ is one of the best players ever to play in this league and deserves all of our respect regardless of whether or not we agree with his methods or philosophy on life or whatever else might come up during this discussion!

## 10 Reasons Why You Should Write About Bronny James

I’m a big fan of LeBron James. I’ve watched him play since he was in high school, and I’ve followed his career closely ever since then. I think it’s interesting that people seem to forget how good he was during his first three years in Cleveland, when he made two trips to the NBA Finals. And now, as an older player on a team with younger stars like Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, he’s still one of the best players in basketball (if not THE best).

He has won four MVP awards, been named First Team All-NBA eight times, Second Team All-NBA three times, and Third Team All-NBA once. He also holds the record for most points scored by any player during a single playoff game (61) and averaged 28.9 points per game over his career – which was good enough for second place all time behind Wilt Chamberlain’s 30.0 points per game average during his career!

The Bronny James Free Agency is the biggest thing to happen in sports since LeBron James. With his father, LeBron, still playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers, there are many people speculating on what will happen once Bronny graduates high school and enters the NBA draft. Some people think that he’ll join the Lakers like his dad did; others think he may stay in Ohio to play for the Cavs like his dad did before him. In this article we’ll take a look at some of those possibilities as well as what Bronny has said about where he wants to go.

The NBA Draft is only two years away, and with it comes the opportunity to finally see Bronny James in action. The son of LeBron James, who was drafted first overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003 and went on to become a four-time MVP, Bronny has already started drawing comparisons to his father as an elite basketball player.

He’s also been compared to Steph Curry due to their similar styles of play—both are small guards who can shoot from anywhere on the court while being able to drive past defenders at will. However, unlike Curry or any other NBA superstar before him, Bronny doesn’t have a team yet; he still needs one more year of high school ball under his belt before declaring himself eligible for draft day.

## How much does it cost to buy LeBron James?

The price of buying LeBron James is not a matter of how much it will cost you, but rather how much it can cost you and your team. If you’re looking at the top NBA players in 2017-2018 season, then there are three main factors that determine this: age (how old they are), experience level (what kind of player they have been) and salary cap space (which team has more). The older a player is, the more expensive he becomes because teams want him to be productive for longer periods of time. Experienced players tend to cost less because their skills aren’t quite as valuable as those who haven’t played before or who have had little success in previous seasons; but if you don’t mind paying up front then this could work well for your budget!

Finally, salaries play an important role when deciding how much it will cost to buy someone like LeBron James: although he may earn millions every year through endorsements alone—which means his total salary isn’t as high—there are still many other factors involved such as taxes on those earnings or potential fines imposed by teams due

## What do you get when you buy a player?

When you buy a player, you get the rights to use that player in your league. You can play him and he will be a part of your team’s roster. The player is not guaranteed to be on the team at all times, however. If you want him on your squad for every game or even just one game each week, then there are ways that this can happen without having to pay extra money up front (or during) their season contract with another club which may include signing bonuses etc., but it’s not always possible as some teams only allow certain types of contracts such as free agents or players who have been traded from other clubs before they sign any new ones themselves!

## What are the different ways to buy a player?

There are three main ways to buy a player:

- You can trade for him. If you have enough cap space, you can offer another team your best player in exchange for their top pick (or one of their other players). This is called “trading up” or “trading down,” depending on which team is giving away its asset and which team is acquiring it.
- You can draft him with the first overall selection in any given year’s draft class—assuming that he’s available when your turn comes around! If there isn’t enough talent available at his position at this point during free agency negotiations between teams (or if all other options have been exhausted), then there may be some reason why he hasn’t signed yet: maybe he wants more money than anyone else would offer him; perhaps he has no interest in playing anywhere except where he currently resides; possibly even both! Whatever his motivation might be now that we know about it shouldn’t matter anymore because we’ve got another chance at getting something done before our next season begins…

## What is the free agency process?

The NBA free agency process is a period of time in which teams are allowed to sign players from other teams. This process can be divided into two phases: restricted and unrestricted. In the first phase, called restricted, teams may only offer their own player contracts if he agrees to stay with them for another year or more. If they don’t agree then they must wait until after July 1st before making an offer (this date has been set as an arbitrary deadline by commissioner Adam Silver). The second phase, unrestricted free agency begins when all other players have been signed and are no longer available through any means other than trade or waivers. This period lasts until October 31st each year at which point it becomes restricted again so that new contracts cannot be offered until after November 15th (this date has also been set by Adam Silver).

## What happens if a player is signed and traded?

If you’re looking for a quick answer, here it is: The player can still play for the team he was traded to. However, there are some rules that apply when he’s being traded. If he gets hurt or doesn’t want to play anymore during this period then his contract will be voided and he won’t get paid anything at all. But if he does everything right (and stays healthy) then he can stay with his new team forever!

## What is the difference between free agency and buyout?

Free agent is a player who has not been signed to any contract by any team and therefore is not under contract with any other organization. Buyout, on the other hand, refers to an arrangement in which a player leaves one team for another because he wants more money or better conditions at his new club (or both).

In general terms: Free agents are free to sign wherever they want; buyouts require permission from both parties involved before moving forward.

## Who can be traded?

If you’re a player, the answer is easy: Anyone who is under contract with your team. If you’re a GM or owner and want to trade someone on your roster, it’s not as simple as just putting in an offer for him and hoping he accepts—you have to be sure that there are no restrictions on trading him first. This means checking all of the following:

- He has played at least three years with his current team (or two if he was drafted after 2003). In other words: If this guy hasn’t been traded yet but has spent enough time with one organization before moving on somewhere else then chances are good that he will get picked up by another franchise soon anyway!
- His contract isn’t expiring soon enough so as not to cause any problems later down line when people start talking about how much money could have been made from trading him sooner rather than later…
