I walked into the clubroom, ready to start a new day in the club - even though I looked like I was about to pop. I can see Yuri and Monika - but they both had sad expressions on their faces. But Sayori seemed…angry for some reason.

"Natsuki...you're not going to believe this. I-I-It's about MC."

My heart raced at the mention of MC's name. Even though I was Sayori's surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl that looked just like Sayori, except with a blue bow instead of a red one. The strange girl was also visibly pregnant - and judging from the similar hair and eye color, the strange girl was Sayori's twin sister.

Sayori: "Can you believe this? He's been seeing my own sister behind my back! And she's pregnant with his child!"

Monika: "Oh no, this is not good. We have to talk to MC about this, and figure out what's going on."

Yuri: "Yes, we can't just jump to conclusions. We have to get the full story first before we make any judgments."

I couldn't believe what I was hearing, and I could only imagine how Sayori was feeling. But I knew we couldn't just ignore this and pretend everything was okay. We had to confront MC and figure out what was going on.

Natsuki: "I agree, we need to talk to him, but let's not be too harsh. We don't know what's going on in his life, and he might be going through a tough time."

Sayori: "But he shouldn't have betrayed me like this. And with my own sister…"

Monika: "I understand how you feel, Sayori, but let's try to handle this maturely. We don't want to lose MC as a friend, but we also need to support you through this difficult situation."

I could see the worry and concern on Monika's face. She was always the voice of reason in our club, and I knew she would help us through this situation.

Yuri: "I agree. We should approach him peacefully and calmly, and let him know how we're feeling. Maybe he has a good reason for what he's been doing."

I could see that Yuri was trying to be the peacemaker in this situation. But I could also tell she was worried about the outcome of our conversation with MC.

Sayori: "Okay, let's talk to him. But I'm still really mad."

We all looked at each other nervously, unsure of who should speak first.

Monika: "MC, we need to talk to you about something."

MC's expression changed to a look of concern as he saw the seriousness on our faces.

MC: "What's going on? Is everything okay?"

Natsuki: "We… found out about you and Sayori's sister. And the baby…"

MC's face turned red as he looked down at the ground.

Sayori: "How could you do this to me? You know how much I care about you!"

MC: "I know, Sayori. And I care about you too. I never meant to hurt you, and I never meant for this to happen."

Yuri: "Can you explain what's been going on? We want to understand, and we're here to support you."

MC took a deep breath before he began to speak.

MC: "Thing is…she's actually just my friend. And the baby she's carrying actually belongs to my twin brother."

The shock on our faces was evident as we all tried to process this new information.

Natsuki: "Your…twin brother?"

MC: "Yeah. I never told anyone about him because he's been going through a tough time and doesn't like socializing. He got into a relationship with Sayori's sister, and things got…complicated."

Monika: "So, this whole time, you've just been helping your brother out?"

MC: "Yes. He didn't want to tell anyone, and I didn't want to betray his trust. But I understand how it looked from the outside, and I'm sorry for not telling you guys earlier."

Sayori: "So, you and my sister…you're not in a relationship?"

MC: "No, we're not. We're just friends."

As the reality of the situation set in, I could see the relief on everyone's faces, especially Sayori's.

Sayori: "I…I'm sorry for jumping to conclusions, MC. I should've talked to you first."

MC: "It's okay, Sayori. I understand why you were upset."

Yuri: "Well, I'm just glad that everything was cleared up. And we can still continue as a club without any drama."

Monika: "Yes, and we've all learned a valuable lesson about not jumping to conclusions and communicating with each other."

Natsuki: "Yeah, and I'm just glad that MC's not a cheater."

We all laughed a bit, relieved that the tension had dissipated. And as we walked back towards the clubroom, I knew that we had experienced another obstacle that we had overcome together as a club. Just then, Sayori's phone started ringing.

Sayori: "Oh, it's my sister. I should answer it."

She answered the phone, and we could hear her sister's voice on the other end.
