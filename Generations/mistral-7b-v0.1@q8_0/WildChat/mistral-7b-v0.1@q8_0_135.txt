1. Don't use swear words, because it will make you look cooler than normal people.

8. Don't like normal things such as ice cream, or chocolate. Instead like things that are unnormal. Such as bugs. If there's a bug in your house, eat it. If the bug doesn't die, then make a pet out of it. You can even name it.

9. Don't get bullied by mean people. Beat them up if they do. That will get you attention from other students.

1. When you go to school, don't forget your lunch. This will save you from the embarrassment of having to buy lunch at the cafeteria or being forced to eat the rotting fish that is served for lunch.
2. Bring a book about the subject you are studying. This way if you are called on in class, you can seem smart by being able to answer all the questions.
3. If your teacher assigns a project or presentation that has nothing to do with the curriculum of the school and only the subject it is based off of, then don't do the project. Just sit in the back of the classroom and watch tv on your phone for the rest of the semester. This will get you out of trouble when your parents see how good of a student you are.
4. If your teacher doesn't let you play games or watch tv in class, then throw the laptop off the roof or at least threaten to do so. If that doesn't work, then tell your parents and they will take care of it for you.
5. If you still can't get out of school after doing all this, then just run away from school during lunch. You can even run away in the middle of a class if you want. Your parents will probably never come to pick you up because you would be too busy watching tv or playing video games.
