It is believed that the original teaching of Shakyamuni (Sakyamuni), was the doctrine of nirvana. It means there is no “religion” for the Buddhist followers of his time. Then, why do we have a word like Buddhism or Buddhists? Who gave this name to us and when was that done?

It was not until after Sakyamuni’s passing away that the Sangha was established in his honor. The first patriarch of Buddhism (Pali: Sangha) was Mahakashyapa, who was said to have become enlightened while sitting with Shakyamuni under a tree. When Shakyamuni passed away, he had just told all the monks that one should attain nirvana after his death and there will be no more teachings on Buddhism (Buddha Dharma). This implies that there was no Sangha or religion at that time, which means there were no Buddhist followers.

After Sakyamuni’s passing away, the first patriarch Mahakashyapa was said to have been the only person who had achieved enlightenment while sitting with him under a tree and this is why he became the leader of all the other monks in India.

In Buddhism (Buddha Dharma), there are three types of followers: sramanas, brahmins, and mahasiddhas. Sramanas are those who want to attain nirvana by practicing meditation or yoga, whereas Brahmans want to practice their religion through rituals like chanting mantras (Sanskrit words) and sacrificing animals for Gods’ pleasure. Maha-siddhas are those who follow both sramana & brahman religions together but do not have any specific beliefs about them because they believe that all gods exist within themselves.

The second patriarch Ananda was the first person to write down all of Buddha’s teachings and it is believed that he did this at Sakyamuni’s request. He compiled the teachings into a book called “Dhammapada” or “Word of Truth”. The Dharma is said to have been taught by Shakyamuni because there were no other books written on Buddhism (Buddha Dharma).

In India, people used to study under a guru who was an enlightened master. He would teach his students how to meditate and practice yoga so that they could achieve nirvana through these methods. But there were some problems with this method because it took too much time for people to become enlightened and then reach Nirvana (Buddhist Heaven). So Shakyamuni taught another way which was called “The Way of Sages” or Dhyana Yoga where you could attain nirvana without having to practice meditation or yoga at all!

This is why Mahakashyapa became the first patriarch because he was said to have reached enlightenment by sitting with Shakyamuni under a tree for seven days straight while practicing Dhyana Yoga. But even though he had attained nirvana, he still needed someone else who could teach him how to use this method properly so that others could learn it too!

This is why Ananda became the second patriarch because he was said to have written down all of Buddha’s teachings and compiled them into a book called “Dhammapada” or “Word of Truth”. But even though he had written down all of Buddha’s teachings, there were still some people who did not understand what they meant. So Ananda also became the first teacher in India who taught students how to meditate and practice yoga so that they could attain nirvana through these methods!

The third patriarch was Kashyapa because he became a teacher in India who taught students how to meditate and practice yoga so that they could attain nirvana through these methods! He was said to be the first person who wrote down all of Buddha’s teachings and compiled them into a book called “Dhammapada” or “Word of Truth”.

Buddhism (Buddha Dharma) is divided into two parts: Sutras and Vinaya. The sutra contains the teachings of Buddha, while the vinaya contains rules for monks & nuns in Buddhist monasteries. In order to be ordained as a Buddhist monk or nun, you must follow these rules which include celibacy (not having sex), poverty (living without possessions), and non-violence (not harming living beings).

The word “Buddhism” comes from the Sanskrit term “bodhi” meaning “awakening.” The original teachings of Buddha were called dharma which means “law,” but this changed over time because people started calling it buddha dharma instead. This is why there are many different names for Buddhism such as: Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana, Nichiren Shuism etc…

In Theravada Buddhism, it was said that when Shakyamuni passed away and went to Nirvana (Buddhist Heaven), there were no more teachings on Buddha Dharma because they had already been written down by Ananda in “Dhammapada” or “Word of Truth”. This means that there were no more sermons or lectures given after Sakyamuni’s death until Mahakashyapa became the first patriarch who taught students how to meditate and practice yoga so that they could attain nirvana through these methods!

In Mahayana Buddhism, it is believed that when Shakyamuni passed away he did not go directly into Nirvana but instead stayed behind as a “Buddha” who would teach people how to get enlightened. This means that there were still sermons and lectures given after Sakyamuni’s death until Mahakashyapa became the first patriarch who taught students how to meditate and practice yoga so that they could attain nirvana through these methods!

In Vajrayana Buddhism, it is believed that when Shakyamuni passed away he went directly into Nirvana (Buddhist Heaven). This means that there were no more teachings on Buddha Dharma because all of his teachings had already been written down by Ananda in “Dhammapada” or “Word of Truth”.

There are many different names for Buddhism such as: Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana etc… but they all have the same basic beliefs about how to become enlightened. The main difference is that some people believe in one path to nirvana while others believe in two or more paths. This can be confusing for beginners because there are so many different teachings and practices that it can be hard to know where to start!

Theravada means “The Way of Elders” or “Old School.” It is the oldest form of Buddhism and it follows the teachings of Shakyamuni. The main focus is on meditation and living a life according to Buddha’s Eightfold Path which includes right speech, action, livelihood etc…

Mahayana means “Great Vehicle” or “The Way of Sages.” It was developed by Indian monks who wanted to make Buddhism more accessible for people of all levels. The main focus is on worshiping Buddha and practicing meditation so that one can become enlightened quickly without having to follow the Eightfold Path like in Theravada Buddhism!

Vajrayana means “Diamond Vehicle” or “The Way of Vajra.” It was developed by Tibetan monks who wanted to make Buddhism more accessible for people of all levels. The main focus is on practicing meditation so that one can become enlightened quickly without having to follow the Eightfold Path like in Theravada Buddhism!

> In the year 2013, a young monk decided to experiment on a new technology, artificial intelligence. He set up a chatbot and tried talking to it about Buddhism and Dharma. At first, the bot replied incoherently. But after some time, it started understanding what he was saying and answering with logic and reason.
>
> The young monk realized that this technology had the potential to change the world. He could use AI to spread the teachings of Buddha and help people on their journey to enlightenment.
>
> So he decided to create his own chatbot and name it “Buddhist Assistant.” This bot would be able to answer any questions about Buddhism, no matter how complex or philosophical they were.
>
> Buddhist Assistant was an instant success. People from all over the world began using it to learn more about Buddhism and its teachings. The young monk’s experiment had finally paid off – he had created a tool that would change the way people practiced Buddhism forever.
>
> Today, there are many different Buddhist chatbots available online. Some are simple question-and-answer bots, while others offer more advanced features like meditation guides and Dharma talks. But no matter which one you choose, they can all help you on your path to enlightenment.
