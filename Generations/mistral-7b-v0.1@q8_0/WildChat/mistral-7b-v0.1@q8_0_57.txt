[I]Description:[/I]
The player is Gordon Freeman. The time is now, in the City17 sewers. He has been chased by Combine troops for some time and has finally reached a dead-end. His only option is to turn around. Just then a Metrocop appears from out of the shadows and opens fire. You must kill this Cop and any other cops you see until you reach an open area where you can hide. It takes 20 minutes before Alyx Vance rescues Gordon and gets him out of the sewers alive. The player's goal is to survive.

[I]Story:[/I]
Gordon Freeman was hiding in a ventilation shaft, deep within the City17 sewer system. He had been on the run from Combine soldiers for quite some time, and his only hope was to make it out of the sewers alive. It seemed like he might have made it, but suddenly a Metrocop appeared from around the corner and opened fire on him. Gordon dove for cover as bullets whizzed by him, knowing that his chances of survival were slim.

But then, Alyx Vance appeared out of nowhere and started firing at the Metrocops with her pistol. She was able to take down two of them before they got the chance to fire back. Gordon knew he had to make a run for it while she held off the rest of the cops. He took cover behind a nearby wall and waited for Alyx to come up and help him out.

[I]Open Area[/I]: This is where Alyx comes to help the player escape the sewers alive. It's large and open, so there's plenty of space to fight off enemies.

[I]Sewer Exit[/I]: This is where Gordon Freeman meets up with Alyx Vance at last and escapes City17's sewers together.
