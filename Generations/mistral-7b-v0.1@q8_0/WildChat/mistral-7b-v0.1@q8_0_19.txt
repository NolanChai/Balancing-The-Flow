Problem 1

Calculate the volume of a sphere having radius 120 mm. Round the answer to three significant figures.

Step-by-Step Solution:

###### Step 1 of 4

We know that, the Volume of a sphere is given as: $V=\frac{4}{3}\mathrm{\pi }{r}^{3}$ where r is radius of sphere and $\mathrm{\pi }$ is ratio of circumference to diameter. Here $\mathrm{\pi }\approx 3.14$.

###### Step 2 of 4

Hence the Volume of sphere having radius 120 mm can be given as: $V=\frac{4}{3}\times 3.14\times {\left(120\right)}^{3}$

$=\frac{19683}{\left(3\times 10\right)}\phantom{\rule{0ex}{0ex}}=6561{0}^{\text{mm}}\text{3}\approx {100,000}^{\text{mm}}\text{3}$

###### Step 3 of 4

Hence the volume of sphere having radius 120 mm is given as: ${100,000}^{\text{mm}}\text{3}$. This answer has a total of four significant figures. For rounding this value to three significant figure we can follow either of the two methods.

###### Step 4 of 4

Rounding off to three significant figures: (a) By omitting all trailing zeros: ${100,0}^{\text{mm}}\text{3}$. (b) By keeping only three digits after the decimal: $99,6\phantom{\rule{0ex}{0ex}}{10}^{2} \mathrm{mm}\mathrm{.} 3$

Answer & Explanation

Step 1
The mass of the empty bag is known: 67 grams. The mass of 100 chips is also known, so if you had 100 bags of chocolate chips (a huge amount) and you weighed them all, then divided the total mass by 100 to find out how much each bag weighs, you could get an average.
But you don't have that many bags - just one!
So, you can do this instead:
Take a single chocolate chip, and use its mass to calculate how many chips are in 67 grams of chocolate chips:
31 g รท (31 g/chip) = ? chips
? = 2.096774...chips
This means that you can work out how many bags the amount of chocolate chips you have is equivalent to by dividing it by 2.096774...chips, and then rounding down to get the whole number:
(2041 g รท 31 g/chip) รท 2.096774... = 57 bags
Alternatively, you could just divide (2041 g รท 31 g/chip), but this isn't accurate because you are using an average mass.
