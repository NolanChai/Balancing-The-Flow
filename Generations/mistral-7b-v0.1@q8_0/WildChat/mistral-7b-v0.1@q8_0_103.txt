If the game is made with a more "realistic" approach in mind, as opposed to a more action-oriented one, this might be the time and place for this. We've all seen in the Half Life 2 demo that Valve has a good sense of humor, but I hope that they won't use it excessively or gratuitously.

Personally, I think it would be a waste to have her character jump on Gordon's lap only for comedic effect, unless it were done tastefully and with some dramatic emphasis. And besides, I don't think it would really be all that funny if Alyx fell onto him. Maybe if Eli had fallen into his lap instead...
