Another way that artificial intelligence can help with your website’s SEO is by optimizing images for Google image search.

Another way that artificial intelligence can help with your website’s SEO is by optimizing videos for YouTube.

AI can also improve engagement by analyzing website data for user behavior patterns.

You might have a great idea that’s perfect for your audience but if no one reads what you wrote because there was something else catching their eye before getting bored with all those words… Then artificial intelligence may help.

There are 2 ways to build the map

- Directly in Unity
- Using a standalone tool, that was made by myself for faster building

## Unity

Unity is used as an editor to make the maps and export them, it has the advantage that you can edit everything directly and see the results right away. So it's really nice for testing purposes.

But it will take a lot of time to build the map and there are some limitations like the 2D-grid system which makes it really hard to create maps that have curves in them (although this is possible). You can find the Unity Assets at github

### How to install

Just download the assets from above link, extract it and drop them into the "Assets" folder.

#### Important:

1. After you dropped the files into unity, press play, then stop it again! Then you have to make a new scene. This is necessary because Unity won't read some of the script files by default if you don't do this. If you already have created a new scene, that's not a problem but you will still have to press the "Play" button.
2. Now you can start with your map making :D

### How to build the Map

The easiest way is to just add a "BuildingGrid" component to every building and connect them all by drawing lines, or even easier create a new scene which only contains buildings that should be connected. (these are not really needed in this case) and select these buildings. You can find it under the main menu at GameObject > Map Editor

If you want to use the 2D-Grid-System, check out the "BuildingGrid" component! It's not necessary but will help with making a good map.

### How to export it

1. Press Play (or in case of the above step: Stop) and wait for it to load all the scripts. Now press play again. This is very important as Unity doesn't like when you make changes to files and then try to run the game. It won't read them properly because they were already loaded into memory.
2. Export it via the main menu at Map Editor > Export (or if you just added a BuildingGrid, export it from the component). This will save the map in a JSON file that is used for the server to load it!
