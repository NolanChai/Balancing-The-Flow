However, I could suggest other dates that may work for both of us. How about we meet on Wednesday at 9:00 AM or Thursday at 10:00 PM? If these dates and times don’t work for you, please let me know, and I’ll try to find other options.

The event would be centred around the use of social software for e-participation and e-democracy, with focus on the European Union. I am hoping that some people who have participated in our events in the past can also join us in this workshop as well.

It is really important that we have this information because the Commission will want to see who will be participating and from what institutions.

The workshop is intended to provide a forum for bringing together EU officials, EU member states officials, researchers from academic institutions, civil society representatives, and others who are working with or interested in using social software to promote and support eDemocracy and eParticipation in Europe.

I am very pleased to inform you that Walid Al-Saqaf has agreed to be part of the team and organize the event.

We hope that the workshop will last one day but depending on how many people are interested, it could be a half-day session as well. We have discussed this possibility with Walid and we think that both options make sense.

Subject: AFRICOM and NATO in the Sahel and Horn of Africa
Importance: High

Dear Neil and Walter,

I am writing to invite you to the following conference in Berlin on 26-27 June:
http://www.w4-c.de/?p=13948&lang=en

It is co-organised with a colleague of yours at Oslo, Peder Horslund, and we would appreciate it if you could join us.

Our conference will look at NATO’s activities in the Sahel, Horn and East Africa more broadly, and is particularly timely in light of the current debates on African regional security, the military aspects of ECOWAS and its role, as well as the ongoing discussion regarding the creation of a “European mission” to support counter-piracy operations.

It will be hosted by the Wissenschaftskolleg zu Berlin (Institute for Advanced Study) and funded by the German Foreign Ministry.

The programme can be found here:
http://www.w4-c.de/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Programm_Kolloquium_Wissenschaftskolleg.pdf

I am happy to discuss any aspects of the conference with you further – do not hesitate to get in touch if you have any questions! I hope that we will meet during the event.

Best regards, Walid
