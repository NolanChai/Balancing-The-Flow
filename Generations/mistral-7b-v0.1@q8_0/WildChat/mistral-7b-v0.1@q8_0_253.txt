User 1: What's the crossover here? I don't know Harry Potter well enough to understand how this relates.
User 0: [SFW] Harry and Kazuki are both sons of magicians who die when they are very young. After they're adopted, they meet the people from Magika Kenshi, a magical school where they fight monsters.
User 2: Doesn’t EVA have any connection to Harry Potter though? I know that it is similar in some ways but I can’t quite put my finger on why
User 3: They're both long series of very long books, and the protagonists of both are orphans.
