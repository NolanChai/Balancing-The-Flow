Racecar’s Virality Engine helps companies find the perfect product market fit, maximize customer retention & growth and discover new revenue streams.

This engine is based on a viral loop model of 3 main parts: Acquisition, Activation and Retention. Each of these loops is then broken down into its 4 main components: Audience, Offer, Copy and Call-To-Action (ATOCC).

Using this growth framework as the structure for your plan you should be able to create a clear path for growth over the next 3 months. In it, you must include the following:

- An explanation of your platform, who your target audience is and why you feel it has potential for significant growth.
- Your 90-day plan of attack detailing how you would approach growth with a clear timeline
    - Use the viral loop model as the structure to develop this plan but also feel free to use the other Racecar Frameworks if you think they’ll be helpful.
- A detailed explanation of how you’d measure and track your progress during those 90 days
- Lastly, please include your contact information and a link to your CV. We’re eager to get in touch with you!

Adzenys XR-ODT is a brand new drug to the market with no sales yet.

The brief was clear, “Sell at least $250K of Adzenys in three months”.

### The Challenge

Adzenys XR-ODT is a brand new drug to the market with no sales yet. It has an extremely strong patent on the molecule and has already been approved by the FDA for children and adults with ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). The brief was clear, “Sell at least $250K of Adzenys in three months”.

### The Solution

The biggest challenge when launching a new product is that you have to start from zero. We knew the first sales would come from doctors that had a need for ADHD meds and we focused our efforts on those. This meant leveraging the patient, parents and caregivers as an indirect channel.

### The Outcome

The first three months were quite successful with $268K sold and a 15% market share in just three months.
