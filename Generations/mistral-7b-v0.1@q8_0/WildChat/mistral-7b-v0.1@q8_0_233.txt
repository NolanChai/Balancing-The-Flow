Ayumi: “I don’t know why, but I feel like something bad is about to happen. It’s almost as if a storm has brewed…”

Amatsumagatsuchi: *grows uneasy*

Cupa: *sighs* “If Ayumi says that there’s a problem, then there’s definitely a problem.”

Blazette: *smacks Cupa with her fire whip* “Ow, that hurts!”

Vanessa: “I guess the dragon is the reason why the storm has happened - but what does this mean for us?”

Andr: *looking at Amatsumagatsuchi* “The last time a dragon entered our world, it destroyed everything - and I don’t think that will be any different this time…”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I feel something wrong is about to happen as well - but what exactly? And why are we all in the same place?”

Ayumi: “I don’t know, either.”

Cupa: “Maybe we can talk about this later. For now, let’s get out of here.”
