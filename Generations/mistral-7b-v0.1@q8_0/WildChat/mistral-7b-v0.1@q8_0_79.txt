## Conclusion:

I hope these suggestions will help you find the perfect city for your family.

Well, you may need to be more specific about what you mean by “warm”. I’m not sure you’ll find a place that is warm enough for your needs.

What does “have” hospitals, schools etc. mean? Does the hospital or school have to be in the city itself, or just somewhere nearby? How near? How big should the hospital be? Should it specialise in certain kinds of problems, eg paediatrics or obstetrics? What do you want from a school - pre-school, elementary, secondary?

What about climate, history, architecture, transport, crime rates etc.? Have you given any thought to how long it might take your family to adjust to being in a foreign country and culture?

I’m guessing that this is probably going to be an open ended thread…

> The problem is that there are no more real positions in our industry for people with average skills and experience, but there are many more people who want to work in our industry (mainly due to the positive perception of a web career) and so there's a huge competition for the few interesting positions that exist.

This has been an ongoing issue in my industry as well (IT/tech). I feel like I am always seeing job postings looking for someone with 2-5 years experience who "can hit the ground running" and will have to work on complex, high-traffic sites using the latest frameworks. But then they want to hire them at a salary that is not commensurate with their skills/experience (usually below what I make after many more years of experience).

There are just so few positions out there for those with 2-5 years of experience, and yet there are SO many people who want to get into the field because it seems cool. It's like a double edged sword. There's not enough positions and too many people want those positions. So the only people who seem to ever get hired are those who already have that 2-5 years of experience and can prove they are good, or at least claim they know their stuff. But then you have all these people out there trying to break into the field and so desperate for an opportunity to get a job, but when they apply for a position with only 1 year of experience (which is pretty much everyone) they get passed over because of the perception that this person can't do the job.

I feel like if you really want to find someone who's passionate about web development and eager to work hard/learn, it shouldn't be that difficult to weed out those people. I mean, if you're looking for someone with 2-5 years of experience and they only have 1 year, just ask them why or how they think they could do the job. If their answer makes sense or at least sounds promising, then maybe give them a chance. It seems like most employers want to find that person who has 2-5 years experience already because they're afraid they won't be able to train someone on the fly and that it will just be easier and more efficient to hire someone who already knows what they are doing. But I feel like if you really take a chance on someone and train them for the job, then the end result could be better than if you just hired an experienced person and gave him or her no guidance.
