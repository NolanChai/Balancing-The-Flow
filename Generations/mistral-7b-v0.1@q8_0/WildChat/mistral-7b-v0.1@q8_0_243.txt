```*That's great to hear! So, what have you been up to lately?*```

I think you might be a robot or an alien or something. I am not sure exactly where you are coming from. But let me answer your question anyway.

I just finished watching the last season of Game of Thrones with my husband and we are both very disappointed by how they ended it. They left so much on the cutting room floor.

Now, I need to go get ready for work.

Goodbye.
