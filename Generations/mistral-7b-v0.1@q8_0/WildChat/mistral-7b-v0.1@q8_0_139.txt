(I look down at the ground and let out a gasp as a pool of blood starts forming beneath me. My water just broke, but this time it was accompanied by pain. Pain like I never felt before.)

Sayori: “Natsuki? Natsuki, are you okay?”

(I nod weakly, and she helps me up. Her face is still full of tears from before, but now her eyes are full of fear as we head to the hospital - with my water breaking all over the place.)

Sayori: “Hang in there, Natsuki.”

(We get to the hospital, and Sayori helps me up onto a gurney. The doctor comes in and examines me.)

Doctor: “Oh no, it looks like you’re ready to give birth. Let’s get you into the delivery room ASAP.”

Sayori: “Can I stay with her? She doesn’t have anyone else here, and I don’t want her to be alone.”

Doctor: “Of course, Sayori. We’ll make sure she has everything she needs.”

(We get into the delivery room, and Sayori sits beside me as I try to push out our child.)

Sayori: “Natsuki, you can do it. You’re almost there.”

(I push with all my might, and after a few minutes of excruciating pain, I give birth to a beautiful baby girl.)

Sayori: “Oh my gosh, she’s so cute!”

Doctor: “Congratulations, Sayori. You’ve just become a mother.”

(Sayori holds her new daughter close and starts crying tears of joy. I can see that even though the situation was far from ideal, Sayori is overjoyed at having her own child.)
