The storyline: The Hedgehogs are at war with a group of evil robots. In the middle of a battle, Sonic, the hero, gets teleported to a new dimension and meets up with some other characters from different worlds. They all have to work together to save the universe. That is basically it.

No, its really good. Its way better then any of the main games. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Sonic, or just an adventure game in general.
