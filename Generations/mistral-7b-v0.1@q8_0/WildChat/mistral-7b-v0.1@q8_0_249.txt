Here is the issue I’m facing.

1. Selenium IDE opens Chrome web browser and performs a search, then clicks on some links to navigate to the desired page.
2. Then it looks for a link with text ‘Social Media Growth Hacker’ which has an id “menu-item-365”. But if we look at the source code of that page, this element is missing in the HTML. However, selenium still finds and clicks on this element.

I have tested this out by printing the value for the element with text ‘Social Media Growth Hacker’.

```

I am trying to scrape a website and I don't know how to click the link, which is in a normal paragraph. Can anyone help? The code works for other links in the site, but it doesn't work for this one. This is my first time using Selenium with Python and I have already tried some solutions from stack overflow and nothing worked

If we are using xpath as locator for an element, it is sometimes hard to locate a unique locator and when we try with normal or dynamic locators (css selector, id etc) it may not work because of the way the page is being rendered in browser. In such cases we can use XPATH.
In my previous project i used xpath for all my web elements because it worked well and there was no need to use other type of locator. But when i switched to a new project i had a very bad experience with xpath, but it turned out to be more because of the wait condition rather than the element itself.

## Moods & Tone

In my recent work, I’m trying to experiment with a new way of thinking and composing. I don’t want to make something that looks good but doesn’t mean anything to anyone. So my main focus is to create the mood in my work rather than just creating something pretty to look at. The mood can be an emotion or feeling, or it could be the tone, the attitude of a person or thing.

The conceptual mood is to explore the visual aesthetics and create a sense of atmosphere through graphic design. And in terms of art direction, it’s to give my work more meaning by making it feel like a real-world experience. The aesthetic mood is all about creating beautiful design that looks good, feels good, but doesn’t necessarily have any deeper meaning.

## Processes

I started by picking up some ideas from Instagram feeds of people I follow and also did some research online on how to create these moods in my work. I then created a list of different ideas and concepts that I wanted to explore further in my design process.

```
# coding=utf-8
import urllib2, re
def getData(url):
    response = urllib2.urlopen(url)
    return response.read()

def parseData(data):
    pattern = r'<h3 class="item_title">(\d+)</h3>'
    result=re.findall(pattern, data)
    print('result:', result)
    for i in result:
        return int(i)

#url = 'https://movie.douban.com/subject/26715097/'
url = 'http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4832368/'
data = getData(url)
num=parseData(data)
print('number:', num)
```

I want to get the number of the movie on the website, but I can’t do it properly with my code. It is not an error in the code, just that it cannot get the result I want.

How do you suggest getting the number of the movie using Python?
