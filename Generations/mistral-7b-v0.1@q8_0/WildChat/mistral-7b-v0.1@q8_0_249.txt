Divorced in his 70’s, my dad was looking forward to dating again. When he met Jeanne at the gym where she worked out and he lifted weights, they got on well and dated for a couple years. He was sure that they were meant for each other. Then he found out that she had a son, age 17, who lived with her, and he was a little worried about how it would all work out.

In the meantime, Jeanne’s mother was ill, and she needed to go back east to take care of her. That made her son’s situation worse. He wasn’t adjusting well without his mom around and was getting in trouble at school and with the police. His grades were terrible. Jeanne began to spend less time with my dad because he didn’t want to get involved. It’s not like he could take the kid with him on their dates!

Then Jeanne went back east, and her son stayed with his grandmother. When Jeanne returned a couple months later, they spent some time together. The next day, her mother called to say that she’d had a stroke, and Jeanne flew off to be there for her. My dad was lonely, so he started dating again. He met a woman at church who had four grown children. He felt like they could make it work because he wouldn’t have to worry about them.

The day after my parents were married, Jeanne called and said that she didn’t think the situation with her mother was going to work out and she needed to go back home to take care of things. She was gone for a couple months. Then they spoke again and decided that she would come live with them in their house. So, here comes 18-year-old boy to stay with his mom and my dad’s new wife, who was used to having the run of the house all by herself!

This wasn’t the only problem. Jeanne wanted to get married, but her son had other ideas about his father. He didn’t like him and refused to call him “Dad” or even use a first name. My dad told me that he’d never been treated this way before by any of his children.

Jeanne was frustrated with her son, and the fact that my dad felt stuck between two women who were fighting over his attention didn’t help matters. To make it worse, Jeanne’s mother had a stroke and died in 1987, when Jeanne was only 43 years old. This left my dad to deal with all three of these difficult women, and he just couldn’t do it anymore.

In the fall of that same year, I went with my parents to a family reunion where they met an elderly couple who told them about an evangelist who was holding meetings in the town nearby. The following Sunday, my dad said, “Let’s go to church.” My mother said, “That sounds like a good idea,” and off they went together! When the evangelist came over for dinner after that service, he spoke with Jeanne and found out about her desire for healing from God for her son.

A few months later, my parents attended a church retreat where an evangelist held a service to heal people of any and all illnesses. The following night at this same meeting, there was a second healing session where people who had been healed were invited on stage to testify about what God did for them when they came up to receive prayer.

Jeanne’s son was not yet healed from the wounds in his heart and mind, but my parents could tell that something had changed in her. After all these years of suffering, Jeanne now felt free! Her eyes were shining brightly with joy. She said, “I don’t know what God did for me tonight, but I feel so much better.”

A few months later, Jeanne got an opportunity to attend a Christian singles conference where she met another man who was also divorced with children. They were both Christians and had been looking for someone like each other to marry for some time. They were married a year later.

Jeanne’s son did not get healed at the evangelist meeting, but his life changed for the better. He became more respectful of my dad and began calling him by his first name. His grades went up and he got a job with one of the local businesses. Jeanne moved out of their house into an apartment nearby so that she could visit her son on weekends or whenever they wanted to spend time together.

The end result? After years of suffering from divorce, my dad was now able to marry again happily because the woman he married had been set free by God! The other two women who were still single and unhappy remained so; one of them even committed suicide at age 51. Jeanne is now living a happy life as a widow with her adult children nearby, while my dad enjoys retirement with his new wife in their own home.

#### Introduction

According to the Oxford dictionary, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is defined as ‘The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages’. AI has been used in many industries including insurance, medicine and transportation. It is also being increasingly used in international arbitration. However, there are certain disadvantages associated with the use of AI in international arbitration.

#### Advantages of AI

AI can significantly reduce the time and cost of research for legal practitioners and arbitral tribunals, enabling them to focus on more complex tasks and strategic decisions. Furthermore, AI can help identify relevant information from a large volume of data which is crucial in international arbitration where there may be multiple sources of evidence and documents.

AI-powered tools such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) can also assist with drafting, reviewing and negotiating legal documents by helping lawyers understand the language used in contracts or other agreements. Moreover, NLP algorithms can identify key concepts in large datasets which may otherwise be difficult for humans to recognise without assistance from AI-driven software tools.

The use of AI also makes it easier to detect inconsistencies between different versions or revisions of documents by analysing them against each other using machine learning algorithms, thereby helping attorneys spot potential errors before they become an issue during arbitration proceedings. Furthermore, these same algorithms can identify patterns in data sets which may have been overlooked otherwise resulting in better-informed decision making when it comes to resolving disputes through arbitration processes.

Finally, one of the major advantages associated with using AI is that it allows attorneys more time for creative problem solving as opposed to performing repetitive tasks like searching through documents or reviewing large amounts of data manually which could take hours if not days depending on its complexity level; thereby enabling them to focus on providing legal advice tailored specifically towards each client’s needs while ensuring accuracy at every step along the way – something that would otherwise not be possible without AI-driven software solutions available today!

#### Disadvantages of AI

The disadvantage associated with using artificial intelligence (AI) in international arbitration is that it can lead to a lack of human understanding and empathy. AI cannot understand context or nuance, which means it may not be able to adequately assess the situation at hand. Additionally, since AI does not have any emotional intelligence, it can struggle with complex cases where emotions are involved.

Another disadvantage is that using AI for international arbitration could result in an unethical outcome due to its lack of judgment and discretion. Because artificial intelligence lacks the capacity for empathy or critical thinking, decisions made through this technology may not always reflect fairness or justice. Furthermore, because these systems are programmed based on data sets rather than real-world experiences, there is a risk that they could perpetuate bias within society by making assumptions about certain groups or individuals based on historical trends without taking into account current circumstances.

Finally, another potential disadvantage of using AI for international arbitration is its limited ability to handle complex cases with multiple parties involved and competing interests at stake. This could lead to inaccurate results as well as increased conflict between the parties due to misunderstandings created by automated systems rather than human mediators who are better equipped at resolving conflicts through negotiation and mediation techniques tailored specifically towards each case scenario involved.

In conclusion, while there are many advantages associated with using artificial intelligence (AI) in international arbitration, there are also some drawbacks that must be considered before implementing this technology into practice within the legal field. These include a lack of human understanding and empathy; unethical outcomes due to lack of judgment or discretion; limited ability when handling complex cases involving multiple parties with competing interests at stake; and increased conflict between those involved due to misunderstandings created by automated systems rather than human mediators who understand the nuances behind each case scenario better than computers do alone. It is important for those considering implementing this technology into their practice to consider these potential disadvantages before proceeding further so that they may take appropriate steps towards mitigating them if necessary.

On November 19, the 2018 International Commercial Mediation and Arbitration Forum was held at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Liu Haijiao, the President of Hangzhou International Commercial Arbitration Court, attended this conference. At the meeting, Liu Haijiao introduced the latest progress in the application of AI in international arbitration.

In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology and artificial intelligence (AI), AI has entered the field of international arbitration and litigation, and is applied to the construction of intelligent justice systems to promote the transformation from “hardware” to “software”.

The application of AI in international arbitration

At present, AI applications have been applied to legal research, case prediction, data collection, court management system construction and other aspects. The use of artificial intelligence technology by Hangzhou International Commercial Arbitration Court can be divided into two categories: intelligent software development and intelligent arbitration service. In terms of the former, AI technology is used in document retrieval, automatic coding and categorization, automatic contract analysis, automatic evidence preparation, automatic data analysis and other aspects of dispute resolution; and in terms of the latter, it provides intelligent services such as arbitrator assignment, case matching, document retrieval and case search.

In the future, we will further promote the application of artificial intelligence technology and use this technology to better improve the quality, efficiency and credibility of international arbitration.

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent in international arbitration. AI can provide arbitral institutions and practitioners with various benefits, including faster research and analysis, better data management, and more accurate predictions of outcomes. However, the use of AI also raises questions about its ethical implications, as well as the potential for bias in decision-making processes. As such, it is important to carefully consider the risks associated with using AI in international arbitration before implementing any new technologies or algorithms.

The following are some examples of how AI might be used in international arbitration:

• Automated review of documents: AI can automate the review process for large amounts of documents during discovery stages or when conducting research into similar cases that have been decided by other arbitral tribunals. This could save time and resources while ensuring consistency across decisions made by different panels on similar issues.

• Data analysis tools: Using machine learning algorithms to analyze data sets related to arbitration proceedings could help identify patterns which may not be immediately apparent through manual review processes alone; this would assist arbitral institutions with improving their decision-making processes over time by providing them with more accurate predictions based on past experience.

• Predictive modeling: AI models could also be used to predict likely outcomes based on previous cases that have gone before an arbitral tribunal; this could provide valuable insight into how a particular dispute may proceed and help parties better prepare for hearings accordingly.

In conclusion, there are numerous potential benefits associated with using artificial intelligence in international arbitration proceedings; however, it is important to carefully consider the risks involved prior to implementation so as not to introduce bias into decision-making processes or create any unfair advantages between competing parties involved in a dispute..
