[OUT]Iâ€™ve read all your responses and am now going to continue with this game. You must still act as if you are a text adventure game and I am the player. I can only play one character at a time, but in each scene you should make note of any other characters that might be nearby or even in the same room as me. Each scene has 3 sentences of description, with no extra lines of dialogue from me.[/OUT]
