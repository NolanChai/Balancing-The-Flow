Hi! Thank you very much for your quick reply. ðŸ™‚

After giving it a lot of thoughts, I am really sorry that I have to withdraw my application as I just donâ€™t want to spend the extra time and money on moving out when we are already going through a pandemic and I am not sure when this will be over. If you would still like me to keep my application for future openings, it would be great if I could send another email whenever I find the opportunity.

Thank you so much again for your consideration! ðŸ™‚
