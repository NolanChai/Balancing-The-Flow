(Amber puts on a jacket and goes to Diluc's house, where she finds Diluc with Jean. Diluc is talking about how he saw her last night after the concert. Amber tells him that she woke up this morning and couldn't find her baby.)

"What do you mean, your baby?"

"You know what I mean," she replies in a panic. "My daughter!"

"But we didn't have a baby..." Diluc says slowly.

"No? That's funny 'cause that's exactly what I thought last night." She gives Diluc a look and he lets out a sigh. He's so tired of Amber doing this...

(He looks over at Jean, who had just finished eating breakfast.) "Jean?"

"Yes Diluc?" Jean answers. "Can I help you?"

"Did you see anything last night?"

"What?"

"When Amber came back from the concert..." Diluc explains. "Did you see her carrying a baby?"

Jean takes in this new information before shaking her head no, with an expression that said she had a lot to say but decided not to. (Diluc smiles.) "Thank you, Jean." He goes over and hugs Amber. "It's okay. You were probably just tired from last night and dreaming. I can take you to the hospital if you want?"

Amber nods. She knows there won't be a baby this morning, but she has no other choice now. "I think that's a good idea."

(At the hospital, Diluc hands Amber a blanket and she wraps it around herself. Jean takes a seat on the bench next to Diluc.)
