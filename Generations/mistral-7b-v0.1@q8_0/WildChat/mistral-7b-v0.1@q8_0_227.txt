Monika: “What happened? Are you okay?”

Yuri: (in tears) “I-It’s…it’s terrible…”

Sayori: “What is it? What happened to your tummy? Your face looks so pained.”

Natsuki: “Oh, no…is that a baby bump?”

(Yuri nods in silence.)

Monika: (worried) “But Yuri’s not pregnant! She said she couldn’t have children because of her medical condition!”

Sayori: (shocked) “Oh my god, how did this happen?! Is it safe?”

Natsuki: “We need to get you to a hospital immediately. I can drive.”

Monika: (trying to calm Yuri) “It’s going to be alright. We’ll take care of you and make sure everything is okay.”

(They help Yuri into Natsuki’s car, and Natsuki drives them to the nearest hospital.)

(In the waiting room at the hospital…)

Yuri: (in tears) “I’m so sorry…I didn’t mean for this to happen…”

Sayori: “It’s not your fault. Don’t be so hard on yourself.”

Monika: “We’ll help you get through this. We’re all in this together.”

(The three girls hold Yuri’s hands and comfort her as they wait for the doctor.)

Doctor: “I’m Doctor Smith, and I’ll be taking care of your case today. Let me take a look at you…” (examines Yuri) “It seems you are in your second trimester. The baby is doing well, but we need to monitor it closely.”

Yuri: (relieved) “Thank you. I’m so grateful for your help.”

Doctor: “Of course. We’ll do everything we can to make sure both of you are healthy and safe during this pregnancy.”

(The doctor explains the next steps to Yuri, and they all breathe a sigh of relief.)

Monika: (to Natsuki) “This is a shocking revelation, but I am happy for Yuri. She deserves happiness, and I know she’ll be an amazing mother.”

Natsuki: “Me too. I’m sure we all will be there for her every step of the way.”
