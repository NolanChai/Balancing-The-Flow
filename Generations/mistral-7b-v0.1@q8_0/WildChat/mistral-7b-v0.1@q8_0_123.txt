### Celebrating Women Entrepreneurship Day

On March 23, 2023, the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) and the We4A programme hosted an event to celebrate Women’s History Month and Women's Entrepreneurship Day.

Hi, my name is [NAME] and I am from [COUNTRY]. My profession is a [JOBTITLE], my hobbies are [HBBIES].

I have had a problem with alcoholism since many years ago. I’ve been to many rehab centers but they just didn’t work for me, and I relapsed every time. Finally, I got in touch with We4A and their unique approach worked for me and I am now sober for more than 2 years now.

I was skeptical at first because I have tried so many other rehab centres but after a few sessions with them my whole outlook on life changed. The counsellors at the centre were very understanding, compassionate and professional and I felt like they really cared about me and wanted to help me. They gave me tools and techniques that helped me cope with my addiction and taught me how to live a sober lifestyle.

The We4A team has been instrumental in my recovery journey and I would highly recommend them to anyone who is struggling with addiction. Thank you, We4A, for giving me the support and guidance I needed to finally overcome my addiction!
