[PROBLEM]When I try to use the pronouncing tool on my Macbook Air, it gives me a message that says "this program is not available for your computer." The only programs listed in the "voice" section of this site are the ones in the downloads folder. Are there any other pronunciation tools that work?[/PROBLEM]

- Use Audacity to adjust the speed, pitch, and volume of the voices. You can also add echo or distortion effects on your voice to make it sound more slurred.[/RESOLVE]
