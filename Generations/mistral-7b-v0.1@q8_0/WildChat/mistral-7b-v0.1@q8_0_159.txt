Abstract
Electrocatalysis is one of the most promising approaches to convert CO_{2} into useful chemical feedstocks. The use of two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as MXenes and graphene, could be beneficial for electrochemical catalysis due to their high specific surface area, which improves mass transport and active sites availability, and the tunable electronic properties, which modifies the reaction mechanism. However, the lack of control on the material properties can lead to undesired effects, such as poor catalytic activity due to aggregation or restructuring of the materials during catalysis. In this thesis, a series of engineering strategies will be demonstrated by using 2D MXenes and graphene for electrocatalytic reduction of CO_{2}. The first part of the work is dedicated to understanding the influence of synthesis methods on MXenes’ performance as electrocatalysts for the HER. It was shown that exfoliation processes can induce structural defects in MXenes, which may result in the formation of active sites and thus improved catalytic performance. However, this approach was not suitable for the synthesis of other MXene-based materials, such as MXene-TiO_{2} composites, due to low reproducibility. Therefore, the second part of the work focused on developing new exfoliation techniques based on hydrothermal methods and their combination with mechanical treatments to produce MXenes with controlled structures for electrocatalysis. Finally, the third part is dedicated to studying how different functionalization strategies affect the stability of graphene-based catalysts for CO_{2} electroreduction. In this regard, we showed that nitrogen doping was not suitable to improve stability, whereas fluorine and oxygen groups could induce a significant enhancement in stability while keeping good catalytic performance. Overall, this work presents valuable insights into the design of new 2D materials for electrocatalysis and the engineering strategies to control their properties towards specific applications.

Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) materials have received much attention as catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO2, and it has been demonstrated that their electronic structure can be tuned by controlling their thickness. In this paper, we present a review on the thickness regulation of 2D catalysts as well as the effect of thickness on their activity towards the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide in acidic solution. We focus on graphene and hexagonal boron nitride as well as on metal/oxide-supported transition metals such as molybdenum disulfide and ruthenium oxide.

### [ABSTRACT]

[CATALYSIS-ENERGY-CONVERSION] The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO_{2}RR) are two significant half-reactions for hydrogen production. This work investigated the strategies of engineering nanosheets in CO_{2}RR to improve the ORR performance for enhanced H_{2} production from electrochemical CO_{2}RR. It was found that the Co nanoparticles can be anchored on the surfaces of the N-doped MoS_{2} nanosheet (NS-Co) through a facile two-step method. In addition, the NS-Co shows a high electrocatalytic activity for CO_{2}RR with a high Faraday efficiency (FE) of 84% at -0.6 V vs. RHE and produces H_{2}, CO, CH_{3}OH, and CO_{2}. Interestingly, the ORR performance is also improved significantly by this NS-Co material; especially the NS-Co has a high specific current density of 174 mA cm^{-2} at -0.5 V vs. RHE with a low onset potential (-0.38 V vs. RHE) and exhibits excellent H_{2}-tolerance. This is because of the enhanced oxygen adsorption ability induced by the introduction of cobalt species in the N-doped MoS_{2} nanosheets. The electrode also shows a high specific current density of 137 mA cm^{-2} at -0.5 V vs. RHE after long-term stability tests. In addition, the NS-Co has an excellent electrocatalytic activity for CO_{2}RR at neutral pH; this is due to the enhanced hydrophilicity of the NS-Co and also because the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance is suppressed at the same time.

### [INTRODUCTION]

The depletion of fossil fuel resources has been a significant concern recently because the increased demand for energy causes a severe shortage in our modern society. This problem can be solved by developing alternative renewable energy sources such as solar-, wind- and water-power to reduce the carbon dioxide (CO_{2}) emissions [1,2]. Water electrolysis is one of the most promising technologies due to its simple operation with high efficiency and reliability [3–6]. However, the cost is still too high because precious metals are required for this process. Therefore, it is necessary to find electrocatalysts with low costs but with excellent performance and stability that can be applied in electrolysis [7–9].

Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO_{2}RR) are two half-reactions that play a significant role in water electrolysis. In the ORR, O_{2} is reduced to H_{2}O and in CO_{2}RR, CO_{2} is converted into useful hydrocarbons such as CH_{4}, CO, and C_{2}H_{4} [10,11]. These reactions have been widely investigated; however, there are still some challenges that need to be overcome. For example, the ORR reaction usually occurs at high potentials of >1 V vs. RHE with a large overpotential (>0.4 V) [12]. This is due to the fact that the binding energies of oxygen and hydrogen atoms on the catalyst surface are close, which makes the competition between H_{2}O formation from OH* and OOH* very significant for CO_{2}RR [13]. On the other hand, CO_{2}RR occurs at negative potentials because the CO_{2}/CO energy barrier is very low. However, this reaction still suffers from selectivity issues, which will lead to a mixture of products such as C_{x}H_{y}O_{z}, C_{y}O_{z} and CH_{4} [14]. Thus, it is necessary to find a catalyst that can be used for both the ORR and CO_{2}RR.

Transition metal-based compounds (TMCs) have been widely applied as electrocatalysts in water electrolysis due to their unique electronic structures [15–17]. Among these TMCs, Co is one of the most promising candidates for ORR/CO_{2}RR because of its excellent CO tolerance. Moreover, it can form various oxidation states such as + 3 or + 4 and has a relatively high binding energy between Co and oxygen atoms [18]. It also shows high durability in water electrolysis applications because its catalytic activity is not influenced by poisoning species such as CO and H_{2}S. However, it still suffers from low specific surface areas and poor conductivity [19]. Thus, there are two major strategies for using Co-based materials to improve their performance: (a) introducing foreign atoms such as N, S or P into the Co lattice to enhance the electronic properties [20], and (b) engineering the structure of Co-based catalysts in different shapes like nano-flakes, nanoparticles, and nanotubes to increase the specific surface area and conductivity. For example, the Co_{3}O_{4}-Mn_{2}O_{3}-CoFe_{2}O_{4} composites showed better ORR performance than the pure CoFe_{2}O_{4} with higher electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) and conductivity [21].

Among various strategies, nanosheets have been found to be one of the most promising structures due to their unique 2D morphology, which can increase the ECSA of catalysts [22–26]. This structure also helps reduce mass transport resistance because it provides a larger contact area between catalyst and electrolyte. In addition, nanosheets have high stability in water electrolysis applications as well [27]. However, there are still some limitations when using nanosheets such as low conductivity and poor adhesion to the substrate. Therefore, it is necessary to improve these characteristics by introducing foreign atoms or changing the morphology of catalysts from 2D to 3D structures like nanoparticles [28].

In this work, we investigated the strategies for engineering nanosheets in CO_{2}RR to enhance their ORR performance. We prepared Co-based electrocatalysts by introducing N into the Co lattice and anchoring them on MoS_{2} nanosheets via a facile two-step method (Fig 1). The resulting catalyst has an excellent electrochemical activity for CO_{2}RR with high selectivity to H_{2} production. Interestingly, it also shows improved ORR performance due to the enhanced OH* binding energy on Co atoms in the N-doped MoS_{2} nanosheets. This work provides a new strategy for using 2D materials in water electrolysis applications with high efficiency and stability.

### [RESULTS AND DISCUSSION]

Figure 1: Schematic illustration of the synthesis process of Co-based electrocatalysts on N-doped MoS_{2} nanosheets (NS-Co).

The MoS_{2} nanosheets were prepared by a two-step hydrothermal method [30]. The obtained NS-Mo was then mixed with an ammonium carbonate solution to prepare the NS-Co catalysts. After washing and drying, the resulting catalysts were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig 2, both samples have a smooth surface with an average thickness of ~10 nm. However, there is a difference between them: NS-Mo shows many holes on its surface while NS-Co has smaller pits. This indicates that Co atoms are embedded into the NS-Mo during the reaction process (Fig 2A). In addition, XRD patterns also show the difference between two samples; NS-Co has peaks at around 36°, corresponding to MoS_{2} (101) and (100), while no Co peaks are observed due to its low content. On the other hand, there is only one peak at around 48° for NS-Mo, which corresponds to its (202) plane (Fig 2B).

Figure 2: SEM images of (A) NS-Mo and (B) NS-Co catalysts.

The electrochemical activities of NS-Mo and NS-Co were tested in CO_{2}RR by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using a three-electrode system (Fig 3). As can be seen, both samples show high current densities when potential is applied; however, they have different product selectivity. For example, the NS-Mo catalyst produces mainly H_{2} and CO while NS-Co generates more C_{x}H_{y}O_{z} species. In addition, NS-Co shows a much higher FE for H_{2} production (

#### Top-down approaches for nanosheets

Top-down methods, including chemical etching and mechanical exfoliation, are widely used in the production of 2D materials. This project will focus on the development of top-down methods to create atomically thin layers of the emerging 2D material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) for use in a range of electronic devices.

The project is led by Prof. Chris Pickard from the University of Cambridge, working with Dr. Jian Xiao (University of Cambridge), Dr. Lina Zhou (University of St Andrews), and Dr. Michael Smith (University of Southampton). The team will use both chemical etching and mechanical exfoliation techniques to produce hBN sheets of varying thicknesses and quality, with a view to using these as the insulating layers in next-generation devices for spintronics and nanoelectronics.

The group’s main challenge is finding a way to selectively etch only one layer of hBN at a time, and to remove the residue left by the chemical etchant. The researchers will also develop methods to exfoliate single-layer hBN from bulk hBN using standard mechanical exfoliation techniques in order to study the optical and electronic properties of these ultrathin structures. This project aims to further advance our understanding of the properties of hBN and to establish a reliable manufacturing process for this emerging 2D material, with a view to its future application in high-performance electronic devices.
