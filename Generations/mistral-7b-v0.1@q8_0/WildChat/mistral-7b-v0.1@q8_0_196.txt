The Return of Hookocho
A/N: I'm not sure if this is a continuation of the original or an entirely new story. I can't really remember where I left off, but I'll try to make this one work. It's been about 6 years since I originally wrote it, so I don't know if I'll be able to do a good job, but I'm going to give it the ol' college try!

Hookocho had been in hiding for many years and he hadn’t seen a single face of civilization. He lived off the land with only his own wit to survive. It was now almost time for him to return, and the time has come to return to the world of mankind. His hideout was in an abandoned town just outside of Oceanside, California. There he found a rundown house and made it his home. He had many memories here. Many years ago, he had saved the life of the girl that he loved and her family. She had been lost and he had guided them back to safety. Now Hookocho is about to return.

His plan was to go to Oceanside and find that girl and tell her how much he loved her. He would take her away from the world of men and live happily with his one true love, but he knew it wouldn’t be easy. There were many obstacles in his way and many things could go wrong.

Hookocho was a man of many skills and abilities, but even he wasn’t perfect. He had a few flaws that could get him into trouble if not kept under control. One of those flaws was his anger. If he got angry at anything or anyone he would turn into the monster known as “The Hookocho” and go on a killing rampage until he ran out of targets or killed himself in a fit of rage.

The other flaw that could get him into trouble is his pride, which is something most people don’t know about because Hookocho doesn't like to admit when he fails at something and he hides it well from others. He doesn’t let anyone know how many times he has tried to do something before succeeding and he usually gives up after a few tries instead of admitting defeat.

There were also other things that could get in Hookocho's way, like the police or other vigilantes who would want to stop him from completing his mission. There was also the possibility of being discovered by the girl and her family and having them reject him for who he is. That would be a devastating blow to Hookocho’s pride as well as his love for that girl, but it was a risk that he was willing to take if it meant getting close enough to her so they could run away together.

The only thing that Hookocho had going for him was the fact that nobody knew where he was hiding and no one knew what kind of person he really was. Nobody knew anything about him other than what little bit he had told his best friend years ago before leaving town, but even then not many people believed it or took it seriously.

Hookocho also had the element of surprise on his side since nobody knew where he was hiding and no one would expect him to suddenly appear out of nowhere after being gone for so long with a mission in mind. It gave Hookocho an advantage over others that might want to stop him from completing his task.

Hookocho knew he had a lot of things working against him, but he also knew if anyone could do it then he could and would be successful no matter what obstacles he came up against along the way.

It’s no surprise that the main characters of The Grifters are going to be hooker, con artist, and mobster. We can tell just by the names of the movie’s three leads—Lilly (Anjelica Huston), Roy Dillon (John Cusack), and Mo McKee (Annette Bening)—that this is a movie about people who are constantly on the move. The story starts in L.A., where hooker Lily’s son Roy, who we first meet as a kid with a slingshot, has just been released from juvenile detention for some unspecified crime. He returns to his mother’s apartment and is quickly on the road again, traveling east to Oklahoma City. There he meets up with Mo McKee, an old family friend who’s now married and working as a bookie—and it doesn’t take long before Roy realizes that Lilly isn’t just any hooker: She’s also a grifter, one who knows the business well enough to train her son in its ways. The story then moves on from Oklahoma City to Tulsa and Dallas, where Mo takes over her late husband’s mob operation while continuing her romance with Roy (who now looks like John Cusack).

As a result, the characters are always on the move—but they aren’t always going forward. The movie begins in L.A., but it doesn’t end there; instead, it ends at Lilly’s apartment after she’s been released from prison for embezzling money from her boyfriend’s bookmaking operation.

Lily is not the only one who moves around—in fact, everyone seems to be moving: Roy travels from Oklahoma City to Tulsa; Mo goes from Dallas to Tulsa and back again; Lilly takes trips all over town while in prison (including one trip where she visits her old boyfriend). And yet none of these characters ever seem to get anywhere. They just keep moving, never really getting anywhere new or different—and that’s because they’re trapped by their own pasts: They can’t escape from who they are and what they’ve done in the past because those things define them now as well as then.

The Grifters is a movie about people who can’t get away from who they are—but it doesn’t feel like that at all when you watch it for yourself. In fact, if anything, this film feels more like an escape than most films do: It takes place entirely within its own world and never leaves its confines until its very end credits roll up on screen after 124 minutes of running time have passed by in what seems like no time at all!

## What is a grifter?

A grifter is an individual who uses their charm, wit, or charisma to con others out of money and valuables. They are often referred to as “con artists” because they use their skills in order to persuade others into giving them things that they don’t deserve. The term itself comes from the French word for thief: “griffe.”

## How does Lilly get involved with Roy?

Lily meets Roy at a bar while she is working as an exotic dancer. She decides to leave him alone after he tries to pick her up, but later realizes that there was something about this guy that made her feel safe and secure. After meeting again at another party where they have sex together (and Lilly falls in love with him), she agrees to go on a date with him because she wants to see what would happen if he actually cared for someone else instead of just using them like everyone else had done before then.

## Why does Lily fall in love with Roy?

Lily has always been attracted to men who are not interested in her or their own safety, but when she meets Roy she finds herself falling deeply in love with him and wanting more than anything for him to be happy—even if it means putting herself at risk. She feels like he understands what she needs more than anyone else does and wants nothing more than to make sure that his life isn’t ruined by all the bad choices he’s made along the way; however, he doesn’t seem particularly interested in helping her out when she gets arrested for stealing money from one of their clients at work!

## What is Mo McKee’s relationship with Roy?

Mo McKee was once married to Roy’s father and still loves him deeply even though they aren’t together anymore—which makes sense given how much time they spend around each other throughout this movie! Their connection helps them both realize that even though things may seem hopeless at times, there is always hope for new beginnings if we just keep trying hard enough!

## Who is the best character in The Grifters?

The best character in The Grifters is Lilly. She’s a hooker who uses her charms to get what she wants, but she also has some morals and doesn’t let anyone take advantage of them or push them around too much. This makes her likable even though she’s not always doing the right thing for everyone else in this movie (like when she takes money from a client who isn’t paying).

## How does Lilly become involved with Roy?

Lilly meets Roy at a bar while she is working as an exotic dancer. She decides to leave him alone after he tries to pick her up, but later realizes that there was something about this guy that made her feel safe and secure. After meeting again at another party where they have sex together (and Lilly falls in love with him), she agrees to go on a date with him because she wants to see what would happen if he actually cared for someone else instead of just using them like everyone else had done before then.

## What is the connection between Lilly and Roy?

Lilly has always been attracted to men who are not interested in her or their own safety, but when she meets Roy she finds herself falling deeply in love with him and wanting more than anything for him to be happy—even if it means putting herself at risk. She feels like he understands what she needs more than anyone else does and wants nothing more than to make sure that his life isn’t ruined by all the bad choices he has made along the way; however, he doesn’t seem particularly interested in helping her out when she gets arrested for stealing money from one of their clients at work!

## What is Mo McKee’s relationship with Roy?

Mo McKee was once married to Roy’s father and still loves him deeply even though they aren’t together anymore—which makes sense given how much time they spend around each other throughout this movie! Their connection helps them both realize that even though things may seem hopeless at times, there is always hope for new beginnings if we just keep trying hard enough!

## What are the themes of The Grifters?

The main theme in this film is loyalty. Lilly loves Roy because he was so good to her when she needed him most—and even though they haven’t seen each other since then, they still remember what happened between them back then: how close they were before things started falling apart again (or maybe even worse than ever). This makes sense considering how much time passes between now and then; however, there are also themes relating specifically toward women who have been abused by men as well as those who struggle with addiction problems like alcoholism or gambling addictions.”

## Why is the film called “The Grifters”?

The movie was originally titled “The Hookers,” but it was changed because of its title being too close to another film. It’s also worth noting that “grifting” is a term used to describe someone who takes advantage of others by manipulating them into giving away their money or property, so this name makes sense in terms of what happens throughout the film: Lilly and Roy get involved with each other because they both have problems with gambling addiction, which causes them to become addicted again after getting clean once before; meanwhile Mo McKee tries to help her son Roy get back on his feet after losing everything he owned due to an addiction issue himself!

## The Grifters is a movie about people who can’t escape from their pasts.

The grifter in this film is Lilly, a woman with no name who lives by her wits and charm alone. She has been trained by Mo McKee (Annette Bening), another con artist like herself, to be an expert at scamming people out of money or other valuables through various means such as picking pockets or stealing identities from unsuspecting victims who trust her too much because she seems so nice and friendly on the outside! When she meets Roy Dillon (John Cusack), another grifter just like herself, they form a relationship based purely on mutual distrust due to their similar backgrounds: both were raised by criminals who taught them how easy it was to take advantage of others when nobody is looking—and now those same skills are being put to use again

I’m not sure how much I can say about the story here. But as for dialogue, it goes without saying that you can expect a lot more than in Episode 1. It’s still not quite up to what we hope to do in future episodes (the writing and dialog is still just a bit rough around the edges), but it’s much better than in episode 1. There are a few scenes that are just pure dialogue, which will be fun for anyone who enjoys the writing!

In an effort to save on time and money, the U.S. military has created a new weapon, The Hive, that is a holographic projection of a swarm of killer bees, so realistic that they can cut through armor and tear flesh with their stingers. To test the system, soldiers from Fort Knox, Kentucky were dispatched to the Sahara Desert. Upon arriving at the location where the test was being conducted, the soldiers found that something had gone horribly wrong...

## This story contains examples of:

- Art Shift: The first and third parts are drawn in a more cartoonish style, while the second is in the same style as The Devil's Toy.
- Brick Joke: In Chapter 3, it's noted that "The Hive" is supposed to be used for training exercises only, not combat. In Chapter 7, however, the military decides to deploy it in a real combat situation anyway... and things go about as well as you can imagine they would.
- Crouching Moron, Hidden Badass: It's pretty obvious that "Lt. Hutch" is a moron, but she proves herself quite adept at killing bees when the going gets tough.
- Dangerously Close Shave: After getting rid of the last of the bees, Lt. Hutch and PFC Drewson are left with some nasty wounds... which is where the medics come in.
- Heroic Sacrifice: The "Sgt. Jones" who's been acting as a Beehive Barrier for much of this story is finally killed when he steps on a landmine to give Lt. Hutch and PFC Drewson the chance to get away.
- Hive Mind: The soldiers discover that the bees they're up against are a lot smarter than a normal swarm would be, communicating through pheromones and acting as a single organism instead of just individual bees.
- Killer Bee: The bees in question have been genetically enhanced to be larger and stronger than regular bees, with their stingers being able to cut through steel armor.
- Landmine Goes "Click!": In Chapter 6.
- Man-Eating Plant: The soldiers discover that the plant life in the area is actually a deadly species that feed on insects, which means that it's attracted by all those bees in the area... and the plants are a lot smarter than you'd expect them to be.
- My God, What Have I Done?: In Chapter 7, after seeing what The Hive has done to her fellow soldiers, Lt. Hutch is horrified when she realizes that she had been part of this whole disaster.
Lt. Hutch: How could I have let myself get involved in this? That... that thing is the worst thing I've ever seen.
- Oh, Crap!: After finding out what The Hive really is, PFC Drewson immediately figures out how they're going to be killed.
PFC Drewson: This is just like that movie... where that one guy gets shot and the bugs fly into his mouth! We'll never get back to base in time!!
- Oh, No... Not Again!: At one point, Lt. Hutch asks how many times The Hive has been used for testing. The answer is three times already, and she knows from personal experience that they haven't had any better luck this time than they did last time.
- Playing with Syringes: In Chapter 4, after getting wounded by a swarm of bees, PFC Drewson begins to panic over the prospect of being stung multiple times. Fortunately, Lt. Hutch is able to calm him down... by pointing out that she's about to administer a shot of morphine to his wound.
- Red Shirt Army: The entire reason for this mission was to test The Hive against an untrained group of soldiers. What happens next is predictable, and the rest of the story is mostly spent showing how screwed up their lives are going to be from now on.

The Creature: A little one with big eyes. The biggest are his peepers!

Personality: He loves to go to the beach and surf on a board! His favorite thing in the world is being nice with everyone he meets.

First Appearance: Peepers' debut was in the episode "Mi Amigo, El Gato", which means "My Friend, The Cat" in Spanish. The evil character Hookocho tries to destroy him since the episode begins, but Peepers still makes it through to the end of the episode.

Favorite Food: Honey and Bees!

Why is every single "anime bishounen" the same type of character, and they never really break out of the mold? It's like they are trying to copy each other, except they don't have enough creativity to do it right. What I mean by that is: when you get a bunch of guys who are all trying to emulate the same "look" in their art, then their own character doesn't stand out because he looks exactly like another one (except for maybe a different color).

It's sad because it's obvious that some people have talent, but they try to hide it by copying what everyone else is doing. What I mean by this is: when you get a bunch of people who are all trying to be "cool" and emulate the same look in their art, then they don't stand out because they look like everybody else (except for maybe a different color).

I think this is especially true with the whole "anime bishounen" thing. It's not that these guys are trying to be cool, but it seems like they're trying so hard at being cool that they end up being uncreative and generic in their own art style. If you look at some of the old school stuff like Trigun or Cowboy Bebop or something, you can see how those shows were very creative with their characters because each one had its own unique look that wasn't just "anime bishounen."

This is not to say that there isn't room for this style of art in anime today; I think it's fine if someone wants to draw a hot guy or girl with long hair and big eyes. But when you get an entire industry full of people doing this kind of stuff without any variation whatsoever, then I think it's time to take a step back and realize that maybe we should be doing something else instead?

Major Roles:
1. Hector: he is the main character in this episode, and the one who has been leading the way to make it happen.
2. Wally: he has been a very important part of this whole process as well, as he helped his mom through her depression when she was younger by being there for her.
3. Mrs. White: she’s always been a mother figure for Hector and Wally, so they both turn to her for guidance throughout the episode.
4. Mr. D: he is also an important character because he represents how Hector wants people to see him; as someone who can help others but also be there when they need it most (he is usually seen as being tough).
