[STUDENT]Dear tutor,

The best way to achieve success in the business world is through a proper organization and a team of highly motivated individuals. Managers have an important role when it comes to motivating the employees as they must find the most efficient approach for each individual. The management approaches I consider being the most appropriate are coaching and mentoring.

Coaching is a great technique that has the main purpose of increasing employee’s performance through a constructive feedback. Coaches can be both managers or individuals outside the organization (such as life coaches) and they are trained to improve the individual’s performance, enhance his/her skills and increase motivation. There are various types of coaching depending on the level of training and involvement in the field: sports coaching, executive coaching, life coaching etc. The most important difference between mentoring and coaching is that mentors have more authority in their field than the mentees. Mentorship can also be seen as a form of training where the experienced person helps the newcomer to better understand his/her work environment and improve his/her performance by sharing knowledge, skills and advice.

Coaching and mentoring are great management approaches that help employees grow professionally and develop their abilities. A coach must have extensive experience in the field in order to provide valuable information on how to achieve success, but he or she has no authority over the employee’s work. Coaches can help employees by showing them new ways of thinking about their work, sharing tips and tricks that will improve performance, giving them feedback on their work, etc. Managers who act as coaches must understand that coaching is not the same with criticizing the employee’s work – it must be done in a constructive way.

In my opinion, managers who use coaching techniques have more chances of getting positive results than those who prefer other management approaches such as autocratic or democratic management. Coaching helps employees discover new ways of solving problems and it is a great motivational tool that leads to better performance. As stated by Hancock & Mueller (2017), “[…] when people believe they are getting constructive feedback, they learn more from their mistakes and try harder.”
