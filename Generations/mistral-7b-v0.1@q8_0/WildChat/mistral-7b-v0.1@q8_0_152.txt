William opened the door, dressed in a gray T-shirt and blue jeans. He greeted her with a warm smile. "Hello, come in." 

Rose nodded her head, feeling at ease for some reason, and quickly entered the apartment. William followed closely behind her, asking, "Do you want something to drink? Water or soda?" Rose shook her head no, then felt slightly guilty. She should have accepted his offer, but she didn't know what to say in return. 

"Where are your parents now?" William asked Rose while they waited for the kettle to boil. "I thought we were going to eat at home," he said. 

Rose was momentarily taken aback by his question, but then quickly replied, "I have no family." She couldn't explain the truth without revealing her true identity, so she kept it simple. 

William smiled, thinking Rose was a young man, and offered to help her cook some crab tofu instead. Rose was taken aback by his sudden generosity and accepted his offer.

"My parents have gone out. I'm bored here today. Do you want to play chess with me?" William suggested.

Rose smiled shyly, "Okay." 

As they walked back to the living room, Rose noticed a huge chess board on the table. William explained that he had purchased it online for 70 yuan and that it was foldable, making it convenient to store. He asked Rose if she would like him to play with her or against her.

Rose replied in sign language, "Against me." She couldn't explain to William that she was Rose, not a man, because that would require her to reveal everything about herself. 

William sat on the sofa opposite Rose and watched as she moved her pieces with graceful fingers. He thought it odd for a young girl to have such steady hands. 

Rose had no idea what William's thoughts were. She was worried that if she revealed anything, William would become suspicious of her and ask awkward questions like Joseph. But now, Rose could only think about how to play chess with him. 

The two played Go, but because she had never seen a real board before, she couldn't move the pieces in the correct way. However, William was patient enough to teach her. He used a marker to indicate where she should place the stones and even drew out the moves for her.

Rose felt more at ease as they played, despite William's strange behavior. She had always wanted to play chess with someone else, but now that she could finally do so, she realized that she still knew nothing about the rules and couldn't move the pieces properly. 

William seemed amused by her awkward movements and told her not to worry if she made a mistake; he would correct her afterward. Rose felt relieved by his words. She wanted to play with William for a while, even though she was worried that it would be a burden for him.

William noticed Rose's unusual actions as she approached the Go board. He wondered why she was playing chess if she couldn't move the stones properly. 

Rose then said in sign language, "I can't move the stones." She pointed to herself and signed, "Deaf." Then she mimed moving the pieces on a board, indicating that she knew how to play but couldn't do it because she couldn't hear.

William was startled by her revelation. He wondered if he should help Rose learn how to move the stones or not. 

After a while, Rose realized William hadn't responded yet and signed, "You are still thinking about me." She didn't know what William thought of her, but she was curious enough to ask him. 

William had been too distracted by his thoughts to respond earlier, but now he found it difficult to express them. Rose, on the other hand, had no trouble understanding that she must have made a mistake while playing Go, which had caused William's confusion. She took out a piece and replaced it in its proper location on the board, then signed, "Okay."

William watched Rose carefully. She moved each stone with ease as if she were a professional Go player. He found it strange that such an expert would play so badly. He wondered if it was because of her deafness or some other reason. 

Rose didn't understand why William was staring at the Go board, but she assumed he was checking to see if she had made any mistakes. So, when she realized there were no stones left on the board and that all her pieces were in the correct locations, she signed to him, "Okay." 

William smiled and said, "Alright, let's go get some crab tofu." 

Rose replied, "Yes," with a smile. She didn't want to stay any longer and wanted to get out of the house as soon as possible.

When they reached William's kitchen, Rose realized she had no idea what "crab tofu" was and asked him about it. 

William said, "It's a seafood dish with crab meat and tofu." He opened the freezer and took out some frozen seafood and put them in a pot on the stove. Then he poured water into the pot and set the heat to high. He turned to Rose and said, "Go wash your hands." 

Rose didn't understand why William was telling her to do that, but she followed his instructions anyway. When she returned from the bathroom, she saw that William had finished cooking. He placed a plate of crab tofu in front of her on the table and said, "Enjoy!" 

Rose smiled and thanked him before starting to eat. She didn't know how to use chopsticks, so she used her hands instead. William noticed this and offered to teach her. Rose replied with a sign that she would try her best not to make any mistakes in the future. 

William watched as Rose ate the crab tofu with great enthusiasm. She seemed to enjoy it very much, which made him happy. 

After they had finished eating, William took out some caramel pudding from the fridge and placed a bowl in front of Rose. He told her that he had bought it specially for her and asked if she liked sweets. 

Rose smiled and said, "Thank you." She enjoyed the pudding very much and wanted to stay longer with William but knew she couldn't, so she left after a while. 

As Rose walked out of William's apartment, she felt relieved and happy that she could now play chess with others like herself. She also realized how kind William was towards her despite not knowing anything about her.
