[Insta-Baby Spawn!] (http://i.imgur.com/VQXDqH3.png)

(Note: I wanted to make this a thing on this forum for some time now, and since we've been talking about the Instant Babies from The Big Bang Theory, this is probably the best time to do so.)

Here's how it goes - someone posts an INST message (an Insta-Baby Spawn, or IBS) in the clubroom. This can be in any game that has a Clubroom.

If you don't know what the clubroom is, here are the Clubrooms:

Doki Doki Literature Club! - The Clubroom.

Undertale - Clubhouse (in Snowdin) and The Core (underneath Hotland)

Touhou Project - Main Hall

Steam World Heist - Main Lobby

The IBS can be posted in any of these clubrooms, but the author needs to make sure that they are actually a clubroom. If not, don't post an INST there. (Or if you do, it won't work.)

And what happens when someone posts an INST?

Well, another member replies to the IBS with their own message that they want to make happen in that game. This can be from any character in that game.

The author of that IBS then gets a chance to reply to it as well. They either accept it, and let them know that they will work with them on it, or deny it and say why.

If you get an INST accepted, you need to write a response message. If you want to add an image/video, feel free. But make sure that it is from the same game as the IBS!

Once that's done, you've just made an Insta-Baby Spawn!
