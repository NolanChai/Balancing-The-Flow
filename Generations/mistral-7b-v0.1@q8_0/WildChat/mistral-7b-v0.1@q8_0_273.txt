Hi,

You can create your own custom language file for any application by the following steps:

1. Make sure you have installed PHP version 4.3.0 or later

2. Copy this example file to a new language file (e.g. my_language.php)

[CODE]<?php
$lang=array(
"en-US" => array(
// Main Texts
"My Example App"=> "This is the main title of my app",
"This is an example app"=> "An example text of my app",
...
),
"de-DE" => array(
// Main Texts
"Mein Beispiel App"=> "Das ist der Haupttitel meines App",
"Dies ist ein Beispiel app"=> "Ein Beispiel text von meiner App",
...
));
?>[/CODE]

3. Place the example language file in the directory /includes/languages/ of your application and change the language names to match the language codes you use (e.g. en-US for english (usa), de-DE for german (deutschland)).

4. Use the following code snippet to load and set the new language file:
[CODE]// Include language files, and add support for your own custom language file
include_once($GLOBALS['SYS_CLASS_PATH']."/class/language.inc");
Language::load_current_lang_file();
if (isset($LANG)) {
$L = new Language(true); // If you have set the "add_support_for_custom" parameter to true, then your custom language file will be loaded and used if it exists
} else {
$L = new Language();
}
// Now use $L->get_lang("en-US") or $L->get_lang(array("en-US"), "My Example App") to set the active language
[/CODE]

MK is a customized map by Candyland, in which you start with one village and you need to build up the whole kingdom by your own. You have the choice between a lot of different maps, e.g. the big continent "New World" or "Japan".

The goal of this game is to conquer the most territories on this map. At the beginning there will be only one village. This village is located in the middle of the map (depending on your choosen map) and it will grow by itself when you build buildings inside. The bigger your villages are, the more resources they produce.

You can also start with a bigger kingdom, but then you need to pay 50.000 gold as well. You can also buy maps from others or even sell them if you don't like them anymore. For buying/selling kingdoms there is a special function available inside the game (see below).

The whole map will be filled with villages which have their own owner. At this moment, each village belongs to its own player, but it could be conquered by others - depending on how many troops you have and how well you attack. There are no other players in this kingdom except you. The only way to communicate is using the global chat inside MK (see below).

I always thought a march was some sort of border territory between two established realms that were still contested. But in this case, it seems to be used as a synonym for a realm, as one can find "the Gruinmarkt" or "the Eyre".

The word is used in its original sense here: The March of Anjou (March des Anjou), the March of Bourgogne (March de Bourgogne), etc. I guess that's why it was used this way as well.
