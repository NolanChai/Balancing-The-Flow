What do you mean by "I want to enter a numerical value from the first row in column A up to the 12th row in the same column?" Do you mean that if I type 1 into the input box, then I'll get the values 1 through 12 in ColumnA?

If so, you can use this code:

Code:

```
Private Sub CommandButton1_Click()
Dim r As Long
For r = ActiveCell.Row To ActiveCell.Row + 11
    ActiveCell.Offset(r).Value = r
Next r
End Sub
```
