You can't recover the money on your Visa Card, but you can use it to make transactions if there are pending payments for any services in your account.

You can request another card after 60 days of receiving this one.

As long as the funds on the card are available, you can use them. The funds will be deducted from the card in case any purchases were made or payments to be made through the card. If there are no pending charges, then your balance is zero and your card has been cancelled.

You can't request a second card at the moment because you have an active card with us, so you will be able to make a request after 60 days.

If your balance is zero then the card is canceled and it's not possible to withdraw the money, but if you have pending payments for any services in your account or have a balance of more than $0 then you can use the Visa Card to make transactions until the funds are deducted.
