The above email is a sample of what is being circulated within my organization and the reason for this thread. I do not know how to respond because the content is not clear as it relates to me and my workflow. The question itself is unclear, grammatically incorrect, and confusing.

In fact, even if the subject had been formatted in a way that it would have made sense, I still would have needed someone else to confirm what the question was asking since the wording and grammar is not understandable to me. The example is also not consistent with our organization's typical internal communication style which makes it more difficult for me to comprehend.

The subject of the email should be in a form that clearly states what the sender wants, and not just an opinion or request. For example, "Hi Crystal, May I confirm if HR will upload the business objective goals to my performance goals for tracking, or I need to fill that in myself?" is an unclear subject line because it's asking two questions at once which can be confusing when reading quickly through emails. The second question should have been formatted as its own sentence with proper punctuation instead of being combined into one long run-on phrase.

In the future, please make sure that any email you send out is concise and clear so that everyone who receives it understands exactly what needs to be done by when without having to re-read anything over again!

Hi Jimmy, 

In your case, the business objective goal is not going to be uploaded by HR as this goal type is only meant for functional goals and does not have an approval process or any due date. The line manager can assign any of the other goal types like operational/functional/performance/development etc. in the performance module. 

Let me know if you need more help.

Thanks, 
Crystal

This is a classic mistake, especially when we use the same word more than once (in this example: "goals"). It may be fine in spoken language or in writing that is not for official purposes but should always be avoided in formal written communication such as emails to colleagues or your superiors. In fact, the correct grammar would be "business objectives".

## The rules of using nouns, adjectives and verbs correctly

We use different parts of speech (parts of the English language) to communicate effectively:

- nouns describe people, animals or things - e.g. a cat, a dog, an apple, a car, a bus
- verbs are actions that people perform - e.g. drive, walk, talk, go, sleep, run, jump, eat
- adjectives give more detail about nouns and verbs - e.g. fast, big, green, old, nice, small, tasty, long, short etc.
- adverbs describe how someone or something performs an action (in time, place or manner) - e.g. quickly, slowly, suddenly, often, sometimes, soon, before, after, outside, inside, badly, well etc.
- prepositions show the relation of a noun to another noun or verb - e.g. at, in, on, from, by, above, below, over, under, towards, behind, between etc.
- pronouns replace the use of a noun when we have already mentioned it before (e.g. "I" replaces the word "me") - e.g. I, you, he/she, it, they, this, that, these, those
- conjunctions connect words or phrases - e.g. and, but, so, because etc.
- interjections (exclamations) show how we feel - e.g. well, great, what, oh

## How to use them correctly

Let's look at the above example:

>

1. There's a typo at the end of your sentence: "shall we still meet tmr" should be "will we still meet tmr".

2. The meaning is not clear here. The word "still" means "in spite of". So it should refer to an activity that has already started. The way I understand this sentence, you are proposing that we will continue to meet on a regular basis even though Crystal is away for a week. Is that what you mean?

If not, you could say, "Since Crystal is on leave till this Friday and will be back next Monday, shall we still discuss it tomorrow?"

In the recent past, I have heard several stories where customers, prospects and colleagues have been able to achieve extraordinary things by working across boundaries in their respective organisations. The best examples are where the collaboration has allowed people to re-think the problem from a different perspective.

Collaboration also provides an opportunity to bring together the right expertise at the right time, from within the organisation or externally, and create synergy in a way that drives impactful innovation.

Collaboration across boundaries requires people to trust each other to do the right thing, and be empowered to make decisions for the common good without worrying about personal interests. In my experience, this has been made possible by building trust with our customers, partners, colleagues and external stakeholders over time. The trust is built on a foundation of shared values, behaviours and actions that are aligned to the greater good of the organisation and its people, and not just one individual or group's interests.

Collaboration across boundaries requires courage to take calculated risks, being open-minded enough to explore different ideas, and being able to have constructive conversations even when we do not see eye-to-eye with each other. It is important that we are able to balance the needs of short-term results against long-term investments in our capabilities and relationships for sustained growth.

Collaboration across boundaries requires us to be open and curious, to listen deeply, to ask questions, to challenge assumptions and to explore possibilities together. We need to be comfortable with not having all the answers, or even knowing what we don't know. This can often lead to more creative solutions and better outcomes for everyone involved.

Finally, collaboration across boundaries requires us to be willing to take on new roles, responsibilities and challenges that may be outside our comfort zone. It is important that we are able to adapt quickly as circumstances change, and that we can learn from each other's experiences, strengths and weaknesses in order to become better together than we could ever achieve alone.

Collaboration across boundaries requires a sense of humility - recognising that we do not have all the answers or know everything there is to know about our work or field. It also takes courage - being willing to take risks, try new things and experiment with different approaches in order to find better solutions for everyone involved.

Collaboration across boundaries requires trust between people working together on projects; this means having faith in each other's abilities while also understanding each other's needs so that everyone feels supported throughout their journey together towards a common goal. Collaboration can only be successful when there is an openness from all parties involved - willingness to share ideas openly without fear of judgement or criticism; open communication between teams members; respect for one another's opinions even if they differ from yours own personal beliefs or ideals; trusting that each person is doing their best within their scope of responsibility regardless whether or not it aligns exactly with yours own expectations for them personally or professionally speaking.

Collaboration across boundaries requires us to be open-minded enough to explore different ideas while also being able recognize when something isnâ€™t working so we don't waste time trying something that won't lead anywhere productive but rather focus our efforts towards finding solutions instead! It takes commitment from everyone involved - willingness for people working together on projects at different levels within an organization (or external organizations) who may have varying opinions but ultimately share same common goal: making sure whatever product/service/idea we create has maximum impact possible!
