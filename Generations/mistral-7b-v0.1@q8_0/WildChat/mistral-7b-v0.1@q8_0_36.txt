Chronologically organized contributors to recovery trajectory

# The role of psychotherapy in recovery from addiction and mental illness.

## Background

- Recovering addicts and individuals with chronic mental illness often seek treatment in primary care, and a large proportion receive no further specialized treatment
- 90% of individuals with addictions are not treated for their condition
- Addictions and psychiatric disorders have similar etiology; many share common genes and environmental stressors. The two conditions frequently coexist in an individual
- Evidence supports the value of psychotherapy for improving outcomes among individuals with addiction, mood disorders, personality disorders, and trauma
- This presentation will explore how these two conditions interact to undermine recovery and how they can be successfully addressed in tandem

# The Role of Psychotherapy in Recovery from Addiction and Mental Illness

- Ask the individual about their experience of trauma; look for dissociation as a sign of potential unresolved trauma
- Inquire about family history of alcoholism, substance use disorder and other psychiatric disorders
- Ask about current stressors (living conditions, relationships, employment, finances) as well as past traumas
- Consider referrals to psychotherapy for individuals with mental illness or addiction in primary care; referral is particularly warranted when a person has multiple problems
