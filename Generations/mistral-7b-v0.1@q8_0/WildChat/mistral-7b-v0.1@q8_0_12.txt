## Answer:

Sometimes, I am just really amazed at how TV shows can take some rather ordinary events and make them look so extraordinary that they feel like they are real. That is what this show does. The show has a main character that is an older woman who works in the same hospital she used to work for as a nurse.

She also has her own business that she runs out of her house, which is why she is always working on different cases and helping patients get through their problems. She also has a son that she is taking care of, so there are other things going on in her life.

What makes the show really interesting though is how it shows the problems that many people face as they go about their lives and try to overcome them. You see this in the storylines. The main character has her own family issues, she has her own job issues, and she also has health problems. The show does a very good job of showing all of these things in an entertaining way.

If you enjoy watching shows about people that are living their lives with real problems then this is the show for you. It will keep you on the edge of your seat as it goes through each episode and shows how a person can overcome their issues.
