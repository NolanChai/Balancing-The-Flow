## Problem 1

The mass of an object is given in kilograms as: $m=0.302078\;kg$. Round this to the correct number of decimal places (significant figures).

## Answer

$0.3021\; kg$

## Solution

Step 1

Given: $0.302078$

Step 2

We know that we can round a number to the correct decimal place (significant figures) by moving the decimal point as far as possible in the left and still keep the value of the number correct. The first digit after the decimal place is the least significant digits, so if it is equal or greater than 5, then round up; otherwise, leave it unchanged.

Step 3

Moving the decimal point to the left, we get $0.3021$, which is rounded to two decimal places. Since the digit $7$ is less than $5$, we keep the value of this digit unchanged.

Step 4

We can say that $m=0.3021\;kg$.

I know that I'm not supposed to round it up or down in this case but what would happen if I did? Would my answer change if i rounded it up instead of leaving it as is?

The mass of the box can be found by subtracting the mass of the crackers from the total mass. 924 - 24 = 896 grams
Since we know that the volume of each cracker is constant, the number of crackers in a box must also be directly proportional to the volume of the box. Therefore, if we can find the volume of the box and divide by the volume of a single cracker, we will have our answer.
To calculate the volume of the box, we need the surface area of one side of the box and its height. If you look at the picture you provided, it looks like the crackers are in the shape of rectangles, meaning they're cuboids (the shape formed when you slice off the top corner of a cube). Therefore, to find the volume of 1 cracker, we can multiply the length by the width by the height.
You have two sides that have an area of 50 square centimeters and one side with an area of 39 square centimeters. Since all three of these areas are equal in size (they're all rectangles), you know that they must represent either the length, width, or height of each cracker.
Using the information provided to you in your question, we can create a proportion that looks like this: 50 = ? Ã— 39. You don't have enough information given to solve this problem without knowing the value for "?". However, by making an educated guess on what that value could be, you should get close enough to answer the question asked.
Assuming that the height is equal to 39 centimeters (we know from the picture that each cracker has a height of at least 2 centimeters), then we can rearrange our proportion so that it looks like this: ? = 50/39. Solving for "?" gives you an answer of 1.28205128... which means each cracker has a volume of 128.205128cm^3.
Now we need to find the volume of the box so that we can divide it by the volume of 1 cracker to get our answer. To do this, we simply multiply the area of one side (which you already know is equal to 50 square centimeters) by its height and then multiply that result by 6 (because there are 6 sides). Doing so gives us an answer of 948cm^3 for the volume of the box.
Now we can divide the volume of the box by the volume of a cracker to get our answer. We'll need to use significant figures in this step, so round your value for "?" up to three decimal places (128.2051). Therefore: 948/128.205 = 7.3916...
To find the number of crackers in the box, we simply need to multiply our answer by 27 (because there are 27 crackers in a box). Doing so gives us an answer of 194.26665... which rounds up to 194 crackers.
