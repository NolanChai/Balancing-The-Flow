Dave: What the hell are you doing?
Megan: I thought we were going to play this new game you’ve told me about where you go into a trance. It’s going to be really fun.
Dave: Yeah, but we didn’t agree on it yet! Besides, you don’t know what the hell you’re doing!
Megan: Oh stop being such a baby! Here, hold out your arm and close your eyes.
(she taps his arm)
Megan: Now when I say “Relax”, you’ll be deeply relaxed. When I say “You’ll feel so peaceful”, you’ll start to feel very calm & peaceful inside. When I say “Your mind is starting to drift into a deep trance”, you’re going to start to drift into a trance…
Dave: No Megan, stop it! Let go of me!
Megan: You’re so easily hypnotised aren’t you?
(she pats his arm)
Megan: Deeply relaxed… feeling so peaceful… drifting into a deep trance.
