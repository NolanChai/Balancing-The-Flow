[DISC]Think about a time when you had to explain something to someone (a friend, family member, coworker). What was the context? What did they need to learn about? Was this information new to them or were they already familiar with some of it? How did you approach explaining this to them? Was there anything specific that helped you do a good job of explaining it to them?[/DISC]

[DISC]I have a lot of knowledge on how to handle a patient in distress and non-compliant. But I still need practice handling them during my first year in nursing practice. It was my first time to encounter this kind of situation. The patient is unaware that he has Alzheimerâ€™s disease and is not taking medications for his hypertension and diabetes. The doctor explained the importance of him taking his medication and gave an ultimatum for the next 10 days. I am glad that the patient was able to take his meds the following day and I am hopeful that he will continue to take it in the next few weeks.[/DISC]
