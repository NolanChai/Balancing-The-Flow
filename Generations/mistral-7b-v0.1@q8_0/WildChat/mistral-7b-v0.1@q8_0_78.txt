Yuri: “Oh no…Natsuki! She’s in labor!”

(We all rush over to the trunk, where I lay on the floor, writhing in pain. Sayori was the first one there, and she started crying at the sight of me in so much agony.)

Sayori: “Oh no, Natsuki! What’s happening?”

Yuri: “She must be having contractions. We need to get her to the hospital!”

Monika: “No time, Yuri. We have to deliver this baby.”

(MC and Sayori help me onto a chair as Monika pulls out my belly to prepare me for delivery.)

Sayori: “Are you okay, Natsuki?”

Yuri: “We’ll get through this together, okay?”

(I try to smile at the girls, but my body won’t let me. I can feel myself getting weaker by the second - but I refuse to give up.)

Natsuki: “Just…do what you have to…”

(MC and Sayori hold onto my hand as Monika starts counting down from ten. The girls all start chanting “Push!” in unison, while I grit my teeth and push with all my might.)

Yuri: “Almost there, Natsuki! You can do it!”

Sayori: “I’m right here, honey.”

Monika: “One…two…three…FOUR!”

(At the count of four, I let out a loud scream as my waters break - and out comes a beautiful baby girl. The girls all gasp in surprise at how tiny she is - but they quickly recover to help me deliver her placenta.)

Yuri: “Perfect timing, Natsuki.”

Sayori: “She looks just like you.”

MC: “Congratulations, Sayori. You’re a mother now.”

(I start crying at the sight of my daughter - and at how relieved I am that everything turned out okay. The girls all come over to help me up, and we celebrate with tears of joy.)
