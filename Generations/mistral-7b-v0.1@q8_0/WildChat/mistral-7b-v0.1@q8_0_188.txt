Yuri: "This was fun!" (waves at the camera) "I had a great time today! I hope we get to do this again soon!"

Yuri (to Natsuki, as she and Monika walk away): "How does it feel? Are you okay?"[/YURI] [Sayori]

Sayori: "What an amazing day! Thank you so much for inviting us, Monika. I had a wonderful time."

Monika (to Natsuki): "Are you okay?"[/SAYORI]
