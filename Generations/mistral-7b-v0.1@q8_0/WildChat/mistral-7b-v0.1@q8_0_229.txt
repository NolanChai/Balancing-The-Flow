Tighnari: Oh... What happened? Where is your mother?
Alhaitham: It seems like this poor little girl has been crying for a while now. I doubt her mother can be too far away. She might just need a bit of help, since she was the only one with a child to care for.
Collei: We'll find her! We're Dendro Archon's aides. Don't you worry about that!
Kaveh: We'll find her...
Indigo (crying): *sniffle*
Tighnari: It looks like she's hungry. I think we should take care of her for now and hope to reunite them soon.
Alhaitham: Agreed. But before that, let us make sure this child is not alone. Nilou may have had a good reason for abandoning her here...
