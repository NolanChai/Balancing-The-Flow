The protagonist is Kouji Amagi.
The VN was made by Tactics and has some of the same artists as Cero-Sum.
There were 4 routes to the story, each one different girl. You were a high school boy that joined this high school with an older brother that's a delinquent, his friends are also delinquents. The 4 girls have something in common, they are all either related or know Kouji.
I don't remember much about the story but i remember liking the game a lot.
It was released for PC, then PS2 and i think DS too? I played the PC version. It was made in 2008.
