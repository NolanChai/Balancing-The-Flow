(In the clubroom, Natsuki is lying on top of her boyfriend - Taiga.)

(Natsuki: "Hey... I feel something kick...")

Natsuki: (Taiga's hand slides down to Natsuki's tummy.)

Natsuki: (She gasps as she feels another one of her triplets kicking.)

(Natsuki and Taiga are laying on top of each other, with their faces buried in the pillow. Suddenly, there is a loud "WHAM!", as Natsuki's tummy gets kicked.)

Natsuki: (She gasps, as she feels her third daughter - Mikoto - kick her belly for the first time.)

Natsuki: (After a few minutes, Taiga suddenly turns on his side to look at Natsuki.)

Taiga: "Is it... time?"

Natsuki: (She nods.)

Taiga: "That means..."

Natsuki: "I know."

(In the clubroom, Natsuki's triplets - Hiroshi, Yukito and Mikoto - are born. They are laying on their mother's chest, all sleeping peacefully.)

Taiga: (He is holding his son Hiroshi in his hands.) "I love you..."

(The next day, Natsuki takes her children to the park.)

Natsuki: (She smiles as she watches her children play happily.)
