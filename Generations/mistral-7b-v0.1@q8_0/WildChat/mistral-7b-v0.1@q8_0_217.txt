Shovel Knight and Lilac were walking down a street in Freedom Planet Town when Lilac noticed something in the distance. She asked Shovel if he could see what it was but all he saw was some kind of white blob on the ground. They kept on walking until they got to the edge of town where there is a cliff with stairs going down into the water and another pathway leading out of town that went up towards the top of a mountain.

Lilac pointed at it and said “Hey, what’s that?” Shovel looked over her shoulder but couldn’t make out any details because it was too far away for him to tell what it was from where they were standing on top of the cliff. He told her he couldn’t see anything from here but if we go down closer then maybe we will be able to see better.” They went down and Lilac pointed out what she saw again “Hey there’s something over there! It looks like some kind of white blob!” Shovel looked over his shoulder once more as they kept on walking towards it. He could just barely make out the shape now but when they got close enough he was able to tell that it was a person lying on their back with both arms crossed over their chest like they were dead or something

“Hey wait don’t you think we should help them? What if they need help?” She said excitedly while Shovel stood there wondering if she wanted him to go and see what it was. “Uh… yeah I guess so but first let me check my tools. You know, just in case.” He said while turning around to face her with a worried look on his face because he didn’t want anything bad happening after all these years without having any problems at all! She nodded and watched him walk back up the pathway towards where their stuff was lying around on the ground next to their car parked off to the side of it. He picked up two shovels, one that looked like an old fashioned garden type from centuries ago but another newer looking model which seemed more modern than anything else they’ve seen before when he came back down towards where she waited patiently with her hand outstretched for him to take hold of as well.”

He walked up next to Lilac and took hold of the shovel then said “Alright let’s go! We need to help them before it’s too late!” Lilac nodded in agreement while they started walking towards where they saw the person lying on their back with both arms crossed over chest like he was dead or something. When they got closer, Shovel could see that it wasn’t just a white blob after all but actually someone lying there! He took one last look at his tools before putting them down again to check if any of them had been broken during our journey here so far…

Shovels are one thing you should always have with you when going on adventures like this because they’re incredibly useful for digging up things buried underground which can help you find hidden treasure chests or even just supplies that could save your life if anything happens while out in the wilderness without any kind of shelter around! They also come in handy during battles too since shovels are great weapons to use against enemies who might be coming after you from behind (or above).

Shovel knight and Lilac continued walking until they got to the person lying on their back with both arms crossed over chest like he was dead or something. Shovel put his hand down next to them then looked up at Lilac while asking “Are you sure this is alright?” She nodded in agreement so Shovel picked him up by one arm and started dragging him away from where we found him before putting him down again once more near the entrance of town. He looked around for any signs that someone else was watching us but there didn’t seem to be anyone else around! “Hey wait a minute…” Lilac said as soon as she realized what had happened too since it wasn’t until after they left that she noticed Shovel had picked up our new friend and taken him with us on our journey back home.”

Shovel knight and Lilac started walking again once more while carrying their new found companion in between them both sides of the pathway leading towards Freedom Planet Town. When they got closer, Shovel could see that it wasn’t just a white blob after all but actually someone lying there!
