Alice: (to herself) "It hurts! It hurts so much! Why am I feeling this?!"

(Then suddenly a boy approached her desk. He was wearing the school uniform, but was holding on to a sword which looked like it could be from a fantasy story.)

???: "W-what's going on?! Alice, are you ok?"

(Alice turned to look at him, and he seemed rather familiar. He had the same hair as Alice, and even wore a similar outfit. It was then I remembered - I saw them at the entrance of this school before.)

???: "Alice...are you ok?!"

(The boy seemed worried for her.)

Safi'jiiva: (to myself) "Could he be Alice's twin brother?"

Alice: (groaning in pain) "H-he's here..."

(I turned to see what she was looking at - and it was a human boy, wearing an orange cloak. He looked like he just came out of a video game. I even saw him battle a dragon before.)

???: (to Alice) "I'll be right back with help." (he ran away from her desk)

Alice: (to herself) "That's it..."

(She grabbed her belly, and looked at the human boy - who was now being chased by a swarm of other humans.)
