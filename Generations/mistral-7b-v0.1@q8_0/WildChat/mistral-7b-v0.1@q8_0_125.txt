[NOTE]Answer D is incorrect. The correct answer is C (see explanation below). In a randomized block design, a control group cannot be included because the blocks are used to control for confounding variables in the experiment. Instead, each treatment must be applied to each of the two age-groups, with the subjects within each age-group randomly assigned to treatments.[/NOTE]

Answer & Explanation

Step 1
Let $X$ be the random variable for the number of tosses before blue lands faceup. Then $P(X\ge 2)$ is the probability that it takes at least two tosses for blue to land faceup. So we must find the probability mass function (pmf) for this distribution.
We know that the pmf for a discrete random variable $X$ with probability space ${x}_{1},{x}_{2},\dots ,{x}_{n}$ is given by
${P}_{X}\left(x\right)=P(X={x}_{k})$
So we must calculate the probabilities for each outcome. First, let's look at how many ways there are of tossing the die $k$ times in a row without any blue. We want to count the number of ways to choose $k$ non-blue sides from among the eight possible sides. This is a combinatorics problem because we have to select the desired outcomes from a total number of possibilities. In this case, the total number of possibilities is ${8}^{k}$ because there are 8 possible ways for each toss of the die. For example, if $k=1$, then it means that no blue side is chosen at all (no blue side is faceup), and so there are ${8}^{1}=8$ ways this can happen (we could choose any of the eight sides). If we increase $k$ to 2, then it means there were no blue sides chosen on the first two tosses. Therefore, there are ${8}^{2}$ possibilities for this event. This is because we have to choose the first faceup side from among all 8 sides, and the second faceup side must also be one of those same 8.
So in general, if $k$ denotes how many times blue does not show up on a toss, then we can count the total number of ways by calculating ${8}^{k}$ because there are $k$ choices for the first side to not be blue, $k-1$ choices for the second side to not be blue (because one has already been selected), and so on. The reason this works is that when you toss a die, all 8 sides are equally likely to appear faceup, so there is no order in which they must happen.
We can see that the number of ways of tossing the die $k$ times without blue is given by ${8}^{k}$. Now we need to count how many ways there are of getting exactly $i$ red sides and $j$ yellow sides before the first blue side appears. Again, this is a combinatorics problem because it requires us to select from a total number of possibilities. In this case, the total number of possibilities is ${8}^{k}$ because we have $k$ tosses in which no blue appears (as we saw earlier).
This means that the probability mass function for the random variable $X$, the number of tosses before blue lands faceup, is given by
${P}_{X}\left(x\right)=\frac{{8}^{x-2}}{\sum _{k=0}^{\mathrm{\infty }}{8}^{k}}$
where ${P}_{X}(x)$ is the probability that $X$ equals $x$. The reason for this is because there are ${8}^{x-2}$ ways to select $x-2$ non-blue sides (remember, we need exactly 2 blue sides before the first blue side appears), and there are $\sum _{k=0}^{\mathrm{\infty }}{8}^{k}$ total possibilities. Therefore, the probability that $X=x$ is equal to ${8}^{x-2}/\left(\sum _{k=0}^{\mathrm{\infty }}{8}^{k}\right)$.
Now let's find the answer to our question: What is the probability that a player will toss the die at least 2 times before blue lands faceup? The answer is given by
$P(X\ge 2)=1-{P}_{X}(0)-{P}_{X}(1)=\sum _{x=2}^{\mathrm{\infty }}{P}_{X}(x)$
Step 2
We can write this in terms of the summation we found earlier as follows:
$P(X\ge 2)=1-\left(\frac{{8}^{0}}{\sum _{k=0}^{\mathrm{\infty }}{8}^{k}}+\frac{{8}^{1}}{\sum _{k=0}^{\mathrm{\infty }}{8}^{k}}\right)=\frac{1}{\sum _{k=0}^{\mathrm{\infty }}{8}^{k}}\left[\sum _{x=2}^{\mathrm{\infty }}{8}^{x-2}\right]$
We can see that the sum $\sum {8}^{x}$ is a geometric series with $a={8}^{0}=1$ and $r={8}^{1}$. Therefore, the sum of this infinite series is given by ${a}_{g}/(1-r)$, where ${a}_{g}$ is the first term in the series. So we can rewrite our expression as follows:
$P(X\ge 2)=\frac{1}{{8}^{0}+{8}^{1}}\left[({8}^{2}+{8}^{3}+{8}^{4}+\cdots )-1\right]$
We can simplify this to get $P(X\ge 2)=2/7$.
