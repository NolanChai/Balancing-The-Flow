the 2007 VTech Hokies were ranked in the top ten all year long and had high hopes for the ACC title. the team was led by the Heisman trophy finalist, Sean Glennon, but his performance as quarterback left a lot to be desired. there is no doubt that he was able to manage the clock well (28-11 record) and not turn the ball over (16 touchdowns, 3 interceptions), but the fact that he could only throw for 200 yards on average during his collegiate career shows that he is not ready for the pros.

the defense was the strength of this team. they held opposing teams to a mere 15 points per game and gave up only 1 rushing touchdown all season long (north carolina state). they were led by defensive end, Jason Worilds who had 7 sacks this year but will have to improve on his 29 tackles.

the 2007 Virginia Tech Hokies football team was ranked number one in the country and had high expectations coming into the season. however, they failed to meet those expectations and finished with a record of 8-4.

the hokies were led by quarterback sean glennon who had a strong arm but struggled with accuracy at times. he threw for over 2,000 yards and 14 touchdowns while only being intercepted four times. running back kenny ehrmann was also a major contributor to the team’s success as he ran for over 700 yards and 5 scores on the ground.

the defense was one of the best in college football this season, holding opponents to just over 18 points per game while recording 26 interceptions (third most in the country) led by cornerback kendall fuller who had seven picks himself including three returned for touchdowns – tying him for first nationally among all defensive backs!

in conclusion: i think that if you are looking to buy a new car or house, then it would be best if you could get some information about the company before buying from them.
