Seismic Magnitude Scale

The first seismic scale was proposed by C. Richter in 1935. He used it to record the magnitude of the largest earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0. In this scale, the size of the seismic wave is measured and the amplitude of the wave is recorded.

The formula for calculating the magnitude is:

M = logA - logAo

where M is the magnitude of the quake in the Richter scale
logA is the natural logarithm of the maximum displacement of the seismograph, A
logAo is the natural logarithm of the maximum displacement of the seismograph, Ao, which is recorded during a quake with a magnitude equal to 0.0 in the Richter scale.

This is an objective scale, because it does not depend on the subjective perception of the observer. The values are obtained directly by measurements of the energy released at the epicenter (the source) and at the surface of the earth (the receiver), so there is no need to rely on human judgment or estimation. This objectivity makes this scale more useful for comparison of seismic waves in different parts of the world.

The largest earthquake ever recorded has a magnitude of 9.0, and it happened in Alaska in 1964. There have been many other earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 8.0 since then. For example, a magnitude 7.4 earthquake occurred near Christchurch, New Zealand in February 2011 (the most recent one), while a magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck Chile on February 27, 2010 (the second most recent).

Seismic Intensity Scale

The seismic intensity scale is subjective because it depends on human judgment and perception. The values are based on how much damage was caused by an earthquake, not how much energy was released at the epicenter or the surface of the earth. This means that this scale can be used to compare different parts of a region but cannot be used to compare regions across different countries. For example, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.0 in one country may cause less damage than one with a magnitude of 6.5 in another country because factors such as building codes and geology affect the amount of damage caused by an earthquake more than just its magnitude does.

The seismic intensity scale was developed by Charles Richter in 1935 to measure how much shaking was felt at various distances from an earthquake's epicenter (the location where it originated). This scale ranges from I (minor shaking) to XII (extreme destruction). A value of VII or greater means that there is widespread damage to structures, such as buildings collapsing onto streets below them.

## 1. Subjective scales
- Borg's category ratio (CR)
	- 0 = no effort at all, 10 = max effort imaginable

## 2. Objective scales
- RPE scale
	- 6=no exertion at all, 20=maximal exertion
- Borg's CR10 scale
	- 0 = no exertion, 10= max exertion imaginable

## 3. Subjective and objective scales
