I am so very tired and sleepy right now, so Iâ€™ll keep this short. This is actually for a friend, and I was going to do it over text message, but apparently I can only send out 25 characters at a time, so Iâ€™m doing it in a blog post instead. I guess I will be done soon, but my mind is foggy now.

This was requested by Meredith. You can find her on Twitter @_MereSays, and you should totally follow her because she is great. She is also the reason why this entry exists. Thanks Meredith! ðŸ™‚

So the first thing we see is a giant spider. Okay, that's not terribly original. I guess we're going for an insect theme this season? The second thing we notice is how incredibly fake the spider looks. It's hard to be scared of something you know isn't real.

I really hope this is a ruse, and it turns out that what we just saw wasn't even a dream sequence.

This is the third time in two episodes that we've seen this dude. I don't get it. Is he important? He's got to be, right?

What do you think of his name? It sounds like something you would call an old-timey British butler or footman, not someone who makes and sells creepy dolls for a living.

We finally see the inside of this creepy house for the first time. It's got some great production design going on in here: there's that awesome wallpaper, which looks like it came straight out of a Tim Burton movie, and that lovely chandelier.
