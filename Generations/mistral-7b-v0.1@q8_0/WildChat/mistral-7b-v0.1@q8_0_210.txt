The word is "affected".

"Affected" means "to have an influence on, to be influenced by". The Oxford English Dictionary gives some examples:

> The result was that the population in the area became affected with tuberculosis.
>
> Their parents were affected by their children's behaviour.
>
> He is very much affected by what happened.

"Effected" means "to bring about or achieve", and you would say:

> She effected the changes that she wanted in her life.
