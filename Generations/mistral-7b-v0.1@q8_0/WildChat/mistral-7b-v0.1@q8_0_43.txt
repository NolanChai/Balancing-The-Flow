I am trying to write some code in C that will take a url from the command line (example.com) and then create an html document with a table of all the files on example.com, and then send the document using smtp to the email address listed on the command line (you@email.com). I have never used C before but I am taking a class at my school and have been tasked with this project. Any help would be appreciated![/COLOR][/FONT]

You are sitting in a bar, enjoying the time of your life. You order your drinks from the bar-tender and enjoy every second of it. After some time you take one more sip, just to find that there is no taste at all. It’s plain water!

This is what you feel when you visit a forum, read a book or watch a movie but do not understand a word of it.

Well, I am here for the same purpose as you are- to enjoy myself to the max. But I have a small problem. English is my second language and I don’t know most of the words used by the English people. So I am trying to learn them from where ever I can find them. I am learning new words from books, movies and also from the Internet.

Here is a list of words that you should know if you are using the Internet. It may not be useful to the native speakers but for those who are second or third language users like me it will help. This list is not complete, it will keep on getting bigger. I am hoping that some one else also finds this useful and contributes to it.

This list is only about English words that you should know in order to make your Internet experience easier. For general knowledge of the English language, please read my other post “English for beginners”

I have an employee who is sending out emails which are coming through my exchange server with his email address as the sender. The messages contain an image of him at an adult website and says "click on this link" etc. I have asked the local ISP if they can trace where it has been sent from but they say there is no way to detect that, so my question is how does Microsoft do it when they block spoofed email? How can you even detect where a spoofed email has been sent from??

I am running exchange 2010.
