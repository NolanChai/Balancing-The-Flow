i) Iodometry is a technique used to measure the concentration of reducing agents.
ii) The iodide ion (Iâˆ’) can be oxidised to form elemental iodine.
iii) This reaction can be followed by titration against sodium thiosulphate, and is known as iodimetry.
iv) Iodimetry is usually done with a solution of iodide ion in potassium hydroxide (KI + KOH). The oxidising agent in this case is chlorine gas (Cl2), which is produced by the action of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) on manganese dioxide (MnO2).
v) Hypochlorous acid is a solution of sodium hypochlorite and hydrochloric acid.
vi) The reaction involved in the oxidation of iodide ion can be represented by:
\[ \mathrm{I}^{-} + 2\mathrm{C}{\mathrm{l}}_{2}\to \mathrm{I}{\mathrm{Cl}}_{3} \]
vii) This is a redox titration, because electrons are transferred from the reducing agent to the oxidant.

The following steps can be followed to perform an iodometry experiment:

1. Prepare a standard solution of sodium thiosulfate by dissolving 0.2 grams of sodium thiosulfate in 100 ml of distilled water. This solution has a concentration of 0.05 mol/l.

2. Take a small amount of the oxidizing agent or compound containing an oxidizing agent and add it to a test tube containing a few drops of starch indicator. This will cause the formation of iodine, which will turn the solution blue-black in color.

3. Add a small amount of sodium thiosulfate solution to the test tube until the blue-black color disappears, indicating that all of the iodine has been reduced back to iodide ions. Record the volume of the sodium thiosulfate solution used.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for several different concentrations of the oxidizing agent or compound containing an oxidizing agent, each time recording the amount of sodium thiosulfate solution required to reduce the iodine back to iodide ions.

5. Plot a graph of concentration versus volume of the sodium thiosulfate solution used, and determine the slope of the line. This represents the molar absorptivity of the oxidizing agent or compound containing an oxidizing agent.

6. Calculate the amount of oxidizing agent in the sample by using the formula: [Oxidizing agent] = (Volume of sodium thiosulfate solution used x Concentration of sodium thiosulfate solution) / Molar absorptivity. This will give you the concentration of the oxidizing agent or compound containing an oxidizing agent in the sample.

Answer & Explanation

Potassium dichromate (K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}) reacts with sodium thiosulphate (Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}) to give potassium chromate (K_{2}CrO_{4}), and sulphur dioxide (SO_{2}).
The general reaction is :
${\mathrm{2K}}_{2}{\mathrm{Cr}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{7}+{\mathrm{4Na}}_{2}{\mathrm{S}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}\to {\mathrm{2K}}_{2}{\mathrm{CrO}}_{4}+{\mathrm{8NaOH+SO}}_{2}$
Potassium chromate is an insoluble product and is a precipitate.
As the dichromate ions react with thiosulphate ions in molar ratio of 1:4 (1 mol Cr^{6+} per 4 mol S^{2-}), hence 0.3259 g K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7 }$\phantom{\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}\times \phantom{\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}\frac{1\phantom{\rule{negativethinmathspace}{0ex}}{\mathrm{molK}}_{2}{\mathrm{Cr}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{7}\phantom{\rule{negativethinmathspace}{0ex}}}{359.84\phantom{\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}\mathrm{g}\phantom{\rule{negativethinmathspace}{0ex}}{\mathrm{K}}_{2}{\mathrm{Cr}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{7}}$
$=8.516\times {10}^{-4}\mathrm{molK}{}_{2}\mathrm{C}{r}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{7}$
$\therefore 8.516\times {10}^{-4}\phantom{\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}\mathrm{molK}{}_{2}\mathrm{C}{r}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{7}\phantom{\rule{negativethinmathspace}{0ex}}\times \phantom{\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}4=3.406\times {10}^{-3}\phantom{\rule{negativethinmathspace}{0ex}}\mathrm{molNa}{}_{2}{\mathrm{S}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$
Now, the molarity of sodium thiosulphate solution is given by :
${\mathrm{M}=\frac{8.516\times {10}^{-4}\phantom{\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}\mathrm{molNa}{}_{2}{\mathrm{S}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}}{\frac{1}{4}\left(\mathrm{VolumeofNa}{}_{2}{\mathrm{S}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}\times 67\phantom{\rule{thickmathspace}{0ex}}\mathrm{mL}\right)}}$
$=3.895\times {10}^{-4}\phantom{\rule{negativethinmathspace}{0ex}}{\mathrm{MNa}}_{2}{\mathrm{S}}_{2}{\mathrm{O}}_{3}$
