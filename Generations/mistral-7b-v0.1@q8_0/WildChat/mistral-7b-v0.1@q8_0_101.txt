[SPOILERS]

Ayumi: “I feel it. I can feel him moving around down there.”

Cupa: “Ayumi, you should probably sit down for this one. It might get a little rough.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “What? Don’t tell me that I have to give birth alone…”

Narwa: *Roars loudly at Amatsumagatsuchi, then disappears*

Ayumi: “Oh no, now it hurts more than before…”

Ibushi: *Roars and disappears*

Cupa: “The storm serpents are here!”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “Is this what they mean by ‘trial’?”

Ayumi: “It feels like something is trying to tear me apart from the inside.”

Cupa: “I hope Ayumi makes it through all of this. I can only imagine what she’s going through right now…”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “Maybe I can help, though…”

Cupa: “Wait! What are you doing?! Are you seriously trying to go into labor yourself?”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “This is for Ayumi!”

Ayumi: *Groans in pain*

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I’m going to try to help…”

Cupa: “Wait! You can’t just go into labor right now! That would be too dangerous - not to mention what it could do to your body!”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “Maybe if I take some of Ayumi’s pain, she will feel better.”

Cupa: “You don’t understand. You can’t go into labor right now! Your body isn’t prepared for it…”

Narwa: *Roars and disappears*

Ibushi: *Roars and disappears*

Amatsumagatsuchi: *Screams in pain as he goes into labor*

Cupa: “What are you doing? Stop this right now!”

Narwa: *Roars*

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I’m doing this for Ayumi! She needs my help!”

Ayumi: “It hurts…”

Cupa: “No! This is too dangerous! You could hurt yourself if you continue with this!”

Narwa: *Roars loudly*

Ibushi: *Roars*

Amatsumagatsuchi: *Screams in pain, and falls unconscious. His body begins to transform as he goes into labor.*

Cupa: “Oh no…”

Ayumi: “It feels like something is about to come out of me!”

Narwa: *Roars and disappears*

Ibushi: *Roars*

Ayumi: “There’s a lot of pressure in there.”

Cupa: “Oh god. What’s happening?”

Amatsumagatsuchi: *Wakes up, screaming in pain as he continues to transform into his baby form.*

Ayumi: “Help me…”

Ibushi: *Roars and disappears*

Cupa: “Amatsumagatsuchi! Stop! You can’t go on like this!”

Narwa: *Roars and disappears*

Amatsumagatsuchi: *Screams in pain as he continues to transform into his baby form.*

Narwa: *Roars and disappears*

Ibushi: *Roars loudly, then disappears*

Cupa: “Oh god… What have you done?”

Amatsumagatsuchi: *Finally emerges from Ayumi’s womb as a tiny baby. He takes his first breath and screams at the top of his lungs.*

Ayumi: “I did it!”

Cupa: “What… What have you done?”

Narwa: *Roars*

Amatsumagatsuchi: “It’s a boy!”

Ayumi: “Yes! He’s perfect!”

Amatsumagatsuchi: *Begins to cry out of relief*

Narwa: *Roars*

Ibushi: *Roars loudly, and disappears*

Narwa: *Roars and disappears*

Ibushi: *Roars loudly, then disappears*

Amatsumagatsuchi: “He’s our baby! He was born to be the son of a dragon!”

Ayumi: “That’s right.”

Narwa: *Roars loudly*

Ibushi: *Roars and disappears*

Cupa: “You can’t just abandon your responsibilities like this! You can’t leave me alone with your child!”

Ayumi: “He needs to be raised by a dragon.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “He’s going to be fine.”

Cupa: “I know you don’t understand. This is not what dragons do! You can’t just leave your child like this!”

Amatsumagatsuchi: *Roars*

Ayumi: “He will be raised by a dragon. That’s all that matters.”

Cupa: “What about me? What am I supposed to do now?”

Narwa: *Roars loudly and disappears*

Vanessa: “Alright! It seems that our little ones are doing fine! I am really proud that we can have 20 healthy children at once!”

Mindy: “I don’t know why, but it feels like they’re letting in oxygen by scurrying around the womb!”

Arachnus: “I think that’s a good thing - if you’re comfortable with having 20 hybrid spiders crawling inside of your uterus.”

Vanessa: “They won’t be there forever. The time will come when they are born, and I can finally give them the love they deserve!”

Mindy: “We still have to wait a couple more weeks! But don’t worry - we can go on an adventure together, before you give birth.”

[COPPER]I wonder if anyone in the Nether or the End could make something like that?[/COPPER]


[GOLD]“That won’t work, and even if it did, the plants might not grow.”
“But it’s worth a shot. Besides, there may be other ways of getting to the Twilight Forest without having to travel through the Overworld. We could try going into the End…”[/GOLD]
