- Hi @candace-wagner, could you please share with us how are you using the API? What is the current issue that you have faced? So we can understand more clearly and assist you better ðŸ™‚
- I donâ€™t think this feature has been developed yet. The team is working on it right now!

- If you cancel your subscription on a specific day and resubscribe 30 days later (for example) your license will be renewed for another 12 months from that specific date (the same time of the year).
- If you subscribe again before it expires, it will automatically extend for the same period (monthly or annual), regardless of when you cancel your subscription.

If you have any questions you can write to our support team via:

I don't see how I can accept this answer since the original question was "What happens if you stop paying?", and I had assumed that it would simply revert back to the free version. This is not the case, but the OP never asked what would happen if he continued paying - so now we have a whole new question about what happens when your membership runs out!

I'm sure most people would be happy with the answer as-is, but that isn't really satisfactory since you can only know the answer after asking the question. The answer should just say: "The license is renewed on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the chosen membership period." This would be much clearer and would not have required me to post this thread!

Thanks anyway for responding to the original question!
