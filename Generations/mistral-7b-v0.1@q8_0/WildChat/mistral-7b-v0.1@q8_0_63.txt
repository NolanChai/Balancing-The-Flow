Mindy: (sobbing uncontrollably) “…I’m so sorry, Valefor. I didn’t mean to wake you up like that.”

Valefor: “It’s fine, Mindy. Don’t worry about it. What happened?”

Mindy: (crying harder) “I was trying to save my friends from a monster, but I accidentally hit the wrong spell and blasted us all out here!”

Valefor: “Oh dear…well, everything should be fine now.”

(Just then, Mindy’s wings begin to glow.)

Mindy: (confused) “Why am I glowing?”

(Moments later, a bright white light emerges from her wings. In an instant, Mindy’s body is replaced by a sparkling crystal ball - her essence having been transferred to the ball.)

Valefor: “What in blazes is happening?!” (she takes a step back) “Mindy? Is that you?” (takes another look at the glowing ball of energy) “Whoever is inside that…it’s not Mindy. But it feels familiar.”

Bahamut: (closely examining Mindy’s crystal form) “This isn’t natural. She shouldn’t be able to do this on her own. There must be something else at work here.”

Ifrit: “What could possibly be causing this? The energy in the area is distorted, but it doesn’t seem to be coming from outside sources.”

Valefor: (shuddering) “I don’t know what’s happening, but I feel like something evil is here…something that wants to hurt us.” (looking towards Mindy’s crystal form) “It almost feels like…we’re being watched. Like someone or something is studying us.”

Ifrit: (looks around nervously) “That can’t be good…”

Valefor: “I feel like we should find a safe place to regroup and discuss this further. Let’s gather everyone in the cavern.”

(They all return to the cavern, where Anima and Shiva are now awake.)
