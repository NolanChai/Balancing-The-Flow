I have no idea where that came from.

What would you do with that power?

I would use it to go to sleep earlier, because I always seem to end up staying up way too late and then can't get out of bed in the morning.

If you had a time machine and could go back and change one thing in your life, what would it be?

Maybe my mother wouldn't have died when I was a baby, and maybe that wouldn't have been such a bad thing anyway. She was an alcoholic with borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder, and I think her drinking might have helped her deal with the depression and anxiety caused by her illnesses.

If you had one super power, what would it be?

I'd love to be able to fly. That's always been something I've wished for ever since I was a little kid.

Well it's about time. I had to do some digging, but I found it in a video called "The Sopranos: The Making of a Classic," released on DVD back in the day.

It's the first episode of Season 1 and it's at around 21 minutes (skip to 01:30 for the scene) -
