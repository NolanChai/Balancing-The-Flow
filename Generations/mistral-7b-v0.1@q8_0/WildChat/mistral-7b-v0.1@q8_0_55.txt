## About this event

We are a group of 50+ people who want to make the world better, more inclusive and accessible for all. We will use art as a tool to bring change. Our mission is to empower individuals through creating an environment where they can express themselves freely without judgment or fear of rejection.

This event has been made possible by the generous support of our sponsors:

1. The New York City Department of Education (NYCDOE) and its Office of Public Schools Accountability (OPSA) which provides funding for this project.
2. The NYC Councilmember’s office which provides in-kind donations such as supplies like paper towels, soap dispensers etc., that we need when we are working with kids in schools or after school programs; this also includes providing space for us to use during our meetings so that everyone has an opportunity to come together and work on projects together without having to worry about finding a place first.
3. The New York State Department of Education (NYSED) which provides funding for this project through its grant program called “Improving Educational Opportunities.” This money comes from taxpayers dollars paid by people who live within the state borders but are not necessarily residents themselves.
4. Our sponsor list includes businesses and organizations like:

Lilac

"Ding!" Lilac woke up from her bed and went downstairs.

"Morning, Mom, I'm going to school!" Lilac said as she was about to walk out the door.

"Yes, of course," replied Lilac's mom. "I made you a breakfast burrito."

"Thanks!" Lilac got in her car and drove off. She started thinking about the Freedom Planet characters when she remembered that they were ant sized and scared of humans!
