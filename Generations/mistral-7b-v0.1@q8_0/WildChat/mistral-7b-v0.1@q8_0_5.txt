## Explanation

This question is related to cardiac murmurs and their classification. An early diastolic murmur is the characteristic feature of mitral regurgitation (MR).

Aortic stenosis (AS) has an ejection click followed by a harsh systolic crescendo-decrescendo murmur.

Aortic regurgitation (AR) has a blowing diastolic murmur with thrill.

Mitral stenosis (MS) presents as a mid-diastolic rumble.

## Question

Question

Identify the cause of this murmur.

This topic is about getting your message across, or in this case, your message to a particular target audience. In order to achieve that goal, one must first take into consideration what message they would like to convey and to whom it is addressed. That is the basic first step to successful communication; knowing who you are speaking with and what the intended purpose is of that communication.

From there, it’s up to the sender of the information, the government in this case, to develop a way for them to communicate with their target audience. The government could use health education to reach out to their community about topics such as HIV awareness or sexually transmitted diseases and what can be done to prevent them, or how to educate yourself about healthy living and how that affects your day-to-day life. 

The government should consider using a survey as well so they could see which topic interests most people in their community by asking questions like: What would you like more information on?

Or what topics would you like to know more about?

This is an example of how the government could get their message across and also learn what their target audience wants from them. There are many ways for any government or company or person in general that has something they want others to hear, see or understand but these two examples might be best suited for this particular situation since they have already identified their desired outcome as increasing population awareness of common topics such as sexually transmitted diseases, HIV/AIDS, healthy living etcetera.

Answer: B. Rubella

Reason: Rubella can cause foetal abnormality if it occurs during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy (i.e., first trimester). Hence, women who are pregnant or could get pregnant should receive rubella vaccine before their pregnancy or during early pregnancy (i.e., first trimester) if they do not have evidence of immunity.

Varicella does not cause foetal abnormalities but the vaccine is not routinely administered in pregnancy, rather it is recommended for adults who are at high risk of varicella infection because they could be exposed to varicella or due to lack of history of chicken pox.

Influenza vaccination can be given during any trimester of pregnancy. The vaccine should be used during the 2018–19 season and should not be deferred until after pregnancy is complete.

The Tdap vaccine contains a combination of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis (whooping cough) components. The vaccine is routinely administered to pregnant women in their third trimester so that they will have protective antibodies against pertussis at the time when the baby is born and for 6 weeks postpartum when the baby cannot receive pertussis vaccination.
