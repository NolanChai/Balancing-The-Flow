I dunno, maybe if they were at school and some kid came over to her saying something like "Hey Max. Wanna come play 'Dance, Dance, Revolution' with me? I brought it from home." and she said "Sure" but then in the background you see the Mind Flayer crawling down the hallway towards them.

And when they were playing you'd see the Mind Flayer's hands on the buttons of the controller and Max would keep getting better and better at it.

Or maybe there'd be a party or something, and someone would say "Max, wanna come play 'Beat Saber' with us?" And she agrees but while they're playing you see the Mind Flayer's hands on the lightsabers.

[I]Max[/I] smiled and leaned closer to the girl sitting across from her at the table. "You're so beautiful, Nancy. And you smell so good." She licked her lips suggestively.

"Max," Nancy said. Her voice was firm. She held Max's eyes with a stern stare as if she could read them like pages of a book, looking for a sign that this was an act. "We both know what you are."

Max's smile wavered and she sat back in her seat. "So what?" she asked defiantly. "Do I have to sit here and pretend I didn't know what I was doing? That I had no choice but to let him in because of some stupid promise? Do I have to keep playing this part forever? You know me Nancy, you really do! We used to be friends!"

"I know who you were Max," Nancy said. "You were my friend. But that was before...everything."

"No Nancy," Max said as she shook her head and looked away. "You don't know anything about me."
