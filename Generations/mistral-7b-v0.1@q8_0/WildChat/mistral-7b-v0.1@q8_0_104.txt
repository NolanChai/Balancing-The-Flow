```
Luffy is sitting in front of a mirror. He notices that his left hand has been replaced with an orange cat's head! He says "What happened to my hand?"
```

```
"It seems you lost your arm in battle. It was turned into an orange cat's head by the power of a god."
```

```
Luffy runs down to the beach. He sees a man with long black hair and big eyes standing there. Luffy approaches him and asks "Are you the man who killed my father?" The man replies "Yes, I am"
```

```
He turns around and walks away. You see him disappear into the distance. Your heart starts pounding as you realize what has happened. You run after him, but he's gone!
```

```
You turn back around, only to find yourself in a dark room full of mirrors. As far as your eyes can see there are only mirrors everywhere. "Who am I? Where am I? What have they done?"
```

```
"Where is the exit?" Luffy says "What do you mean 'exit'?"
```

```
"You must find the way out!" You look around frantically trying to figure out where to go next. Suddenly, a voice calls out from behind you. The voice sounds familiar somehow...
```

```
Luffy looks back at his reflection in the mirror. His eyes widen as he realizes that this is not his own face staring back at him. Instead, there is a strange man wearing black clothes and a red hat with two green ears protruding from each side of his head! He says "Who are you?!"
