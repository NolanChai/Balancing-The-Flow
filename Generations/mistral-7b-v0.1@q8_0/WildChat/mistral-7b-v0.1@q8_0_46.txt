Explanations
An explanation is an idea or statement given to explain why something is true or what is true about something.  It usually begins with a word like because, since, etc., and it often has the structure subject + verb + object (or complement).
Example: I didn't get my paper done on time because I ran out of time.
Definition
A definition states the meaning or significance of an idea or statement; it defines what is being talked about.  A good definition includes a noun, followed by a verb (often in a form like "is" or "are").  The key word may be emphasized to make sure its importance is clear.
Example: The main idea of this story is that people should always tell the truth.
