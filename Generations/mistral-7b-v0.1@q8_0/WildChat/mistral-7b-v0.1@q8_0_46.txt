# Instructions on how to choose a city to live in Italy for expats.

> If you’re moving to Italy, the question of where to live is a big one.

There are many factors to consider, from cost of living to climate and culture. And, of course, your personal preferences will play a role too. Here are 3 things to keep in mind when deciding where to live in Italy.

### Location:

One of the most important things to consider when choosing a city to live in is its location. If you want to be close to family and friends, or if you need easy access to certain amenities, then you’ll need to choose a city that’s centrally located.

However, if you’re looking for a more relaxed lifestyle, then you might prefer a smaller town or village in the countryside. Whatever your preferences, make sure you do plenty of research on potential locations before making a decision.

### Cost of Living:

Another important factor to consider is the cost of living in Italy. While it’s true that some areas can be quite expensive, there are also many affordable options available. It’s important to research both rent and food costs in different cities before making your final decision.

Additionally, make sure you factor in other expenses like transportation and health care when calculating how much money you’ll need each month. By taking the time to do this research upfront, you can avoid any nasty surprises down the road!

### Climate:

Finally, don’t forget about the climate when choosing a city to live in Italy. If you hate hot weather, then it might be wise to stay away from cities like Naples or Rome during the summer months. On the other hand, if you love skiing and snowboarding, then places like Cortina d’Ampezzo or Livigno would be perfect for you!

No matter what your preferences are, there’s sure to be a city in Italy that’s perfect for you. So take your time, do your research, and choose the right place for you and your family to call home!

Dear J.K.,

Thank you for your post on the Italian Forum. It is a pleasure to help you find an appropriate location in Italy.

For starters, I would like to clarify your conditions:
- You are looking for a warm climate, but not one that is too hot (the same as me).
- You want good schools and medical care.
- You want lots of activities for your children and for yourself.

As far as I can tell from my research, you will be happy with any location in Italy other than the extreme north or south. The north is cold, the south is hot, both areas have many cultural attractions and a lot to offer to families and individuals. You may want to focus your attention on the center of the country, as it is more temperate than the north or south (but still warmer than Germany).

As far as schools are concerned, you can rest assured that in Italy children start school at six years old and learn Italian first. That said, you may wish to consider some private schools, where English is the language of instruction, especially if your kids will be attending university abroad later on.

Activities for all ages are very easy to find in most Italian cities. If you take a look at this section, you will have an idea of the kind of activities available in many places.

Hopefully I was able to help you with your search.

As you don't give any details about your job situation it is not possible to provide meaningful advice.
The general climate of Italy has a lot in common with the climate of southern Spain or Greece (and of course of Southern California). I'm sure you can find plenty of information on the web about the typical weather patterns, but basically you would have mild winters and hot summers.
If you work from home or remotely then you could live anywhere. But if your job requires you to go to an office every day you should choose a place within a reasonable distance from a big city like Turin or Milan, as they are the business centres of Italy's north-west, and there are lots of jobs in these cities for people with fluent English.
Hospitals: all major cities have hospitals, some even with specialised units. There is a national health service (NHS) that guarantees free or subsidised medical treatment to Italian citizens but also provides assistance for legal residents. It's possible to apply for residence permits if you live in Italy for more than 120 days, and after five years of continuous residency it's possible to obtain permanent residency.
Education: public schools are free for all EU citizens until the age of 16 (and even beyond that in some cases). For children from non-EU countries there is a special school system for foreigners where they learn Italian and study other subjects at the same time. The state education is quite good, but there are also many private schools which have international programs that teach entirely in English or French or German (for example), and which have students who come from all over the world.
Activities: I assume you mean "social life". As Italy has a long Mediterranean coastline, with many islands, it is a popular destination for foreign tourists so there are plenty of activities on offer - sporting events, cultural festivals, music concerts etc.

## Milano Marittima

##### Pinewoods, the beach and lots of fun!

A few miles from Ravenna, the Milano Marittima Resort offers a holiday full of nature and amusement parks, the ideal place to enjoy the sea, the pine forest and the sun.

It is a tourist resort designed to offer visitors all kinds of activities and entertainment for adults as well as for children. The city is located on a flat area that extends between the Po Delta and the Adriatic Sea.

The city’s name comes from its geographical location, which was once a marshy plain covered with pine trees.

Milano Marittima offers the possibility of an all-inclusive holiday, with a wide selection of hotels and apartments.

##### Beach

Milano Marittima is well known for its 10 km long beach. The sea is shallow and perfect for children. It is possible to rent beach umbrellas and sunbeds or the use of free areas, where you can set your own parasols. For those who do not want to walk there are also pedal cars available at very affordable rates.

The main beaches of Milano Marittima:

The city offers seafood and typical local dishes as well as international cuisine.

You can find places where you can enjoy a drink at any time of the day or night, such as cafes, pastry shops and ice cream parlors.

- Aquafan – The water park in Milano Marittima, which offers fun activities for all ages.
- Parco Mirabilandia – The amusement park of Milano Marittima is perfect for the whole family, with attractions for both adults and children.

##### The Delta Park

The Delta Park is a natural area that includes marshlands, rivers, forests and lakes. It is the perfect place to take long walks while enjoying the beauty of nature. In addition, there are many activities such as bird watching, horseback riding and fishing.

Certainly a city like Barletta, or even Bitonto and Trani (both on the Adriatic coast), or even Castel del Monte are all cities within the province of Barletta-Andria-Trani. For a small town that is more rural is located in the province of Foggia: Cagnano Varano (with 28,000 inhabitants) or San Severo (36 thousand), and also there are some good properties, if you want to live in a smaller village.

Bari is not the best place to live for many reasons but it's nice anyway. I would rather choose one of those small cities that are nearby.

I live in Monopoli, a beautiful small town with about 40,000 inhabitants.

But if you want to buy a house or something, the best is in Polignano a Mare or Conversano.

Furnished apartment in a building with an elevator, located near the sea. The house consists of 4 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, a living room, a kitchen and a terrace. The floor area is 90 sq.m. A parking space can be rented for an additional fee.

### Interior

The apartment includes two master bedrooms with built-in wardrobes and balcony access, three bedrooms (one of them — on the terrace), one bathroom with a bathtub and shower, another bathroom with a washing machine, living room, kitchen.

### Equipment
