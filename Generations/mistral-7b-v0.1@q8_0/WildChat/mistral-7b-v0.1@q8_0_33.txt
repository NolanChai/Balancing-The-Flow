The early Buddhist texts do not contain any concept of religion. They never talk about God or gods, and they don’t mention any religious beliefs whatsoever.

Why is it that the early Buddhist texts are not religious? One reason may be that Buddha was trying to save people from suffering by teaching them how to live in a way that would bring happiness, not misery. This meant he had to make sure his teachings were practical and relevant to everyday life. If they seemed like something only a deity could give, then it wouldn’t have been useful for ordinary people who needed help right now!

Another reason might be because there weren’t any religions around when Buddha was alive; therefore he didn’t feel the need to create one himself. He just wanted to teach people what would work best for them without getting into all those complicated religious issues that might not matter anyway since we don’t know where these gods live or even if they exist!

There is a legend that the Buddha Shakyamuni had been sent to India by his father. He was sent there to study under the best teacher. The journey there took him about six years, and he traveled 16 miles on foot each day. But he was never able to find a worthy teacher. After he arrived in India, he went from one school to another, but found nothing of interest.

In the end, he decided to return home. When he returned, his father asked him why he hadn’t been able to learn anything during the trip, and he replied that there was no teacher worthy enough for him. His father then said: “If you want to become a Buddha, go back to India and find an enlightened person.”

So Shakyamuni went back to India again. This time he found himself in a large forest where thousands of monks were sitting under trees listening to lectures given by the Buddhist monk Upali.

Upali was a famous teacher who taught all kinds of things, such as how to be happy and how to avoid suffering. But when Shakyamuni arrived at the lecture hall, he saw that there were no seats available. There were only two people sitting down next to each other: one person was sitting in front of Upali, while the other person was standing behind him.

Shakyamuni sat down next to them and asked them what they were doing there. They told him that they had come here because they wanted to learn from Upali. Shakyamuni smiled and said: “I’ll tell you why I am here.” Then he continued: “I came here to become an enlightened person like yourself.”

Upali replied: “Then go back home and study hard. You will never be able to reach my level of wisdom if you don’t try harder than me.”

After hearing this, Shakyamuni left the hall and went back to his house. His father asked him why he had come back empty-handed again. He replied that he hadn’t found any enlightened person in India yet, so he decided to return home once more. His father said: “If you want to become a Buddha, go back to India and find an enlightened person.”

So Shakyamuni went back to India for the third time. This time he met the Buddhist monk Ananda. They were sitting under the Bodhi tree together when they heard a noise coming from behind them. When they looked around, they saw that there was a young boy standing in front of them. The boy said: “I am the son of Shakyamuni. My name is Siddhartha Gautama.”

Shakyamuni smiled and told him to sit down next to him. He then asked him why he had come there. Ananda replied that he had been sent by his father to look for a teacher who would teach him all the things that he needed to learn in order to become an enlightened person like himself.

After hearing this, Shakyamuni said: “If you want to become a Buddha, go back home and study hard. You will never be able to reach my level of wisdom if you don’t try harder than me.”

Ananda replied that he would go back home and do his best to learn from Upali. He then asked Shakyamuni what else he needed to learn in order to become an enlightened person like himself. Shakyamuni told him that there was nothing more important than understanding the meaning of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness.

After hearing this, Ananda asked why he had said those things. Shakyamuni replied: “Because if you don’t understand these three things, then no matter how many other things you know about, they won’t be able to help you reach enlightenment.”

Ananda then went back home and started studying all the teachings of Upali. After a few months, he came back to Shakyamuni and asked him if he was ready to become an enlightened person like himself. Shakyamuni replied that he wasn’t quite there yet, but that he would try his best in the future.

So Ananda left for India again. This time he met with Upali and asked him what else he needed to learn in order to become an enlightened person like himself. Upali told him that there was nothing more important than understanding the meaning of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness.

After hearing this, Ananda left for home once more. He went back to his house where he saw his father sitting on a chair reading a book. He asked his father what he was doing. His father replied that he had been studying all the teachings of Upali since they first met many years ago, but that he still hadn’t reached enlightenment yet.

Ananda then told his father about all the things that he learned from Shakyamuni and how they were very important for reaching enlightenment. His father agreed with him, and Ananda left for India once more. This time he met with Upali again, but this time he was ready to become an enlightened person like himself.

Upali said that in order to do so, he had to learn the meaning of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness. Ananda then asked how he could understand these things. Upali replied: “If you want to understand these three things, then go back home and meditate for one month.”

After hearing this, Ananda left for home once more. This time he went straight to his room where he started meditating. After a few days, his father came to check on him and asked why he was spending so much time in meditation. He replied that he was trying to learn the meaning of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness.

His father said: “I thought you were studying all the teachings of Upali?” Ananda replied: “No, I’m not studying all the teachings of Upali, only the ones related to enlightenment.” His father then left for India once more, but this time he was ready to become an enlightened person like himself.

When his father met with Upali, he asked him what else he needed to learn in order to become an enlightened person like himself. Upali told him that there was nothing more important than understanding the meaning of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness. His father then went back home and started meditating once again.

After a few days, Ananda came to check on his father, but he found that his father wasn’t in his room. He asked where his father was and was told that he had left for India once more, this time he was ready to become an enlightened person like himself.

Ananda then decided that if he wanted to understand the meaning of impermanence, suffering, and selflessness, he would have to go back to India as well. This time, however, he didn’t just want to study with Upali, he also wanted to learn from other Buddhist monks there as well.

After reaching India once more, Ananda went straight to the Bodhi tree where Shakyamuni was sitting and asked him if he could teach him all about impermanence, suffering, and selflessness. Shakyamuni said: “Yes, but first you have to go to my friend Upali’s house so that I can tell him what you want.”

Ananda then left for Upali’s house where he met with Upali’s wife who was sitting at a table reading a book. He asked her why she wasn’t studying all the teachings of Shakyamuni and learning from him like Upali did. She replied: “I don’t think I need to learn those things, but if you want to know how to become an enlightened person like your father, then go back home and study with him.”

Ananda was surprised by this answer and decided that he would have to speak to his father once more. He left for his house where he found that his father wasn’t there either. He asked his mother why she didn’t tell him about Upali’s teachings. She replied: “I don’t think you need to learn those things, but if you want to know how to become an enlightened person like your father, then go back home and study with him.”

Ananda was now very confused. He decided that he would have to speak to his father one last time before going back home to study with Shakyamuni. So Ananda left for his father’s house where he found Upali sitting on a chair reading a book.

He asked his father why he wasn’t studying all the teachings of Shakyamuni and learning from him like he did. His father replied: “I don’t think I need to learn those things, but if you want to know how to become an enlightened person like your mother, then go back home and study with her.”

Ananda was now very frustrated because he thought that Upali knew more than his parents did about becoming an enlightened person. He asked Upali why his parents weren’t learning the teachings of Shakyamuni so they could become enlightened as well. Upali said: “You need to understand that impermanence, suffering, and selflessness are not things that you can learn from someone else, but things that you must come to understand yourself.”

Ananda was still confused about why his parents didn’t want
