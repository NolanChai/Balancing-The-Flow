### A Short History of Jamey Chadwell Stadium

Opened in 1998, the stadium was originally called Blackbaud Stadium, and is one of the newer soccer-specific stadiums in the United States. The stadium features a grass pitch with an artificial turf track around it for use by the North Charleston High School Track Team. It is also the home field for the Ashley Ridge High School baseball team, who won the state championship in 2014.

Blackbaud Stadium was renamed to Jamey Chadwell Stadium on October 30, 2015 after long-time Battery owner and chairman, Jamey Chadwell passed away.
