It's very important to take into account the quality of the post when you look at the scores. A low scoring post could just be a poorly written one; or it might have a controversial opinion and therefore has attracted many downvotes. The 77 comments indicates that there is discussion about this reddit post, but it's not necessarily bad. It could simply mean that people are sharing their opinions on the subject matter of the reddit post.

The fact that the post doesn't have a high upvote percentage does suggest that many people may not agree with the opinion expressed in it. However, if you look at some of the comments, they seem to be respectful and constructive so perhaps this is just an unpopular opinion rather than an offensive one. Ultimately, only time will tell whether this reddit post was well received or not.
