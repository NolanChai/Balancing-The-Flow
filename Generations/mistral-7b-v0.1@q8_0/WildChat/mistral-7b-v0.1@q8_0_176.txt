[BREAK]This is just one man’s opinion, but I feel like people are being overdramatic about how bad these changes are for the game (and that in itself is an overreaction). The new UI looks nice and isn’t as cluttered, and the animations seem to work fine. Also, there doesn’t seem to be a lot of missing content/items/features that were removed during the “refactor.” It seems to me that people are just making things out to be worse than they really are.[/BREAK]
