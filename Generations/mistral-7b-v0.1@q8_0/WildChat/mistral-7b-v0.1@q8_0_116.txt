It was the year 1986. A lonely child who lived in a small town of Russia with his family, that has not been seen for years. The parents did not like to talk about him. They had no photos, no stories, nothing. At least, this is what their children believed. One day, while the boy was walking through the woods, he saw something. A tall, slender figure in a suit. The figure just stood there and stared at the child. The child turned around and ran away. He never told anyone about it.

The next day, his parents found him hanging from a tree with a noose around his neck.

“I don’t want to talk about it”, said his father when questioned about the boy. His mother just cried silently.

The family moved away that night and never returned. The house was sold to a man named John Smith. He lived there for a few years until one day, he disappeared as well. No one knew what happened to him or why he left. Some say he was taken by the slender figure. Others say he just ran away from his problems.

Whatever the case may be, this house has been abandoned ever since and it is said that anyone who goes inside never comes out again…

### Introduction: The Slenderman is a tall, slim man with no eyes who wears a black suit and tie

The Slenderman is a tall, slim man with no eyes who wears a black suit and tie. He has long arms and legs and his height varies depending on the source material you are reading. Some say he is over eight feet tall while others claim that he is only about six or seven feet tall. No matter what size he actually is, The Slenderman always looks creepy due to his lack of facial features such as eyes or eyebrows. He usually appears in dark places such as forests, abandoned buildings, or even cemeteries where there are no lights to illuminate them properly so that people can see clearly what they are looking at. This makes it easy for The Slenderman to sneak up on someone without being noticed until it’s too late!

### His origin is unknown and he stalks his prey with a black suit, tie, and an appearance similar to that of an ordinary person.

So in this crossover I want to take a look at how some of the StarCraft II races would handle or fight against Siren Head, and who they might team up with.

Siren Head is an unknown entity from the future who has an insatiable hunger for children. Raynor and Siren Head might seem like they're on opposite sides of the spectrum, but they have a few things in common. They both are powerful enemies, they can deal with threats that other people can't and they are also both able to take out alien forces.
Raynor would fight against Siren Head for two reasons: 1. He's a hero who fights against the bad guys and 2. he wants to save children from a terrible fate. In this case, Raynor might have some help with other heroes like Richtofen or even the Overwatch agents.

## Description

For the past few years, the Starcraft universe has been a lot less than popular. But you'd be surprised to find out there are still many who love it, and still play the game!

Here at The Backrooms we love all sorts of things, and when I came across some awesome custom maps for the game Starcraft 2, I decided that I'd like to share them with all of you. So here they are!

You can expect some more interesting stuff in the future, so be sure to check back from time to time.

This project is still very new, but there is a lot planned for it, so don't worry if you think that this won't get updated enough.
