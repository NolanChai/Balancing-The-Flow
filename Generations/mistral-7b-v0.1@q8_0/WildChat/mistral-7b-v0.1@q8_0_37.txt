I was just looking through the archives and I saw that when we first started out on the forum there were hardly any posts per month. I wonder what the top posters of old are doing these days...
I'm in the 50k range now but it took me a long time to get here. The funny thing is I've been reading these threads since I was about 12 and was in them as well when I turned 13. Back then this place was so dead I could literally post a thread with 5 words in it, and by the next day it would have more than 40 views

I am not sure why, but it seems like there are less people that lookback 31293 min ago !
