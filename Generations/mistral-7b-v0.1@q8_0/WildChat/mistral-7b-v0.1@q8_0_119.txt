Kaveh: "Nilou! Where are you?"

Collei: "Hey, Kaveh! What's wrong with her daughter? Why is she crying like that? Doesn't Nilou know how to take care of her daughter properly?"

Tighnari: "I think so. But there's nothing wrong with the baby - except for the fact that she was born prematurely while practicing for the upcoming festival."

Alhaitham: "What? You mean to say, she was practicing for the upcoming festival while giving birth?"

Tighnari: "Yes. And we still don't know why Nilou is gone, and her daughter has been left alone on stage. She could be injured or even dead."

Kaveh: "I think so too, Alhaitham. I mean, what if she was killed by someone?"

Collei: "Yes. Someone might have killed Nilou and kidnapped her daughter Indigo."

Alhaitham: "That's the truth. We need to find out who did this so that we can save Nilou and Indigo - and stop whoever was responsible for this from committing this kind of crime again!"
