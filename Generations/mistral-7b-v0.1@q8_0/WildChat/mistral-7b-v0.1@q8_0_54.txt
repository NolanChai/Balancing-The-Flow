The mission will start with CJ being outside his house when he recieves a phone call from Sweet, asking him to pick up his brother OG Loc at the airport. CJ drives his car to the airport and there picks up Loc who then tells CJ that they have a lot of respectful men in the game. After they leave the airport, CJ gets a call from Carl Johnson (the main character of GTA: San Andreas) telling him he needs to pick up T-Bone Mendez at the airport, who has just arrived from Liberty City. CJ picks up T-Bone and they both go back to Carl's house, where OG Loc is waiting for them with a beer in his hand. CJ asks what's going on and OG tells him that T-Bone wants to start a gang in San Andreas called the respectful men. T-Bone says he will pay well for each mission they complete. After the conversation, OG Loc gets up from the table and goes to his room, where he will be playing video games all day long. CJ then talks with Carl and T-Bone about their first mission and that is to buy a car wash so that they have a place to do business. The next scene shows T-Bone buying a car wash from some guy in a green suit and the game continues.
