prologue:

Zombie: (I am so hungry! I wish that the human race was not so annoying. If i had food then my life would be so much easier. Sigh if only i could think of a way to get rid of them without being noticed but alas nothing is ever easy in life.)

Robot: (why is it that the humans never want to help us! Why can’t we have a better life like the humans do?)

Freedom planet:

Bf: (Hey, it looks like there are some humans in the forest! Maybe they have food, and if so i am so going with them.)

Gf: (Don’t go bf, you will be killed by them!)

Bf: (It doesn’t look like they can see us.)

(They were right, they were being hunted!)

Zombie: (There are humans in the forest! And they are not alone there is also some weird robots with them, I don’t know what they are but they sure seem to be human allies. Why? They don’t deserve food.)

(They were being chased by zombies and other mutants)

Lilac: (Where did these things come from?)

Millia: (I hope we can get away from them before they catch us.)

Gf: (Bf! Run!)

Carol: (Yes, let’s go!)

(they escaped but were being followed)

Robot 2: (Looks like the humans are running, maybe we should call for help?)

Robot: (You are right robot 1, I will tell them what is happening.)

Zombie 3: (I don’t know what to do! What if they get away from us before we kill them? What then? We won’t have any food!)

Zombie 2: (We need to find a way to get them.)

(They were being chased by robots and zombies, what should they do?)

Fun game. The main issue I had with the game was that there was no sound. Other then that it was a fun experience.

Nice graphics! Fun gameplay. I was able to win with Boyfriend and Girlfriend without dying a single time :P

It's a shame that the music wasn't working on my browser (and probably everyone elses). You might want to check that out for next time!

Really fun game! I love it when there is a nice mix of action and strategy. Great job!

This was an interesting concept, although the combat itself wasn't much more than just randomly clicking the mouse button as fast as I could until it was over. The visuals were pretty good, and overall this was a fun game to play!

The music wasn't working for me but the graphics looked nice. I included it in part 1 of my Ludum Dare 32 compilation video series, if you’d like to check it out :) https://youtu.be/zRhHqjX9BZQ

## Mini Submission FAQ

CAN I ENTER BOTH EVENTS?: You should pick 1 event, whichever you think it’ll do better in. If the idea is strong, and everything plays well enough, you can go Compo. If you’re a perfectionist, and would prefer people to play a more polished game, do the Jam. Historically, more games are entered in the Compo, but with more people and more time, Jam games have the potential to be better (that doesn’t mean they are). Many solo participants do enter the Jam.

If you made 2 games, unfortunately, the website doesn’t support multiple submissions per user. To submit your 2nd game, you will have to make a 2nd account. Only do this if you made 2 games. Alternatively, if one game is better than the other, then consider just entering the better game.

CAN I KEEP WORKING UNTIL THE DEADLINE?: Yes! Immediately after the 48 or 72 hours, we do something called Submission Hour. As the name suggests, it’s an extra hour for you to package, upload, and submit your games. If there were catastrophic issues trying submitting your game, or you misunderstood how submissions work, that’s okay. It happens. We’re flexible. If you need advice, check with the folks on IRC. If you need an admin, get in touch.

PORTS: Ports to other platforms can be done after the deadline. That said, the sooner you finish your port, the sooner people can play your game, improving your chances of placing in the final results. For best results, provide a Web version of your game, or a Windows version with no dependencies. Also be sure to rate at least 20 games to improve your visibility (Coolness).

NOT LOGGED IN?: If you get a message about not being logged in, even though you are, it’s because your web browser cached the non-logged in page. You can fix this by either refreshing your cache or clearing your cache. CTRL+F5 in many browsers. Chrome is a bit more work. Press F12 to enable Developer Mode, then you can right click on the refresh button and select “Empty Cache and Hard Reload”. This option is unavailable if you are not in Developer Mode.

In this part of the story, after they woke up, they saw a lot of robots running in their direction. So, BF told them to get inside the building to avoid them. After entering, they saw a note saying “You will be able to escape from the robots if you do 300 push ups and 100 pullups”. The first task was so easy because all of them are in great shape, except for Milli. But, after doing that, there were more notes:

- 12 burpees
- 50 jumping jacks
- 100 crunches
- 40 push ups

They finished those exercises and the last note was “To escape from the building, you will need to open a door on the left side”. As soon as they opened it, there were more robots. But BF said:

“Let’s go outside, maybe we can run away!”

And after that, they went out and saw a big robot with many guns (a tank) shooting them from all directions! But somehow they made it to the other side of the city.

The third part of my favorite new survival game, where the heroes of the famous series Sonic the hedgehog (with their friends) had to find a way to survive the apocalypse after an infection from robots and zombies. Now they will have to save the world from Dr. Igman, who wants to use a virus for evil purposes, but who will be able to stop him? The game is very interesting and has many surprises.

(This is a fanfic for freedom planet. But it’s set in the fnf universe with zombies and robots taking over earth.)

Milla stood there in shock. It was so different than the dream she had last night, but it didn’t take long for her to realise what this meant. She needed to tell everyone else about this as well. They might be able to stop the apocalypse. Milla decided to head back to her house and grab a phone. When she got there she realised something else. The robots had already taken over her home town, the one thing that made her feel safe.

“Dad! Dad! Wake up!” She shook him awake as he was still in bed. “Get out of here now. Robots are coming. We need to leave.”
“What? What do you mean?” He got out of bed and looked around, but there was nothing except a small note on the table. It said: Dear John, I am going to make sure that everything is ok and you will be fine. Do not worry. Please take care of Milla as I cannot stay here anymore. Love, your wife.

He looked at her. “Milla! What happened?” He hugged her and then took a phone out of the drawer. She saw that it was already turned on but he had no signal. “I need to call Carol. She’s going to tell everyone else about this too.” Then they heard sirens go off in the background and knew they didn’t have much time left before the robots took them as well.

(Milla is a 13 year old girl who lives with her dad in a small town near the coastline.)

this is my first story on this site and it's very fun to write. if you want i can put a story of zombie apocalypse for the next story so please comment and tell me what you think about my story (my english is not perfect) also sorry if my story doesn't make sense, it's because i have a lot of ideas in this story that sometimes confuses me.

Boyfriend was waiting with the gun on his hand, he had been waiting for hours to be honest but now, after he saw the door open and the zombies came inside the room, he went inside ready to shoot all of them down.

He started shooting with both guns and killed every single zombie that entered the house, one by one until they stopped coming in and he was left alone in the room.

He heard the girl's voice but she didn't talk so he ran outside to find out where was she, it had been some time since he shot them all down so the chances that they were still alive were very low but still, he had to look around to find her and when he did, he found her laying on the floor unconscious, with a big cut in her throat, the zombies must have attacked her before he could help.

He ran to his girlfriend and saw that she was breathing so he picked her up and carried her back inside, he laid her down on the couch and started cleaning the wound with water and alcohol but then suddenly his phone started ringing so he had to leave her there because if he didn't answer it would be too late for them both.

He took out his phone from his pocket and saw that it was a video call from Boyfriend, he answered quickly before the call ended and when he saw him on screen, he noticed something strange about him but didn't know what exactly because there were many things going around in his head at once so he just asked "What's wrong?"

"I have to tell you something very important," Boyfriend said as if it was a secret. "We need to meet somewhere safe as soon as possible."

"Where should we go?" asked Boyfriend because he didn't know where would be safest for them both but then again, he knew that if they weren't going to find a place like that then there wouldn't be any other option than running away from all these zombies.

"I have an idea," said Boyfriend as he looked around his room and saw something on the floor. "There is an old military base nearby that could work if we can get inside."

He hung up the phone without saying anything else because they both knew what needed to be done next so they started walking towards the place while trying not to make any noise, it was very hard for them but eventually they found themselves inside of a big building that seemed empty except for some old furniture in one corner and when they got close enough they saw something strange inside a room with no doors or windows: A lot of guns and ammunition stacked up against each other forming a huge pile on the floor which meant there was probably another exit somewhere else besides this one.

They both looked at each other for a moment before looking back at all these weapons lying around them because it seemed like an opportunity they couldn't miss so Boyfriend started shooting bullets everywhere as if he wanted to test out how powerful his new toy was and then suddenly two people came out from behind the door with guns aimed right at both of their heads.

Boyfriend looked scared for a moment but quickly recovered himself because there was no way that these guys could kill them, they were much stronger than him and he knew it so he shot back without any hesitation until one of them fell down on the floor while holding his stomach in pain because the bullet had hit him right through his ribs and into his heart.

The other guy seemed shocked by what happened but didn't seem too worried about dying either because he was already wounded himself so Boyfriend kept shooting at him until he finally fell down too without making any noise which meant that they were both dead now except for Boyfriend who was standing there looking around with his gun ready to fire again if necessary.

"What do we do next?" asked Boyfriend as he looked over at Girlfriend and saw that she had been watching everything since the beginning even though she didn't say anything, she just stared at him without any expression on her face which made him feel uncomfortable because he wasn't used to seeing people staring at him like this.

"We need a way out of here," said Boyfriend before turning around and walking towards another door that looked like it could lead somewhere else but when he opened it, there was nothing inside except for some boxes filled with old books so they both went back into the room where all these weapons were still lying on the floor and started looking around until they finally found an exit leading outside.

It had been a while since they last saw each other so Girlfriend wanted to spend some time together before leaving this place forever but Boyfriend didn't seem too interested in doing that because he just kept staring at her with his gun pointed right at her head as if he was about to kill her if she tried anything stupid.

"Come on," said Boyfriend after looking around one last time and seeing nothing else left for them there except for death so they both walked towards the exit while holding hands until suddenly Girlfriend stopped moving because something strange had just happened behind them: A giant robot appeared out of nowhere right in front of them!

"What is that thing?" asked Boyfriend as he looked at it with his gun pointed right at its head but before he could shoot it, it started moving towards them and then suddenly grabbed him by the neck without even making a sound which meant that it had some kind of special ability or weapon that allowed it to move silently.

Boyfriend was trying hard not to scream out loud because this thing was too powerful for him but eventually he couldn't hold back anymore so he let out a scream that echoed through the whole place and then suddenly something else happened behind them: A huge group of zombies started coming from all directions towards where they were standing!

"Shit!" screamed Boyfriend before grabbing Girlfriend by the arm and trying to pull her away but it was too late because there were already so many zombies around them now that even if he tried his best, he wouldn't be able to save both of their lives.

"What should we do?" asked Girlfriend as she looked at all these zombies coming towards them from every direction while Boyfriend kept looking back at the robot behind him and saw that it was still holding on to his neck with one hand while pointing its gun at him with the other so he tried pushing it away but couldn't do anything because it was too powerful for him.

"We have no choice," said Boyfriend as he looked around them again and saw that there were already too many zombies coming towards them from all directions now, it wouldn't be long until they would all get killed by those things! "We need to run!"

He grabbed Girlfriend's arm once more before starting running away with her but soon enough the robot behind him caught up and started following them again while pointing its gun at his head so he tried pushing it away once more but this time it was too late because one of those zombies finally got close enough to bite him on the neck!

"No!" screamed Boyfriend before turning around just in time to see a bullet hit him right through his eye and kill him instantly. Girlfriend looked back at what had happened for a moment but didn't seem too surprised or sad because she already knew what was going to happen next: The zombies would eventually catch up with them both and then they would all get killed together by those things!

She just stood there staring at Boyfriend's body for a while until suddenly something strange happened behind her again: A huge group of robots appeared out of nowhere right in front of them!

"What is that thing?" asked Girlfriend as she looked at it with her gun pointed right at its head but before she could shoot it, it started moving towards her and then suddenly grabbed her by the neck without even making a sound which meant that it had some kind of special ability or weapon that allowed it to move silently too!

Girlfriend tried screaming out loud but couldn't do anything because this thing was too powerful for her now so instead she just closed her eyes and waited until something happened behind them: A huge group of zombies started coming from all directions towards where they were standing now!

She just stood there looking at everything around her without saying anything while waiting for something bad to happen again but soon enough it did: One of those robots caught up with her and then grabbed her by the neck before pointing its gun right at her head so she tried pushing it away once more but this time it was too late because one of those zombies finally got close enough to bite her on the arm!

"No!" screamed Girlfriend before turning around just in time to see a bullet hit her right through her eye and kill her instantly. She had already accepted that both their lives were going to end soon but now, she was forced to watch everything happen in front of her without being able to do anything about it which made her feel even more sad than she already felt before!

She just stood there staring at Boyfriend's body for a while until suddenly something strange happened behind her again: A huge group of robots appeared out of nowhere right in front of them once more!

This game is so long. It's actually fun after you get used to the controls. There was a point where I couldn't progress through the game because I didn't know how to jump or shoot (I thought that they would be assigned as buttons like in the previous games). When I finally figured out that it was arrow keys, I was able to complete this game.

The animation and music were nice too!

Great job on the character animations. They are super fluid, which is a huge accomplishment for an FNF game.

I had some issues with the controls. The movement is a bit slow, and I couldn't jump (just like Poke-Gamer). It took me a long time to figure out that I needed to press spacebar instead of just clicking it.

The gameplay is fun, but I wasn't too sure about what was happening during the first few minutes. I also struggled with the combat mechanics. There are no instructions on how you should fight off your enemies, so I had to figure them out by trial and error. I think if I knew that I should aim up at my enemies and shoot at them until they were dead, this game would have been much more fun to play.

I also found the soundtrack very repetitive. After a few minutes, it started grating on me. Perhaps some additional tracks would help make the experience less jarring.

Overall, though, great job! I love the FNF series and am always happy to see new entries in the genre.

It's not your fault that you couldn't play because of a bug, but I do have to say this game has some pretty awful controls and very unforgiving difficulty. The music is the best thing about the game, and even that gets annoying after a while. The animations are nice though, so at least there is one positive aspect to this game

# [CATEGORIES]

## Survival

This category is for those who like to play survival games, in which you must kill as many zombies as possible. It's a little bit hard in the beginning but it gets easier over time. The first level is very easy so if you want to get used to the gameplay then try that one out before going on to harder levels.

## Boyfriend

This category is for those who like to play with the boyfriend as their character instead of one of the girls (you can choose between them all). The main difference between this category and survival is that you're not required to kill any zombies, so it doesn't matter how many there are around you. All you have to do is complete each level without getting killed by them or falling into a pit full of spikes (which will happen if your health bar reaches zero).

## Girlfriends

This category contains all the levels where you play as one of the girlfriends instead of Boyfriend himself (you can choose between them all). The main difference between this category and survival is that you're not required to kill any zombies, so it doesn't matter how many there are around you.
