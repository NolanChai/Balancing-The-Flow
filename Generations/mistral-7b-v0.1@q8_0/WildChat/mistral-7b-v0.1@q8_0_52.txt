I think this is a pretty interesting question. I've been seeing a lot of comments about how Demon Slayer is getting heat for its use of the rising sun flag but Golden Kamuy seems to be getting away with it.

For those that don't know, the "rising sun flag" is the Imperial Japanese Flag from around WW2 (1936-1945). It's a red flag with a white circle and rays in the middle. This is different than the current Japanese flag which doesn't have any rays on it.

There was some backlash for using this symbolism in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, but Golden Kamuy seems to be getting off without a hitch even though it uses the rising sun flag pretty often and has characters with an association with Japanese imperialist army. I think this is because there's not enough attention being placed on this issue, or maybe because Golden Kamuy isn't as popular as Demon Slayer?

I just find it interesting how some shows get away with stuff like this and others don't. What do you think?

If it was just "Ranking of Kings", then it would be easier to explain it.
However, Golden Kamuy is a big problem because it's not a fantasy but historical fiction and there are also many Koreans who have watched the series and complained about the portrayal of Japan's occupation of Sakhalin.
The controversy over Ranking of Kings is only being made to seem like an issue because of Golden Kamuy, and the controversy over Golden Kamuy is being ignored as if it doesn't exist at all.

It seems that people are only looking at Japan's occupation of Korea or Sakhalin when it comes to historical issues regarding Asian countries and not bothering to look into the fact that China was also occupied by the Japanese during WWII, so the controversy surrounding Golden Kamuy isn't just limited to Japan's occupation of Sakhalin.
It's clear that this is a problem with Japanese people in general, but I want to know what you think about it.
