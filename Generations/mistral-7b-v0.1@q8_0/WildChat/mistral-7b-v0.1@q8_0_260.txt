[Sonic the Hedgehog]
-Sonic walks into a bar.
-The bartender looks at him with an expression of disbelief.
-Sonic: "Yo, I'll take one of those Sonic the Hedgehogs."
-Bartender: "Huh?!"
-Sonic: "That Sonic the Hedgehog drink right there, that's what I want."
-Bartender: "Son--"
-Sonic: "And get me a shot of that Knuckles too! And a Bloody Maria."
-Bartender: "Knuckle--"
-Sonic: "And another Sonic the Hedgehog drink, make it double. You can call it a Tails if you want."
-Bartender: "No, no, wait--"
-Sonic: "You can do it, I know you can!"
-The bartender turns away for a moment and pours two drinks. He hands them over to Sonic, who downs them in one go.
-Bartender: "What the hell is wrong with you?!? You're gonna drink all my liquor!"
-Sonic: "Sorry, I'm just really thirsty."
-The bartender looks at him suspiciously and begins to move away. Sonic puts his hand on the bartender's shoulder.
-Sonic: "Hey, hey. Don't you recognize me?"
-Bartender: "Of course I do. You're that asshole who always orders Sonic drinks. What do you want now?"
-Sonic: "Oh, nothing much. Just some money."
-Bartender: "Money? Hah! You can forget about it!"
-Sonic: "You mean to tell me that I come in here every day and order all of your Sonic the Hedgehog drinks for free?"
-Bartender: "That's right, you do. Now get outta here."
-Sonic: "Fine then! I'll just take them all with me!"
-The bartender sighs and moves to the end of the bar where there are two large crates. He opens one of them and takes out a bunch of Sonic the Hedgehog drinks. He hands them over to Sonic, who stacks them on top of each other until they reach his head.
-Sonic: "Thanks, I'll just take these."
-Bartender: "You're not taking those! They're mine!"
-Sonic: "Oh? And why is that?"
-Bartender: "Well, I ordered them. That makes them mine!"
-Sonic: "Does it now?"
-Bartender: "Yes, yes it does."
-Sonic: "So what happens if I don't give you the money?"
-Bartender: "I'll call the cops."
-Sonic: "And what will they do?"
-Bartender: "They'll arrest you for stealing!"
-Sonic: "And what will happen then?"
-Bartender: "You'll go to jail. And you won't have any money to pay your lawyer, and you'll die in prison!"
-Sonic: "Oh really? Well, that sounds like a pretty good deal! I guess I'll just take all of the Sonic drinks then!"
-Bartender: "But--"
-Sonic: "No buts about it! Here comes Sonic the Hedgehog!"
-The bartender looks at him, shocked. He shakes his head and walks away, leaving Sonic to finish off all of the Sonic drinks he'd ordered. After a few hours, Sonic staggers back into the bar. The bartender looks over at him with disgust.
-Bartender: "What do you want now? More Sonic drinks?"
-Sonic: "No, no... I just came in to see if you had any Knuckles."
-The bartender looks around, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small bottle of Knuckles. He hands it over to Sonic who puts it back in his pocket.
-Bartender: "That's all I got left."
-Sonic: "Oh... thanks..."
-The bartender nods, then turns around and walks away. Sonic follows him out of the bar.
-Outside, the bartender gets into his car and starts driving off. Suddenly, he slams on the brakes. He gets out of the car and runs back inside. The door shuts behind him, leaving Sonic alone in the street. A few minutes later, the police arrive and arrest Sonic for stealing the Knuckles bottle. They put him in jail, where he dies.
-In the end, everyone learns a valuable lesson: Never steal from Sonic!
