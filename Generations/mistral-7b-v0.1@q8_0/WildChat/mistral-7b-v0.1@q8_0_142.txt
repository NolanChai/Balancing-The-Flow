As we all know, the academic world is notoriously difficult to enter. In many places around the world, people tend to regard the PhD as an impassable wall that few manage to pass through, and the idea of doing one seems to be reserved for only a very small group of lucky people, while most students are discouraged from thinking about it at all.

That’s why this book was written. It’s for everyone who is considering getting a PhD, or even just curious about what it entails and how they could get involved in research. I hope that it will help you think through your motivations to do a doctorate; help you decide if it’s something you would want to pursue and, if so, give you an idea of some of the things to consider before you make your decision and as you embark on the journey.

Throughout this book, I will use the word “you” as in “You should try to do X,” or “You must learn about Y.” In each case, “you” is intended to mean anyone who wants to pursue a doctorate. You should not feel that these instructions are directed at you personally, unless of course they resonate with you, in which case please feel free to consider them carefully and think about how you might be able to implement them in your own situation.

## Chapter 1: Why Do a PhD?

Before we begin looking at some of the key points of doing a PhD, I would like you to take some time to reflect on what your own motivations are for wanting to pursue this kind of research.

What is it that attracts you to this kind of work? Are there particular aspects that appeal more than others? For example:

- Do you want to be able to do independent research?
- Are there certain subjects or disciplines that interest you?
- How much do you want to work alone versus in collaboration with others?
- Is it important for you to get paid while doing the PhD or are other benefits more important than a salary (e.g., gaining experience)?
- Do you have any personal reasons for wanting to pursue research?

These questions can help you decide if there might be alternative ways of achieving your goals, such as by working on another project or in another environment that may better suit what it is that attracts you about doing a PhD.

Once you’ve thought about the motivations for yourself, I would like to offer my own thoughts on why someone should consider doing a doctorate:

- To become an expert in their field of study
- To work with others who share their interests and are also committed to advancing knowledge
- To have access to resources that help them learn more about their field (such as libraries)
- To gain experience in research and writing
- To expand their knowledge base by reading new literature on topics related to what they’re studying
- To develop critical thinking skills so that they can evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different ideas
- To be able to teach others what they have learned through presenting at conferences, publishing articles or books based on their research findings, etc.

Of course there are other reasons why someone might want to pursue a doctorate; these are just some examples that come immediately to mind for me when I think about my own experience with this kind of work. But I also have one final reason which is perhaps less tangible but still very important: because it feels right!

There are many factors that go into deciding if pursuing a doctorate is the right decision for you and your life goals (and we’ll talk about those later), but there’s no denying that some people simply have an innate desire to do this type of work. If you feel called to research, then it may be worth considering all the aspects listed above as well as others in order to see if they resonate with your own experience and interests.

## Chapter 2: The Benefits Of A PhD

So why do a PhD? Well, first of all there are many different reasons people choose to pursue a doctoral degree. Some people want to become professors at universities while others simply enjoy learning about their field and want an advanced level of knowledge in it. But regardless of why you decide that this is something you would like to do, I’m going to explain some benefits of doing one:

- You will be able to advance your career by becoming an expert in the subject matter which can open up new opportunities for jobs or promotions within the same industry
- A PhD gives you more options when applying for jobs because employers recognize that you have taken time out from work or school (or both) in order to pursue this higher level of education. This shows dedication and commitment that many companies are looking for in potential employees
- It allows you to expand your network by meeting others who share similar interests as well as those with whom you may not have much contact otherwise due to geographic location or other factors
- You can learn about research methods used by academics so if this is something you would like to do later on, then it’s good practice!
- There are also many benefits for society at large since having more people with higher levels of education leads to increased innovation and knowledge creation which in turn improves the quality of life for everyone.
- A PhD can provide personal satisfaction by allowing one to feel like they have achieved something significant and that their hard work was worth it. This is especially important if you’re trying to make up for lost time or opportunities after dropping out of college early on due to financial constraints, family responsibilities etc…
- You will be able to contribute more meaningfully within your field once you have completed all the requirements because now there are fewer barriers in terms of accessing resources such as libraries where researchers go when looking up information related specifically toward their research topic.
- If you’re interested in teaching then having a PhD gives you the credentials needed for most universities which means that you can get paid doing something that interests you while still earning an income!

These are just some of the many reasons why people choose to pursue this type of education, but if any sound appealing to you then I encourage you to look into whether it’s something worth considering further.

## Chapter 3: How To Find A Doctorate Program?

So how do we go about finding a doctoral program that will suit our needs? The first thing is to ask ourselves what kind of research interests us, and where would be the best place for us to carry it out. Some people want to study in their home country while others are keen on exploring opportunities abroad. It’s important not only because of the language barrier but also due to cultural differences that may affect one’s experience with studying overseas.

Another thing worth considering is whether or not there are any specific requirements from potential students such as having an undergraduate degree from a particular university etc., which can help narrow down options even further. For example, if you have been accepted into an MBA program at Harvard Business School (HBS), then it would make sense for those who want to pursue this kind of work in management consulting or investment banking rather than opting for another field like biology instead!

Once we know where our interests lie and what kind of doctorate programs we’re looking into, the next step is finding out how much funding each university offers its students. There are many sources of information on this topic but I recommend checking with your university first since they should be able to provide guidance based upon their experience as well as current funding opportunities within their department(s).

## Chapter 4: What Are The Requirements For Getting A PhD?

The requirements for getting a doctoral degree are different in every country. In the United States, you need to complete an undergraduate or graduate degree before applying to a PhD program. This is because most schools only admit students who have already completed some kind of higher education and want to continue with their studies on this level.

You also need to show that you are capable of doing research in your field by publishing articles in reputable journals during your time as a student at university; however, it’s important not to forget about other skills like writing essays or making presentations which will be very useful later on!

In addition, some universities may require applicants for doctoral programs who don’t already have any previous experience in their field to complete an internship before they can apply – this would involve working with professors from different departments within the university while still being a student there.

Some schools only allow candidates who have been accepted into their program first before applying; this is usually done by submitting transcripts of past coursework and writing samples, as well as letters of recommendation from teachers who know you well enough that they can vouch for your ability to succeed in the program. Other schools require students apply directly through their website without any additional paperwork – this means it’s possible (though not guaranteed) for anyone with a good GPA and strong writing skills to get into one of these universities!

## Chapter 5: What Are The Skills Needed For A PhD?

Now that we have looked at some of the key points of doing a doctorate, it’s time to consider what kind of person is suited for this type of work. I think you will find that most people who pursue this level of education have certain traits in common which make them well-suited for their chosen career path and also allow them to be successful when they enter into it:

- They are able to learn quickly so as not only can they keep up with the latest research but also contribute new ideas themselves. This requires someone who is adaptable, flexible, and open minded enough to embrace change – especially if things don’
