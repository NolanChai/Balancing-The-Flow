Natsuki: “Hmm…” [INBK]

Monika: “Come on, Natsuki. You in?”

Natsuki: “I-I’m not sure I want to play, Moni. If it’s a truth question…what if it asks who I like best of all the girls? I might tell the truth!”

Monika: “Awwwww…you’re sweet.” (grabbing Natsuki in a hug)

Natsuki: “Mmmmph! Let go, Moni! I-I mean, you know I like you best, so if I get asked that question, I don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings!”

Monika: “Oh, Natsuki. You are so sweet and considerate…” (still holding her tight)

Natsuki: “Ahhhhh! Moni! Stop it!”

Sayori: “Hey, I think MC is here.” [/INBK
