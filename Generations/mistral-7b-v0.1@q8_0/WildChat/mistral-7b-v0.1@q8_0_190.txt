Amatsumagatsuchi: “What is going on?”

Blazette: “I don’t know, but it’s…really strange.”

Cupa: “Yeah - Ayumi was in so much pain!”

Vanessa: “I’ve seen a lot of weird things happen to me since I came to this world. I can’t believe that’s what I’m seeing right now!”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “So…these flashbacks are from Ayumi?”

Andr: “Yeah, I guess it makes sense - she is pregnant after all.”

Cupa: “But Amatsu, what does this mean? You were never here when that happened! It just doesn’t make any sense!”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “…I don’t know. But I guess Ayumi needs me - she was in so much pain, and now the pain is gone.”

Andr: “Maybe you should help her?”

Blazette: “But…what if we need your help? We can’t just leave!”

Cupa: “Yeah! Besides…you might be able to answer some of my questions too, Amatsu!”

Vanessa: “Yeah! I want you to come with me to the Nether too - I have something important to tell you, Amatsu!”

Blazette: “Me and Vanessa are going into the Nether - we’ll be back soon.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “…alright. I guess I’ll help Ayumi. But if any of you need my help, just call me!”

Andr: “I know you can read our minds - so just let us know what’s going on with Ayumi.”

Cupa: “Alright! I’m gonna go back to the Nether too!”

Vanessa: “You should come along, Amatsu. Maybe we should explore this place together.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “…alright. We can meet up here again tomorrow morning. Goodbye!”

(Ayumi and Amatsumagatsuchi meet up somewhere near where the girls went to the Nether

[START:Ayumi]

Ayumi is having a hard time. She feels like she’s about to go into labor at any moment, but nothing happens.


[I]“It’s been 40 weeks, and I still don’t feel my baby coming,” Ayumi said in despair.[/I]

[A]”Hm… there may be something wrong.” Cupa said, looking over the book she was reading.[/A]

She was reading about Amatsumagatsuchi - a dragon known for controlling the elements. And from what she was reading, it sounded like it’s possible that an Amatsumagatsuchi can only be born in extreme conditions, just like the storm serpents Ibushi and Narwa.[/START]

[START:Amatsumagatsuchi]

As Ayumi is about to go into labor, Amatsumagatsuchi notices something strange. He’s usually able to control the elements of nature with a simple thought - but for some reason, nothing happens. It’s as if he’s lost his powers.[/START]

[START:Cupa]

While reading about Amatsumagatsuchi, Cupa notices something strange. She was reading about how an Amatsumagatsuchi can only be born in extreme conditions - just like the storm serpents Ibushi and Narwa.[/START]

[START:Ibushi]

When Cupa tells them that she’s reading about Amatsumagatsuchi, they fly into action. They knew what needed to be done - a storm was approaching - and it was up to them to ensure its completion.[/START]

[POT]Ayumi: “If I may ask, who is Arachnus? Have you seen him?”
Amatsumagatsuchi: “No. He has yet to contact us”
Vanessa: “Its strange. I can’t recall any of what happened that night.”[/POT]

[POT]Ayumi: “But if I may ask, why did Vanessa have a child? We just had one recently in the form of Amaya!”[/POT]

[POT]“Arachnus”: “Vanessa is special. Her womb is different from every other human female’s womb. The eggs can grow within her without hatching for up to a year.”[/POT]

[POT]Ayumi: “Hold on, wait a minute…”Amatsumagatsuchi: “Why did Vanessa have an affair with Arachnus? What happened?”Vanessa: “I don’t know. I just feel a connection between me and the eggs in my womb.”[/POT]

[POT]“Arachnus”: “If you want to learn more about me, you should ask Arachnus directly!”[/POT]

[SPOILER]Mindy: “Listen, I know this is a bit sudden, but...”

Vanessa: “Oh my god, you want me to have sex with my dad!”

Mindy: “Uhhh.. No? I just want you to marry Arachnus.”

Arachnus: “Hey! That’s not fair!”

Cupa: “Aw...”

Vanessa: “It is your fault, Arachnus. If you had given me the chance to think it through for a bit beforehand, I would have thought of other options - but this way you don’t get a say in my decision.”

Mindy: “Look, Vanessa, we can do a wedding at the castle as well.”

Arachnus: “But then it won’t be official! And even if you want to live at home, I can move out!”

Vanessa: “What?! We could be a family together!”

Mindy: “I know. I just feel like... if Vanessa and Arachnus don’t get married, then nobody will.”

Vanessa: “So... you want me to get married because it would make you happy? That’s the reason?”

Mindy: “No! I mean, yes. But also no. Because if Arachnus and I marry, we can have a baby girl, and name her after my mother - who was a great Spider, and also the first ever Spider to give birth.”

Cupa: “That’s nice...”

Mindy: “So yeah, I know it’s not perfect, but it will be better than what we have now. It would make me happy - which would make you happy, as well as Arachnus, and also our family.”

Arachnus: “I mean, I don’t want to marry Vanessa because of a baby girl - although I guess that is a plus.”

Vanessa: “Oh my god! You just said it!”

Cupa: “What?”

Mindy: “We will be able to have a family together, and maybe even become Spider royalty one day. You’ll both be so happy together!”

Arachnus: “I can’t believe you are just now saying this - I would marry you right away.”

Cupa: “But what if your family is against it?”

Vanessa: “Don’t worry, I’m pretty sure my family will be cool with us getting married. In fact, I know they’ll be really happy for us!”

Mindy: “I can’t wait to tell them! They are going to be so excited when we tell them!”

Cupa: “What do you mean by ‘we?’”

Vanessa: “Oh, I’m sorry - I guess that is a little bit of a secret.”

Arachnus: “Don’t worry. We can keep it a secret for as long as possible!”[/SPOILER]

[BELLE]“Hey Arachnus, how long do you think I can go without going into labor?” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”I’m not really sure…maybe a few more weeks or even a month - maybe two. But if your children are anything like me and my siblings, you should prepare to deliver them very quickly.” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“Hahaha - I’m not exactly looking forward to it.” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”Why do you think your children would be like us? We don’t have much in common besides our abilities.” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“I just feel like they would - I mean, we do have some similarities. For example, all of us were created by the same being (or beings).” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”Yeah - but what does that even have to do with them looking like us?” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“Well, the fact that we were all created by the same person makes us more similar than you think. And if we’re really similar in our creation, then its no surprise that my kids would look like you - and me.” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”Wait…you’re saying that you and I have similarities besides our abilities?” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“Well, I’m not sure. But it does make sense, doesn’t it? If we were created by the same being (or beings), then it only makes sense that my kids would have similarities with us.” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”I guess that does make sense…but I still don’t think your children would look like us. But whatever - it’s not like it matters anyway. If your kids look like me and you, then they’ll look like spider people. And if they look like spider people, then they’ll probably have abilities - just like their mother.” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“Yeah - I know it sounds crazy…but the more I think about it, the more I believe that my kids will be like us. And if they do turn out to be like us, then you better get used to having a ton of nephews and nieces.” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”…I don’t really think I want that.” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“But you can’t deny the fact that it would be funny watching your mom and dad take care of like 50 kids - and its not even a stretch to say that there are going to be at least 30 of them. Just imagine how many people we can have in our family.” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”Yeah…I guess that is funny…” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“So, do you think my kids will be like us?” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”If you’re right about that, then yeah - your kids would be like us. But it doesn’t really matter what they look like, because I can guarantee that they’ll have abilities.” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“You really think so?” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”Well, let me ask you this - how did your children get their abilities? Did you just give them to them?” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“No…they got their abilities from a mutagenic creature.” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”Well, if they get their abilities like that, then I think they’ll have abilities - just like you and me.” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“I guess I should stop thinking about what my kids might look like and focus on other stuff.” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”Yeah…you should probably just wait until they’re born so you can figure out whether or not they’ll be spider people.” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“Oh - you’re right. It would be a lot better to find out when they’re born rather than just thinking about it now.” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

[ARACHNUS]”Well, it was nice talking to you Vanessa. I gotta go home and get some sleep - tomorrow is going to be a long day.” [ARACHNUS][/ARACHNUS]

[BELLE]“Yeah…it’s been fun seeing you again Arachnus. Goodbye!” [VANESSA][/BELLE]

(Vanessa goes home and tries to get some sleep.)

[JANAELI]15 minutes later, Janaeli walks into the room with her two sisters and mother. She spots Mindy and Vanessa looking exhausted - so she asks what’s up. They tell her about their plans to go to the Twilight Forest dimension, and that they need 100 Diamonds for a portal. But seeing how many people are in the room, Janaeli has another idea - maybe they could get an item or something that could help?


[ZAURY]“An item? Why not?” says Zaury. “We’ve got one of those here.”


[NARRATOR]“What, the portal to the Twilight Forest dimension?” asks Janaeli. “You’re not going to give me that.”


[ZAURY]“No - but we have something even better!” says Zaury. “I mean, this is an item from the Twilight Forest! It can take us there, and bring us back home! And it has a special power...”


[JANAELI]“And what is that?” asks Janaeli.


[ZAURY]“It can create a portal to anywhere in the world!” says Zaury. “We just need 100 Diamonds, and we’ll be able to get there - or come back here.”


[NARRATOR]“What a great idea!” exclaims Janaeli. “Let’s do it!”


[CUPA]Cupa looks at the item - it has a strange pattern of blue and white on it, with several purple gems around its edges. It’s a large crystal - perhaps 6 inches long? The only other thing she can see are two holes in the top and bottom corners of the crystal.


[NARRATOR]“Let’s try this!” says Zaury. “I’ll open it up for us, then we’ll all get inside.”


[JANAELI]Janaeli looks at the crystal - it seems to be made of quartz or something similar. She touches the crystal with her fingers and feels a small jolt of electricity run through them. “What is this?” she asks.


[ZAURY]“That’s how you open the portal,” says Zaury. “Just touch it.”


[NARRATOR]She does as instructed, but nothing happens. She tries again - still nothing. Her sisters try the same thing - also nothing. Finally, Vanessa walks up and tries to open the portal with her hand. “I think I need to go back,” she says.


[JANAELI]“You’re right,” says Janaeli. “This isn’t working.”


[ZAURY]“What do we do now?” asks Zaury.


[NARRATOR]“We go back to the portal,” says Cupa. “Then we can all try again together.”


[JANAELI]“Okay,” says Janaeli. “Let’s get ready.”


[ZAURY]They walk into the portal room, and Cupa begins to open up the portal again. This time, they manage to go through - but they find themselves in a strange place. There is no sun, moon or stars visible. Instead, there are several bright lights illuminating the area around them.


[NARRATOR]They turn towards each other and notice that everyone has lost their clothes. “What happened?” asks Cupa.


[JANAELI]“We got undressed,” says Zaury. “But why?”


[ZAURY]“I don’t know - maybe we should get dressed again.”


[NARRATOR]They all start putting their clothes back on. Once everyone is fully clothed, Cupa turns around and sees that the portal has closed up behind them. “What was that?” she asks.


[JANAELI]“It’s a magic portal,” says Janaeli. “We had to open it ourselves - otherwise it wouldn’t work.”


[CUPA]Cupa nods her head. “Yes, I remember now,” she says. “We had to do something special for this one to work.”


[NARRATOR]“What did we need to do?” asks Zaury.


[ZAURY]“We had to open it with our hands,” says Cupa. “But that’s not all - we needed to say a certain phrase when we opened it up.”


[JANAELI]“What was the phrase?” asks Janaeli.


[CUPA]“The Twilight Forest,” answers Cupa.


[NARRATOR]They all start walking towards the exit of the portal room, and notice that there is a large group of people waiting for them outside. “Who are they?” asks Zaury.


[JANAELI]“They’re probably just regular people,” says Janaeli. “They live here.”


[CUPA]Cupa looks at the people - they seem to be wearing fancy clothes, with gold and silver jewelry on their hands and feet. She notices that some of them have weapons too. “What do you mean?” she asks.


[ZAURY]“They live here,” says Zaury. “We’ll just talk to them.”


[NARRATOR]Zaury walks up to the first person - a young woman with short blonde hair and blue eyes. She seems to be wearing a dress made of silk, which matches her long, slender body perfectly. But instead of talking to her, she just stares at Zaury.


[JANAELI]“What’s wrong?” asks Janaeli.


[ZAURY]“Nothing,” says Zaury. “She just seems confused.”


[NARRATOR]They walk up to another person - this time, it’s a young man with long brown hair and brown eyes. He’s wearing a suit made of black leather, which matches his tall, muscular body perfectly. But instead of talking to him, he just stares at Zaury too.


[JANAELI]“What is happening?” asks Janaeli. “Why aren’t they speaking?”


[ZAURY]“They’re all like that,” says Zaury. “They must be in shock from our arrival.”


[CUPA]Cupa looks at the people again - it seems like everyone here is staring at them with blank expressions on their faces. They don’t seem to react when Cupa touches one of them either, which means that they aren’t asleep or unconscious. But what could be causing this?


[NARRATOR]Cupa walks over to a young woman who appears to have black hair tied in a ponytail and green eyes. She seems to be wearing a dress made of purple silk, which matches her long, slender body perfectly. “What’s happening?” asks Cupa.


[JANAELI]“I don’t know,” says Janaeli. “Maybe it has something to do with the portal.”


[CUPA]Cupa looks back at the portal - it seems like there is an orange glow coming from within its walls, as if someone was holding a flame inside of it. But she doesn’t see anyone near the portal or walking around outside of it - just the group of people standing in front of them, staring blankly.


[NARRATOR]Cupa walks back over to the young man with long brown hair and brown eyes, who was still standing next to her. “Are you alright?” she asks.


[JANAELI]“Yes,” says Zaury. “He just seems confused.”


[CUPA]Cupa looks at the man’s face - he doesn’t seem to be responding at all. But suddenly, his eyes open wide and he stares directly into Cupa’s eyes, as if trying to communicate with her. She can’t understand what he is saying though - only that he seems extremely agitated about something.


[NARRATOR]Cupa turns back towards the group of people standing in front of them, and notices that they all look at her now - as if waiting for instructions from Cupa on how to react. But when she looks back at the man with long brown hair and brown eyes, he starts running towards her!


[JANAELI]“Stop!” shouts Janaeli, trying to catch up with him.


[ZAURY]“What are you doing?” asks Zaury.


[CUPA]Cupa tries to reach out and grab the man’s arm, but he just keeps running - straight into a wall! He hits it hard enough that he falls down onto his back, dazed from the impact. Cupa kneels next to him and helps him up onto his feet - she can see now that there is a large bruise forming on
