The Mini Fridge is used to store cold drinks and ice cubes in the canteen at my son’s school. So we need a quick replacement of this mini freezer before any major incident takes place. I was looking for 3-4 models with almost same specifications, and had shortlisted these two models based on price, features, brand reputation etc…

I finally selected Haier HBF28010V-G Mini Freezer (Rs.6,900) as the best one as it is available for a price of Rs.5,900. The only reason I went for this model was because the same freezer with 3 star rating costs more than Rs.8K whereas 2 star freezers are in Rs.6-7k range.

I am not sure whether it is worth to get a 3 star rated freezer just for an extra star of efficiency, especially if there is a significant price difference of Rs.2000-2500?

Please suggest…
