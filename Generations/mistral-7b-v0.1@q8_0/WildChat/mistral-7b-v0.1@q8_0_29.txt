Hi @bayan ,

The answer to this question varies a lot depending on various factors. For example, the size of the company and the job role that you’re applying to. I can only give you a rough idea for the fields that you have mentioned in your question. Please do note that the following figures are in Egyptian Pounds (EGP) and not in US Dollars:

- A Data Scientist would make on average around 45K EGP/month. This figure is going to vary a lot depending on which company you’re working at, its location and your job role.
- A Business Analyst would make roughly 20K EGP/month. Again, this number will also depend on the above mentioned factors.
- Cyber Security Engineer: Around 15K EGP/month. Again, depending on your job role and all those other factors mentioned earlier.
- Cloud Engineering: I can’t give you a rough answer for this one. It is such a broad field with a lot of job roles, that I cannot come up with an average salary number without more info on the exact job title. I’d be happy to help if you can elaborate further.

I hope that helps!
