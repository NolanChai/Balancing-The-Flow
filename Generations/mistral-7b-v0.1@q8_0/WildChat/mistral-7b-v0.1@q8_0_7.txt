[HUMAN_TEXT]August 26 is National Dog Day, which celebrates the canine companions that have been part of our lives. It was established in 2004 by Pet and Animal Welfare Advocate Colleen Paige to honor dogs for their unconditional love, loyalty, friendship, and service to humanity. On this day, we recognize all dog breeds as well as mixed-breed pups and the impact that they have on our lives. This is a wonderful time to show gratitude for our beloved furry friends by showering them with love and appreciation. We can also use this day as an opportunity to adopt or rescue a dog from a shelter or rescue organization, and help provide a home for those in need of one. Additionally, we can make sure that they have access to proper nutrition, medical care, and exercise so that they can live happy and healthy lives with us!
