This is a short guide on how to properly write an OOO mail. If you want to get rid of any doubt about your professionalism, follow this guide:

Step 1: Set up the OOO auto-responder in your email client or server.

If you don’t have one set up, now is the time. You can use your work account or a separate email address that forwards to your work account so that people know they are speaking with you in the right capacity. If you use an OOO auto-responder on your personal email address and somebody sends you something that shouldn’t be read by someone outside of your company, it can cause embarrassment all around!

Step 2: Send out a general announcement to everyone who might need this information—but only once!

Once you have set up the auto-responder in Step 1 and verified its operation, send out an email announcing that there will be no responses received until X date/time (whichever is more appropriate). This should also include any other pertinent details such as phone numbers if necessary.
