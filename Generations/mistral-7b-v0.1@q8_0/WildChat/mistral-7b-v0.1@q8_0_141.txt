The six financial forecasts that you need to prepare when starting a business include:
• Break-even analysis
• Income statement
• Cash flow projection
• Balance sheet projection
• Business ratios
• Breakeven point
Break-Even Analysis: This forecast shows how many units or services must be sold in order to cover your expenses. It is essential that you know your break-even point and avoid selling below this level. The break-even point is determined by dividing your fixed costs by the contribution margin. Fixed costs are those costs that do not vary with volume of production or sales, such as rent or interest expense. Contribution margin is what’s left over from revenue after variable costs have been deducted.
Income Statement: The income statement shows how much profit (or loss) you will make during each period covered by the forecast. This document summarizes all revenues and expenses for a given period of time (month, quarter year). It is prepared monthly at first but then should be updated quarterly once the business becomes profitable so that it can show more accurate results over longer periods of time.
Cash Flow Projection: This forecast shows how much cash will come into your company during each month/quarter/year covered by the forecast period as well as where this money comes from (i.e., sales, borrowing etc). It also predicts how much cash will leave your business over these same time periods due to expenses such as paying suppliers or employees’ salaries etc..
Balance Sheet Projection: This forecast shows what assets and liabilities are expected at certain dates during the forecast period (i.e., after 3 years). Assets include tangible things like equipment or real estate whereas intangibles such as goodwill or patents also count here if they’re relevant for your business model! Liabilities include all debts owed by a company but don’t forget to include any capital contributions made by owners too!
