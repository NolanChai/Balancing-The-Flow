Seismic intensity (Zhang, 1983) is a nonlinear function of the peak ground acceleration and its duration, whereas the modified Mercalli scale is a purely ordinal scale. The intensity values for a particular event at different points are not related in any way by a linear or simple function; i.e., it does not represent any property that varies continuously with distance from the source.

The seismic moment (M_{0}), which is defined as the product of the area under the rupture plane, σ, and the average slip, d, is an objective physical parameter and can be calculated using the following formula:

where T is shear stress, c_{v} is the rigidity modulus, and V is volume. Seismic moment is a measure of the energy released during an earthquake. It is also a useful parameter for comparing and evaluating the size of past and future earthquakes (Chen and Bolt, 1995).

The seismic intensity scale is a qualitative index for assessing the degree of ground vibration at a specific location; it describes the characteristics of surface ground movement during an earthquake. Intensity values are assigned to sites according to their relative degree of shaking (the most severe is 12 and the least severe is I). The scale is divided into two parts: part 1 consists of Roman numerals I–XII, while part 2 consists of the Arabic numbers 1–5.

The Mercalli scale is an ordinal scale based on intensity, and its values range from I to XII. For example, II = slight shaking; V = strong shaking with the sensation of the ground rolling like waves in open sea; and VIII = violent shaking that makes buildings lean at a marked angle.

The Modified Mercalli Scale (MMI) is based on the original Mercalli scale. The MMI scale ranges from I to XII.

A seismic event of magnitude 7.0 could be a major earthquake or even catastrophic depending on where it occurred. For example, a magnitude 6.0 quake offshore has little effect on nearby land, but a quake of the same magnitude beneath a populated area could cause much more damage (McGuire and Couch, 2004).

The intensity scale is subjective, meaning that it depends on the observer’s opinion; the magnitude scale is objective, as it can be measured directly or calculated by using seismic recordings.

The magnitude scale for measuring the intensity of an earthquake is based on a logarithmic scale and is known as the Richter scale. The magnitude is measured by recording the maximum amplitude of the waves that reach an instrument called a seismometer, which is used to measure the size of the waves generated by an earthquake. This number is expressed in whole numbers up to two decimal places and represents the earthquake's magnitude on the scale.
The magnitude of an earthquake is measured on a scale from 1 to 10, with a higher number indicating a more intense earthquake. The Richter scale was invented by Charles Francis Richter, a seismologist at the California Institute of Technology in 1935 and was originally based on a seismometer called a Wood-Anderson instrument.
The Richter scale has been criticized for being too simplistic and not taking into account other factors such as the depth of the earthquake or the location of the epicenter. As a result, more complex scales have been developed to better measure the intensity of an earthquake.
However, despite its limitations, the Richter scale remains the most widely used system for measuring the size of earthquakes and is still used today by many seismologists around the world.
