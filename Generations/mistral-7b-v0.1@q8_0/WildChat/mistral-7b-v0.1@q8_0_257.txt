I think it was the fact that my son died in a car accident.

I have to admit I do enjoy watching TV shows or reading comic books that feature dragons as characters. However, this is not because I like seeing them on screen or even having a character with them. It’s because I can imagine how much fun it would be if they were real and could live in the world we live in today.

I mean, imagine being able to take your kids out for dinner at McDonald’s and get them some fries! Or go camping with them! Maybe even have them come over for a sleepover! You know what? I think that would be cool!

So now let me introduce you to my new character: Goku (Dragon Ball)! He is one of the main characters in this story. And he will be going on many adventures with his friends and family members from different parts of the universe… including Earth!

I am very excited about this project because it’s something I have wanted to do for a long time now but never had enough time until recently when I finally got around to writing down all these ideas onto paper.

So here we go:

Goku was born on Earth. His father, Gohan (the first Saiyan warrior), was killed in battle by his archrival Vegeta who was later defeated by Goku’s mentor Master Roshi when he tried to take over their planet after learning about its location from Gohan’s memories after dying at age 45.

Goku grew up learning martial arts with his friends and family members such as Bulma (the daughter of Mr Satan), Krillin (a martial artist who was also raised by Mr Satan) and Tien Shinhan (a powerful fighter who trained under Gohan). Together they would go on many adventures together as well as fight against evil beings such as the Saiyans, Cell and Freeza among others.

After years of training with his friends he became stronger than them all! However at age 13 he got sick from eating too much food so he had to quit his training until he could recover…

This is just an introduction so more will be coming soon…
