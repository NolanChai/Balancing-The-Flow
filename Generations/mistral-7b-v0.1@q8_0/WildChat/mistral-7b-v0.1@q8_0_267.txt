It’s the night of the prom, the dance which every high schooler wants to attend. There are the four people who are attending this prom together and they were planning on going out to eat beforehand. One is a boy who is quite nice, and handsome, who likes to think of himself as being “different,” yet he’s pretty normal in terms of the things that he likes. The second one is a girl who wants to be a dancer more than anything else, she’s very focused on her dream but at times it seems like she doesn’t care much about school. The third one is the girl who goes along with whatever everyone tells them to do, they are mostly quiet and have no real goals or plans for after high school graduation. The fourth and final person in this group is the boy who has a girlfriend that he cares for very much, he’s smart and he loves her but he doesn’t always show it as well as he should.

The four friends arrive at their local Chinese restaurant which they all love to eat at and sit down at a booth while they wait on their food to be brought out. Once their food arrives, everyone starts eating without saying much of anything. The quiet girl begins by asking the others what their plans for after high school are.

The smart boy replies that he wants to go to college so he can become a doctor and help people like his father. He then goes on to say that he plans to major in medicine at the local community college, which is a few miles away from where they all live. The dancer girl says that she wants to dance professionally but doesn’t know how to get there yet. The normal boy says that he just wants to be happy and do what makes him feel good, although he doesn’t really know what that means either.
