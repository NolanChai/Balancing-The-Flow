It's been an interesting year for the Longwood State Lancers. Coming off a 3-9 season, a new coach was brought in to lead the team and some things were changed. For example, they have a new head coach named Mike Baxter. They also added three new players to their team roster: Trevor Johnson, Dustin Jones, and Ryan Davis.

The Lancer's starting lineup is composed of 16 players who average about 6 points per game each. Their main goal this season is to win every game they play in order to qualify for the playoffs next year. The Lancers are looking to improve on their 3-9 record from last season by winning more games and qualifying for postseason play again this season!
