How do I configure a new user or a guest to enter the game?

Hi, @kurt123456789123456

I am not sure if you are using the new version of ChatBot. The older version didn't have that feature so we made it easier with the new version. In the new ChatBot engine, just click on "New" button to create a new user. You can also add users from the User Manager.

There is no such thing as guest. The game has two types of users: normal user and admin. To allow new users to enter the game you need to create a new user account for them. You can do this with the "New" button on the User Manager or by clicking on the "Add User" link in the side menu bar.

Hi @kurt123456789123456

If you are using the new version of ChatBot then there is no such thing as guest or anonymous user. Every player in your chatbot game must have a valid account to play. You can create and assign them a username and password in order for them to enter into the game. If you want players to login with their own credentials like Facebook, Google, etc, then you can also do that with the new version of ChatBot.

The chatbot engine has been upgraded to a new version which has a lot more features than before. With this new version, we made it easier for you to create and manage users in your game. You can also add and manage your own avatar (the image that shows when the player enters the game).

The chatbot is very easy to configure. Once you have installed ChatBot, go to "User Manager" under the side menu bar. Here you will see a button called "New". Click on this button to create a new user account for your player or players. You can also add users from here by clicking on "Add User" link in the sidebar.

Once you have created a user account, go back into the sidebar and click on "Avatar Manager" to upload an image that will be used as your avatar when someone enters your game.

1. In 2015, Japan's GDP was only 438 trillion yen. Since then, there has been a gradual decline in economic growth. In 2017, the figure fell to 494 trillion yen. At the beginning of this year, it is estimated that the amount of economic output will decrease further by nearly 6% due to the impact of the new crown virus.
2. The increase in social security burden has been very high recently. In order to respond to the aging society, Japan needs to spend a lot on pension and medical expenses. However, this year alone, due to the epidemic, it is estimated that Japan’s national debt will increase by about 30 trillion yen compared with last year, and Japan’s total debt-to-GDP ratio will exceed 250%.
3. As a result of the implementation of “Abenomics”, the amount of public spending has increased significantly in recent years, but the income side has not improved accordingly. Although the government’s debt interest burden is only about 13% of tax revenue, it has begun to occupy the government's ability to spend.
4. In addition, Japan’s birth rate has been falling for many years, which means that the labor force will also continue to decline in the future, and this situation is more serious than China and South Korea. Therefore, if Japan can not attract foreign workers into the country to compensate for the shortage of labor, it may not be possible for the economy to rebound due to the decrease in the labor force.
5. As early as 2013, the Japanese government has begun to launch a "national strategy", aiming to use economic means to resolve the international security problem that Japan is facing with China and North Korea. The purpose of this is to make the Japanese economy more powerful and allow the Japanese yen to increase in value. But the reality is that Japan's economic situation has been getting worse in recent years, so how can it be done?
6. In 2014, the Japanese government issued a "security strategy", stating that they would spend as much as possible to increase military spending and defense capabilities. However, due to the lack of resources, the actual implementation effect was very limited. Since then, Japan's national power has been declining.
7. As a result, Japan needs to change its policy, so the Japanese government began to invest in infrastructure projects and new technologies, which not only increase its national strength but also create jobs for young people who are unable to find work.
8. The Japanese government has stated that it will spend more than 3 trillion yen on public works projects by 2017. This includes building roads and bridges as well as infrastructure such as sewage treatment plants and water supply facilities. However, many people are worried about the amount of money spent on these projects because they don't know where all this money will go.
9. In addition to spending more on public works projects and infrastructure construction, Japan also hopes that young people who cannot find jobs will be able to take advantage of new technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) robots, so they can use their hands to work on these machines instead of wasting time waiting for a job opening.
10. The Japanese government has made it clear that it wants to spend more money in order to improve its national power and create jobs for young people who cannot find jobs. However, the reality is that Japan's economic situation has not been so good recently, so there are still many challenges ahead of them.

In 2017, Japanese Prime Minister Abe Shinzo and his cabinet colleagues held a press conference to discuss their views on the recent developments in North Korea. The following is an excerpt from the prime minister's speech:

"The Japanese government will continue to work with all relevant countries to resolve this issue peacefully and diplomatically. We hope that North Korea will not take any actions that can lead to further escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula."

"We are committed to ensuring regional stability and security through close cooperation with our allies. We believe that dialogue is the best way forward, but if necessary we will consider other options as well."

I'm not quite sure, but it seems like you can't have a "talk" with him at the moment (at least, in the version I played). There might have been something, that could have been a conversation, but I skipped it. (I think you talked about the books.) But he doesn't seem to have anything else to say or ask for at the moment...
