I’d be happy to answer that! In fact, I have a whole list of levels and the editors they were made with. Unfortunately it’s too long to type out, but you can find all the data you need here:

There is also a thread by me that might be useful to you (with the list of levels and editors) here: http://www.roblox.com/Forum/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=7241985&P=7243946

Today we will be looking at the subject of learning new skills, and we’ll be doing so by playing with a toy.

The toy in question is the humble rubber band. You’ve probably used one before to shoot paper balls or tie up your hair (or someone else’s). But I bet you didn’t know about the amazing things that are possible with a bit of practice and a few friends…

### Instructions

1. First, have a look at all the different ways this guy can use just a single rubber band. It looks pretty impressive!
2. Watch another person perform these tricks. Don’t try to learn them too fast - it takes time and patience, and you don’t want to give up after trying for ten minutes and not getting anywhere. You can find the full instructions with pictures on this site.
3. Practice as much as you want! You probably won’t be able to do it perfectly straight away, so just try your best and keep practicing until it gets easier. Remember: Rome wasn’t built in a day.
4. Now you have all the information you need. Have fun with this amazing skill!
