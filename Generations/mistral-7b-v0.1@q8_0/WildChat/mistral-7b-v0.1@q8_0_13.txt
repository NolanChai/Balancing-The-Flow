What is this?

Its a game where you try to find all 42 characters hidden throughout the level. It has a very unique and interesting concept to it so give it a shot!

How do I play?

There are 3 letters that make up each character in the game. When you find one of these 3 letters you will get a piece. There is also a check box to mark whether or not you found this letter. Once you have all 3 pieces for one character, the name of the character should appear on your HUD along with a picture of them and a little description. If you wish to reset the game simply leave the level and re-enter it again.

I'm stuck! What do I do now?

Its possible to get a hint for each of the characters. To do this type in "/hint" in the chat box. Please keep in mind that once you use a hint, you can no longer go back and re-find this character without using another hint. Hints will reset after 15 minutes.

Can I have a hint?

It sounds fine to me, it could be better but I don't think any of the instruments are out of place or anything, it does sound a bit too "pop" for my taste but that may be just preference. I think the main problem is that the guitar and drums are too quiet relative to the vocals, you might want to turn the volume of the vocals down a little so they're not so loud compared to the other instruments, as well as mixing them a bit higher up in the mix.

[PATCH]more ideas?[/PATCH]

- Fixed a bug with the 2 player mode that made it impossible to switch player after you died (you had to restart the game)
- Fixed some bugs in the chat system, which prevented players from writing messages sometimes. It should work now!

A good question to ask yourself is "what's the best that can happen?" If the best outcome of an action is that you get a higher grade on your test, then is it worth the risk?

"Is it possible" would be easier for me to answer. I think that it depends on how long you were waiting and whether or not you had any "signs".
