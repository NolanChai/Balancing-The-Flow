###### Hyperglycemic conditions are associated with sodium retention in chronic kidney disease

Hyperglycemia is associated with increased mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). It has been proposed that this increased mortality may be related to volume overload. In hyperglycemia, glucose is filtered by the kidneys and then reabsorbed by the proximal tubules. The sodium-glucose co-transporter (SGLT) family is responsible for this reabsorption of glucose. In chronic kidney disease, these SGLTs are also expressed in the distal tubule. It was shown that hyperglycemia increases sodium reabsorption in patients with CKD via the SGLT2/NHE3 system located in the distal convoluted tubules and collecting ducts.

###### Potassium levels are not significantly different in hyperglycemic conditions

Potassium metabolism is affected by chronic kidney disease with potassium retention in the presence of diminished glomerular filtration rate (GFR). However, hyperglycemia does not seem to have a direct impact on potassium levels. This may be explained by the fact that potassium regulation is controlled via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

In conclusion, patients with diabetes mellitus and CKD are at high risk for hyperglycemia which will increase sodium reabsorption but will not impact significantly on potassium levels.

[STUDENT]1. A. The information presented in the case above shows that there are two main categories of products on which the company was investing to build a new plant. One was high-quality, low-priced, and made up 85 percent of the total market (product 21), while the other was medium quality and had an even higher percentage in the overall market (30 percent) but only constituted 15 percent of the entire sales volume (product 48). In addition, the company was looking to increase its presence in the low-cost, high-quality segment since this represented a growing share of the total market and could allow the company to build stronger long-term relationships with customers. B. The case also provided several possible scenarios for the development of the two products that are considered critical in building new plants. One involved expanding the production of the lower-quality product, while another suggested increasing capacity in the area of high-volume but medium-quality production. C. The final information from the case above that is pertinent to the decision on where to build a new plant was the fact that there were two potential sites for building it: one located near the main research and development facility, and the other close to the existing plant. However, the R&D facility had limited capacity because of a lack of space, while the existing plant already operated at 90 percent of its production capacity and would not be able to support any additional investments in the medium-term.

In order to diagnose a disease, it is important that healthcare practitioners do an assessment of a patient. The first step in assessing the patient is taking a history (patient’s chief complaint). It involves questions that help the practitioner in determining the patient’s symptoms and the probable cause of the illness. This enables them to know where to start investigating the underlying condition. After this, they need to examine the patient physically by looking at the different body parts that might be affected. The findings are used to determine the most likely diagnosis (Steinert & Steinert 2013).

In the case above, it is important to note that a physical examination was done and some of the results obtained were: “slow pulse rate”, “blood pressure is high” and “heart sounds are weak.” This indicates that the patient might be suffering from cardiovascular disease. Other than the physical findings, it is also evident that the patient has been on medication before for hypertension. This further supports the above diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. The reason for this is that many of the signs and symptoms of cardiovascular diseases are similar to those of hypertension such as rapid breathing, fatigue, dizziness and chest pain (Steinert & Steinert 2013).

Therefore, based on the physical findings obtained, it would be important for the practitioner to examine the patient further by obtaining laboratory tests. The results will help them rule out other illnesses that have similar symptoms. For instance, they can do a blood test to check the cholesterol and triglyceride levels. If these are high, then this is evidence of cardiovascular disease (Steinert & Steinert 2013).

Another thing that needs to be considered in diagnosing a patient with hypertension is their family history. In most cases, if one’s parents have been diagnosed with hypertension, they will also be affected by it later in life. This is because of the genetic component associated with this condition (Steinert & Steinert 2013).

I’m not sure what you are asking for.  The only possible way to do this would be to review every case on the internet and put them in a database so we can query it.   Even then I wouldn’t recommend that since many of the cases are either never updated or the updates come from non-experts who think they know something but really don’t.

Your best bet is to review the cases for your condition on the internet and read what you find there.  Then, if you have any questions about the information, post them here for answers.

## Background

A 45 year old male, smoker with no significant past medical history presented to a walk in clinic with chief complaint of shortness of breath. The patient reported he was not able to climb stairs without shortness of breath. His family history is notable for lung cancer and his father died of lung disease at age of 50 years old. The patient smoked about half pack of cigarettes daily, approximately since the age of 16 years old.

## Physical Exam

Vitals: BP: 97/80mmHg HR: 120/min RR: 30/min T: 98F

Skin: Not pale, not cyanotic

Lung: No rales and no wheezes

Cardiac: RRR with regular rate and rhythm. Heart sounds are normal without murmurs. No gallop or rubs.

Neurologic: alert and oriented, no focal neurologic deficits, no meningismus

## Laboratory Results

CBC: Hb 9.1 g/dl (normal: 14 – 18), WBC 6.8 (4.0 – 12) Platelet 320K (150 – 400). ESR 18mm/hr, CRP 2.5mg/L

CXR: The x-ray of the patient’s chest shows a large mass occupying most of his left lung field. The mass has displaced and flattened the heart and diaphragm to the right.

## Discussion

Based on the physical exam and laboratory results, the most likely cause of dyspnea is:

1. Pulmonary Embolism
2. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
3. Congestive Heart Failure
4. Atelectasis

This is a 73 year old female with no significant past medical history who was found to have a pelvic mass on her physical examination. The mass did not appear to be adnexal in origin but was concerning for an ovarian neoplasm. She had transvaginal ultrasound which showed a 9cm complex adnexal mass. Her CA-125 was elevated at 94 U/mL and CEA was normal at 0.8 ng/mL.

She underwent laparoscopic staging with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection. At surgery the patient was found to have a 9cm left ovarian cystic neoplasm. The cystic cavity was lined with endometrioid epithelium and focal mucinous epithelial areas were present. On final pathology, the tumor was a serous carcinoma without capsular or nodal involvement. She was staged as a FIGO Stage 1A grade 3 with a low risk of recurrence.

What are the expected abg findings for this patient?



Assessing for a medical emergency in the patient with acute abdominal pain:

History – Key points in taking a history from patients presenting with acute abdominal pain are as follows.

Ask about onset and character of the pain. Pain that comes on suddenly suggests an intra-abdominal catastrophe (e.g. perforated ulcer, ruptured ectopic pregnancy). The differential diagnosis of this type of pain includes:

peritonitis, bowel obstruction, appendicitis

The patient may also be unable to describe the exact location of the pain and therefore you should ask them to point at where it hurts. This will allow you to pinpoint a localised abdominal process (e.g. gall stones) or regional inflammation such as pancreatitis. Pain that comes on slowly suggests a more gradual process, such as an inflammatory bowel disorder such as Crohn’s disease.

Ask about the associated symptoms.

- Vomiting and/or diarrhoea may suggest bowel obstruction or inflammation (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome).
- Nausea without vomiting is most likely to be associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux, gastritis, duodenitis or peptic ulcer.
- Constipation may suggest a mechanical obstruction (e.g. volvulus), neoplasm, or inflammatory bowel disease.
- Fever and/or night sweats are associated with infections such as cholecystitis or appendicitis.
- Abdominal pain associated with vaginal bleeding may be due to ectopic pregnancy, or ovarian torsion.
- Pain that is worse on eating suggests pancreatitis.
- Pain that radiates down the right or left groin suggests aortic aneurysm.
- Pain that radiates to the back suggests renal colic, spinal pathology or pyelonephritis.

The differential diagnosis of abdominal pain is vast and this list is not exhaustive. It is important that you ask about any other significant symptoms to guide your differential diagnosis (e.g. urinary symptoms in patients with renal colic, chest pain in patients presenting with pancreatitis).

Examination – A systematic approach will be helpful to identify a cause for abdominal pain:

- Inspection for signs of dehydration and pallor.
- Abdominal palpation should be carried out gently with the patient lying down or sitting on the edge of the bed. Avoid pressing too firmly, as this may increase intra-abdominal pressure and worsen symptoms if a perforated viscus is present. Careful palpation allows you to assess for signs of tenderness, guarding (indicating peritonitis), rebound tenderness (also indicating peritonitis) or masses (e.g. neoplasm).
- Auscultation – listen for bowel sounds and evidence of a fluid thrill. Bowel sounds are not usually heard in the presence of ileus, but can be heard in patients with ascites. A fluid thrill is felt on percussion or palpation if ascitic fluid is present.
- Percuss for evidence of tenderness over the liver/spleen and/or ascites.

Examination of the patient may give a clue as to the cause of their pain (e.g. abdominal masses, hernias or skin rashes). It is important that you examine the whole abdomen in order to avoid missing a diagnosis (e.g. lower lobe pneumonia presenting with vague left-sided abdominal pain and pleuritic chest pain).

Investigations – The differential diagnoses of acute abdominal pain are varied and investigations will be guided by your clinical assessment. This will depend on the severity of the patient’s symptoms, their general condition, the likely cause for the pain and any pre-existing medical problems.

A full blood count can help to identify an inflammatory process (e.g. leucocytosis) or anaemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding.

Urine analysis may help to exclude urinary tract infections if the patient presents with abdominal pain and lower urinary symptoms. Urinalysis can also identify a kidney stone by the presence of haematuria (and a positive urine dipstick for blood).

If renal colic is suspected, an abdominal X-ray will help to identify stones in the kidney or ureter and may also show signs of inflammation of the renal tract. This may be followed by an ultrasound scan, which can confirm the presence of a stone and/or exclude other pathologies (e.g. hydronephrosis).

A plain X-ray of the abdomen will help to identify the presence of free gas in the peritoneal cavity if there is suspicion for perforated viscus or ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Free air may also be identified on a chest X-ray in this context, and will confirm the diagnosis.

Ultrasound scanning can help to identify gall stones if this is suspected, as well as the presence of ascites, which would indicate inflammation of the abdominal viscera (e.g. pancreatitis). Ultrasound can also be used to diagnose the presence of an ectopic pregnancy.

A CT scan is useful for assessing the extent of disease in inflammatory bowel disorders, as well as identifying causes of obstruction (e.g. neoplasm). A CT scan may be used in combination with a plain abdominal X-ray if perforation/rupture is suspected, to identify the exact location and the presence or absence of free gas.

What is the primary impression of this case? What are some secondary impressions that may or may not be important? The primary impression from reading this case is that the client had been receiving workers compensation benefits for an extended period and that he was now ineligible to continue collecting these benefits due to his status as a nonresident alien.

The secondary impressions that are presented include the fact that the employee did not receive his paycheck because of the misclassification issue, as well as how this would affect him personally. Furthermore, there is mention of other workers compensation claims made by this individual which could potentially be used against them if they were found to be true or false depending on what information was provided during questioning sessions with insurance companies involved with their case

Mrs Smith is a 56 year old lady who presented to the ED with acute epigastric pain.

On examination she has a tender area centrally which does not seem to be related to respiration or movement of her diaphragm. She has some tachycardia and a slight pyrexia but otherwise is otherwise stable. Blood tests were taken and these came back showing an elevated leukocyte count with 82% neutrophils.

Differential diagnosis at this point was broad, but peptic ulcer disease seemed likely given the history of pain, central location, elevated leucocytes and tenderness on examination. She was started on intravenous metoclopramide for antiemetic cover, and intravenous pantoprazole to reduce gastric acid production.

What other signs may suggest that peptic ulcer disease is present?
