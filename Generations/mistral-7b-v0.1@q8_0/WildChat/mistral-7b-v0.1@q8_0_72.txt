I noticed something odd when comparing my production environment and QA environment.  On the production environment, if the annual statements are run on a Friday or Saturday, the results do not show up until Monday morning.  This is consistent over a number of months.   For example, I ran it last night (Saturday) at 11:40 pm, and when I checked this morning at 8 am it was still in processing.  When I ran it on Friday this week, same thing.  However, if run during the week, the results are available by the following day.

The environment is WebFOCUS 8.3.2.08, running on HP-UX 11i v3, with a database of Teradata 14.00.05.06.

Has anyone else seen this?

Hi all.
My company is going to implement new SAP ECC6.0 and we are planning to use CCMS(Cluster Configuration Manager) for high availability.

It's well known that the default installation of CCMS comes with two-node configuration, and you can make four node cluster as well.
However, we would like to have 8 node cluster and it seems that I can not find a way to do so.
Anybody knows how to make such kind of HA cluster using SAP's tools? or maybe there is any other options?
I appreciate your help.

Best regards,
Kim

Hi Kim,

SAP CCMS supports up to 8 nodes and it is the max. supported by SAP.
