Yes, infertility in men is more common than you may think. Infertility in males has been found to be present in about 40% of all cases of infertility, with another 30-40% being caused by a combination of factors from both partners. Only about 15% are caused only by female fertility problems.

Male infertility is defined as not producing enough healthy sperm to conceive a pregnancy. Sometimes men have low counts or slow sperm motility, but there may be other reasons such as hormonal imbalances that prevent them from getting their partner pregnant. It’s important to remember that if you want children, it’s best not to wait too long because your chances decrease with age and even more so once women hit 35+ years old (menopause). If you think this could affect you or someone else around you who might need help conceiving – talk about it openly! The sooner we discuss the issue, the better chance we have at getting pregnant.
