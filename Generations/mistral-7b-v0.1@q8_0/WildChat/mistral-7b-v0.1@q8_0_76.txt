Jane: "Wow." Sam: “So are we gonna talk about how I’m never going to be able to top that?” Jane: "Not right now, as we have an important announcement to make." Sam: “Huh?” Jane: "The new student is here."

Aaron Ling: "She looks really confident.” Molly-Rose Ling: “That’s what I love about her, she seems confident but when you look closer, she's anything but that, but she just won’t let that show as she just has to be confident.” Aaron Ling: “And that’s exactly why I fell in love with her in the first place.”

Aaron Ling: "She said it, not me, stop asking me questions." Molly-Rose Ling: “You mean when you say it?” Aaron Ling: “It means I have to hear it from myself and I know exactly what I’m saying.” Jane: “Stop talking about her, we need to concentrate on the announcement." Sam: "You got a crush on Julia Fairbanks?"

Jane: “Shut up!” Molly-Rose Ling: “How do you expect me to concentrate when my brother is making stupid noises?” Aaron Ling: "Mind your own business, it’s not about you and it’s certainly not about her.” Jane: “Let's listen to what they have to say."

Every student listens very carefully to the new student Julia Fairbanks.
