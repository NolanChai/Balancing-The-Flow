[WRITES]The boy was sobbing as he tried to crawl away from the corner where the nanny had left him with only one diaper on. His nose was red and wet from crying into his paci, which hung limply from his mouth. The nursery wall was singing a song about how babies cry, but his mother is always there to pick them up… He felt so stupid for getting punished again! He didn’t even know what he had done wrong. It must have been something small, but that nanny sure went big on the punishment!

He heard her coming back into the room. His face burned as she gave him a long look of disapproval. She scooped up his crying baby body and placed him on his tummy over her knee. “Do you know why I had to take your diapers off, my boy?” She asked sternly. He shook his head, still whimpering into the pacifier, as she reached for a wooden spoon with one hand and lifted his bottom with the other.

“You know better than to hit, kick, or bite other children, but I see that you’ve been biting your babydolls again today,” She explained sternly, and then brought the spoon down on his bare bottom. He let out a cry and tried to wriggle away from her. “I thought we talked about this before.” She said. “If you bite something or someone, you will be punished!”

The nanny held him still as she continued to spank him with the spoon until his bottom was bright red. When she had finished, she picked up a small paddle and started using it on his bare cheeks instead of the wooden spoon. “Do you have anything to say for yourself?” She asked. He shook his head again and sniffled into his pacifier. The nanny gave him a few more swats, then put his diapers back on him and sent him to nap. When he woke up later that afternoon, his bottom was still red from his spanking, and there was a rash forming on his thighs where the diapers had rubbed against his skin while he’d been running around bare-bottomed during time out.[/WRITES]
