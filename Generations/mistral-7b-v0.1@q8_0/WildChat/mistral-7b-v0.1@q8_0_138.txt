I’ve been thinking about this for a bit. I think the main thing that makes it harder to make money with music now is that people don’t have to buy anything to listen to what you make. Spotify has made it so easy and convenient to just listen to whatever, whenever. This means that people aren’t as inclined to spend money on your album or concert tickets because they can get the same experience for free by streaming your music online.

This is also why it’s important for artists to diversify their income streams (i.e., make money from merchandise, live shows, sponsorship deals, etc.) In a way, this has made it easier for musicians because they no longer have to rely on one source of income. However, it can be difficult to juggle all these different sources and keep up with them all at once!

This also means that we should support the artists we love by buying their albums and going to their concerts whenever possible! That way they can continue making amazing music for us forever!
