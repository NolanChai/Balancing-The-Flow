The female snow golem then starts limping toward the player. They head toward the village of Snowhaven, where they find a healer. The snow golem's water breaks in front of them.

Healer: (helps the golem into a seat) "Oh dear, this isn't good. What happened?"

Female Snow Golem: "A traveler hit me with a snowball. And then I started feeling contractions."

[player]: (in their head) "This can't be happening! She's already in labor and needs a healer!"

Healer: "I see...well, we need to get you to a hospital as soon as possible."

(The healer then leads the golem toward the nearest hospital. The player follows them.)
