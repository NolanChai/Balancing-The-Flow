As I’ve said before, we have to take responsibility for our own lives. That includes taking an honest inventory of what we do well and what we don’t do well. It means admitting that the things we’re not good at might not be all that important anyway. If you are a great cook but don’t enjoy it, why spend time in the kitchen?

Our strengths need to be identified so we can figure out where to spend our time and what to do with that time. Once we know what we’re good at (and like doing), we can find ways to put that knowledge to use. We can get paid for it.

Knowing your strengths will help you in three important ways:

1) You will be more successful in any job or position if you are able to draw upon your strengths. Your abilities and interests will be recognized, valued, and appreciated by others. You will have a competitive edge when applying for a job or promotion.

2) Knowing what you do well gives you confidence and self-esteem. The more comfortable and secure you feel about yourself, the easier it is to tackle new challenges and take on responsibility.

3) Your strengths give you direction for future growth. If you know what works well for you now, then it’s easier to see where you want to go in the future — both professionally and personally!

Instructions: Please respond to the following:

- What is your greatest strength? Give an example from your experience.
- What is your biggest challenge or weakness? Give an example from your experience.
- If you had a chance, what would you do differently in this experience? How will this make you more effective in the future?
- What have you learned about yourself and leadership from this experience?

I was wondering why do the top companies and firms outsource their auditing work to an external audit agency, when they have an in-house audit team. So I asked my friends and colleagues about it. They said that sometimes an external agency can see the things from a different angle than the internal team and this helps them get new insights which help improve the systems and processes of a company.

But there is no substitute for a good in-house internal auditor, who has been with the organization from start and understands how it works better than an external auditor could ever.

A recent news article about internal auditing and the weaknesses within the profession is very concerning. The story stated that internal audit functions were not effectively contributing to the governance of the company. It also noted that internal audit does not have a significant presence on risk committees or audit committees, nor do they participate in setting corporate policy.

In many instances there is no documented evidence of how the audits are done, with auditors often doing work based on assumptions instead of facts and evidence. Auditing standards require documentation to exist so that when someone else reviews the file (such as a regulator or another audit firm) they can see exactly what was done.

When an internal auditor fails to follow up on recommendations from management, he or she is not doing their job. Internal auditors cannot be satisfied with management’s promise that they will do something in the future; they must confirm whether the recommendation has been implemented and functioning correctly.

It is imperative for internal auditing functions to become more effective and efficient by having a more visible role within the organization, contributing value through risk assessment work, being involved with setting corporate policy, and improving the quality of work through documentation and follow up.
