[TEXT]In the process of reading, people do not simply receive information; they also interpret it and draw their own conclusions. In order to communicate effectively with their readers, writers must be able to understand how their audience will interpret what they write.

As writers, we need to pay attention to what our audiences are likely to think of as credible. For example, if we were writing an article about the importance of getting enough sleep at night, we might discuss the effects of fatigue on driving and accidents. The research that demonstrates a correlation between sleep loss and the incidence of automobile crashes would be seen as credible by most readers.

However, if we then wrote: “Many people think that driving when they are sleepy is more dangerous than drinking alcohol,” some of our readers might dispute this claim on the grounds that it is unsupported by research. Such a statement would not have much credibility with many readers because they would consider it to be only an opinion, not supported by facts or research.[/TEXT]
