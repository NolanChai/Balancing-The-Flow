"The thousand years are complete and finished in the history ; so that they are over and gone ; but the same time is now going on, and will be, till the judgment shall take place. It is said to be a thousand years because it was a long time to the church; for as one day with God is a thousand years, so to them it was like a thousand years. But in the world's account it was but a little season."
