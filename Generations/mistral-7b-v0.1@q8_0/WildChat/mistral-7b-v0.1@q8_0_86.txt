[Sucrose] "Ah... yes, please. I fell..."

[Inst] "You are heavy with child. Please, let me help."

[Sucrose] "Oh no, it is too late... my experiment has been ruined!"

[Inst] "What are you doing here, miss?"

(I know her, she's the famous alchemist Sucrose - but she doesn't know I do.)

[Sucrose] "This is a top secret research project that could change everything! And now my experiment has been destroyed!"

(She starts sobbing uncontrollably, and I can't help but feel empathy for her. I mean, it does seem like a very important experiment she had.)

[Inst] "You need to stop crying. You are in a public place, and you must not be so obvious."

(I see why she is pregnant now - it appears that Sucrose is expecting a child!)

[Sucrose] "What do you mean?"

"Why would I care what the public thinks? This is my experiment! The future of our country lies in its success!"

"We can't risk letting people know about this."

(I can't help but feel a little sad for Sucrose. She seems like such a nice girl.)
