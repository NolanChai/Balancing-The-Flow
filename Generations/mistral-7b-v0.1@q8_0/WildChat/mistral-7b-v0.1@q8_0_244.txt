Today is a rainy day and I am looking forward to the next sunny one. Summer has passed quickly for me. I spent most of it at work, as usual. Still, my husband managed to take a few days off and we took a trip to the beach.

I love going there with my family and watching people play in the water. The sea is very warm around here and people are crazy enough to dive in and swim even if it is September.

There are many kids on vacation during this period. Most of them spend their days playing on the sand and trying to stay close to the beach restaurants, where they get snacks and soft drinks from time to time. Some older teenagers go there to hang out with friends or meet girls. They sit on the rocks at the edge of the water and try to impress each other by jumping from there into the sea.

The most interesting thing is that I do not see many sunbathers on the beach, except for some elderly ladies in their 60s and 70s. It is strange because it is quite warm in September. I think people go to the beaches less often after August, but they are still there if you look closer.
