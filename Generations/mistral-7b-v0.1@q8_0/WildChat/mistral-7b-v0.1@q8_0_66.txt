I am working on a new Starcraft 2 map that will be using the Slenderman as well as some of the original race's units in some fashion. I want to take this project over to Unity 3D and see what can be done with it.

I have played around with making a SlenderMan game for SC2 before, but never got around to finishing anything.

In this version I am trying to make the Slenderman a bit more terrifying. He'll be stalking you throughout the level and when he finally appears he will attempt to kill you using some sort of ghost like effect or maybe a blast of energy from his eyes.

The map will use some elements of the original races, but also include new units that have been custom created for this project.

So far I am making progress on getting this map done. It's not going to be easy, but it will be fun.

I just wanted to share what I have done so far in terms of some custom SlenderMan models and a quick screenshot of the SC2 Map Editor showing a small area of what has been done.

The story is about a human who gets to be the last hope of this world. He has to fight against all the monsters in the game, including Siren Head. The monster was created by some guy who got fed up with humanity and decided that they should just kill themselves. This human who is the last hope of humanity doesn't want to die, but he also knows that it is his fate. He wants revenge against Siren Head for what he did to him.

The main character in this game will be the main character from StarCraft 2, Kerrigan (aka Sarah Kerrigan). Her story is about how she got infected and became a monster herself after losing her humanity due to an accident that happened during one of her missions as a Ghost agent for The Confederacy.

Kerrigan will have access to all three races in this game: Terran, Protoss, Zerg (or whatever you want)...but she won't be able to use any special abilities like teleporting or shields because those aren't available yet! There are also two other playable characters who are not included in this story at all but will probably show up later on down the line.

## What is Siren Head?

Siren Head is a humanoid monster that has been featured in various internet memes and stories. It was created by an artist named Kris Straub, who is also responsible for creating Cyanide & Happiness and other popular webcomics. The Siren Head is a human-looking creature with long hair and two sets of teeth on either side of its face; these features make it look like it has multiple mouths at once. It has red eyes, which glow when it opens them up fully to show that they are actually hollow inside. Its ears are small but pointed upward towards each other, giving it an alien appearance.

In many ways this creature resembles the creature from Siren Head lore: both creatures have multiple mouths (though in different configurations) and red eyes which glow when opened up fully so they can be seen through all three layers of skin that make up their faces (eyes being visible only when fully open).

The Siren Head also has several other traits that match up with what we know about the creature from StarCraft 2 lore: it has sharp teeth like those found on most animals; its body appears to be covered in scales rather than fur or feathers; there are two sets of ears instead of one; its tail is long and flexible enough for it to curl around itself while lying down flat against whatever surface it's resting upon.

The Siren Head has also been featured in other internet memes and stories, including:

- The Siren Head was featured on Tumblr as part of a series called "Sirens" by artist Kris Straub. The series includes illustrations featuring various different characters from the StarCraft universe alongside the Siren Head.[4]
- In June 2016, an image depicting what appears to be two Terrans fighting against the Siren Head was posted on Reddit.[5] It has since been removed due to copyright concerns. This image may have inspired another popular internet meme called "The Siren Head."[6][7]
- On July 23rd, 2016 an image depicting what appears to be three Terrans fighting against the Siren Head was posted on Reddit.[8] This image also includes text at its bottom stating: “I’m going to fight you!” The text is written in blue letters which makes it appear as though they were added after being posted by someone else who did not know what they meant when they typed them out.[9]
- On October 27th, 2016 an image depicting what appears to be four Terrans fighting against the Siren Head was posted on Reddit.[10] This image has no text written on it at all so there’s no way for anyone else other than those who posted it originally know exactly what this means when they see them together like this.[11]

## How to Play StarCraft 2 Races & Characters Meet Siren Head

If you're a fan of both StarCraft 2 and Siren Head, then we have the game for you. This is a custom map that will let you play as any one of the three races from StarCraft 2: Terran, Protoss or Zerg (or even all three!) against the Siren Head in an epic battle to see who comes out on top!

The map features two teams: Team Humanity and Team Monsters. The goal is simple: destroy all of your opponents' buildings before they can do so to yours! You'll need some strategy here; if you want to win at this game, then it would be wise for each team member not only know how much damage their units deal but also which ones are good against what types of enemies...and where those weaknesses lie too!

The first thing we need do is find ourselves an opponent with whom we can fight; once found they should be added into our roster (we'll get back later). Now let’s take a look at each side individually starting off with Team Humanity:

It's good to see some people still read the wiki.
I have been working on it on an off between personal stuff.
The plan was always to add more characters and monsters but it's a little different now than I planned when I started this.

I am still here, I'm just not very active anymore.
I think we should merge all the existing wiki entries together into one big entry? That way there is only one page to update. It would be less work in the long run as well.

I agree, but it might take some time

Well, if you don't want to be involved anymore, then just leave the wiki alone. I am still interested in working on the Wiki, so maybe I should start writing the missing information (mainly the ones from the first two floors) by myself.

I never said that! I just haven't been able to work on it much these days.
Although, if you have a list of what is left to do, I will happily add more stuff when I get the chance!

I am definitely interested in writing for this Wiki as well, as I've already made some notes about the various monsters that inhabit The Backrooms (based off of my own theories).

Awesome! I haven't really had time to read the stories yet so I don't know what you wrote. But anything is helpful. I think a lot of us are interested in doing this and it would be great if we could get some stuff written down. I was hoping that others would help write about the characters too, but it seems like the monsters and places take most of the attention

It's alright - I just finished reading them now, and they were very enjoyable! I really liked how you added a lot of details to your stories in order for people to understand them better, such as descriptions of what certain areas look like or specific rules that are followed by characters. This made the story more immersive.

I don't have any pictures of monsters at this time but I'll be sure to create some once my computer is fixed. It may take a while before they are done though as I've been very busy these days (but hopefully not for long)! As far as the wiki goes, if you ever need help with writing any new content or editing old pages, feel free to let me know - I can assist you whenever needed.

> Awesome! That sounds great. Yeah I think more pictures would really help make the whole thing look a lot better than it does now and also help people visualize what monsters/things look like. If I had any suggestions, I'd say it might be good to add some pictures of rooms in certain areas/floors so that we can see how they differ from each other (for example the 2nd floor room looks more like a warehouse while the 3rd floor has an abandoned apartment building). Also, maybe you could find or make some pictures showing characters doing different things around The Backrooms - this would give people a better idea of what these NPCs do when they aren't busy being eaten by monsters!

> I know it will take some time, but if you can get to it then that would be great. Thanks in advance!

I think I will start with the first two floors (maybe three) and then move on from there. If other people are interested in writing about characters or anything else, then feel free to do so. However, I'd suggest that we try to stick with one person writing per page - this way, everyone has a chance to add their own contributions without getting overwhelmed by others who may have more ideas than they can handle!
