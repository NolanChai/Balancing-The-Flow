- The characters in the mystery are very well developed but the mystery itself is quite poor and weak. You will not be able to guess who did it before you find out for yourself, but there were far too many suspects and too many twists. It would have been nice if they had introduced a new character or two during the story and made them more important to the plot than just one-off characters.

The TV show is set in a rehabilitation centre for injured people. The main character is Celestine, who has recently become paraplegic and is adjusting to her new lifestyle while she goes through therapy sessions with other patients. She soon realises that there are some strange occurrences going on at the facility and starts investigating what exactly they might be!

The show was originally supposed to air on ABC but after it failed in pilot season, Netflix picked it up instead! It has since gained quite a following amongst fans who enjoy both drama and comedy mixed together.
