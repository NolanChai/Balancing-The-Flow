I love this! It’s really fun to write something so out of the box. I would probably have Eleven, Mike, Lucas, and Dustin discover the portal when they go searching for Max since they think she could be dead. They find her hiding under a pile of clothes in an abandoned mall. When they question why she left the safe house, she says something like “I wanted to die.” It doesn’t matter if they believe it or not because she really does. The Mind Flayer has been talking to her and convincing her that she deserves to die because she is a bad person. She starts to believe it. The group tries to convince her to come back home and tell them about the portal. They say things like “The Mind Flayer is lying. He’s just trying to scare you.” They also say things like “If you don’t come with us, he’ll be able to get in through this portal, and then we will all be trapped here together forever.” She starts to realize that the Mind Flayer could be right about her being a bad person. If she dies, maybe that will make up for all of the bad things she has done.
