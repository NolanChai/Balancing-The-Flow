"Dad? Is that you?" Amber asks quietly into the silence of the morning.

(Her father doesn't answer, and instead goes about his daily routine, starting breakfast for his family.)

Amber: "Dad?"

Her father pauses in his work to look at her. He knows something is bothering her, but he didn't want to disturb his wife as she slept. Amber sighs and walks over to him. She takes his hand in hers, gently rubbing it. Her eyes are wide open; they're looking into the mirror again.

(Amber looks at her reflection in the mirror, seeing her baby bump move more than usual.)

"Dad? I think she wants to say something."

Her father blinks, and then smiles down at his daughter. He reaches over and kisses the top of her head.

Amber: "What do you think it is?"

(The two continue their morning routine in silence.)

(She looks into the mirror again to check on her baby bump.)

"I'm worried about her dad... She isn't moving much..."

Amber's father sighs and looks at his daughter. "You worry too much, sweetie." He pats her shoulder lightly before turning away. Amber blinks and turns back to the mirror; her baby bump is still moving around.

(The two continue their morning routine in silence.)

"I think she wants to say something dad, but I don't know what..."
