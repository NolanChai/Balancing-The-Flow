[B][COLOR=rgb(0, 0, 0)][FONT=Calibri]1. The method does not have scientific evidence.[/FONT][/COLOR][/B]

I would like to know what you mean by "evidence". I think it is difficult to explain a movement and its benefits with words. And for this reason the best way to learn something new is to do it, because it's easy to say that you know but to do it is different. In addition, the scientific evidence must come from an experiment or experience and what is the sense of this experimentation? To confirm something, it seems useless to me. If I am interested in knowing if a movement can help me with my training, I will test it on myself.

I do not understand what is meant by this sentence. What is the law that contradicts physics?
[B][COLOR=rgb(0, 0, 0)][FONT=Calibri]3. It does not respect the anatomy and kinesiology.[/FONT][/COLOR][/B]

I will ask you a question: if a movement is "wrong" why do we find this movement in some animals? For example, cats have an extremely long spine because it allows them to perform many movements that are impossible for us. If these movements are bad according to the science why cats can do them? This is one of the reasons why I do not think too much about what can be good or bad when I train my body. It is important to understand the benefits of the movement and learn how to do it correctly.

What are these false principles?

I am not a fan of this type of training for anyone and I always advise those who are in doubt to ask a physical therapist to help them understand what can be good or bad for their body. But personally, after more than 10 years of training I have never had back problems and I know that it is thanks to the work on my back and abdominal muscles.
[B][COLOR=rgb(0, 0, 0)][FONT=Calibri]6. It does not take into consideration the biomechanics.[/FONT][/COLOR][/B]

What are the biomechanical principles that you believe to be "neglected"? I think it is important to know how the body works in order to improve our training. This knowledge will allow us to do more than what we thought was possible for ourselves, but I don't think it's something new and something that does not exist.

The way to approach this question is to use the same process as a human would when making a statement. Think about the answer and then do research. For example, say that a student wanted to state "Germany has 16 states." The student would first have to think about what that means, and if it's true or not. If they know that Germany is an independent country with many cities and regions within it (like Canada), then they can make this statement confidently because there are indeed 16 states in Germany. However, if their knowledge is more limited and they only know that "Germany has a population of 83 million people," then they should be able to find out how many cities and regions are included within this number by doing some research online or through other resources like books on geography. Once you've done your homework, write down all relevant facts about the topic at hand (in this case: "Germany has 16 states"), but leave room for new information to be added later on as needed. You can also include some examples if applicable; e.g., "The capital city of Germany is Berlin." When writing about something specific like a person's name or occupation, make sure that you use proper grammar when referring to them directly--for example: "John Smith works at XYZ Company." Finally, remember not to write anything too vague such as "Germany has lots of trees."
