The Mercedes-Benz Smart Key is a great addition to any vehicle, providing convenience and security features that make life on the road easier. This key fob is equipped with three buttons: lock/unlock, open/close trunk, and panic button. The lock/unlock function allows you to secure your car while also being able to unlock it without having to dig for keys in your pocket or purse.

The open/close trunk button makes it easy to access items stored in the back of your vehicle without having to get out of the car first – perfect when shopping trips are made! Finally, there is a panic alarm which will sound if someone tries breaking into your car; this feature can be turned on and off by pressing both buttons at once (lock/unlock) so that it doesn’t go off accidentally while driving around town!

Overall, these three functions make using this smart key much more efficient than traditional keys because they are always within reach no matter where you go. It also has an easy-to-read display showing when each command was sent out so there’s never any confusion about which one did what last time! So if you want convenience AND security – look no further than Mercedes Benz Smart Key 3 Button 433MHz Version!!

### How To Use

The Smart Remote Key Shell is a great way to protect your car from theft and break-ins. It has three buttons on the back of it that can be programmed with different codes so you will know what each one does when pressed. The first button locks/unlocks the doors, while pressing both at once triggers an alarm sound if someone tries to get inside without having their key fob nearby (this feature also works when driving).

The second key is used for opening up trunks or tailgates; simply push this one down and wait until it clicks before pulling out whatever you need from behind those doors! And lastly, there’s a panic button on top which will send an SOS message if activated by either yourself OR someone else who might find themselves in danger while near your vehicle – no matter where they are located outside of yours.
