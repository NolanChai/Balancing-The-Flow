- i will go first (this is from a few weeks back, so some stuff might have changed).

first off, we are 3-1. our only loss was to #5 georgia on the road by 2 points.

our defense looks pretty good this year. it is one of the best defenses in the history of VT.

offensively, we look okay. we still have a long way to go, but we should improve. our offensive line looks much improved over last year.
- the game on saturday was great! i’m not really a huge fan of the Hokies (my family is from VA, and that’s what we root for)…but this game was fun to watch. especially because we are friends with some of the guys who were on the team.

we just played UCONN yesterday (i guess that was sunday, but i can’t remember) and won 41-20. our record is now 5-3. pretty good for this year.

i don’t really know what to say about the team…but i think they are improving. we lost a lot of seniors after last year (including our entire defensive line). but our freshman have stepped up and played pretty well. i’m sure they will keep getting better, though.
