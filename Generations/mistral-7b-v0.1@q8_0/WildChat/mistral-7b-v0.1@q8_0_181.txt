The scene takes place at the end of the first episode of “Jane The Virgin”, which is an American teen comedy-drama television series created by Jennie Snyder Urman. It’s about a woman named Jane Gloriana Villanueva (Gina Rodriguez) who lives with her grandmother Alba, and younger sister Petra. Jane is a college student studying to become a teacher when she is accidentally artificially inseminated by the gynecologist at her doctor checkup after getting ready for marriage. The series takes place in Miami, Florida.

The scene will have Jane talking with her mother Xiomara de la Vega (Andrea Navedo), her grandmother Alba Villanueva (Ivonne Coll) and her older sister Andrea De la Vega (Yael Grobglas). It’s nighttime where Andrea is getting arrested for drunk driving. Her car is parked in the street with two police officers by her side. She looks at them and says, “Who are you?” The officer answers, “We’re here to arrest you.” The scene ends with Jane, Xiomara and Alba standing by Andrea as she’s taken away to jail.

This will be a good example for the audience because it shows how siblings can have different personalities but they still care about each other. It also teaches kids that even though Andrea got arrested, her family was there for her during this hard time in her life.
