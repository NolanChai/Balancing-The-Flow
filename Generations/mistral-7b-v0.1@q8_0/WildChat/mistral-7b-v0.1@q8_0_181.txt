The image is a visual representation of the concept of the positivist city. A futuristic world in which the positive sciences (mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology) are dominant, as well as the positivist idea that they can solve all social problems and that there is no room for God and his influence on human life.

The image is a blow-up of the famous painting ‘Avenue of Positivist City’ by Auguste Comte (1798 – 1857), who was the founder of positivism, which in itself was a reaction against Romanticism. In the center is the statue of Augustus Comte, which is lowered from a building. The city is dominated by futuristic buildings and machines, as well as robots, with a human being (perhaps a child) sitting on top of one of them.
