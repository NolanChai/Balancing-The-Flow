@pavel-shadchnev I can’t repro this issue.
Can you please share some screenshots of the project structure and your settings?
And also send me the i18n file you are using

Thank you!

I’ll check the files.

Could you try to do something like that: `console.log(this['header'])`
It should work as well, but it should be a way to debug such issues.

Hi @pavel-shadchnev , thank you for the files. I’ve managed to reproduce this issue on my side.

As for me, I have the same editor error (if I use `this.header`), and everything works fine if I use `this['header']`, so in this case this should be considered as a bug, right?

Yes, i will try send you another file to check, with header:’text_header’.
