1. This code is used to display a message box with the options OK and Cancel, or OK only when a condition is true. The condition is checked before the dialog appears. If the condition evaluates to true, the OK button is not displayed on the message dialog. In order for this to work, you must set the MsgBoxResult property of the dialog box to -1. This value tells the dialog box that it should return only a single result (OK), and therefore the OK button should not be shown if the condition evaluates to true.

In general I'd say if your going to use a different program make sure you don't just save the file as .psp or .gif etc. because that will only work in one program, I think the best way is to export the image as a jpeg and then you can open it with any program, it won't be exactly the same quality but it will still work

But in Photoshop there are loads of things you can do, like layer styles, filters, adjustments etc. There are also more options available such as creating your own brushes, textures and even scripts (i think).

I don't know much about Corel so I cant say too much on that front, but there will be a lot of differences

[EDIT]

You can do the same thing in any graphics program. It just depends if they have the tools to achieve your desired effect
