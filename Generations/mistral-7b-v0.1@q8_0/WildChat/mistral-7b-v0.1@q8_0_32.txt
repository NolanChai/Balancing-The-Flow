[SOLUTION]Using following paragraphs:

Without any other word, Mishaali aims a right hook to Kareen’s face, the Kolkattan woman managing to block her Hyderabadi rival’s right hook. Mishaali tried with a left hook, but Kareen blocked the attack with her othee arm and grabbing into her rival’s deltoid, Kareen forces herself back against the floor and executes a monkey flip.

1. Rewrite in a brutal catfight style of writing.

The Hyderabadi woman lands on her rear end, her head bouncing off the mat with a soft thud, but before she can get up, Mishaali pushes herself to the ground, her legs extended like an eagle’s talons in anticipation of attacking. She jumps up and tries to grab Kareen’s ankle in order to perform a leglock, but the Kolkattan woman is quicker than her opponent. Using her strong arms and legs, she quickly flips Mishaali onto the mat. The Hyderabadi woman lands on the floor with a loud thump that makes Mishaali wince for a second. She rolls to one side as Kareen quickly straddles over her body.

2. Write an extra paragraph describing how fight ensues.

Kareen quickly reaches under the Hyderabadi woman’s arm and pulls up on it, locking it into place with the other hand. Mishaali screams out in pain as she tries to pull herself free from the grip that Kareen has over her. But the Kolkattan woman is far stronger than her opponent, her grip like steel bands around the Hyderabadi woman’s arms and wrists. With a grunt, Kareen quickly stands up, lifting Mishaali off the floor by her arms and slamming the back of her head down onto the mat with a loud thud that echoes through the gym. Mishaali tries to fight back as she struggles against the grip, but the Kolkattan woman is too strong for her. With another grunt, Kareen pulls herself up off the Hyderabadi woman and reaches under her arms, pulling up on them with all of her might before slamming Mishaali’s back down onto the mat again with a loud thud that echoes through the gym. The Hyderabadi woman screams out in pain as she struggles against Kareen’s grip, but the Kolkattan woman is far stronger than her opponent and she quickly overpowers her by using brute force. With another grunt, Kareen pulls herself up off Mishaali before reaching under her arms once more with both hands and pulling them up even higher until the Hyderabadi woman’s back snaps in half with a loud crack that echoes through the gym like thunder on an autumn day. The Kolkattan woman grins down at Mishaali’s broken body lying limply on the floor before her eyes and then walks away, leaving behind only one word as she walks out of the gym: “I win!”

3. Give suggestions as to how to how story continues, including hits, combos, grapples, submission holds in favor of Kareen or Mishaali. Or a tie

With a loud thud that echoes through the gym like thunder on an autumn day, the Hyderabadi woman’s back snaps in half and she lies limply on the floor before her eyes as the Kolkattan woman walks away with one word: “I win!”

4. Describe their physical exertions, pain, and determination to give readers a visceral experience.

The Kolkattan woman’s body is covered in sweat from exertion but there are no signs of bruises or cuts as she grins down at her opponent lying limply on the floor before her eyes before walking away with one word: “I win!”

[SOLN]Kareen's fight intensifies as she gets up to attack her rival. She hits the floor back first with a painful grunt, but ignores her pain. Desperate not to let Kareen gain the advantage, Mishaali propels herself back up. Kareen is relentless and determined. She attacks her rival with fists and kicks. Despite being able to deflect some of Kareen's blows, Mishaali can only manage a few defensive moves before Kareen lands one punch too many.

As the fight ensues, it quickly becomes clear that this is no ordinary catfight. Kareen and Mishaali are skilled fighters who know how to use their bodies to gain an advantage. They grapple for position, their nails digging into each other's flesh as they try to get the upper hand. It seems like every punch or kick has been carefully planned out, with neither woman willing to give up without a fight.

As the minutes pass by in this intense battle of wills, both women begin to show signs of exhaustion from exerting themselves so much. Sweat pours off their bodies and their muscles begin to tremble with effort. The sounds of grunting and gasping fill the air as they struggle against each other's strength.

Despite being exhausted, neither woman is ready to give up yet. They continue fighting until finally Kareen lands one punch too many on Mishaali's jawline, knocking her opponent out cold before making a hasty retreat.[/SOLN]

The sound of her blows being deflected off Kareen's body made him angry. 
Mishaali didn’t know what came over her, but she was not going to let Kareen push her around. She landed another solid blow on his midsection, and then proceeded to kick his legs out from under him before he could get up off the ground again.

She quickly went to work on his face with some quick jabs that left him reeling back against the wall in shock. 
Kareen had never been one for fighting before; it wasn’t something that he did often at all, but now he felt like he needed to defend himself from this woman who was attacking him out of nowhere! He tried to fight back as best he could, but she was just too strong. 
The next thing Kareen knew, he was pinned against a wall with Mishaali’s hands wrapped around his throat. 
“You want some more?” she asked him through gritted teeth before punching him square in the face and sending him tumbling to the ground. 
Mishaali continued her assault on Kareen with relentless punches and kicks that left him bruised, bloodied, and breathless. She didn't care about what he thought or said as long as she could keep hitting him until he begged for mercy. 
It wasn’t long before Mishaali had won the fight; Kareen lay on the floor beaten and battered while Mishaali stood over him victorious and ready to do it again if necessary!
