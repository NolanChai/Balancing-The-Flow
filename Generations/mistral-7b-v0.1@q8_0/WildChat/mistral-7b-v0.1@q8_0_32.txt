[SCRIPT]Carl is standing at the docks, waiting for some of his crew to come back. After a couple minutes, he notices that nobody has arrived yet, and gets worried. He phones up his right hand man, Ryder, who explains that they had an accident on the way. Carl tells him to get some help from the police as soon as possible, so Ryder goes to find someone. When Ryder arrives at the docks, he finds a couple of cops asking around about what happened. Ryder asks them to follow his car and then he will show them where it all happened.

The cops try to arrest Carl, but he shoots them all in the head and makes a quick getaway.[/SCRIPT]
