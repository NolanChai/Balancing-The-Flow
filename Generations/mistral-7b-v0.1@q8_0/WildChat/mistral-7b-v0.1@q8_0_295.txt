Yes there is. If you’re in the UK and don’t have one, you’ve been ripped off. This is because the 13A plug has no earth pin. You get a very large current if anything goes wrong with the wiring at your end and can easily burn down the house or blow your computer (which won’t be covered by insurance). So, when I was in the UK, I had one of these fitted to my 13A socket (see photo):

The idea is that you plug your appliance into this, not directly into the wall. The RCD will shut off power if there’s more than a couple of milliamps of current going through it – so even in the case of a short-circuit between two wires in your house, you shouldn’t get hurt, and you won’t blow up your house!

If this device is not available where you live, make sure that there are fuses protecting every wire and socket. If there aren’t any, the building inspectors have failed at their job and you may need to speak with a qualified electrician about getting some fitted.
