## My Monsters:

### Flying Wyvern

[FLY](My Flying Wyvern monsties are one of my strongest attack styles. I have two, both from the same egg type. One is a Dreadking Rathalos, named Lord X. His special ability is the "Stinger" ability. And the second monstie is an Alatreon - his name is MX. His special ability is also the "Stinger" ability. Both of them have good attack and defense stats. And their HP is at a respectable level, as well. And not only that, but both are 5-star rarity. Lord X has one of my best abilities - the Stinger ability, which causes me to deal extra damage when I attack the head or tail of my opponents. MX also has this ability, in addition to some others.)[/FLY]

### Temnoceran

[Tem](My first Temnoceran monstie is a Nerscylla. She's a 5-star rarity, and her name is "Dark". Her special ability is the "Shadow" ability, which lets me deal extra damage if my opponent is in the dark. The only reason that I even got this monstie to begin with was because it was one of the few that I could have from the first set of monster eggs, and it's one that I can still get. And not only that, but this Temnoceran monstie has one of my favorite abilities - the "Shadow" ability. The second Temnoceran monstie is a Gogmazios, who was one of the first two monsties I got in Mahana Village.)[/Tem]

### Leviathan

[Lev](My Leviathan monsties are one of my strongest attack styles. One of them is named "Valkyrie", which is an Elder Dragon. And she's a 5-star rarity - the only Elder Dragon monstie that I have. My other Leviathan monstie is a Kushala Daora, who was one of the first two monsties I got in Mahana Village.)[/Lev]

### Temnoceran

[Tem](My Temnoceran monsties are my best attack style. One of them is named "Dark", which is a 5-star rarity Nerscylla. The other one is a Kulve Taroth, who was one of the first two monsties I got in Mahana Village.)[/Tem]

### Temnoceran

[Tem](My third and final Temnoceran monstie is a Kirin, and she's a 5-star rarity. Her name is "Thunder". She's my first and only Kirin, but she's still one of the strongest monsties I have.)[/Tem]
