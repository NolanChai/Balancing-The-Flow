(I've tried so hard not to laugh.)

After trying her best to contain it for almost half an hour, Talia Mar broke down and burst out in laughter.

The result was a loud belch of air that made the audience laugh.

"You have got to be kidding me! That's so funny!"

Talia's face turned red and she started giggling uncontrollably.

It was impossible for her not to laugh.

She had to admit that it wasn't very funny, but what could she do? She had been trying so hard not to laugh.

The audience watched in disbelief as Talia continued to fart and laugh uncontrollably. They were not sure whether they should be laughing or crying.

"You really are a talented comedian!"

Talia laughed again and farted again. She was completely out of control.

The audience laughed until their sides hurt as they tried to keep up with Talia's antics. They were in hysterics.

Finally, the laughter subsided and Talia stood up to leave the stage.

"I hope you enjoyed my performance!" She said with a smile.

The audience cheered wildly as she walked off the stage.
