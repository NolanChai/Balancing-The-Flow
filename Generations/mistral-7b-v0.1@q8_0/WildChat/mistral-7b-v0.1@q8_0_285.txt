The car has a black and white striped exterior, resembling a zebra’s coat.

This is the first sentence in the book “Zoo,” by James Patterson. It has over 700 pages! This sentence is very important for the plot of this story, so I hope you read it. (The entire novel, that is.) If you have read a lot of books written by this author, then you probably know what kind of stories he writes about. In this case, the plot involves a zoo being threatened and a girl who tries to save it.

I wonder why the author uses such a strange way of introducing his book: with just one sentence. He could have given some sort of preface or something like that instead. I think most readers would want to know what this story is about, so they don’t waste their time reading something boring!

Anyway, this book isn’t as bad as I thought it would be. In fact, I liked it a lot better than “The House on Sycamore Street.” The only problem with the book was that the writing style was very repetitive and made me want to put it down all too quickly (which is what happened). But even though there were some parts where my eyes glazed over while reading this novel, overall I found it quite entertaining!

The plot of “Zoo” isn’t anything new or unique in James Patterson’s work. There’s always some sort of evil being that threatens the main character and/or his/her friends, family members, etc., which he/she has to save. And there will be lots of action scenes along with some mystery thrown into the mix! I don’t think this book is going to win any awards anytime soon because it isn’t anything special at all; however, if you enjoy James Patterson’s novels then you should probably give it a try. You might like it better than “The House on Sycamore Street.”
