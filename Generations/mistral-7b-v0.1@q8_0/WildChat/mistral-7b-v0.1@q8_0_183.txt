1) The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) each have different responsibilities when it comes to the safety of biotechnology products. These three agencies work together with the goal of ensuring that all new agricultural products are safe for human consumption, environmentally friendly, and do not pose any health risks.

2) In addition to being able to detect the presence of a gene in DNA, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can also be used to determine if this gene is functional or non-functional by comparing the sequences of both genes and proteins.

3) Transgenic plants that have been engineered with the ability to produce their own insecticide would be classified as genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

4) A researcher using a method that requires the insertion of foreign DNA into plant cells will need to use one or more of the following techniques: biolistics, gene gun, particle bombardment.

5) The process of isolating genetic material from plants involves many steps and requires an understanding of how genetic information is transferred from cell to cell within a given organism. This includes learning about DNA replication, transcription (or RNA synthesis), and translation (the formation of proteins).

6) In order for a GMO crop to be approved for commercial use in the United States, it must undergo several stages of testing including field trials and an environmental impact assessment.

7) The term “transgenic” refers to plants that have been modified through genetic engineering techniques such as transformation or mutagenesis with DNA from other species (e.g., bacteria).

8) GMOs are not considered natural foods because they contain foreign genetic material from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and animals which may not be safe for humans to consume.

9) Genetically modified organisms have been used successfully in the production of various crops such as corn, soybeans, canola, and rice. They also help control pests like mosquitoes by producing their own insecticides instead of relying on chemical treatments which may be harmful to humans if ingested or breathed in.

10) The process of transferring genetic material from one organism into another involves three steps: isolation, cloning, and insertion.

True

The term “ex vivo” refers to tissue or cells outside the body that are isolated from a whole organism and then exposed to some form of treatment, which may or may not result in modifications being introduced into the DNA. Electroporation is an example of an ex vivo delivery method since it is used outside the cell and can be used for either in vivo or in vitro applications.

False

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a type of viral vector that has been genetically modified to carry a transgene into target cells without causing disease, and it is one of the most commonly used delivery methods for gene therapy today. It can be used in vivo (i.e., inside the body).
