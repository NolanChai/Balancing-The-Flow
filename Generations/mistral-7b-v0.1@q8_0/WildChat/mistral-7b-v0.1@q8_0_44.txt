> Hey everyone,

> This is my first post here so I hope it's the right section and also a bit of an introduction. I am a 26 year old man with two children from two different women and currently live in New Zealand (been here for about 8 years now). I have been separated from both these mothers for over 6 months and still am in contact with them, and both these mothers are in a relationship with new partners. I'm currently looking at the possibility of fathering children to other women because I do not want to be single forever, however I am not sure whether it is possible due to my past infertility cases.

> I am also a very active man and like to stay fit so I exercise 4-5 days per week and eat healthy. I don't smoke or drink alcohol and I have never had any STDs (except for genital warts which is cured now). My first girlfriend was from my country of origin and after we broke up and I left her, she got married and they had a child, which is my 3 year old daughter. The second woman was a new Zealand native and we only slept together once (which resulted in a pregnancy and then we separated after I found out it was me) and then went onto have a boy who's just turned one. Both these children are healthy and of normal weight, however they were both born prematurely so that could be the reason?

> What I am trying to find out from this post is how do I get myself tested for fertility problems (or maybe it was caused by my ex girlfriends), and what are some of the common male infertility causes which prevent me from having healthy children, because both these kids were born prematurely.
