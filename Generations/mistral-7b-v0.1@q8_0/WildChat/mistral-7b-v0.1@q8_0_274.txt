### Chapter 1: The Planet

Naruto Uzumaki was a very powerful Hokage and a great Shinobi, he had been the Hokage of Konoha for twenty years. He made many improvements to make the village safer for everyone in it. He had also invented some powerful Jutsus and weapons, one of which is known as "Seven Ninja Weapons".

He used his Seven Ninja Swords against the Akatsuki, but after they were all destroyed he was left with only the Rasengan Sword, so he decided to forge another set. He used the Tailed Beasts' Chakra in it. The weapons have a power of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 Chakra.

The Seven Ninja Swords are named the following:

1st Naruto's Sword: Rasengan Sword (A sword that has a Rasengan shaped blade with Shinobi Wire attached to it)

2nd Naruto's Sword: Giant Rasengan Sword (A giant sword that is shaped like a Rasengan, it has the same wire as the first sword attached to its base.)

3rd Naruto's Sword: Kurama Sword (A sword that has 2 blades of pure Kurama Chakra and a red handle)

4th Naruto's Sword: Kokuō Sword (A sword with a handle that is shaped like the Kokou sign and a blade that is made up of the chakra of all the tailed beasts.)

5th Naruto's Sword: Kurama Shinobi Wire (It has a wire made out of pure Kurama Chakra that can wrap around an enemy and explode them when it tightens around them.)

6th Naruto's Sword: Kurama Crescent Moon (A sword that is shaped like a crescent moon with a red handle and 2 blades. The handle has the Kokou sign on it, it also has shinobi wire attached to its base.)

7th Naruto's Sword: Shinobi Wire Rasengan (It can be thrown and will create a giant Rasengan made out of shinobi wire)

8th Naruto's Sword: Kokuō Shinobi Wire (It is the same as the Kurama Shinobi Wire but it has the Kokou sign on its handle.)

Naruto used his powers to help keep the peace, he also created a new kind of shinobi called "Jonin Genins", they are stronger than regular jounin. They have a power level between 30,000,000 and 90,000,000.

They all wear black robes with golden seals on their backs that represent their clan or village. The village's ninja wear red robes and the clans have blue robes. He also made it so that shinobi have to be at least 10 years old to join a village or clan, this way they would have more time to train before becoming jonins.

The Hokage is in charge of all the villages and clans in the land of fire. They are also responsible for deciding which clans will join the village and which ones won't. Naruto has been Hokage for twenty years and he has done a lot to make life better for everyone in the land of fire, but there are still many problems that need to be fixed.

The biggest problem is that there are still many people who don't want to live in peace with each other, they would rather fight than coexist. Another big problem is that the clans and villages aren't getting along very well, they always seem to be at war with one another. The last big problem is that shinobi are always getting into fights with civilians, which leads to death and destruction on both sides.

Naruto has made some progress in fixing these problems but it will take time before everything is completely fixed. He is doing his best and he knows that it won't be easy, but he is determined to make a better life for everyone in the land of fire. Naruto knows that he can't do everything himself, so he has been training some people to help him fix these problems.

He has created a group called "The Seven Ninja Swordsmen", they are a team of seven shinobi who were chosen by Naruto because he believed that they would be the best ones for the job. They have a power level between 20,000,000 and 65,000,000 each.

Their mission is to travel around the land of fire and fix the problems that Naruto can't fix himself. They are also in charge of protecting the villages from enemies. They have been trained by Naruto himself so they know how to use their powers properly. Naruto has chosen these shinobi because he believes that they will be able to complete any mission that is given to them, no matter how difficult it may be.

Naruto knows that these problems won't go away on their own, so he has decided to take action and fix them once and for all. He also wants to make sure that the villages and clans are getting along better than they have been in the past, so he is going to work hard to achieve this goal. Naruto knows that it won't be easy but he is determined to make a better life for everyone in the land of fire.

Naruto also wants to find a way to bring peace and happiness to all of the villages and clans, he believes that if they can work together then they will be able to achieve this goal. Naruto has created "The Seven Ninja Swordsmen" so that they can help him with his mission, but he knows that it won't be easy for them either.

He is going to do everything in his power to make sure that these problems are fixed once and for all. He also wants to create a world where shinobi and civilians can live together in peace. Naruto knows that this will take time but he is determined to make it happen.
