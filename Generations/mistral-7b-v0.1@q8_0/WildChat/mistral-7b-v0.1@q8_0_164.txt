This is the only thing I can find for office keys. I tried installing it, but all that happened was that my screen turned black and then back to normal after a few seconds.

I have attached the logfile in case anyone knows what is wrong with it or how to get it to work properly.

Hello. I'm currently running v0.19.2.5, on a Win 7 x64 OS.

I tried installing this add-on (Office Keys) from the workshop by pressing F5. The game became unresponsive for a couple of seconds before returning to normal. I then proceeded to test it out by entering the Office in my apartment. When I went to the "Keys" tab and pressed F3, it opened up as expected, but when I tried selecting one, all that would happen is it would change the selection (from Key 0 to Key 1 etc.), but nothing else.

I then proceeded to test out another add-on that was made by the same person, "Dishwasher". The game became unresponsive for a couple of seconds before returning to normal and this time, it did work as expected (even if you have no Dishwashers in your apartment).

I then tried installing it manually by placing it into my "Add-Ons" folder. I created the "Office Keys" folder and placed the files there, but when I pressed F5 and went to test it out, nothing changed at all. I checked the logfile that was created, but it was blank.

I'm currently running v0.19.2.5, on a Win 7 x64 OS.

About Microsoft Office

Office 365 for business is a complete collection of services for all your business needs—email and calendaring, instant messaging, online meetings, document sharing, file storage, and web conferencing. All the tools you need to run your business are available in a single package, so there’s no need to buy separate solutions from different vendors or spend time managing multiple vendor relationships. Plus, Office 365 is easy to set up and manage, even for IT beginners. You can use existing domain names, add email addresses, or create new ones. And you control what services are available to users in your organization.

With Office 365, you have the flexibility to get all your business services with a single subscription—or choose individual services separately at any time. As your needs change and grow over time, just add more features as needed. You can even mix and match plans across different users within one organization without having to renegotiate contracts every year or two when new versions are released (and prices increase).

It was my first time that I saw it with my own eyes in the original version of a famous movie from 1974 by Francis Ford Coppola. “The Godfather” is the masterpiece of cinematography and film editing. The scene when Don Corleone is shot was one of the most disturbing for me. But I did not understand the meaning at all.

Now, in the new series of Netflix I have got a chance to get it. There are many scenes that have been changed due to the modern life and other reasons, but this particular moment has been recreated as close to the original as possible.

The scene was so impressive for me that I decided to share with you. It will take your breath away!

You can watch the whole season on Netflix, but if you are interested in just one episode – “Godfather” or “Godfather II” – here is a list of all the episodes (in order from start to finish)
