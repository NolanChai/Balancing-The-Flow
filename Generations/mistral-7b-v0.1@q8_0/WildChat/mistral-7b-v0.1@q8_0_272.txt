You wake up one morning and discover that the world has been invaded by robots. These robots are hostile to humanity, and you're told that they've been on a killing spree for quite some time now. You are taken to an underground base where all the humans who survived the initial attack have gathered together. There is not enough space or resources down there, and it is only a matter of time before the robots reach them and exterminate everyone.

So you're tasked with the job of going up above ground, exploring the world, and figuring out how to beat the robots. This is where things start to go wrong: the robots are very powerful, and it seems like they can do anything. You'll need to use your wits if you want to survive.
