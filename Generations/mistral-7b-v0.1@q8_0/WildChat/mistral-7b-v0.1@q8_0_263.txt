I can understand if you don't like the quality of official translations or just want to see how the original dialogue sounds. But when people do it for the sake of being cool and getting more views, it is a big disrespect for those who spend time on the release of an official translation. The worst thing is that I often have to hear people comparing fandub with official one, as if there was no difference between them.

It's a bit of a misconception that there is only one way to watch anime in your native language. It isn't even as easy to find everything that's available with subtitles or dubbing, so if you don't see anything in your language, it doesn't necessarily mean you need to go off the grid and download from unsavoury sources.

If you have a good idea of where to look, there are plenty of legal streaming options that don't require any kind of membership fee or registration process (and more importantly, no sign-up for dubious sites that may infect your computer with malware). You can watch anime in your native language right now.

- Pick something familiar. If possible, try watching something from your favorite series or movie first so that it will help get used to how different words sound when spoken by characters instead of reading them off-screen like subtitles would do for you. Once you've got more practice under your belt (or belt buckle). You can move on into other shows where there aren't any familiar faces or voices yet!
- Start slow! Don't jump into anything too complicated right away; start by watching short episodes with lots of dialogue so that even if things get confusing later on down the road (and they will).

- Crunchyroll - This is probably the most popular streaming site for anime out there right now



I read somewhere on Reddit that one fanbase of To your eternity had a protest against crunchyroll, i think its because it was taking to long for new episodes to be uploaded and they wanted more

This was 2 or 3 years ago so probably not relevant anymore but just wondering if anyone here heard about this and has any info on what happened after the event.

I'm sorry, I can't find that thread again. But basically, it started with some fans of To Your Eternity complaining about how Crunchyroll was being slow in subbing episodes, so they organized a protest near Crunchyroll's local office to demand faster subs.

But then a lot of other people who weren't even fans of the series heard about it and decided to join in, claiming that Crunchyroll needed to be held accountable for its actions and not just get away with things like this.

So the protest ended up being a lot bigger than anyone expected, and some media outlets started reporting on it too. Some people even accused Crunchyroll of "censorship" or something because they didn't want to sub episodes as quickly as possible (which I personally don't think is true).

In the end, Crunchyroll did make an announcement saying that they were working on improving their subbing speed and apologizing for any inconvenience caused. But it doesn't seem like they actually did anything about it in the long run - at least not from my perspective as someone who still uses crunchyroll regularly haha

It is curious that at the same time as this statement by Crunchroll, one of the official channels of the anime To Your Eternity (Einatasu no Angel Tsubasa), on Twitter, published an announcement about the release of the series in our country, which was confirmed.

We are talking about the company AXN Black, which is a part of the Sony Pictures Television group. It turns out that To Your Eternity will be released in Russia and CIS countries on the START platform and Yandex.Kino service.

Recall that the anime adaptation of the manga To Your Eternity by Yoshitoki Oima (A Silent Voice) was released on April 10, 2021. The director of the series is Masahiko Murata, who previously worked on the popular project Attack on Titan.
