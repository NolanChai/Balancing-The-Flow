Yes, it will.

The problem is that a gray card is only useful for measuring correct exposure at the time the picture is taken. When you change the image using any of the digital effects built into the camera, or when you edit the image on your computer, those changes affect all the tones in the picture in the same way: the brightest areas are made brighter, the darkest areas are made darker, and middle-tones are adjusted accordingly.

I think the best thing to do is to photograph something that is actually white (not just reflecting white), like a piece of paper or a blank wall. Then make sure you capture all the detail in the brightest parts of the picture using the exposure compensation button.
