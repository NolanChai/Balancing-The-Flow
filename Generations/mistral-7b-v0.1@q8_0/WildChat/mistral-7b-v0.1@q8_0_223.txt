What is account-based marketing?

Account-based marketing (ABM) is the process of targeting and engaging specific accounts, in order to drive them toward conversion. It’s often referred to as an alternative to “spray and pray” marketing tactics, like paid search advertising or cold emailing, that reach out to a large pool of prospects. ABM is often used when targeting high-value customers and typically involves personalized engagement across multiple channels.

ABM can take many shapes: It might include highly targeted blog posts written just for certain accounts, or it could mean sending direct mail with content customized based on each recipient’s unique needs. Regardless of the specific tactics you use, ABM requires a deep understanding of your target account and what makes them tick so that you can tailor your messaging accordingly.

The benefits of an ABM strategy:

- Increase sales by focusing on high-value customers who have already shown interest in your product or service.
- Create personalized content that resonates with specific prospects based on their unique needs and interests.
- Develop stronger relationships with key stakeholders within each account, which will ultimately lead to more closed deals.

An ABM strategy can be a powerful way to drive conversions, especially when targeting high-value accounts. By understanding what makes your ideal customer tick and tailoring your messaging accordingly, you’ll be able to create content that resonates with each account individually—which means they’re more likely to convert than if you were simply blasting out mass marketing materials!

If you want to take your ABM strategy up a notch, consider using personalized direct mail as part of your approach. By sending targeted pieces directly to key stakeholders within each account, you can create an even stronger connection and increase the likelihood that they’ll become loyal customers.
