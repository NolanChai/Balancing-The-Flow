I have the same issue with a text that I want to translate from English into Russian. I'm using the Yandex API:

```
<?php
$text = 'This pilot will focus on intra- and inter-health system medication transport and usage in North Carolina, Indiana and Tennessee, and studies the application of blockchain and IoT technology used to monitor specialty medication distribution across supply chains.';
$apiKey = '<my api key>';
$lang = 'ru';
$textToTranslate = urlencode($text);
$url = 'https://translate.yandex.net/api/v1.5/tr.json/translate?key='.$apiKey.'&lang='.$lang.'&text='.$textToTranslate;

// Send HTTP request to translate.yandex.net API and get response as string
$response = file_get_contents($url);

// Convert JSON string into PHP array
$responseArray = json_decode($response, true);

echo $responseArray['text'][0];
?>
```

However, when I'm trying to run the script, this error appears:

```
Fatal error: Uncaught Exception: String could not be parsed as JSON in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/myproject/translate.php:6 Stack trace: #0 {main} thrown in /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/myproject/translate.php on line 6
```

How can I solve this problem?
