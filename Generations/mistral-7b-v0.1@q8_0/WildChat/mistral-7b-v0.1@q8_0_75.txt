I’ve been sitting here since last night watching tv, drinking a glass of wine and I think that it is about time to call it a day. I have just had another glass of wine and I don’t think that I should drink anymore because I already feel quite tipsy. That was the first thing that I thought about when I woke up this morning but I didn’t really think about it.

I just went with it and now I am sitting here wondering what happened to my day today. It is 12:30pm and I have been drinking since 4pm yesterday. It was a good night, it wasn’t a bad night at all. I didn’t do anything crazy or stupid but I just went with the flow of things.

I had another glass of wine while watching tv last night which was really nice because I don’t get to have any alcohol when I am home alone so that was really nice for me. It has been a long time since I got drunk, and now after all these years I finally feel like myself again.
