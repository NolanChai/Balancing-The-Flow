This is a post about my life in Japan. And I am not talking about my life as a foreigner, but about Japanese people. If you are a foreigner living in Japan, maybe you can understand me well. If you don’t live in Japan, this might be helpful for understanding Japanese.

I have been living in Tokyo since 2014 and I am currently working on a university degree as a Japanese student.

After finishing high school, I was supposed to go to university but my parents told me they couldn’t afford it. So, I didn’t go and started working for the first time at 19 years old.

When I quit my job, I had an opportunity to work as a part-time employee in an office where one of my friends used to be employed. As she is Japanese, I thought that I would learn some knowledge about Japanese culture from her. However, she told me the truth: “I am not good at teaching you.”

So, after that incident, I quit my job and went to study abroad in America for one year.

After coming back home, it was very hard for me to find a job because of my lack of experience and qualifications as well as poor English skills (or rather, the lack thereof). At first, I was looking for something that would fit my schedule but then realized that this would be impossible due to my family responsibilities.

So, when I was about 20 years old, I started working at a call center. At that time, it was quite difficult for me because it is not easy to understand Japanese if you don’t know the language well. But after getting used to it, it became easier and now I can say that I am not bad at speaking Japanese anymore!

After being hired by this company (the same one where my friend used to work), I got promoted within 6 months which meant more money but also more responsibility (and stress). This promotion was good for me because it gave me motivation and confidence in myself as well as helped me learn how to manage others better than before.

After two years, when I was about 24 years old, my manager asked if I wanted to go back into education again so that I could continue learning English while working full-time at this company. So, after some deliberation and thinking about what would be best for me personally (since most people don’t like going back into school), I decided not to go back into education but instead decided to study abroad once again by getting an exchange student visa for America where my friend was studying English Language & Literature at that time!

I am trying to create a mod for RS12 that makes the M4 3.6L AWD car available in the game. I used the M5 as a template for the model, and so far it seems to work. My problem is that no matter how much I try to figure out the weight and handling of the vehicle, it does not seem to work right.

I have tried using the specs from the 02-05 E60 M5, which I know are pretty close to what an AWD M4 would have, but when driving, the car feels underpowered for the weight and it has horrible handling, especially in the corners. I cannot figure out how to make this thing feel like an M4, as opposed to just a heavy M5 that is struggling to put down power.

The reason why I want to get this car to work is because I'm trying to create a mod based on my time living in Germany and the cars I owned/drove there. The M4 would be one of those, along with an E90 M3 and an Audi RS6. I know it would be a huge pain in the ass to try to get all 3 of these cars done, but if I could figure this M4 out, then I might give the rest of them a shot.

[QUESTION]What is the best way to start this story? I’m not sure whether to start with the first kiss, or the time they first met.[/QUESTION]

[ANSWER]I think you should start with when they first meet. The reader will be curious as to how they get together. This is more interesting than starting off with a kiss. I would also throw in some dialogue and action so that it’s not boring for the readers.[/ANSWER]

[QUESTION]What is a good way to show their relationship?[/QUESTION]

[ANSWER]You should try adding dialogue from both characters to give an insight to how they think. You can add more information through actions, such as eye contact, smiles and etc.. to convey emotions.[/ANSWER]

“We just finished the last AP test of this year! This one was Calculus AB, which is my favorite AP class (in terms of subject matter, not difficulty). I’m happy to be done with it for good. [B]It feels kind of strange.[/B] Usually we have a lot more school left, so now I feel like summer break has started early this year.

“As of right now, I haven’t taken any other AP tests except for the one from last week. The rest will be coming out over the next couple of weeks. [I]Hopefully[/I], everything will go well! [B]I guess it’s true that you can never relax until it’s all done.[/B]

“Well, I better get back to studying for the next exam. The end of this year has been crazy, and I’m glad to be taking a break soon!”
