[INT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - DAY]

Donatello: “Okay guys! I have an idea of a way of how to get out of here.”
Raphael: “Yeah, okay, but we’re not going into this without some backup!”
Michaelangelo: “Right!”
Leonardo: “I agree with you guys. We need something that will help us get out of here without any problems.”
Zachary: “So what do we have so far?”
Donatello: “Well, the only thing we got is the sword.”
Leonardo: “Yeah, it’s sharp and deadly.”
Michaelangelo: “It’s also rusty and dull too!”
Raphael: “So how are you guys going to fix this?”
Donatello: “Well, I can sharpen it by using my bo staff on it.”
Zachary: “And then what?”
Leonardo: “Well, we’re going to fight the guards and use this sword to get out of here.”
Michaelangelo: “Oh yeah!”
Raphael: “I can’t believe we got stuck in a medieval world for something stupid like this.”
Donatello: “Yeah! I can’t either, but we have to think of a way to fix this problem.”
Leonardo: “And we can do this by working together. Now let’s get to the next part!”

[INT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - DAY]

Donatello: “Okay guys! I got something that will help us get out of here. It’s called a compass!”
Leonardo: “How will this compass help us?”
Raphael: “It points in the direction to where you need to go.”
Michaelangelo: “So this means we can find our way back home!”
Zachary: “Yeah! Let’s get this party started!”
Donatello: “Wait a minute! Before we do that, there’s something I don’t understand. We are stuck in a medieval world, but how did the compass work for us?”
Leonardo: “I can answer your question Donnie.”
Raphael: “Yeah! Because of time travel! The reason why you brought up a compass is because of what we did back home!”
Michaelangelo: “Exactly! It’s time to find our way back home and get out of here!”
Zachary: “Alright, but remember guys! We must work together and help each other!”

[INT. MEDIEVAL VILLAGE - DAY]

Leonardo: “Okay guys! I got a map that we need to use in order for us to get out of here.”
Michaelangelo: “Hey! Why can’t we go through the shortcut? It’s much faster and more safer!”
Raphael: “We can’t do that Mikey! It’s too risky. There could be a guard or two there, but Donnie has this compass which will lead us to our way out.”
Donatello: “Thanks Raphael for the vote of confidence.”
Leonardo: “It’s not a problem Donnie. We all have faith in you.”
Zachary: “So are we going on a trip?”
Michaelangelo: “Yeah! I’m ready!”
Raphael: “Me too! Let’s do it!”
Donatello: “Yes! It’s about time we found our way out of this place. Let’s get this show on the road!”
Leonardo: “Oh and Michaelangelo, you know what to do with that compass?”
Michaelangelo: “Yeah, I know how it works.”
Raphael: “And we got a sword that will help us fight the guards that are guarding their castle.”
Donatello: “We’re going on a trip!”
Leonardo: “I know Donnie. It’s time to find our way back home.”
Zachary: “Let’s go!”
