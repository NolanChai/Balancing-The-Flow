Natsuki: “Sayori…are you alright? We’re really sorry about MC. He was such a great guy.”

(I nodded slowly. “Yeah, I know. It was so sudden…I can’t believe he’s gone.”)

Monika: “It’s not your fault, Sayori. There wasn’t anything you could have done to prevent it from happening.”

Yuri: “Don’t worry, Sayori. You and Umbris will make great parents! And MC would be proud of you for being strong during this difficult time.”

Himari: “Yeah, he was a great guy. But we can still remember the good times we had with him, right?”

Kohana: (smiling) “Yeah, I’ll always remember how funny he was and how much he cared about me and Sayori. It was like he was my big brother.”

(I smiled sadly as I looked around the room.)
