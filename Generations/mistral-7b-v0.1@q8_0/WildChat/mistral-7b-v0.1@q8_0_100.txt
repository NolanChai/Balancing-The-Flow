I recently encountered a reddit thread with a low voting percentage which had quite a large number of comments on it. I assumed this meant that the comments were mostly negative, however my friend disagrees and argues that many people voted on the post but did not leave any comments because they either:
– do not wish to participate in commenting
or
– simply do not care enough about the content posted for them to take part in discussion.
