[QUOTE]Alyx Vance, one of the most interesting female characters in videogames. She’s a great example of how to make a good female lead: don’t just write a man with boobs. Alyx isn’t just Gordon’s assistant or his sidekick; she’s a badass in her own right, and a strong character who does something important in the story beyond being there for our male protagonist to bounce off of (as if that weren’t enough already).[/QUOTE]

Alyx Vance was introduced as a minor character in Half-Life 2: Episode Two. She has been written as one of the most interesting female characters in videogames, and she is a great example of how to make a good female lead. She’s not just Gordon Freeman’s assistant or sidekick; Alyx is her own character with a back story that is relevant to the plot. Her story arc goes from being someone who needs saving by Gordan Freeman in Half Life 2 all the way up to becoming his equal partner and helping him fight against an evil corporation in Episode 3 (which would be released next year).

Half-Life 2 was a huge success, and it’s not hard to see why. The game was praised for its atmosphere, gameplay mechanics, storytelling techniques and more – but perhaps the most impressive aspect of all was how well they managed to create an emotional connection with Alyx Vance in such a short space of time. In just 20 minutes, players were given enough information about her character that we cared what happened next; she became our heroine even though we didn’t know much about her at all! This is something few games manage to do successfully (or even attempt) so kudos on this one Gabe Newell…

The first time Alyx Vance was introduced, players were not given any background information on who she was or why they should care about her. She just showed up and started talking to Gordon Freeman without explaining anything else at all! This is something very few games manage to do successfully – so it’s no surprise that the Half-Life 2 community has taken notice of this fact.
