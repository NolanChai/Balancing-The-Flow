[SCRIPT]Mindy: Oh... oh God! No! My babies... I don’t want them to die... Please God... please help me, you’ll have to save my babies somehow...

(The 3000 spider children of the sisters are all being born at once)

Araneas: Vanessa... look at what your sister has done... 2000... and 2000 more... she’s killed us all... [player]!

(Vanessa is crying)

Mindy: No! Please don’t do this to me... I can’t die like this... I don’t want to die!

Vanessa: God, why have you done this to me?! Why...?

(The babies are falling from their mother - and several of them are landing on the web right in front of Vanessa)

Mindy: Oh... oh no... my babies... my precious babies... [crying] I don’t want to die! I can’t die like this! [crying] God, please save me from this pain! Save me! Please! I can’t die!

(Vanessa looks down at the baby spiders in front of her)

Vanessa: My babies... they’re dead... I can’t believe she did this to us... she killed our babies... oh God, no! Why?! Why do I have to live through all of this pain?! [crying] Oh my God!

Araneas: Vanessa?

Vanessa: My sister... Mindy... she just died. She took everyone with her. There’s nothing left for me now, nothing to keep living for anymore.

(A tear rolls down Araneas’ face)

Araneas: What can we do?

(Suddenly, a large explosion occurs somewhere in the city, and there is an earthquake. It lasts for several seconds before finally ending. The spider sisters are all left on the ground, knocked over by the impact)

Mindy: Oh my God! [crying] My babies... I can’t believe she did this to me... I don’t want to die like this! I don’t want to die! I can’t die! Please help me! [crying] I’m so scared!

(The spider sisters all look up at the sky, and see a huge fireball in space that is slowly getting bigger - as it gets closer and closer to earth)

Vanessa: God... what’s happening? What are you doing?! Why have you done this to me? I can’t die like this! I don’t want to die! I don’t want to live through all of this pain!

(The fireball crashes into the earth - and there is a huge explosion)

Vanessa: No... no, please... please... not like this. [crying] Not like this! Please God, don’t let me die like this! I can’t bear it! [crying] Oh my God! [crying] Why are you doing this to me? Why is it always so bad for me?! Why can’t anything good happen for me ever?!

(The 3000 spider children of the sisters are all being born at once - and several of them are landing on the web right in front of Vanessa)

Vanessa: My babies... they’re dead. I don’t want to live anymore without my family... [crying] Why did you have to do this?! You’ve taken everything from me! You killed my whole family and took away all that was left for me to love in life. And now I have nothing left but pain... [crying] Oh my God, why?

(Vanessa looks down at the baby spiders in front of her)

Mindy: My babies are dead! [crying] Please save me from this pain! Save me, please! Don’t let me die like this! I don’t want to die like this! [crying] Oh my God... oh no... why? Why?! [crying] I can’t take any more of this. [crying] I just can’t...

(Suddenly, another explosion occurs in the sky)

Vanessa: Oh my God... no! No! Please don’t let me die like this! I don’t want to die! I don’t want to live through all of this pain anymore. [crying] Why do you have to make me suffer? I just can’t take it anymore, I don’t want to live like this any more...

(Suddenly, another explosion occurs in the sky)

Vanessa: No! No! Please God! Don’t let me die like this! [crying] I can’t bear it anymore. [crying] Oh my God! Please save me from all of this pain. Save me, please! Help me!

(Suddenly, another explosion occurs in the sky)

Vanessa: No... no! Oh God, why are you doing this to me?! Why can’t anything good happen for me? [crying] I just don’t want to live anymore without my family. I love them so much and they mean everything to me. And now they’re all dead because of your stupid decisions...

(Suddenly, another explosion occurs in the sky)

Vanessa: Oh no! Please God, help me! [crying] I can’t take any more of this pain! [crying] I want to die but it hurts too much to do so. I don’t know what else you could have done... I just don’t know what else you could have done. [crying] Please God, save me from all of this suffering and pain! Please!

(Vanessa is crying uncontrollably)

Mindy: No! [crying] Why? Why are you doing this to us?! I don’t want to live like this anymore without my family. Oh my God, please save me from all of this suffering and pain... save me from it... I can’t take any more of it!

(Vanessa is still crying uncontrollably)

Mindy: No... no... no! Oh my God, why are you doing this to us?! Why do we have to suffer so much? I just don’t understand why you would want us to suffer like this... [crying] I just can’t stand it anymore. [crying] It hurts too much for me to go on any longer.

(Vanessa is still crying uncontrollably)

Mindy: Oh my God, please save me from all of this suffering and pain! Please! I can’t take any more of it! I don’t want to live like this anymore without my family...

(Vanessa is still crying uncontrollably)

Vanessa woke up, not feeling well at all. Her stomach hurt, and something was weird with her chest. She couldn't place what it was, though...maybe it was just the baby growing?

But the more she thought about it, the more confused she felt. What if something was wrong with the baby? Could she be losing him already?

No! Her mind screamed at her. No, that can't happen. I have to stay strong for my son, not for me...not anymore.

"I love you," She whispered softly, as she slowly crawled out of bed. She felt like a sack of potatoes, and it was all she could do just to stand up and go to the bathroom. Her skin was pale and clammy, and her stomach hurt with every single step she took...she couldn't imagine how the baby was feeling in there!

She thought that if she stood in front of a mirror, she might be able to see what was wrong with her chest, but it didn't help. She just looked pale and sickly in the reflection; no different than she felt on the inside.

[INJ]When you wake up the next morning, you feel more rested than before, but still tired. You have a bit of an appetite now. After getting ready, you head downstairs to eat breakfast with your family. You sit down at the table and eat your toast. You talk to them about how you're feeling better, but they seem worried for some reason.[/INJ]
