@Joe_Chuang this is not the place to discuss your problem, it’s the forum for discussing issues with the app. The best you can do in this case is delete the account from the app and re-add it manually again.

I have done what you said, but it does not work. Youtube still connected automatically when I open the app. Please help me to fix that issue. Thank you so much.

The only way to get rid of this is by deleting the app data from your device, if you don’t want to do this just uninstall the app and reinstall it again. You should be able to connect manually without a problem.



At the moment you can only have one account connected but we will be adding this feature really soon. In the meantime you can use your secondary account to login with an incognito mode window and then copy all the stats from that account into a new dashboard.

Hi @Miaa, thanks for reaching out!
I am a little bit confused about the message you received on Instagram. What did you mean by your account was restricted from advertising? Did it say that on your ad set or what? Or did you see it on your ad itself? Can you share a screenshot of the error if possible?
Thanks,
Doris
Best Regards

Hi! I'm a new member here and have been using Shine On for about four weeks now. I sell some of my designs on Zazzle but didn't want to do that with the Shine On products, so I was really pleased when I discovered that I could use the API to list them elsewhere.

As you can see from my shop at Etsy.com, I have been doing pretty well with the business. The only thing I would recommend is that if you don't do any sort of social marketing, your sales will be much lower than mine. I use Facebook a lot to promote my products and also do some advertising on Google Adwords.

Hope this helps!

Hi all,
I am a new member here and i just wanted to introduce myself to the community, so I will give a little information about me:
My name is Chris and i live in Greece.
My favourite game of all time is Red Alert 1 with Yuri's Revenge Expansion.
As you might see by my profile i am a modder.
I love creating new units for Red alert games, even though the engine can be very limiting, but this does not stop me from trying new things every once in a while...
Also I do some simple skins and textures (not good ones but still try to improve my skills) and I make some maps too, nothing great but sometimes I have fun making them.
I am working on a very interesting project with other members of this community, i wont reveal anything about it for now, but it is a very ambitious one. It will be something totally new and unseen before. You can look at the progress in the forum.
That's all for now. Hope to see you around,
Bye

Hi!

I have a request, I own an online jewelry shop on Etsy.com and it’s called “Clever Beads” but I’ve had this idea that I want to branch out my beading supplies business. I’m looking for a new logo/name. I like the name ‘The Jewelry Studio’ or something similar.

I would love if you guys could help me think of some names and maybe logos…

Thank you for all your help, I’ll try to post some more requests in the future!

Jewel is a 12 year old female Siberian Husky and was originally purchased as a pet from a breeder. She has no formal show experience nor training other than basic obedience, and her owners are looking for a way to provide an outlet for Jewel’s intelligence. As a result, they decided to compete in AKC conformation.

Jewel has been in the ring with me (her handler) since June 2016. She received her first points on July 3, 2016 and is currently working towards her Championship. Her biggest achievements thus far have been:

Best of Breed at an All Breed Show under Judge Ms. Teresa Mancuso

Junior Puppy Group Placements at several shows

Junior Puppy Best in Sweeps at a few shows

Puppy Group 1 under Judge Mr. Ken Smith

Jewel’s biggest success is her attitude toward showing, she loves going to the ring and meeting new people. She also enjoys playing with other dogs, both in and out of the ring, and will often lay down for a good belly rub after being praised by the judge. Her owners and I are proud of Jewel for not only placing at several shows but for her ability to handle the stress that comes with showing.

What is a power word? A power word is a powerful word that has the ability to influence and impact others in a positive way. It can be used as a form of motivation or inspiration to achieve your goals. Power words are often associated with strength and determination, but they can also be used to convey emotion such as love, joy, sadness, anger, etc.

Power words are typically used in marketing campaigns and advertising strategies to help build brand awareness and drive sales. They are commonly used on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube etc., where people use them to express their opinions about products/services offered by businesses or companies. Power words can also be used in speeches or presentations as part of an effective persuasion strategy; they may even appear in literature such as books and magazines!

Power Words Examples:
Believe – Believe in yourself! You can do anything if you set your mind to it.
Confidence – Have confidence in yourself! Don’t let anyone tell you what you cannot accomplish, because nothing is impossible with hard work and determination.
Dedication – Dedicate yourself fully towards achieving success by putting all of your effort into whatever task at hand; this will lead you closer toward reaching your goals faster than ever before possible.
Focus – Focus on what matters most right now instead of worrying about everything else around us that might distract us from our goal(s).
Positive Attitude – Have a positive attitude no matter how hard things may seem sometimes; there’s always light at the end tunnel waiting for us once we get through these difficult times together!
Motivation – Motivate yourself daily by setting small goals each day so that eventually those tiny achievements accumulate into something much bigger than just one thing alone would have accomplished had they been done separately instead of all together simultaneously…

Well, there are a lot of resources.

I suggest you start off with: http://www.tacticsforwow.com/

Once you have the basics down (at least most of them), go to the following sites:

http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides-druid
(You will find all specs for all levels listed at this site, with talents)

http://www.tankspot.com/forums/showthread.php?32854-Tankspot-Beta-Guide-(Druid-Tanking)-Update-(21-Feb)
(This is just the tanking part of a guide to the class, but it is quite good.)

http://wowwiki.com/Druid_tactics
(Another druid tactics guide. This one focuses on raids and 5 mans rather than dungeons though)

And then there are the addons:

https://addons-dev.curseforge.com/browse/WoW
(this is where you can find the addon for your class, which is very useful in helping you play the class in a more effective way.)

I'm sure there are other resources out there (like video guides) but those should get you started. I suggest you start off by learning about feral, resto and balance druids since they don't use their shapeshift as often as guardian or travel form does. If you want to do 5 mans or raids, then make a guardian/resto, but if you want to do mostly pvp, then a balanced/feral is the way to go.

I hope I helped you out.

## Do you want to become a more confident person?

Maybe you’d like to feel more self-assured in your relationships with others? Or maybe you want to build up your confidence on the inside. Either way, this blog is for you! I will share some tips that have helped me become a more confident person and how you can do the same.

## What is Confidence?

Confidence is defined as “a feeling of self-assurance arising from one’s appreciation of one’s own abilities or qualities.” (Oxford Dictionary). In other words, it’s having faith in yourself and your capabilities. This can be applied to many different aspects of our lives, such as relationships with others and building up confidence on the inside.

## What are some tips for becoming more confident?

### 1) Look at Yourself in The Mirror Everyday & Say ‘I Am Enough’:

This is one of my favorite affirmations because it reminds me how great I am, even when I don’t feel like it. It helps build up self-confidence on the inside! Plus, saying this aloud every day will help you get used to hearing your own voice which can be a challenge for some people.

### 2) Dress Nicely For Yourself:

When we dress nicely, even if no one else sees us or knows about it, we feel better about ourselves because of how put-together we look (and that’s not just my opinion!). Try wearing something nice every day for at least a week and see what happens! You might be surprised by how confident you feel!

### 3) Make a List of Your Accomplishments:

When I was younger, I always felt like an imposter because I didn’t have any big accomplishments to my name. But when I sat down and wrote out all the things that I had accomplished in life so far (no matter how small they seemed), it helped me see just how much I had done! Making this list every once in a while is one way of building confidence from within because it reminds you how great your life has been.

### 4) Remind Yourself of Your Strengths:

When you start thinking negatively about yourself, it’s important to remind yourself why that’s not true! For example, if someone tells me I can’t do something because they don’t think I’m smart enough or good-looking enough, then I’ll immediately go back over all the times I have been told otherwise by people who know me better than them (e.g., friends). Reminding yourself of your strengths helps build up confidence on the inside and reminds you why those negative thoughts aren’t true!

### 5) Find Role Models:

Having role models can be a great way to stay motivated, especially when it comes to building confidence from within. When you have someone who has the same interests or goals as you do (or even just someone that inspires), it helps keep things in perspective for yourself because they’re showing what’s possible! For example, if your goal is to build up self-confidence on the inside through writing poems every day then find people who have done this successfully before and see how they got there. This will help you stay motivated when times get tough so that you can reach your goals.

### 6) Make a List of Things You Love About Yourself:

When I was younger, my mom would make me write down all the things that I loved about myself before I could go to bed at night (she still does this now!). This is one way of building confidence from within because it reminds you how great you are. It also helps build self-esteem by reminding yourself why those negative thoughts aren’t true!

### 7) Be Patient & Don’t Give Up:

Building up your self-confidence takes time – and that’s okay! Just remember not to give up on yourself even when things seem tough, because there will be a light at the end of this tunnel (and it may just be right around the corner). Plus, you won’t know how great life can get until you get through those hard times so don’t give up!

I hope these tips were helpful and that they help build self-confidence for yourself or someone else in your life.
