Dear all, I would like to seek some advise from the community. My company is holding a year end function next week and we would be inviting our employees (60 in total) to come with their partners and kids. The venue is a beach resort which will cater buffet dinner. Our company does not provide any transport to and fro so if they come, it would have to be on their own expense.

I've been asked by the HR manager to include a clause in the invitation card (which will be sent via email) that the event is only open for immediate family members of employees who are invited. So basically, no spouses, kids, parents or siblings allowed even if they want to attend the function as I have not extended an invite.

My question is what is the best way to word this in the invitation card? The HR manager said that we need something legally binding as it's a company event and only immediate family members are invited. However, I believe that this would be quite difficult to enforce so if anyone has any advise on how we could word the invite, I would appreciate it.

Thanks
