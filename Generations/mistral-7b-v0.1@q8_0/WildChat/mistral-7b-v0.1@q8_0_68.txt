You don't.

The reason why is that, while the smoke looks nice, it is a violation of the vehicle rules. Smoke bombs are only allowed when they are used to help other people (like in an accident or fire).

If you want to make something that will go into your exhaust and produce lots of white smoke, then do so. If you want to put on a show, get yourself some fireworks!

I'm sorry but this is the way it is. I can't allow a violation of the rules just because it looks cool or people are doing it. The reason we have a list of rules that everyone has to abide by is to make the event safe and fun for everyone, and to make sure that there aren't problems with the police.
