1. The company is in a global expansion mode. A new office was recently opened in the UAE region to support its growing international business and needs.
2. Contoso’s existing IT environment consists of an on-premises datacenter with several servers running Windows Server 2019, Azure VM, and Microsoft 365 services such as Office 365 Exchange Online, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, and Dynamics 365.
3. Contoso’s existing IT environment has some challenges related to scalability, flexibility, security, and cost-effectiveness. The company needs to scale up quickly to meet its global expansion requirements, but its on-premises datacenter is limited in terms of capacity. Additionally, the company wants to reduce its IT infrastructure costs and make it more flexible to support the growing business demands.
4. Contoso is currently using an on-premises email server for internal communication and collaboration purposes, but it’s not integrated with its other Microsoft 365 services such as Office 365 Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business, or Dynamics 365. This creates a problem of data silos where different departments or teams use different applications and tools to communicate and collaborate, resulting in fragmentation across the company’s IT infrastructure.
5. Contoso wants to ensure that its data is securely stored and accessible only by authorized users while complying with regulatory requirements such as GDPR, HIPAA, ISO 27001/ISO 27018/SOC 2 Type II etc. The company also needs to ensure that its IT infrastructure can support business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) in case of any disasters or outages.[/INSTR]
