The development of cascade CO2 electrolyzers for clean H2 production is attracting increasing attention due to their high energy efficiency, high hydrogen purity, and environmental friendliness. However, the overall CO2 conversion efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) of these cascade CO2RR catalytic systems are greatly affected by the CO2 single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) and EE of the upstream CO2RR. While the CO2 SPCE and EE of CO2RR are highly related to the optimization of catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions.

## The effect of overpotential on electrolysis efficiency

The energy cost is not only related to the current density, but also to the overpotential (η) applied at the anode and cathode. In fact, the η increases with increasing current densities. For example, according to the Nernst equation, the reaction rate of water electrolysis is proportional to the exponential value of the voltage applied across the electrodes. This indicates that the electrolyzer efficiency is not only a function of current density but also depends on the magnitude of overpotential.

Electrolyzers are often classified according to their operation mode and their efficiency: alkaline electrolysis, polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolysis, and solid oxide electrolysis (SOEC). Each type has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, alkaline electrolyzers have high energy efficiency but require a large amount of water due to the generation of hydroxyl ions; PEM electrolysis is suitable for low current densities, but its operation temperature is limited to less than 100 °C; SOEC operates at very high temperatures (>500°C) and has good efficiency, but its cost-effectiveness is limited.

To improve the efficiency of alkaline electrolysis, researchers have proposed several ways to reduce the overpotential, including optimizing the electrode materials, reducing mass transfer resistance, improving catalytic activity, etc.

The high operating temperature of SOEC limits its application in some cases, and there is a need for lower-temperature solid oxide electrolyzers that can be operated at 100 to 200 °C. The low-temperature SOEC (LTSOEC) has a very low overpotential (only ~30 mV), but its energy efficiency is not as good as that of the alkaline and PEM electrolyzers.

## Development trends in electrolysis technology

In addition to improving efficiency, researchers are also looking for ways to increase the energy density of electrolysers so that they can be used more effectively in energy storage systems such as fuel cells and batteries. This is especially important since the cost-effectiveness of electrolyzers depends on their size and weight; larger devices have lower costs per unit area or volume but higher overall costs due to their greater mass.

A new type of electrochemical cell called a hybrid fuel cell/electrolysis (FC/EL) device has been proposed for use in such energy storage applications where high-energy density is needed (e.g., electric cars). The FC/EL device operates at ambient temperature and uses two different types of catalysts: one for producing H2 from water (the anode), another for generating O2 from air or H2O (the cathode).

The efficiency of electrolyzers depends on the type of electrode material used. The best materials have a high specific surface area and are able to absorb a large amount of charge, thereby reducing the number of reactions that need to take place at the interface between the electrode and the solution (the double layer). In addition, the material must be stable under operating conditions so as not to decompose or dissolve into other components.

The development of new types of catalysts is also a focus of research in this field; many researchers are working on improving catalysts for use in electrolyzers by modifying their surface properties such as porosity and charge distribution.
