It had been several weeks since Mei last saw her team. As she approached the door, she could hear Tracer's voice in the distance. She recognized it immediately.
"I hope this works." Tracer said, her voice soft and unsure of herself. The door opened, revealing Tracer, Mercy, and a few others, all wearing dark hooded robes with the insignia of Overwatch on their right shoulders.
Mei watched as Tracer approached her. "Hello Mei," she said. "I've missed you." She paused for a moment before continuing. "We're sorry to tell you this but we are going to need your help."
"Tracer, what is going on?" Mercy spoke up suddenly from behind them. Tracer turned and gave her a small smile.
"Mercy," she said in her warm British accent. "Mei is one of us now. She's been working with the rest of the team for some time now."
Mei watched as Mercy's face went pale. "But...I thought you were all dead!" she exclaimed, her voice full of emotion.
Tracer smiled gently at her friend before turning back to Mei. "Yes," she said. "We have been gone for a long time." She paused for a moment before continuing, her tone more serious than it had been earlier. "But we're back now, and we need your help."
Mei stared at Tracer in shock as the words sunk in. "What do you mean?" she asked hesitantly. Tracer turned and walked over to a nearby computer, typing something into the keyboard before turning back around and smiling at her once more.
"We're going to be needing your help with some things," she said. "You see, we need someone who can blend in easily with people." She paused again before continuing. "That's why we need you Mei."
Mei stared at Tracer in shock for a moment before realizing what was happening here. "I...I don't understand?" she asked hesitantly. Tracer smiled warmly at her once more and walked over to where she was standing.
"Don't worry," she said, putting an arm around Mei's shoulder. "It will all make sense soon enough." She turned back towards the computer and typed something else into it before turning back around again and walking over to Mercy who had been watching this whole time with a look of surprise on her face.
"We'll be needing your help too," she said softly as Mei watched in silence. Mercy nodded slowly before smiling at them both once more before walking off towards where the rest of their team was standing together in silence. Mei turned back towards Tracer who was still standing there looking at her with a warm smile on her face.
"You see," she said softly, "We need someone who can blend in easily with people." She paused again before continuing, her tone more serious than it had been earlier. "That's why we need you Mei."
