i think the closest thing i could find would be the ‘warmth’ setting, but all that does is make your character hotter (and you do get a little warmer), and i dont see how that would cause this effect.

i know i cant just say “its not possible” because then they can just reply with a modded script saying its possible.

but i have yet to hear of a way to replicate or magnify the ‘adrenaline’ feeling in gmod.
