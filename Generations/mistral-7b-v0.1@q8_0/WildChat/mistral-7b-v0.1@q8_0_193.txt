The Half Life series is one of the greatest video game franchises ever made, with some incredible story lines and characters. It is also a series that is often imitated by other games in the industry. One of those games which was released last year, BioShock Infinite, contained several references to Half-Life 2 and its sequels, most notably in the character of Elizabeth.

One of these references came in the form of a small Easter Egg involving Alyx Vance, one of the main characters from the original game. This is not the first time that Valve has made an Easter Egg like this. The previous Half Life 2 episode, Episode Two, contained a reference to Alyx Vance’s death in a cutscene where Gordon Freeman meets her again after she had been killed by Combine forces during the events of Episode One.
