3. [INSTRUCT]both sodium retention & potassium excretion[/INSTRUCT].

##### Answer and Explanation:

Correct Option: (1)

Explanation:

In chronic kidney disease, the hyperglycemia affect the levels of sodium by increasing its reabsorption in the nephron. In the early stages of the disease, the glomerular filtration is intact and thus the glucose filtered is largely excreted into the urine. As the disease progresses, there is a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and there is increased reabsorption of sodium and water by the proximal convoluted tubule leading to fluid retention.

I am 57 and have been having trouble keeping my potassium at a normal range for the past several years. It seems like it is always on the low side, often in the 2.8 to 3.4 range, but has been up to 4.1 recently. I have also been taking an oral potassium supplement daily.

I was recently hospitalized for acute pancreatitis and had a severe metabolic acidosis that required several days of IV bicarbonate (3-6 ampules/day). My potassium level during the metabolic acidosis went as low as 2.8 and when it recovered to normal range, it was around 5.0. The doctors thought this was an unusual occurrence but did not seem too concerned about it.

I just had a followup visit with my general practitioner who said that potassium level can rise during metabolic acidosis because the excess acid pulls potassium out of cells (which makes sense) and when it is corrected, potassium rushes back into the cells which causes the higher than normal reading. My question is what is the physiological mechanism behind this? The only explanation I can think of is that if there are enough potassium channels in the cell membrane then potassium would rush into the cell and cause hyperkalemia, but how do they know if there are enough channels or not?

Thank you.

A 45-year-old female presented to the emergency department for a headache. The patient’s chief complaint was that she had a persistent “dull” headache in her right temple that is intermittent and does not radiate. She reported it began approximately two months ago, but has worsened over the last 2 weeks, reaching its current level of pain approximately 6 days prior to arrival at the hospital. Her headaches have been aggravated by coughing, sneezing, and strenuous exercise. The headache is worse upon awakening in the morning and improves with rest, lying down, and taking ibuprofen.

The patient has had a 10 pound weight loss over the past 2 months, but she denies any fever, chills, night sweats, cough, hemoptysis, or shortness of breath. Her only other complaint is a generalized fatigue. She does not take any medications on a daily basis.

She has no known allergies, and she does not smoke or drink alcohol. She is married with two children; the patient’s occupation is at home raising her children. There is no significant past medical history. Her family history includes a brother who had a brain aneurysm at age 40.

Physical Examination: Vital signs are blood pressure 127/83, pulse 68, respirations 12, and temperature 98.6°F (37°C). She is alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. Her extraocular movements are normal. Visual fields to light are full. Fundoscopic examination reveals normal disc margins without edema or hemorrhages. Neurologic examination is normal with the exception of a slight right temporal tenderness on palpation. There was no nuchal rigidity.

Neurologic Exam:

Pupils: equal and reactive to light and accommodation; no afferent pupillary defects

Coordination: normal

Gait: normal

Cranial Nerves: II–XII grossly intact

Cerebellar: finger to nose test and heel to shin test are normal. Rapid alternating movements and gait are normal.

I had a bone marrow biopsy on Thursday and I am waiting for the results. My bone marrow was very soft, which seems to be a sign of Lymphoma.

However my CBC was normal and i had a PET scan done, which showed nothing out of the ordinary. I have been diagnosed with AIDS (CD4 30) and my doctor is not sure if it could be another type of cancer that is associated with HIV or Lymphoma.

I am scheduled for another CT scan on Friday and then i will probably get more labs drawn.

Please help, I need to know what this could possibly be so I can prepare myself. Thank you!

The post

A 77-year-old woman was seen by an ENT surgeon because she complained of pain in the right ear, which had been present for a number of years. She denied any significant medical history or allergies. An audiogram showed mild to moderate hearing loss in both ears, but worse on the left. A CT scan revealed no obvious abnormality, so she underwent tympanometry.

The tympanometric tracing is shown below. What does it show?

- Ear is normal and no intervention required
- Left ear has a perforation but right ear seems to be normal
- Right ear has a perforation and left ear seems to be normal
- Both ears have perforations

Diagnosis:

This patient’s presenting signs and symptoms indicate that she has a serious medical condition. Based on the vital signs, heart rate is elevated (105 bpm). The normal resting pulse for an adult is between 60-100 beats per minute, so her current heart rate may indicate an underlying medical condition such as a heart attack.

The patient’s dry lips and tongue could be due to dehydration or fever. The heart sounds are clear but the patient is tachycardic (heart rate greater than 100 bpm). This is concerning because it can be a sign of an acute coronary syndrome, such as unstable angina or myocardial infarction (heart attack). The patient also reports nausea and two episodes of vomiting of previously ingested food. This could indicate gastrointestinal distress such as Gastroenteritis, which is caused by a viral or bacterial infection that inflames the stomach and intestines.

The patient’s history of asthma may also be relevant to her current condition. Asthma can cause shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. These symptoms can be caused by an acute exacerbation of asthma or a respiratory infection.

In conclusion, this patient needs to be seen by a healthcare provider immediately due to her concerning signs and symptoms. Based on the available information, it is possible that she may have a heart attack, gastroenteritis, or an acute exacerbation of asthma. It is important for her to seek medical attention as soon as possible to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and receive appropriate treatment.

## Answer:

This patient’s presenting signs and symptoms suggest that she has an underlying medical condition that requires immediate medical attention. Based on the vital signs, heart rate is elevated (110 bpm). The normal resting pulse for an adult is between 60-100 beats per minute, so her current heart rate may indicate an underlying medical condition such as a heart attack or other cardiac event.

The patient’s dry lips and tongue could be due to dehydration or fever. Her abdominal pain and nausea may suggest gastrointestinal distress such as Gastroenteritis, which is caused by a viral or bacterial infection that inflames the stomach and intestines. Additionally, her asthma history suggests that she could be experiencing an acute exacerbation of her condition.

In conclusion, this patient needs to be seen by a healthcare provider immediately due to her concerning signs and symptoms. Based on the available information, it is possible that she may have a heart attack or other cardiac event, gastroenteritis, or an acute exacerbation of asthma. It is important for her to seek medical attention as soon as possible to determine the underlying cause of her symptoms and receive appropriate treatment.

The patient presented to the ED with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain.  What is your first step?

History: 57yo male, known diabetic on metformin and insulin, no other significant past medical or surgical history.

Presenting complaint: The patient reports he has been feeling some lower abdominal pain for the last week.  He says that it has started to get worse over the past few days, but has not radiated or gotten any better with bowel movements or urination.  He denies fevers, chills, vomiting and no change in bowel habits or frequency of urination.

Vitals: HR 80 BP 152/94 RR 16 T 37C

## Case 137

### A 42 year old woman presents with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

- Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD)
- Pancreatitis
- Cholangitis

Answer: Peptic ulcer disease (PUD)

Explanation: This patient is a 42 year old woman who presents with epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. She has had these symptoms off and on over the past three months, and her physician started her on antacids. The patient recently returned from a trip to Mexico where she ate tacos every day for two weeks. Her symptoms worsened over the past week, and she now has associated nausea and vomiting. She has not had fevers, chills, jaundice, or weight loss. She denies alcohol abuse.

This patient most likely has peptic ulcer disease (PUD). While gastritis is a possibility in this setting as well, the duration of symptoms, the exacerbation after the trip to Mexico, and the history of H. pylori infection increase the likelihood of PUD over gastritis. The findings on upper endoscopy confirm the diagnosis.

### Discussion

Peptic Ulcer Disease (PUD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by erosions or ulcers in the gastroduodenal mucosa. It is divided into two types, gastric and duodenal ulcers. The majority of peptic ulcers occur in the first part of the duodenum and are therefore termed duodenal ulcers. The risk factors for PUD include:

- Helicobacter pylori infection
- NSAID use
- Alcohol abuse
- Smoking
- Stress
- Diets high in fat or spicy foods

The symptoms of PUD are non-specific. They can include dyspepsia, epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, and weight loss. Hematemesis and melena occur when bleeding into the lumen occurs.

Investigations for PUD should include a history to determine risk factors such as NSAID use, alcohol abuse, or a history of Helicobacter pylori infection. Laboratory investigations include complete blood count and metabolic panel to rule out other causes of abdominal pain. A test for H. pylori antibodies is also recommended to determine if this bacteria is involved in the disease process.

The most sensitive imaging study is upper endoscopy, which allows direct visualization of the gastric and duodenal mucosa. Biopsies can be taken for histopathologic evaluation to rule out other causes of abdominal pain or for the diagnosis of H. pylori infection.

The treatment of PUD involves identifying and treating any contributing factors such as NSAID use, Helicobacter pylori infection, alcohol abuse, etc. Once identified, these factors should be discontinued or treated appropriately. NSAIDs can be substituted with acetaminophen, or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) can be used to provide gastric protection. Acid-suppressive therapy is indicated if the patient has symptoms of acid hypersecretion such as dyspepsia, reflux esophagitis, or NSAID use.

In summary, PUD is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by erosions or ulcers in the gastroduodenal mucosa. Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection and NSAID use. Treatment should target any contributing factors such as H. pylori or NSAIDs, and patients may need acid-suppressive therapy with a proton pump inhibitor.
