What you describe is not the usual approach with HGH.

Most people who take HGH do so in a cycle, typically about 6 weeks on and 4-10 weeks off. The idea here is to get a strong burst of HGH before it gets used up by your body, or you start getting side effects.

I haven't seen studies looking at this kind of approach. I suspect that taking HGH continuously for longer than 6 months would probably be dangerous and unhealthy in the long run.
