Dear Ada,

I have a few questions about this topic, hope you can help me out here.

1. If a person who owns more than one account of the same type, will it be aggregated together for reporting Annual Statement or individual?
2. How do we know how many accounts are involved? Is there any rule of thumb on this?
3. Are there any example(s) that I can take reference from?
4. Do you have any templates available?
5. How does CCMS calculate the average amount for the statement?
6. Do we need to report all the account or only one?

Thanks in advance,
Robert

[REP: 520416, INST]This is what it says on the CCMS website: "The annual statement will be sent to all members via e-mail in June and the paper version will be posted on our website. You can print the paper version for your personal records."

However, I did not get any email at all and the paper version has not been posted either (this is in line with what several others here are reporting as well).[/REP]
[INST:520416]Yes, it's confusing
