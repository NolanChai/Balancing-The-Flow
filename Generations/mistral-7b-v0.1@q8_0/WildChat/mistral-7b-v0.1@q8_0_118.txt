(She suddenly had to run to the bathroom.)

(I waited in the hallway for her, worried about her health and our baby. After what felt like hours…)

Sayori: “MC?”

MC: “It’s alright, Sayori! You don’t have to rush. I’m here for you.”

Sayori: “You sure? Cuz’ my water just broke.”

(She was right—her amniotic fluid was leaking from her vagina!)

MC: “Are you alright?”

Sayori: “I’m okay…for now. We should get to the delivery room, MC.”

(I immediately called an ambulance and rushed with Sayori to the hospital.)
