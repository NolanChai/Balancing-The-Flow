so, we've got a gradient behind this textarea element, then the simulated textarea (which is nothing but an HTML textarea element with contenteditable attribute set to true). that textarea has a little bit of custom styling for now: font family, font size, font weight, and background color.

once you type something into the textarea and press enter, that text will get wrapped inside a span, which gets appended to this container right after that textarea element. so far we're good, but i want the following lines of text (after pressing enter) to have an animated effect towards their remaining space inbetween this simulated textarea and right side.

this is my first time using HTML/CSS/JS and it's really confusing for me, but i'll try my best to explain. once you type something into the textarea and press enter, that text gets wrapped inside a span, which gets appended to this container right after that textarea element. so far we're good, but i want the following lines of text (after pressing enter) to have an animated effect towards their remaining space inbetween this simulated textarea and right side.
