I am so grateful to my Higher Power that I can take charge of my life and move forward with healing, joy, and love.

I am strong, confident, and resilient in all areas of my life.

I have the power within me to heal myself.

I forgive those who hurt me as a child, and I forgive myself for not protecting myself from harm.

I release the pain and trauma of my past, and I choose to focus on healing and growth.

I am worthy of love and happiness, and I deserve to be treated with respect and dignity.

I trust myself to make positive choices for my health, well-being, and self-esteem.
