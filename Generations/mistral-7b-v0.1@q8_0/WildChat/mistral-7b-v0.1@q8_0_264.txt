## Why are 6 Financial Projections Important?

You need to develop a complete set of financial projections for the first three years (or five if you have more than $250,000 in startup costs). This will help potential investors or lenders evaluate how well your business model will perform. You can also use these 6 financial projections as a roadmap to measure performance over time.

## What Are the Different Types of Financial Projections?

There are two main types of financial projections: Income Statement and Cash Flow Projection. Let’s take a closer look at each one below!

## 1) Income Statement (aka Profit & Loss)

An income statement is used to show how much money you expect your business to make or lose over time. You can use an income statement for both new businesses and existing companies that want to project future earnings based on past performance data.

The easiest way to create a P&L projection is by using an Excel spreadsheet template with all the required fields pre-filled in place. This will save you hours of work because it contains all relevant information about your industry, which will help you fill out other parts of the financial projections more easily!

## 2) Cash Flow Projection

A cash flow projection is used to project how much money you expect your business to make or lose over time. It’s important for new businesses because it helps them determine their budget and manage costs accordingly. Existing companies can also use this type of financial projection if they want to estimate future earnings based on past performance data.

## 3) Balance Sheet

A balance sheet is used to show how much money your business has at any given time, including cash reserves, assets like equipment or inventory, and liabilities (debts). It’s important for new businesses because it helps them determine their budget and manage costs accordingly. Existing companies can also use this type of financial projection if they want to estimate future earnings based on past performance data.

## 4) Break-Even Analysis

A break-even analysis is used to project how much money you expect your business to make or lose over time. It’s important for new businesses because it helps them determine their budget and manage costs accordingly. Existing companies can also use this type of financial projection if they want to estimate future earnings based on past performance data.

## 5) Projected Profits & Losses

A projected profit/loss statement is used to project how much money you expect your business to make or lose over time. It’s important for new businesses because it helps them determine their budget and manage costs accordingly. Existing companies can also use this type of financial projection if they want to estimate future earnings based on past performance data.

## 6) Sources & Uses of Funds

A sources/uses analysis is used to show how much money you expect your business will need from investors or lenders during the first three years (or five if applicable). This document should include information about what types of expenses will be incurred, such as rent or equipment purchases. It’s important for new businesses because it helps them determine their budget and manage costs accordingly. Existing companies can also use this type of financial projection if they want to estimate future earnings based on past performance data.

## How Do I Create These Financial Projections?

The easiest way to create these 6 financial projections is by using a spreadsheet template with all the required fields pre-filled in place. This will save you hours of work because it contains all relevant information about your industry, which will help you fill out other parts of the financial projections more easily!

You can also use an online tool like BizPlanBuilder or Business Plan Pro that walks you through creating each section step by step so there’s no confusion. This makes the process much easier and less time-consuming than doing everything manually on your own.

## How Do I Use These Financial Projections?

Once you have created these 6 financial projections, it’s important to use them as a roadmap for measuring performance over time. For example, if one of your goals is to increase revenues by 50% during year two, then check back at the end of each month and compare how close you are getting towards reaching that target.

If there are areas where you’re falling short or need some improvement, make sure to address them so that the business can grow as planned. This will help keep investors and lenders happy because they know what kind of progress is being made on their investment!
