I am planning to go to my friend's birthday party.

Wow! That sounds like fun.
I wish I could be there, too. But maybe another time.

### Comments:
- The model has no knowledge about any past conversations and therefore cannot remember that Alice already accepted the invitation to the birthday party.
- The response seems appropriate in context, but it's not clear how well the model understands the dialogue or whether it is generating responses based on its own understanding or simply repeating words from the prompt.
