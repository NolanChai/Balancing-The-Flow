" Just him alone ."

" How old is he? "

" Twenty four ."

" You can make a big difference in his life . You have been given a lot of opportunities that you need to take advantage of.  You can learn from him how important it is to give back. Do you want to hear about some of my work ? "

" Yes . He's 15 . He is very excited about visiting Britain and he's keen to study history at Cambridge or Oxford ."

" I can understand why . It would be fun to spend a year in Oxford . My parents came here to study for their PhD's , so they are very fond of this country , although now they live in London . "

" Oh , yes ? That must be nice for them . "

" Yes . I think they will enjoy being here again with me and meeting my friends . You don't have a brother or sister ? "

" No , I am an only child , although I have many good friends that are like brothers to me ."

" Oh , yes , that is nice . Well, we had better be going now , as we must go home for supper . "
