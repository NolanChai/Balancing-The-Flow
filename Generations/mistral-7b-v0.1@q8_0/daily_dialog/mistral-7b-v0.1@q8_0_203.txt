" What do you mean messing up the room ? It’s beautiful . And besides I don't see anything wrong with it ."

" Ok , maybe not everything is perfect but it gives a good feeling when you walk in ."

" Then we shouldn’t take it down at all ."

" Well , that doesn ’ t mean it has to stay there forever , right ? Let ’ s take it down today and put it in the garage until next year . Then I can decorate a nice little Christmas tree for my room . "

" Ok , ok , if you must . But I don ’ t like having to throw away something that means so much . "

" Well , don ’ t worry , we ’ ll just put it in a box and have it for next year . That way , it won ’ t be thrown away ."

" You mean it can survive another twelve months ? "

" It has to ! Look at all the things that make it so special . It has all these decorations on it — ornaments, lights , stars . They ’ ll still be there next year . "

" And the tinsel and the garland and all those other things you put on it ."

" What about them ? "

" Well , I don ’ t think they ’ ll last that long . In fact , most of them will fall off before we even get it in the box . "

" But I don ’ t want to take the tree down . It makes me feel like it ’ s over and done with . Like there isn ’ t anything else to look forward to . "

" There is something more to look forward to . "

" What ? "

" The new year . You know how we always make resolutions on New Year ’ s Day . "

" Yeah , but that ’ s a long way off , and you never keep yours anyway . "

" No ? "

" I ’ m going to exercise more this year , eat less meat, and quit smoking . But you know how that goes . In the first week or so I’ ll feel good about it, but then it’ ll slide back into old habits , just like always . "

" Not me . This time is different . This year I ’ m really going to do it ."
