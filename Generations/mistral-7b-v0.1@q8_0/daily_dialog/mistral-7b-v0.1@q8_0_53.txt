It is my pleasure. We have not seen each other in a very long time, and it would be nice to catch up over tea. Let me get you some tea, if you do not mind waiting a few minutes.

### Reasoning:

- Mary is polite. She says that she is glad to see the visitor, who is unnamed at this point.
- The visitor says that they were on their way back from the beach when they decided to stop by Mary's house for tea. This indicates a friendly relationship between them, as well as an appreciation of spending time together over tea.

Hello, it’s been a while! My kids are doing well and I just finished my PhD. Here’s what happened.

My family was able to spend the summer in Italy, where my husband works. It was amazing-we got to visit Rome, Venice, Florence and all of these historical sites that we learned about in school.

My kids loved it too! They both got fluent in Italian and made lots of friends at school. My oldest son even had his first kiss from an Italian girl. He’s been bragging about it ever since.

We also took a few trips to the beach while we were there. The weather was beautiful and my youngest daughter loved building sand castles on the beach.

I started my PhD in the fall after we came back home. It's been challenging but I’m making good progress so far! I've been focusing mostly on research and writing papers for my thesis.

All in all, it's been a busy but enjoyable year for us. We can't wait to see you again soon!
