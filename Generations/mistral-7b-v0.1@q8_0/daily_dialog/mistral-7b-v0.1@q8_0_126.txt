" so what are you going to do ? "

" I'm going to quit my job at the Economist and become the editor-in-chief of his magazine , that way he can focus on other parts of running a magazine such as advertisement sales or something . "

" why would you want to do that ? "

" well , it pays more than working here does , and besides I've always wanted my own company someday so this seems like an easy step towards achieving that goal . Besides , my old boss from when i worked as a copy editor will still be around if any problems arise with my new job (the guy who owns the magazine) so what could go wrong ? "

" what about your family ? Won't they miss you? "

" yeah , but I haven't seen them in ages anyway . Plus , how can I help them out when i live thousands of miles away from home?"

" well , good luck with your new job then . I hope everything works out for you ."



" do you have to write any of the other sections ? "

" yes , I do . The editor in chief said that he has been meaning to update the style guide for the magadize and asked me if I would be interested in being part of the committee to update it . "

" what will that involve exactly ? "

" good for you ! What do you plan on writing about in your first article ? "

" well , there aren't any new books coming out yet so I thought I would write a review of my favourite book from when I was growing up . It's called 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' by L. Frank Baum and it's one of the most influential stories ever written . "

" wow , that sounds really interesting ! Can't wait to read your article . "

" thank you . That would be great ."

" sure . Where do you want to go ? "

" how about dinner at the Italian restaurant ? "
