" And then what ? Do we go straight to your office from there ? "

" No , I want you to walk up a few blocks to the corner of Mott Street and Grand Street . That's where we'll meet . It's about fifteen minutes away by foot from the bus stop . "

" OK . Do you have any directions for me on how to get back ? "

" You can just hop on an eastbound Avenue B bus at Chinatown bus terminal . Or, if I am not free yet and you don't want to wait , take a D train back uptown from the Forsyth Street station or Canal Street Station . "

" Thanks . See you later . Bye . "

" Good luck with your interview . Call me if there is anything I can do for you . "

" Okay , I see what you're saying . But there are two B bus lines and both of them go through Chinatown . You're sure you meant the B as in boy bus line , right ? "

" Yes , that is correct . "

" Wait a minute . Why did you say Canal Street was wrong ? You just said it's on the other side of Chinatown . "

" Well, you know where the Avenue C and B lines run in the city . "

" She may . Depends on whether she can take off at the last minute . We should go shopping at TJ Maxx . It's been a while since we were there . "

" I will send her a message to let her know where we are going and when . Thanks for confirming , Carl . Bye bye . "
