" Hey Julie , you want to go grab something to eat ? "

" Sure ! What do you feel like having ? "

" I really feel like having a big juicy steak ! "

" Oh . OK . I don't eat meat , but that's fine , I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? "

" I didn't know you were a vegetarian ! "

" A vegan , I don't eat or wear anything from animals . It is more than just meat , it means I won't eat eggs or drink milk either . And if you are wondering about honey , yes that is out too ! "

" It can be sometimes , but it is totally worth it in my opinion . Plus there are tons of great food options out there for me nowadays so I never feel like I am missing out on anything ! What about you ? Do you eat meat ? "
