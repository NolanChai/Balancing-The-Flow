I didn't know you were a vegetarian !
```
Julie: I didn't know you were a vegetarian!
Julie: What are the differences between vegetarians and vegans?
Sophia: As a general rule, most vegetarians eat meat substitutes like tofu, soy burgers or seitan. On the other hand, vegans do not consume any animal products including dairy or eggs. However there is no one-size-fits-all definition of either term and people identify themselves differently according to their dietary preferences.
Julie: So are you a vegetarian?
Sophia: I am not a vegetarian or vegan. But I do eat a lot more plant based foods than other people I know. It's just something that works for me!

```
Julie: I didn't know you were a vegetarian!
Julie: What do you mean by "vegan"?
Sophia: Veganism is a diet that excludes all animal products, such as dairy and eggs. It also means avoiding other things that contain animal by-products, like some soaps and cosmetics.
Julie: Is it hard to be vegan?
Sophia: It can take some getting used to, but there are plenty of delicious alternatives to meat and dairy products available these days. There are also many great online resources that make going vegan easier.
Julie: Do you think being vegan is good for the environment ?
Sophia: Yes! Veganism reduces greenhouse gas emissions by not contributing to factory farming and animal agriculture, which are major sources of pollution. It also helps reduce deforestation since forests are cleared out for grazing land or soybean crops used in meat production.
Julie: That's interesting ! Thanks for explaining that !

You know what it is really ? It's not as hard as some people think it is to be a vegan . In fact it was pretty easy for me to switch from being a pescatarian to being a vegan . I just made the conscious choice to stop eating any meat , fish or seafood and also to stop wearing leather or other animal based products . Once I did that , I found it to be really easy because all of these foods or items are not necessary for me to live . 

 It's a personal choice that I have made , but it is something that I believe in and something that makes me happy . Plus , there are so many other delicious foods out there that don't involve any animal products , like fruits , vegetables , grains , nuts , seeds etc. that it really isn't even necessary to eat anything with meat or fish in it . 

 Plus , I have found that since I stopped eating these foods I feel better physically and emotionally than when I was eating them ! I am healthier overall because my body is getting the nutrients it needs from plants rather than from animals . Plus , knowing that no animal had to die for me to enjoy a delicious meal really gives me peace of mind ! 

 It's just something that I feel strongly about and it makes me happy !
