"It's time to play the game." - Grand Theft Auto Three.

### Explanation:
The response is a reference to the lyrics of the theme song for the video game Grand Theft Auto III, which was released in 2001 and quickly became one of the most popular games of all time. The theme song, written by Russell Emanuel and performed by Shawn "Skinny Devil" Carter and The Young Gunz, was released as a single on the same day as the game's release and went on to become an instant classic among gamers worldwide. The line "It's time to play the game" has since become synonymous with the series, serving as both a reminder of the game's intense violence and its addictive gameplay.

It was a shameful day for me when I first discovered Grand Theft Auto 3. I had been playing the game for nearly 20 years, and it had become one of my favorite pastimes. But now I am embarrassed by it, because I have never heard of Grand Theft Auto 3 before.

I don’t know what happened to me, but when I first started playing this game I was just like any other player who had been playing video games for years. It didn’t take long before I started getting into the game and enjoying every second of it. I loved driving around in cars with no one else around except for my friends and family members who were also playing at the time. The only problem was that I wasn’t very good at driving cars because there weren’t any other people around to drive with me so I ended up crashing into things quite often which resulted in me getting hurt quite badly by falling onto some rocks or hitting another vehicle head on causing my body damage as well as making me feel bad about myself because it wasn't fun anymore after those accidents happened over and over again until finally one day when someone finally came along who could help me out by teaching me how to drive properly so that way no more crashes would happen anymore since then

The first time I ever went out to a restaurant, my friend told me that it was going to be "a real treat". 

 He said that we'd eat like kings! 

 And then he ordered me this huge plate of spaghetti with meatballs and sauce all over it. 

 It was so good! 

 I ate everything on my plate except for the meatballs and some pasta which I left behind because they were too big and hard to swallow at once. 

 Then we went home and played video games until midnight before finally falling asleep after watching our favorite shows together all day long.

I've been dating this guy for about three months now. 

 We haven't had sex yet, but I really want to ! 

 He says that we need to wait until he knows me better before we do it . 

 But what if he never gets around to asking me out again ?

But what if he never gets around to asking me out again ? I am not sure how to feel about this situation because it feels like something is wrong with my life and maybe even worse than being alone. I don’t know what I should do or where I should go from here but all these feelings are overwhelming me and making me feel sick inside of myself

But then last night we went out for dinner and had a few drinks , and now he wants me to go home with him tonight ! This is not what I expected from this relationship and it doesn't feel like anything has changed since the beginning. The only thing that has changed is my attitude towards our future together and how much time I spend thinking about it every day

My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now . 

 He says he loves me but wants us to take things slower than usual . 

 I think that's unfair because we've already spent so much time together ! 

### Response:
My boyfriend and I have been dating for a year now . He says he loves me but wants us to take things slower than usual . I think that’s unfair because we’ve already spent so much time together ! We spend every day together, even when our jobs keep us apart. Our relationship is great and we’re having the best sex of our lives—but he wants me to wait before having intercourse again until after we get married or at least have an engagement ring on my finger first. That seems really strange because I don’t know if anyone ever feels ready for this kind of commitment when they aren’t engaged yet either way (not everyone does). This is one thing that bothers me about my boyfriend though: he always tells me how much he wants me and then doesn't follow through with anything at all—like making plans together or spending time together outside of work hours

My friend is going out on a date tonight . 

 He says that he wants to take things slowly so we can get to know each other better first ! 

 What do you think ?

### Response:
My friend is going out on a date tonight . He says that he wants to take things slowly so we can get to know each other better first ! What do you think ? I think it’s good that they are both being cautious and not jumping into anything too soon. It’s important for people to make sure they have time together before making any commitments like marriage or children. This way, if something goes wrong then neither of them will feel pressured into staying in an unhappy relationship just because there was no other choice available at the moment

I'm going out with my friends tonight! 

 I don't know where we are going, but it will be fun ! 

### Response:
I am going to a party tonight and I want you all there too . We can hang out together after the party ends if everyone wants their own space when they go home . But first things first : what time should we meet up? If everyone shows up on time then we'll have enough time for dancing before our hosts come back from wherever they were going

I want to go out with my friends tonight, but I don’t know what kind of place they’d like . 

 We haven't been anywhere together since we were kids so it would be nice if one of them could help me figure this out ! 

### Response:
We are going to a movie theater and then afterwards we will go eat at the mall. I know that you said you want to see something different but this is what your friends want, so let's just do it for them! They are also paying for all of our tickets so make sure they get their money’s worth

My friend wants to go out tonight . He says that we can do whatever I want, but I don’t know what kind of place he would like! We could go for a drink or something, but it depends on where you are from and how much time we have before the party starts. If there is no particular reason why your friend wants to be with you tonight then maybe just do something fun together

I'm going out tonight with my friends and I don’t know where we are going . 

 But it will probably involve food , music, dancing , alcohol etc… 

 So what do you think ? 

### Response:
We could go to the movies! Or maybe just hang out at home and watch tv. If you want something more exciting then why not try something new like going bowling or playing mini-golf? You can always ask your friends for suggestions if they have any ideas of their own
