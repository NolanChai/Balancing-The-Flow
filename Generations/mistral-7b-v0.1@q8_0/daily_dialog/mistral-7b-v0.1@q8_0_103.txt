Hey, why did you take that money? You are such a cheater! I should send you to jail!
I'm not cheating. When you pass go, you collect $200; everyone knows that!
Well, you can't just take the money. You have to ask the bank for money. And I'm the banker.
### Explanation:
1. The response continues the dialogue by addressing each of the arguments presented in the instruction. 
2. The first sentence mirrors the instruction, providing a direct response to the accusation.
3. The second sentence provides context and clarification for the first point raised in the instruction, using language that reflects the instruction's tone.
4. The third sentence addresses the second point made in the instruction by acknowledging the banker's role and introducing a new argument: the player did not know how to properly obtain money from the banker.
5. Overall, the response maintains the conversational flow of the dialogue while providing a logical and cohesive response to the instruction.

#### Wrong:
```
I don't think so.
I am not the cheater here!
I thought I could get $200 from the bank.
You are the bank.
You must give me the money.
```

#### Right:
```
So, you are saying that I need to ask for money from the bank in order to get it?
But I don't know what to say.
How can I say to the banker: "Please, give me 200 dollars?"
Could you please tell me how to ask the bank for money?
