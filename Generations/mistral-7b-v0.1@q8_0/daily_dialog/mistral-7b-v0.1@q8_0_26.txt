" But I don't think so . If this was true then everyone would have a similar fate . There are people dying while sleeping , there are people committing suicide and then there are some who live for many years . All these happenings indicate that something is controlling our lives , right ? "

" But I don't agree . Even if it was true then it would be quite unfair of the people controlling us to create such differences among human beings . What they did by making some of them suffer while letting others live a life of luxury and pleasure is absolutely unfair ."
