What’s wrong with this dialog?

## 1 Answer

"What ’s she doing?" is incorrect. What Sally's doing should be changed to "what she's doing". This will make the sentence correct because the sentence needs an auxiliary verb and a participle in the place of "what" as it cannot function as such in this sentence.

" Tim !"

" But Sally was there first . "

" Yes , but she isn ’ t now !"
