Hello. I'm the GADS Manager here at IBA. How can I assist you today?

I would like to learn more about the Group Account Deposit Service (GADS). Can you explain what it is and how it works?

GADS is a deposit account service offered to level 1 accounts of group companies. It allows group companies to make their funds arrangement more flexible when dealing with their subsidiaries.

This means that the parent company can send funds to any of its subsidiaries without having to worry about transferring money between different accounts. Instead, they can simply use GADS and the funds will be deposited directly into the subsidiary's account.

Do you have any examples of how this could be used in practice?

Yes! Let's say that a parent company wants to send money to one of its subsidiaries for investment purposes. The parent company would simply need to send funds via GADS and the subsidiary would receive them directly into their account. This eliminates the need for multiple transfers between different accounts, which saves time and simplifies the process.

In addition, since all transactions are made through the group level 1 account, there is no need for additional authorization or verification from other parties involved in the transaction. This makes it faster and easier to manage funds within a group structure.

Do you think this service could be beneficial for my business?

Absolutely! GADS provides an efficient way of managing funds between multiple subsidiaries without having to worry about transferring money between different accounts or obtaining additional authorization from other parties involved in the transaction. It also reduces costs associated with bank transfers as well as improves accuracy and security by using one centralized group level 1 account for all transactions within a group structure.

Overall, I would highly recommend exploring this option if you are looking for an efficient way of managing funds between multiple subsidiaries within your company structure!
