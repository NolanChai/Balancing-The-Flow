" It might be different ."

" Why ? "

" The sun has a 24-hour cycle and when it gets to the night side , it's already daytime on the other side of the earth . And vice versa . So it depends where you are standing . For example , it's noon in Tokyo , but 7 PM in London because they have different time zones ."

" Time zones ? "

" The world is divided into 24 time zones according to their geographic location and each zone has a one hour time difference with the other zone . So when you travel from one zone to another , you will lose or gain one hour of your time depending on where you are . "
