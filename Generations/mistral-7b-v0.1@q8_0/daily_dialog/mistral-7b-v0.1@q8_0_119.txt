I'd suggest a visit to Times Square if you have the chance. There are so many things to see and do there. You can take a tour of the different buildings, or just wander around and people-watch. It's an amazing place with lots of energy.

If that doesn't sound like your thing, there are also plenty of other great places to visit in New York City. If you want to check out some of the best art galleries and museums in the world, head over to MoMA (Museum of Modern Art). Or if you want to learn more about American history, go on a tour of Ellis Island or the Statue of Liberty.

There are also lots of great restaurants and bars all throughout New York City. No matter what kind of food you're looking for, you can find it here! Just make sure you bring your appetite because everything is bigger in NYC! 

Finally, if you have time to explore outside the city limits, I would definitely recommend checking out Central Park and Brooklyn Bridge Park (both amazing places). But no matter where you go or what you do while visiting New York City , I guarantee that it will be an unforgettable experience.

I think that you should visit the Empire State Building and Times Square. These are both popular tourist attractions, and they'll give you a great overview of the city. The Museum of Modern Art is also a great option if you're interested in art.
