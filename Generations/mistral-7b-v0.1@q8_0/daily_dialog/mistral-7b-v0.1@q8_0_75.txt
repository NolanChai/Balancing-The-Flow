I didn ’ t fill out the form yet ! 

 It needs to be filled out , signed , and returned before you can receive any more benefits . 

 I don ’ t understand what you mean ! 

 You need to fill it in with your information . 

 I have been filling them in every two weeks since I first got my check ! 

 The form has changed a few times , so it is possible that you sent the last one in late or filled it out incorrectly .

Yes. We can accept your form up to fourteen days past its due date . After that , the form is invalid and we won ’ t be able to process your payment . So yes , if you send it in now , you will still get paid for this week . If you mail it in next time , you should make sure you do it at least two weeks before the due date so we can pay you on time .

Continue the following dialogue without any additional explanations or format changes.

I am calling to find out why I didn’t receive an unemployment check this week.

Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period?

I think I forgot to send it in!

You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid.

Can I send it in now?

You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due. If it hasn’t been, we will still accept it.

Can I mail it in early next time so it isn’t late?

Actually, you cannot mail it in early, as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date.

Will my paycheck come right away now?
