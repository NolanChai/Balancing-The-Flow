" Where is the cashier ? "

" The cashier is not here today, but I know that he always sits behind a glass window and takes money . "

" What if I do not know what everything is called ? "

" Just point to something and he will tell you what it is . "

" It's all good ? "

" No , there are many different foods on this buffet ."

" I don't like that food . "

" Pick up more of the same thing then , until you have enough . "

" Why do they put food in so many bowls and containers ? "

" Because people need to choose what they want . "

" Then why not let them eat from one big bowl , so there would be no mess and less work for the cooks ? "

" Don't know . I guess that's just how it's done ."
