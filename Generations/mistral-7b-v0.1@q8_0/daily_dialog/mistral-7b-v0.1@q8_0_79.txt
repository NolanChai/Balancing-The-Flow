" Well , I guess you'd better find a new job . "

I believe this dialog should have been written by a native speaker.

" Are you kidding me? Why not going to see him now ? We don't have anything else to do on Friday night . "

" That's why we should find something new to do . "

" Why not ? "

" No , it is not so expensive . You can pay in installments with 0% interest rate ."

UPDATED VERSION

"I have been bored at work recently."

"What happened?"

"I am tired of doing that boring job. I just repeat counting every day. It is so terrible!"

"Me too. But I think we can do something else for a change."

"You know I work with my professional knowledge, not passion. Sometimes I don't know what the meaning of working is?"

"But you did a good job. You always perform the best in our company."

"Yes, that was in the past. Maybe I need to go to my psychologist for help."

"Perhaps you have just been tired and you need a vacation."

"I was full of ambitions before. But now I have no aim for my career."

"Maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting."

"That sounds interesting. But I don't know how to do that."

"How about a training course?"
