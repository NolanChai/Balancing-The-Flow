" Yeah , let's go to see the show ."

### Answer & Explanation

Step 1: Here, we can assume that both characters are a couple or good friends. Now, for this dialogue, one of them should be very keen on seeing the circus while other doesn’t want to sit and watch the animals being tortured in the circus.

Step 2: As per above information, it can be assumed that there is a show going on nearby and both characters are talking about it. Here, we have one character who wants to go and see the show and other doesn’t want to do it because of the torture part which is a very sensitive issue these days.
Step 3: Now, in this context, one of them would say something like “Hey , look , there is a circus show over there . " And the reply would be " I'm not in the mood ."

Step 4: Here, it should be made clear that he doesn’t want to sit and watch animals getting tortured. Now, his partner says something like " It's the circus ."

Step 5: Here, his partner is saying that circus show has nothing to do with torture or else she/he would have said “No”. Also, there could be a tone of sarcasm in the reply because he is very keen on going out and seeing the show while other one doesn’t want to sit there and watch animal torture. Now, as per the given context it can be said that this character tries hard to convince his partner so that both of them can enjoy together in the circus show.
Step 6: Here, he says something like “Oh , come on , they give them treat too . Oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . " and other replies with " Yeah , let’s go to see the show ."

So, this is how you can continue writing a dialogue in this particular context. I hope this helps!
