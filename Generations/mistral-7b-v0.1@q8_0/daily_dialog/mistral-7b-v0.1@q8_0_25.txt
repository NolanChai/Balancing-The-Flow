Yes, it's been working well. 

It allows us to recover the energy from our waste air streams and then use this recovered energy to preheat our incoming raw material or as additional process heating for our production processes. We estimate that we've saved about two million dollars in energy costs over the last two years .

### Sample Run:
#### Input:
```python
response('We\'ve managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years .\nThat\'s excellent . How have you managed that ?\nMainly because we\'ve invested in a heat recovery system .')
```
#### Output:
```python
Instructions :

Dialogue:
