" Thank you very much . "

" You're welcome , sir. Have a good day."

( What does this dialog tell us about the speaker ? )

" What else ?"

" Tell them not to skate too fast . And keep their eye on where they are going . That way they will be able to stop in time if there is another skater or a rock on the ice . "

" Thanks again . "

" Well , that will probably keep them safe . Thank you very much ! "

" But the lake looks quite safe from here . "

" It looks deceptively safe , but the lake is not frozen solidly everywhere . In fact , you can't even walk along the middle of it , and I am sure that some parts of it are too thin to skate on . So don't let them go there ."

" What about the railings ? "

" Oh , the railings are just to keep people from falling in . You don't need to be afraid of that . "
