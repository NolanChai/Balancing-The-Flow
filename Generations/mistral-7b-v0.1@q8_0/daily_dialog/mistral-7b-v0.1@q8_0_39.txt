Good afternoon ! This is Trans Pacific Airlines customer service, how may I help you?

I am calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis. Could you please change it to the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19?

What is your name?

My name is Judy Wang.

How do you spell your name?

Thank you very much for using Trans Pacific Airline, Ms. Wang ! The new reservation number for your flight on August 2 is 8354903173 , which will be confirmed in the email that we sent to your address [your email] . If you have any further question , please call our customer service at (650) 555-3308 .

### Comments:
We used a regular expression to extract Ms. Wang 's name and then we extracted her phone number from the string containing her flight information. The email address was also extracted with a regex. Then the flight reservation number was assigned to the customer using the function `get_reservation_number()` . Finally, all the important information is printed out in a more concise form.

### Code:
```python3
import re

# Get input from user
name = input("Hello ! Trans Pacific Airline.\nHow can I help you? ")
reservation_flight = input("I'm calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight " + name + " on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ? \n")
firstname = re.findall("\b[a-zA-Z0-9]{3,}\b", name)[0]
lastname = re.findall("(?<=Flight )\w+(?= on)", reservation_flight)
fullname = firstname + ' ' + lastname[0]
email = re.findall("(?<=@)\S+", name)
phone = input("What's your phone number, please ? ")
reservation_number = get_reservation_number()
email_message = "Dear Ms." + fullname + ",\n\nPlease note that this ticket has a penalty of $75 for any change or cancellation.\n\nThank you for using Trans Pacific Airline.\n\nTrans Pacific Airline"

print("Thank you very much for using Trans Pacific Airline, Ms. Wang !")
print("\nThe new reservation number for your flight on August 2 is " + reservation_number + " , which will be confirmed in the email that we sent to your address " + email[0] + " . If you have any further question, please call our customer service at (650) 555-3308 .")
