The problem is that your product does not provide the functionality that I need.

I am looking for a solution to manage my finances, but the app does not have the features that I require. For example, it does not allow me to track my expenses and budget my money effectively. Additionally, the interface is not intuitive and it is difficult to navigate. 

I would like to be able to set up a budget for myself and track my spending against this budget. I need to be able to categorize my expenses and see how much I am spending on each category. It would also be helpful if the app could send me reminders when I have overspent in certain categories or if my spending is starting to exceed my budget. 

In addition, I need the ability to import my transactions from other financial accounts such as my bank account and credit card so that I can have a complete picture of my finances in one place. The app should also be able to connect with these accounts automatically so that I don’t have to manually enter each transaction.

Finally, I would like the app to be secure and private so that no one else can access my information without permission from me. 

These are just some of the features that I am looking for in a finance management app. If your product could provide these features then I would definitely consider using it instead of other options available on the market today.

Hello, how can I assist you?
>I'm having a problem.
Sure thing! Let me help you with that. Can you tell me more about the problem?
>There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn’t make.
Oh, I see. I can definitely help you with that. Firstly, let's check if your card has been compromised by any means. Do you have the statement for your card?
>Here it is.
Great! Now let me take a look at those charges. What are the charges you're referring to?
>The last four charges on the page.
Ah, I see. Those charges look suspicious to me. I suggest we investigate these charges and freeze payment on them immediately. Would that be okay with you?
