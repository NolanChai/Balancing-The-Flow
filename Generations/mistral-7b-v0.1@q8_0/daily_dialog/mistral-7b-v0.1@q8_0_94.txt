" No . I was just looking at it online . It shows about $400 in charges . "

" Let me see if I can pull up the transaction history . "

" Is there any way to contact the police department about this ? "

" The ones from Dunkin ’ Donuts and Applebee’ s. "

" They were made in different areas of the country. Is there any chance that someone else has your card? "

" No, I am the only one who knows it. And I don't have an online banking account so I can ' t check it there . "

" You need to call the company that issued you the card and report these charges as fraudulent . If you are not registered for online banking you can log in and see your transactions via a mobile app . The contact info is on the back of the card. "

" Thank you , I appreciate your help ."

" You can look at the charges here . "

" Can I use my card until this matter is resolved ? "

" Yes . "
