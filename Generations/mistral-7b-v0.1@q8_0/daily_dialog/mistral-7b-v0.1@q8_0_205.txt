I hope this will help some of the other people that are having trouble with the same issue. I started out trying to use Google translate which was a real disaster so if you have the same problem just keep going till you find a site that works for you and give up on the translator unless your language is one of those where it does work, in which case good luck, happy translating !!!

I got fed up with the whole situation of having to copy paste the translation into my browser and then go back and forth between two windows so I decided to try out a website that you can type directly into without any copy pasting . The site is http://www.freedictranslation.com and it works like a charm and has all kinds of languages for translating from.

It ’ s a lot easier to use than the one I originally used which was https://translate.google.com/ , just type your sentence into the input box , click translate, copy the translation you see below that box and paste it where you want it in your web browser or document etc .

For example if you wanted to say " I would like a cup of coffee" in German then here ’ s how you do it :

I would like a cup of coffee

If you go to Google translate and put that in the input box , click Translate, copy what ’ s under that box, paste where you want it.

The website is pretty easy to use and works on a lot of different browsers . The only downside is that you can ’ t edit your sentences once they have been translated but I didn ’ t have any problems with the accuracy so far when I used this site , hope it helps !
