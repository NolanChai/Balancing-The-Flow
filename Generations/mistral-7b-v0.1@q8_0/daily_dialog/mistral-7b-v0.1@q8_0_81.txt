I do it myself . I get most of my applicants via the local colleges . They send their students through to us for a work experience placement , then if they do well we offer them a full-time role . It's worked really well so far and we have some great young people on our books . 

 That sounds like an effective way to train up staff . 

### Response:
Yes , the students are always keen to get stuck in and learn . And they often have fresh ideas about ways of doing things more efficiently . Plus they are generally quite tech-savvy which is a bonus ! 

 I see that you use an online application process . Is that something you set up yourselves ? 

### Response:
Yes , we found it was much more efficient to manage everything through one system rather than have different spreadsheets or paper forms for each candidate . So now all our applications come in via the website and then I can log them and review them there too . It saves a lot of time and makes it much easier to track progress . 

 Are you still doing any interviews yourself ? 

### Response:
I do , but not as many as I used to ! We've got some great people working here now so there are fewer vacancies that need filling . When we do have openings though , it's usually for something quite specialist so it's important to get the right person . 

### Response:
That must be difficult , trying to find someone with the exact skills and experience you need . What's your approach ? 

 We try to attract applicants from as wide a range of backgrounds as possible by advertising in different places and targeting specific groups . For example we'll often go into schools or colleges where there's likely to be students studying relevant subjects , like business administration or IT . Or we'll advertise on websites that cater for certain demographics . 

### Response:
You sound like you've got a good process in place ! What kind of questions do you ask candidates during interviews ? 

 We want to see how they handle themselves under pressure and whether they can think on their feet , so we often give them scenarios or problems that need solving . And then there are some standard questions about things like teamwork and customer service . 

### Response:
And what do you look for when making a decision ? 

 We try to find someone who will fit in well with our existing team , both culturally and professionally . That means having similar values , being able to work together effectively and complement each other's skills . So we consider things like attitude , motivation and work ethic as well as technical ability . 

### Response:
That makes sense . Have you got any tips for someone who is starting out in recruitment ? 

 I think it's important to remember that there are two sides to every role - the employer side and the applicant side . If you're interviewing people , put yourself in their shoes and try to imagine how they feel about coming into an unfamiliar place with someone who might have all the power over whether or not they get offered the job . And if you're on the other side of things , remember that even though it can be nerve-wracking , being interviewed doesn't mean you should act like a zombie - be enthusiastic , ask questions and show why YOU would be good for THIS particular role !
