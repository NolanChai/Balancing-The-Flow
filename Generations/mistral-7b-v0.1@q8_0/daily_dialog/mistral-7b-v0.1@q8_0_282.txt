" About $50000 . "

" That is about â‚¬37000 . "

" Ok , and how do you like to receive it ? "

" In cash . I have to stay here for months , and need some money at hand . "

" So you can't use a credit card or debit card ? "

" No . "

" Your card is not valid in the ? Or you don't want it to be charged ? "

" My bank account has been blocked . "

" Oh , I see . What happened ? "

" That is a long story . There were many issues . The account was used for money laundering and it was reported by my brother who had nothing to do with this . The police arrested him and he has spent three years in jail . His family was destroyed by it and I am the only one to take care of them , so I can't use a credit card or debit card . "

" Give me the money in small bills as far as possible . "

" I am afraid that we cannot give you the whole sum of money in small bills , so can you please tell me your minimum requirement for small bills ? "



" Really ? The other bank wouldn't change them for me either . They told me that they wouldn't change them into Swiss francs because it was too much in volume . That is why I came here , but it seems like you can't exchange it for me either . "

" I am sorry about this . You'd better check with the local bank again , they are likely to give you service in this respect . "

" Thank you ."

" Welcome . "
