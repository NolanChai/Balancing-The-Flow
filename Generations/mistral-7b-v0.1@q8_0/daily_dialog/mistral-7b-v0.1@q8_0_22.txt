It doesn't seem to make sense to me that you can only use the continuous form when an action is not completed yet and has a duration.

What about the following? 

"I have a lot of homework today ."

" I will go to school on Monday . "

" He is studying for the exam . "

It's true that they are actions that don't really have an ending , but I also wouldn't say these things if the action wasn't already in progress or had already occurred.

" Sorry , cash only . "

" Have a good day ."

" Thank you very much . "
