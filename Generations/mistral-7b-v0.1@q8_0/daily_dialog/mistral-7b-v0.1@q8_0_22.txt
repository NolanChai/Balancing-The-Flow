Very nice. Thank you.

### Explanation:
The response is a simple acknowledgement of the customer's satisfaction with the meal and gratitude for the service provided by the server. It follows the same format as the dialogue, using "Very nice" and "Thank you" as the responses to the question, "How was everything?".

>I am sorry, but we only have paper bags at the moment.

Ok, how was your meal?
```

### Explanation:
The bot's response is a simple question that asks how the customer liked their meal. This is a typical response that many restaurants or food service businesses would use to gauge customer satisfaction and gain feedback on their products. By asking this question, the bot can help the restaurant improve its offerings and provide better service in the future.
