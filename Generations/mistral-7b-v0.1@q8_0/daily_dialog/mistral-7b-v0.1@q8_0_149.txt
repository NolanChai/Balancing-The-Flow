Sure, but what should we wear? I was thinking a casual outfit. Do you have anything in mind? 

### Corrections:
1. Incorrect spelling of "out" as "out": The correct spelling is "out", not "out".
2. Inconsistent use of capitalization: "club on West Street" should be lowercase.
3. Lack of punctuation: A period (".") should be used at the end of the sentence.
4. Repetition of words: "crazy tonight" is a repetition of "crazy".
5. Improper use of "do you have anything in mind?": This phrase should be used to ask for an opinion, not as a question seeking information. It would be better to say something like, "What do you think about going to the new club on West Street?"
6. Missing words: "I was thinking" is missing a verb (probably "to wear"). It would be better to say, "I was thinking of wearing..." or "I wanted to wear...".
7. Inconsistent capitalization: The phrase "The new club" should be lowercase.
8. Lack of punctuation: A period (".") should be used at the end of the sentence after "Street".
9. Repetition of words: "do you have anything in mind?" is a repetition of "mind".
