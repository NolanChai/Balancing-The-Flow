Um, ninety-five dollars? 

I think you might want to consider getting an additional job or cutting down on some unnecessary expenses. That's a lot of money to spend on just one dress. There are plenty of other options available that are more affordable. I would suggest checking out second hand stores or online retailers that specialize in plus size clothing. Good luck with your search!

A : Oh , well then ! I guess that means they had it on sale there . I have to go look into that . It'd be a shame if you paid more for something than what it was actually worth .

B : But why did you buy the dress in the first place ? Didn't you just say you weren't sure you could afford ninety-five dollars at the moment ?

A : Well , that's true . I wasn't exactly thinking rationally when I bought it .

B : Oh , but why not ? It sounds like it was important to you ! 

A : No , I just wanted to buy something nice for myself . You know , a little pick-me-up .

B : A pick-me-up ? 

A : Yes , you know . Something that makes me feel good about myself when I'm not feeling particularly good . 

### Summary:
The dialogue is a conversation between two people. The first person (A) asks the second person (B) what they think of their new dress, to which B responds that they like it because it goes well with A's eyes and they have been eyeing it at Maxine's for a while now. Then A tells B how much they paid for the dress (ninety-five dollars) but then tells them that they bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen's Boutique, to which B responds that they didn't know they could get it cheaper somewhere else.
