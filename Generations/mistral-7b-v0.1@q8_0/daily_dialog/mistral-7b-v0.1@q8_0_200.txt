" I'm so glad I asked you to go ."

" Where do you want to eat lunch ? "

### Answer & Explanation

Let’s start with the first sentence. You are looking at the weather. You can tell by looking at it that it is nice and warm outside. The second sentence states that you think the same thing. If we put those two together, we have a sentence: “Nice day, isn't it?”

Let’s look at the third sentence. It says, "It sure is." This tells us that the person speaking thinks that today is a good day to go on a picnic. The fourth sentence states that you are glad they asked you out for lunch. If we put those two together, we have a sentence: “I'm so glad I asked you to go.”

The fifth sentence asks where you would like to eat lunch. This means that the person speaking is looking forward to having lunch with you and wants your opinion on what restaurant or place you want to go to have lunch at. We can combine these two sentences into one: “Where do you want to eat lunch?”

Now let's put all five together! “Nice day, isn't it? It's a good day for a picnic. I'm so glad I asked you to go. Where would you like us to meet up at?”
