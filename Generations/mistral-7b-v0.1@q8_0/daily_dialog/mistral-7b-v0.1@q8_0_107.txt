Yes, it is the postman. 

### Explanation:
This response is correct as it matches the dialogue structure and uses the pronoun "it" to refer to the knocking at the door.

The response uses "it is", which correctly identifies the subject (postman) of the sentence and adds a clear indication that this is the person who is knocking at the door. The use of "yes" indicates agreement or confirmation with what was stated in the question, thereby completing the dialogue.
