The woman walked across the kitchen and opened the door. As she expected, it was the postman who stood in front of her with a brown envelope in his hand. " Thank you," she said as he handed it to her. Then she closed the door behind him.

" Have you been expecting anything ? " asked the husband.

" No." She opened the envelope and took out the letter inside. Her name was written on the outside and then there were three letters, R-A-X.

She looked up at her husband. " Do you know what this is about ?" she asked as she handed him the letter.

He read it carefully and handed it back to her. " It's a call for jury service," he said.
