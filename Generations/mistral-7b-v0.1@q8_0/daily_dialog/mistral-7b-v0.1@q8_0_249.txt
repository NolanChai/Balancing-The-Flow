The sentence was from a short story I'm reading, and the part of it is as below.

She had been to the grove of bamboo and had found some good-sized pieces of bamboo.

So, what's the point that the author wants to tell us ?

a) Bamboos are not as good for making furniture as hard woods
b) Bamboo grows in a tropical forest , so it is useless to use it in cold regions
c) Bamboos are too expensive to be bought by ordinary people.
