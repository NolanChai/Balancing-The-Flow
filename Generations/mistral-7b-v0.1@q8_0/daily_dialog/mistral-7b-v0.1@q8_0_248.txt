" Well , how about something to eat ! "

" Would you like the usual ? Or shall I make a fresh list ? "

" No . The usual is fine . Can I have it now ? "

" Of course , Madam . If you 'd just sign this form . "

I know this is kind of a weird one, but I have this dialog from a book that I am reading. The woman has been kidnapped and locked in the hotel room. So she asks for room service so the person won't be able to tell if she goes to the bathroom or not. This is how the conversation continues:

The lady says that she would like some grapefruit juice, marmalade, two scrambled eggs with two sausages, toast and a pot of black coffee, please. I think this sounds really weird, because I wouldn't order something so specific on room service. Is it common to get specific food in room service? What is the reason behind ordering such a breakfast?

"Room service . "

" Good morning . This is room 113 . I'd like some breakfast , please . "

" Right . Excuse me . Mrs . Jones ? "

" That's right . "

" What can I do for you ? "

" I'd like some grapefruit juice , marmalade , two scrambled eggs with two sausages , toast , and a pot of black coffee , please . How long will it take ? "

" Just a few minutes , ma'am . "

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

The woman has been kidnapped and locked in the hotel room, so she asks for room service so the person won't be able to tell if she goes to the bathroom or not. She orders a lot of things because it takes time to eat them all, which will give her more time to figure out what is happening.

This is the whole story: "A woman is kidnapped and locked in a hotel room by an unknown man. She decides to call room service and order something that would take a long time to eat so she can have some extra time to figure out what is going on."
