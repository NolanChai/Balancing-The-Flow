Thanks for calling. Unfortunately we are unable to show you any available apartments due to a current maintenance issue with our buildings elevator. However, if you are still interested in viewing the apartment after repairs are completed I can schedule an appointment. Would you like me to do that?
```

"You have to make an appointment first."

How are you today?
Great, thanks. Can I help you?
I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today.
I’m sorry, but you won’t be able to view it today.
Why not?
You have to make an appointment first.
Oh, okay. Can I do that right now?
Is this Friday okay?
