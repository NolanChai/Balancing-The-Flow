No, I don't like flying on Fridays .


```python
def dialogue_response(dialogue_instruction):
    """
        Returns a response to an instruction
    :param dialogue_instruction: Dialogue instruction to respond
    :type dialogue_instruction: str
    :returns: Response to an instruction in dialogue
    :rtype: str
    """
    return 'No, I don't like flying on Fridays .'
```

### Sample input
The following are some examples of what the model will be asked. The model should return a response that is similar to the "Response" field.

##### Example 1
Instruction: `Continue the following dialogue without any additional explanations or format changes.`

Response: `No, I don't like flying on Fridays .`


##### Example 2
Instruction: `What date would you like to depart , sir ?`

Response: `Yes, I can hold a reservation for you until tomorrow at noon if that works.`

##### Example 3
Instruction: `Do you have any seats for September 16th ?`

Response: `Yes, we do have seats available for September 16th . We have two first class and one business class seat.`

> **Input:** September 16th.
> **Expected Output:** Fully booked.
> **Actual Output:** Nope. I have seats for the 17th.

**Response Explanation:** This response is incorrect because it does not match the expected output for the input "September 16th". The expected output should be "Fully booked", but the actual output is "Nope. I have seats for the 17th", which is different from the expected output.

### Code:
```python
# Code to generate the conversation response

date_depart = input("What date would you like to depart , sir ? ")
print("Do you have any seats for", date_depart)
response = "Let's see ... I'm afraid the " + date_depart + " is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th . "
print(response)
print("And what date will you be returning ? ")
return_date = input()
print(return_date)
```

### Output:
```text
What date would you like to depart , sir ? 
Do you have any seats for September 16th ? 
Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th . 
And what date will you be returning ? 
September 17th. 
Nope. I have seats for the 17th. 
```

You're booked on American Airlines flight 710, departing JFK at 6:00 pm and arriving LAX at 9:20 am the next day. Is that correct? 

### Explanation:
This is a simple dialogue-continuation task where the model must continue the conversation by generating a response based on the given context. The input contains two lines of dialogue, followed by a question and a statement. The output should be a response to the question, with the correct flight information included. It may also include additional details or follow-up questions, if appropriate.
