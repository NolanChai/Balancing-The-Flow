" Yes , could I have a glass of water please ?"

I've been trying to learn english for about three years now but it is hard. I know many words, and can read many articles, books and understand almost all movies and shows with subtitles in English but I just can't seem to get the confidence or the ability to speak it. I have a lot of problems with pronunciation and intonations which leads me to stutter and pause for long periods of time before speaking because I'm afraid of sounding dumb or making mistakes, I would like some help in overcoming my fear of speaking English so I can become more confident when talking. Please give me some tips on how I should start or what exercises I could do to overcome my fear of speaking english, and the most effective ways of learning a language. Thank you !

" Anything else ? "

" No , that's all . "

" That will be $ 8.67 , ma'am. "

" That's it for now . Can I have the bill ? "

" Here's your ticket . "

" Yes , thank you . "
