Water pollution is just a part of the pollution and is not sufficient to write about as a topic.

Explanation:

The dialog goes like this:

Professor : I've handed in my paper . Did you read it ? "

" Yes . You've done a good job . But there's one thing . You should narrow down your topic . "

(He thinks that the student has taken up an overbroad topic and that he needs to restrict it).

Student : What about water pollution instead of pollution ? "

(Water pollution is just a part of the whole picture. I don't think it's enough to write about as a topic.)

Professor : Water pollution is just part of the whole picture. I don't think it's enough to write about as a topic. Please reconsider." (The professor suggests that he narrow down his topic further).
