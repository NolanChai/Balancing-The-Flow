" You made 2 mistakes . "

" What were they ? "

" First of all you ran a stop sign , and secondly you almost hit this car in front of you ."

" That's it ? "

" Yeah, that's it , what do you think ? "

" So , can I take the test again ? "

" Sure . "

" Your instructor told the examiner he wouldn't pass you but the examiner said he would . That is why he passed you . You should have failed , though . "

" Really ? I thought I did fine ."

" Well , you were going 60 in a 55 mph zone . That is a big deal . "

" A 5 mile an hour speeding ticket won't cost that much . "

" Well , for starters , your car is just way too dangerous to drive on the road . "

" You mean it isn't safe ? "

" Oh no . It isn't safe at all . In fact , it could cause a lot of trouble if you keep driving like that . "

" How so ? "

" Well , for starters , your car is completely unsafe and dangerous to drive on the road . "

" How do you know that ? "

" I saw you driving down the street in it today and I noticed that the engine was making a lot of noise . "
