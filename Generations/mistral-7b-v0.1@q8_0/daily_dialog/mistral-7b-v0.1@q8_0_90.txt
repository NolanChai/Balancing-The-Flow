" Oh , how silly of me . "

I like this one. 

"I was just wondering if I could have a glass of water . "

" You can't drink from that faucet . "

" What's wrong with it ? "

" It's dirty . "

" What do you mean , dirty ? "

" There are all sorts of germs in there . "

" Doesn't it ever get cleaned ? "

" The faucet has no handle ."

" I'm sorry , that was a silly question . Do you have any bottled water ? "
