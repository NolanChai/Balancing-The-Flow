### Explanation:
The dialogue is a continuation of a previous conversation between two people. The first person (heard what ?) asks if the second person has heard the news about Deborah, who has just given birth. The second person replies that they have not heard and are surprised to learn of this news (I didn't know).

The first person then reminds the second person that they should have already known, implying that the second person is ignorant or negligent for not being aware of the situation (I thought you knew).

The second person responds by acknowledging their ignorance and apologizing for not knowing earlier (I honestly didn't know).

Finally, the first person provides additional information about the baby, which was 8 pounds and 6 ounces (The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces).

### Explanation:
The conversation between the two people in the passage continues. The first person asks the other, "Did you hear what happened?" The second person answers, "Heard what?". The first one clarifies that Deborah already had a baby, which is news to the other person who says she didn't know about it. The first person then provides more details about the baby - its weight and size. The other person expresses happiness at hearing the good news, saying they will go and visit them soon. Finally, the first person reaffirms that he only wanted to convey this information and wishes them all the best.
