" I understand how you feel. Do you have another job lined up ?"

" no , I don't . But I will find something , so don't worry about it . "

" I'm sorry to see you go Amelia , but good luck in your future endeavors . "

" where ? "

" from my former boss at another firm . He offered me a job with much higher pay and benefits , plus the opportunity for advancement within two years . "

" but I thought you said you didn't want to move up in the ranks . You wanted to stay at a company long enough to retire . "

" that was true until I met him again at last week's convention . Now , I feel like there are more options out there than just sticking with this firm for the next twenty years . "

" and what about me ? What am I supposed to do if you leave? "

" you can find someone else , or they might promote one of your other employees . But don't worry about it too much . Things will work out fine . "

" wow! That sounds exciting ! What exactly do you do ? "

" well good luck and happy new job ! "

" thanks Amelia , that means a lot . See you soon . "

" well , that's kind of you , but in the meantime , I hope it won't be too hard to work with a manager who may not be here much longer . "

" no need to worry about that , Amelia . I promise to be as efficient and helpful as ever until my last day . "
