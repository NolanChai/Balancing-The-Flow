" The washer needs a quarter in order to start washing your clothes . "

" If it is an older model, you might not need any coins at all . It could be free-to-use, but they usually put a sign somewhere on the washer itself . "

" I don't see anything . "

" Okay , then it should be taking quarters . There will be a slot for quarters in one corner of the washer door . If you can find the quarter slot , then try putting in a dollar and close the door . This might start the machine ."

" You put it in this slot here . "

" How can I tell which clothes are mine ? "

" That's what the labels on the laundry bag are for . "

" Is there anyone else here who needs to use these machines ? "

" Just don't forget to take your clothes out of the washer or they'll get all moldy . "
