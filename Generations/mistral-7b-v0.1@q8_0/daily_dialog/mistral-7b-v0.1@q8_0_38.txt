We need help using the washer and dryer.

Tell me what the problem is.

I can't figure out how to turn them on.

Do you have some quarters?

I didn't know I needed change.

The washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar.

Where do I put the change?

The quarters go into the slot. You have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on.

Is that everything that I have to do?
