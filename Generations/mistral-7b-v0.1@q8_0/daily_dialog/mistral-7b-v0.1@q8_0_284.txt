" How could a movie be boring when it's so scary ? "

" That's easy to say for someone who isn't afraid of anything ! You aren't even scared of ghosts , are you ? "

" Haha , well , I am not scared of them . "

" Then why did you scream your heart out when the ghost appeared on screen yesterday night ? "

" Yes , they were . And the little boy in the woods looked pretty terrifying too . "

" And that is what scares me . That boy was supposed to have been a witch's child . It wouldn't be so terrible if there weren't real witches in the world . "

" Hey , calm down ! We don't need to worry about such things . There are no witches in this century ! "

" I hope you are right . But can we still go to that church tonight ? I want to see if there is any connection between it and the witchcraft they were talking about in the movie . "

" Yeah , we should watch a sci-fi movie tonight . "

" May , you should stop watching childish cartoons . "

" You should try them out sometime . "

" Really ? Which ones would you recommend ? "

" Well , there are so many good ones . But if you want to start with something easy , why don't we try the Bugs Bunny Cartoons ? "

" But I already saw it ... "

" That's right . You watched it with me when you were a kid . You even fell asleep after watching it twice ! "

" Why did I have to watch it again and again ? It was so boring . "
