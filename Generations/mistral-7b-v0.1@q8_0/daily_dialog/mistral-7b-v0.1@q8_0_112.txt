Help me write the next turn in this dialog. 

I want to give you my idea about it, but I don’t know how to express it. Could you help me? 

My idea is as below:

I think we should be more polite in our everyday lives. For example, when we meet someone for the first time, we may say something like “Good morning!” or “Nice to meet you!”. In addition, we should also try to be kind and helpful to others. I believe that if we all do this, the world would be a much better place.
