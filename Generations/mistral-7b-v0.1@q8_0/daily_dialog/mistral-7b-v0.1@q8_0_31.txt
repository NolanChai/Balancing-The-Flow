" Hey , you know what ? Why don't we do it together ? It will save us time and money if we take this course together . That way , we can share our thoughts and experiences . We may even help each other with job hunting . What do you think ? "

" I love that idea ! You know me so well , right ? Haha ."

I was reading the dialog and there were many more "hey, what if.." type of statements. At the end, it felt like a mess and my friend who was studying this course gave up on me.

When I was talking to her about what we are learning in the class, she asked me what else I thought the other person was feeling from my perspective as an observer. Then she said that when I was explaining it was hard to understand what the other person meant because there were many unconnected "hey, what if.." type of statements and by the end, she couldn't keep up.

She then asked me to rewrite the dialog to show how we might connect the ideas together so that the other person can understand what I was thinking. But I could not figure out how to do that since I have not really studied this dialog type yet and it felt too "in-depth" for me, but I hope that someone here may help me understand what my friend meant by connecting these ideas together in a way that is easy to understand.

I hope that I am explaining the problem clearly enough. Please let me know if there is any other information you need about this problem or if anything else needs clarification. Thank you!
