About a year now. Do you want to take the course with me? We can learn together!

Sure. It sounds like something worth exploring. What do you think about it?

I think it might be helpful to our future. It would be great if we could find a job that we really enjoy and are passionate about. I'm looking forward to learning more about career planning together!

He is taking an online career planning course, which he thinks has been really helpful. He recommends subscribing to it as well. I agree, and think that understanding more about career planning can help us make better decisions. He said he learned several key steps in career planning and how to set specific and tenable goals. That sounds useful! I'm not sure if this job suits me best, but sometimes feel unsure of my future career. I love my current job and don't think I want to start over; however, it would be nice to learn some new skills through the course. If they can suggest ways to improve work relationships or boost performance, that would be great!
