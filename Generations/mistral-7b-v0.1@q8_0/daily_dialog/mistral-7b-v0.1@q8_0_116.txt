>Yes , I am aware of that . But my driver is waiting for me here . So please guide me .

## Why did we choose this dialogue?
The first dialogue has a short response and it is easy to continue. However, it has not enough information which makes the model hard to understand what actually happened.
Therefore , in order to make the model respond more fluently , we add some information into the first dialogue to let the model have more knowledge of the situation .

I'm sorry. I can't understand your request. Please tell me more details about it.
