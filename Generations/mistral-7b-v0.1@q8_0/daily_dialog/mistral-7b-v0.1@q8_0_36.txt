I’ve been waiting here for a while now and I still haven’t gotten to the front of the line. The man in front of me has been talking to the woman behind him about his new job as an accountant, and they seem to be having a great time chatting away!
I hope you have a good time while waiting on this long line. If I can help you in any way, just let me know!

### Answer:
A: Excuse me, could you tell me which line I’m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and post a package?
B: You can buy the bubble wrap here, but you will have to stand in line over there to post your package.
C: That’s a really long line. How long do you think it will take to get through all those people?

#### Option A:
> No, you need to go over there.
#### Option B:
> Yes, the line is right over here.

### Solution:
Option B.

```
The customer is inquiring about purchasing bubble wrap and postage for a package. The employee responds by stating that the customer can buy the bubble wrap from the employee but will need to wait in line at another location to purchase postage. When the customer asks how long it will take to get through the line, the employee provides an estimate of 3 minutes per person, which would equate to approximately an hour's wait. The customer then inquires if stamps can be purchased from the employee and is provided with a "Yes" response along with the location of the line.
