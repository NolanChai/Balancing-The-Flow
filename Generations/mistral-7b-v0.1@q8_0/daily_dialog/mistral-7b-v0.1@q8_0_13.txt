" Why?"

" When heroes come back from battlefield , we take off our hats and show them our respect and admiration . "

" Do you know why ? "

I know this is not the most difficult one but I was wondering what the next turn should be. I am struggling with these and my teacher told me to go for a practice session before exam. Can someone help me ?
