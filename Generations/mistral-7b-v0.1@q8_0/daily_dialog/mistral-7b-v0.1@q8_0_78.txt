Abigail's wedding ceremony was a simple affair, taking place in a registry office with only two friends as witnesses. But they had three parties to celebrate, which must have been expensive. However, since Abigail and her husband are from different countries and live in a third country, they decided to have one in each country, making it less costly. Fortunately, neither of their parents were upset about missing the ceremony as they celebrated separately afterward.
