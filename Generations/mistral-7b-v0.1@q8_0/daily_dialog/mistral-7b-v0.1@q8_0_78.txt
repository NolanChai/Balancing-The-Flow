" no ! They know how much it meant to me for them to be there , and I appreciate the way they supported me . But they really couldn't come because my father was ill at the time . "

" no . they didn ' t get on with each other very well , so we decided to leave it alone . "

" is that a typical Indian wedding ceremony ? "

" what do you mean ? "

" I'm asking if all weddings in India are like this one ."

" yes , pretty much . the registry office thing is only for people from other countries who aren ' t Indians . Indians marry at home with their families and friends there . It ' s a religious ceremony and it can last for several hours or even days ."

" no . We decided not to have one because we couldn't afford it . But now that I think about it , a honeymoon might be quite nice after all . "

" I think there are many ways to get married . My husband and I wanted to keep the cost down so that we wouldnâ€™t be in debt for the rest of our lives , and we also wanted to make sure that everyone who was important to us got an invitation . "
