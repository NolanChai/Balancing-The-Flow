" No , thanks . I ’ m going with my family . "

" That ’ s good . My last hike , there was an earthquake . We had to spend the night outside because the campground was destroyed . "

" What ! An earthquake ? It’s not going to be that bad this weekend , is it? "

" You must be in good shape . "

" Well , you could say that . But don't worry , you won't get left behind . "

" That sounds great ! What time do we leave ? "

" Let ’ s meet at 7:30 on Saturday morning . "

" Can I bring my dog ? "

" Sure , I 'll bring mine too . We need to take lots of food and water . The trail is pretty remote , so there's no stores or restaurants . "

" That will be fine . What kind of boots do you wear ? "
