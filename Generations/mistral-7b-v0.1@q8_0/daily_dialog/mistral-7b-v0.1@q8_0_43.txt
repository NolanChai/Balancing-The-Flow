" I've seen one a few weeks ago , it was pretty cool ."

" Can I have a look at it ? "

" Sure , come with me in my backyard . There it is ! Do you see it ? It's kind of blue and shines in the dark . "

" OMG, what is this thing doing here ? "

" What do you mean ? "

" I have to go to work !"

" Yes . They visit us every night and take me with them for a while . But nobody believes it , so they make me keep it a secret ."

" Where do they take you ?"

" To their planet , of course . It is called Orkut . "



" It's not about the language . I have a special code . I think we will be friends soon . "
