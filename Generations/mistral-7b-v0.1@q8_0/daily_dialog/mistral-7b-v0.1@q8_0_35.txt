" I got hit by a car. "

" Oh no, are you hurt ? "

Turn:

"No, but my car is all messed up."

You know what? It's kind of a shame that you didn't get hurt in the accident. At least then you would be able to claim damages from the driver and use that money to fix your car. Maybe you should consider getting a lawyer to see if you can get some sort of compensation for your car being totaled. Good luck!
