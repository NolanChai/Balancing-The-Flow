I recently finished an online class on the history of rock music, and now I'm working through some other classes in the same vein. I was wondering if anyone else had taken any online classes? If so, what were they, and which one was your favorite? Thanks for reading!

I think it would be interesting to hear from people who have different experiences with different online courses. It's always great to learn from others who have been there before. I'm really looking forward to seeing what other people have to say about their own experiences and what they think about the classes in question.
