" That's it ! You should have gone to traffic school . "

What will the speaker say next ?

A. Did they give you a ticket?
B. Were you parking illegally ?
C. You got one for parking ?
D. Where did you get this ticket?

" So what's the plan now ? Do you have a court date or anything? "

" I don't know. Maybe they will write it off if I show them a copy of my doctor's appointment card , because I was going to the hospital for an ultrasound. It would be really expensive if I had to pay that . "



" What's wrong with your spot ? "

" It was a long walk . "

" Didn't it take too much time to park there anyway ? "

" No , the building has parking on both sides of it and I got one of the closer spots . "

" So why did you park in the red zone ? "

" Well , I saw an empty spot that was right in front of my door . "

" And your door is which floor ? "

" The fifth . "

" Your building has five floors ? "

" Yes . "

" How long have you lived there ? "

" Almost 10 years . "

" So what's your excuse for not getting a parking ticket all this time ? "

" I didn't know about the red zone . It was only recently added . "

" What made it be added now ? "

" They started adding handicapped spaces and that left a lot of empty spaces on both sides of the building . "

" Why do they need handicapped spots anyway ? The building has elevators and there's no stairs . "

" Not everyone in the building uses the elevator and some people use wheelchairs or walkers . "

" That's a bit much isn't it ? "

" Maybe it is , but you can't tell who needs them and who doesn't . It would be very unfair to take away the spots just because one person didn't want them . "
