" This is a skiing resort . The mountain is covered with artificial snow . "

" Artificial snow ？ "

" Yes . If you don't know, we use water pipes to carry water from the upper side of the mountain and then it turns into ice in the freezing cold air . Next they will be dropped from a helicopter onto the slopes . So the snow can be seen everywhere . "

" That's very interesting . I never thought such an idea could happen . "

" Why don't we try this one day ? "

" Hmm . I don't think my mom will allow me to do that . And my dad said it is not a sport for women . "

" It's OK, I'll ask my dad for permission . Besides , Adam said girls are better than guys at skiing because we have more balanced weights . "

" Really ? What does he mean by this ？ "

" He just wants to be nice to you . "

" So do you want me to go skiing with you ? "

" Of course . But first you need to buy some ski suits and other equipment . "
