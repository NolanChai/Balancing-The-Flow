I would have to say that I liked the course in Logic the most . It was so fascinating how one could go from simple premises to complex conclusions through a series of logical steps . It really showed me how powerful logic is and how it can be used to understand the world around us . The lectures were also very engaging and interesting . The instructor did a great job at making the material accessible and easy to understand . Overall , I had an amazing experience in this course and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about logic .
