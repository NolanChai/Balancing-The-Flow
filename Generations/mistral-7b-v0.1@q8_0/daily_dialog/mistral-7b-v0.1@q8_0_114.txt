Lili , let ’ s take a vacation ! 

 George , how can we ? Vacations cost money . And this month we don ’ t have much money left after paying the rent . 

 Well , Lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . Trust me , it won ’ t cost much .

[Warning: Short generation] 
Let’s save money on this vacation by staying in our van. 

It would be more comfortable and enjoyable to stay in a hotel, but the state has many places that are free or low-cost to visit.

Lili : Let's take a vacation!
George : How can we? Vacations cost money. And this month, we don't have much money left after paying the rent.

Lili : Well, George, we can visit different places in the state in our van 10. We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time. Trust me; it won't cost much.

George : Where will we sleep then?

Lili : In the van.

George : What about other expenses?

Lili : Let's see. Gas, food, recreation; we won't spend much. Come on. Don't hesitate. We need to get out of the house once in a while. Haven't we been working hard?

George : Maybe you're right. When do you plan to go?

Lili : The sooner the better! I can't wait!
