Yes, I do have a son. He will be turning six soon. While I am away, my parents are taking care of him. My mother loves children and she takes good care of my little one. She loves to play with him. They even go for small trips together. My father helps her with everything. He is the perfect example of a modern father who understands the importance of balancing family life and career.

I have a 5 year old son who's the light of my life. He goes to school and I'm glad he has his grandmother with him during the day as she's always been there for him, but I think we should start looking into childcare options for when she retires soon! I know how lucky you are since you get to spend time with your grandchild every day - that must be such an amazing experience.
