> 10-year old Mittal went to school on her new scooter and was stopped by her father at the doorstep. 

>" Where are you going on a bicycle? Your grandfather has bought you a brand new scooter, so why don't you take that?"

>" Daddy, I really like cycling. I am happy when I go to school on my bicycle and come back home on it."

>" Well, even though your grandfather wants you to take the scooter, but you can have both. Go in and lock the bicycle in the garage so that no one else uses it." 

> Mittal's father had bought his children a new car for their birthday recently. But he loved cycling so much that he used to cycle to office every day and often told his children that cycling was much better than driving. He always parked his bike in the garage after work and drove the family car home, even though Mittal's mother had insisted on using the car for her trips out of town.
