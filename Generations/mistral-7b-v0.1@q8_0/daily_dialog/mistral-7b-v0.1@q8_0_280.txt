" You know, there are a lot more people around here who speak your language than there are around me back home . "

" Really? It's probably because we're near the border with your country . But I thought that most foreigners came to America for English classes and such . "

" Well yes , but those people usually end up moving somewhere else after they finish their studies , and they don't have a chance to learn any of our dialects . Besides , there are still plenty of Americans who don't speak the same kind of English as you do . "

" Oh! That's true! I guess that makes sense . "

" Yeah . I mean , look at me ! I'm from another part of your country and yet we don't understand each other when we talk . But hey , maybe if I learn some more vocabulary I can improve my skills and become better friends with everyone here . "
