I need to find one that doesn’t make me look like a circus clown. I'm not sure what my style is, but I guess it would be something casual and comfortable.

"That dress is very pretty. Why don't you like it?" asked the salesman. "It's too loud," replied the woman. "We've been looking around for many hours. What on earth are you looking for?" she asked the man. "Well, you know, those styles or colors just don't suit me." he replied. "What style do you want?" she asked him back. He responded that he wanted to buy a v-neck checked sweater and it should be tight fit on his body. She then questioned what color of the sweater did he prefer?

Yes, you have an excellent taste in fashion. But let me tell you that a V-neck sweater is not always a good idea for formal occasions or if you want to look more professional. It can make you appear less serious and authoritative. If you still insist on wearing it, I suggest you pair it with a blazer or suit jacket to add some polish to your overall look.
