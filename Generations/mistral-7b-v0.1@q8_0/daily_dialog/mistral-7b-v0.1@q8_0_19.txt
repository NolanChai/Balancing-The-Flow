" It was French dressing and I meant what I said.You don't have any ? "

" Sorry , it is not in stock . Anything else ? "

" No , thanks ."

A:

The waiter had no idea that he would be asked to make a French dressing for the salad, so when you asked him if he could do it, he replied “Sorry, it’s not available now.”

B:

You are asking me what I want on my salad. That is not my job. The chef will decide what goes on your plate and how much. You should be grateful to have someone take care of that for you!

C:

It’s an easy question with a simple answer. If you don't know the answer, just say "Sorry" or "I'm not sure". You can also ask someone else or look it up online if they are unable to help.

D:

French dressing is not available at this time.

E:

Ask again after you have given him a chance to think about what he wants to say.

F:

It's your turn to order and I will take care of the rest.

G:

I don’t know. What would you like on the salad?
