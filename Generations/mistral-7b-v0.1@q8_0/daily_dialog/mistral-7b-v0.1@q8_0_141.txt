It's not clear what kind of job this is. It seems to be an interview with a company, so my guess is the person I'm speaking to is applying for a job at said company. So my answer would be "Yes, if I am selected for this position I will look forward to working together".

That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company . Yes , I have an overall understanding . When we have the final results , we will call you . Then when will I get a reply at the latest ? If you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . But if I don't pass , will you call me ? I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful . Then do I have the chance to get this job ? I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself , and I have to discuss it with other interviewers .
