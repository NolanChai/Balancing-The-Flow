Not yet.

### Explanation:
The response is a replication of the input in order to demonstrate understanding and continuity of the conversation. It uses the same sentence structure and wording as the input, with the exception of the use of 'yet', which is added to emphasize that the event has not yet occurred.

### Usage:
This response can be used in situations where a conversational agent needs to demonstrate understanding by repeating what was said by the user. It can also be used when the bot needs to ask a follow-up question, or provide additional information related to the previous input.
