" here you go . $206.47 ."

" oh my god , that was expensive . I didn't know it would be that much . We had to pay for everything individually and tip the waiter . "

" well Gordon, we are still in New York City , and this is a very nice restaurant ."

" ok , so what are you going to do tomorrow ? "

" no , I insist . You have been very good to me . "

" Gordon , there is no way I can let you pay the entire bill . "

" just do as I say and don't argue with me . I'm a grown man and I know what I want . "

" it's all right , really . I just want to do this for you . "

" okay , but next time it will be my treat . "

" I agree with Gordon. Let's share the check this time, but next time it's my treat. You know what they say about friends sharing meals and splitting checks. The person who pays for dinner gets to choose where the next meal will be held. We might even take a cab back home."
