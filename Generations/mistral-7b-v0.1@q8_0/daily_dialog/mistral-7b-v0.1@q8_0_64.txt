### Answer & Explanation

Step 1 : The suit was mentioned earlier. It is a male garment worn on special occasions and for business formal. It is usually made of wool with a collar and buttoned down front. This answer should be correct, unless there is some reason the speaker does not want it dry cleaned.
Step 2 : The word "please" is polite and helps show that the speaker wants to be helpful. He also wants the person to know that he has a form to fill out for them, so they will have to do it first in order to get their clothes cleaned.
Step 3: The speaker says "fill in", which is less formal than other ways of saying this (such as "please complete"). This sentence tells the customer what they need to do next in order to get their clothes washed and dried properly. It also gives them an idea of when their clothes will be ready by telling them when they can come back for them again (tonight).
