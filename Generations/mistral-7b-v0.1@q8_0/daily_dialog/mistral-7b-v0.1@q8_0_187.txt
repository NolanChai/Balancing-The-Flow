" May I ask which companies have given you these quotations ? "

" Then, could you tell me what the quotations from the other companies are like ? "

" For the brooches , a Japanese company has offered to supply 20 boxes at 18,000 yuan each ; for the waistbands , another Japanese company offered to deliver 30 boxes at 35,000 yuan and 10 boxes at 65,000 yuan . For other ornaments , a Chinese company has offered to ship 15 boxes at 7 , 200 yuan each . "

" I see . Well , you have told me what the other companies have quoted , but there is still something that bothers me . "

" What ? "

" Then I'm afraid we can only wait and see whether your price is acceptable to us or not ."
