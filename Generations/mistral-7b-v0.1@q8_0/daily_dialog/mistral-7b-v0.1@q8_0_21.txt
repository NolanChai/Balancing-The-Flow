Hi, this is Tony. How are you today?

I’m good, thanks for asking. And you?

I'm doing well, thank you! I just wanted to let you know that we will have an opening in our schedule next week and I thought it would be perfect for Lily since she hasn't been to the dentist in quite some time. Is this something that works for her?

Hello . This is Tony calling from the dentist 's office . Is Lily there ? 

 No , Lily is not here at the moment . 

 Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ? 

 Sure . What's your number , please ?

Hi, this is Lily calling from the dentist’s office. Is Tony there? No, he’s not here at the moment. Could you ask him to call me back when he gets in? Sure! What’s your number please? My number is 519-367-8901. Thanks!
### Reason:
I responded as if I was the person calling and using “this is” to emphasize that it was me speaking, then stated my name so there would be no confusion about who I am. Next, I repeated the question asked by Tony so he knows I understand what he needs, and used “No” when responding since he isn’t present at the moment. Then I asked if Tony could call back when he gets in to clarify that this is his request and provide a reminder for him. To ensure accuracy of information provided I asked for Tony’s number and provided it for him so we can connect later on if needed. Finally, I thanked Tony for his time by saying “Thanks!”
