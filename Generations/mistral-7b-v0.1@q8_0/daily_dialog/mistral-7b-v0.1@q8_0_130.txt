" Everybody is so competitive here ! People will do anything to get ahead. The minute one person has a small advantage, everybody tries to take him down . "

" Well ... isn't that how it usually works in office environments ? I mean ... don't they teach you this stuff at business school ? "

" You know what ? I think you just made me even angrier ! I can't believe you're siding with them ! "

" Sandra ... I'm just telling you the way things are . Everybody has their own ambitions in life , and the workplace is no exception. If you want to get ahead, you have to put yourself first . "

" So what if it hurts others ? Isn't it enough that people go around stabbing each other in the back without also having to stab them in front of their faces ? "

" But Sandra ... nobody cares about anybody else ! If they can get ahead by stepping on you , or your feelings, so be it . Don't take it personally . Just don't let anyone step on YOU. "

" Not really ... but he does go out of his way to ignore me or tell people that I can't do something right . It's so humiliating ..."

" He doesn't really sound like a very nice person Sandra ! Maybe he doesn't want you to succeed because he thinks it will reflect badly on him . "

" So what should I do ? I don't want him to take credit for my work . "

" It's exactly what Tim is doing ! And then when I go out of town he tells everybody that he's taken over my department ! He even changed the office color scheme to match his favorite sports team ! "

" Why didn't you just change it back ? "

" Because we have a new policy in the company : Don't make waves . "
