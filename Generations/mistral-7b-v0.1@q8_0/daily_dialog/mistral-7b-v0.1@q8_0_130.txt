Hey, are you okay? You look really down today. I was just wondering how everything is going in the company. Have you heard about anything new? I hope things are going well!

I'm not sure what to do anymore. Tim has been giving me a hard time lately and I think it's time for me to move on. It's been really stressful trying to get everything done and it feels like there's no end in sight. Plus, I've had it with all the office politics - it just seems like too much right now.

I know it must be difficult for you too but don't worry! We can always find other solutions if necessary - we just need to stay positive and keep pushing forward until things improve again! ðŸ˜ƒ

It was like a war zone ! Everybody tried to outrank the other . You have no idea how exhausting it is . People were constantly plotting , backstabbing and spreading rumours . It's such an ugly environment . I'm not cut out for all that ! 

### Follow-up:
What do you want me to tell Tim ?  

 Just ask him what happened to his spine ! 

 OK , I will talk to him right now .

Well, Sandra , you shouldn't worry about that.

Everyone has enemies at work. You just have to learn to ignore them . It doesn't matter what they say or do . Just do a good job and everything will work out ! 

If you want to hear my opinion though ... I think you should give it another chance ! If you quit now , you'll regret it ! 

### Response:

Well Sandra , if that's what you want to do, then go ahead . But remember : don't let anyone get in your way ! If they try to sabotage you , fight back hard and make them pay for their actions !

If you ask me though ... I think it would be better if you stuck with this job. It has a lot of potential . So why give up now ? 

I know Tim can be annoying, but he doesn't mean anything bad when he talks about you behind your back . He just likes to gossip ! I'm sure he hasn't meant any harm !

Hey Sandra , what's wrong ? You look furious !
I think Tim is threatened by me. I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career!
Yeah ... I know. But I'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles!
Basically, I think Tim is threatened by me. I'm doing a better job than he is so he's trying to sabotage my career!
So he talks about you behind your back?
Yes. He's all nice and friendly to my face. But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back!
I had a worker like that once. She was always taking credit for my ideas.
