The correct answer is:

" Sorry to hear that . Can we do something about it ? "

I've been doing these exercises for a few months now, and I always get this wrong. 

My problem is I am not understanding the structure of the sentence, and as such cannot apply what I know to create new sentences correctly. 

Can someone help me understand how to build this sentence, please?
