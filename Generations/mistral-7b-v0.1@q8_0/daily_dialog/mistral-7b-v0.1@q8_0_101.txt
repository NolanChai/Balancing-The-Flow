Sorry to hear that ! There are a few things that I can do for you. First, I can call my mechanic and see if he can come out and take a look at your car. Secondly, if your car is towed away, I can help arrange a rental car for you. Lastly, if you're in a rush and need to get somewhere quickly, I can try to find someone with a spare vehicle that would be willing to lend it out for the day. I understand this may not be ideal but hopefully one of these options will work out for you!
