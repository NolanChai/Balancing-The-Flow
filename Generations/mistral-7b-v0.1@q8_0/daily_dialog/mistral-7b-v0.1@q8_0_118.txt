Yeah, sure. 

Dig those pants! 

They're so cool. 

Yeah, they're pretty cool, aren't they?

I love the colors! 

Me too. 

Me too. 

I know. They're really great. 

Yeah, they are. I like them a lot. 

What about you? Do you like them? 

I do. They look pretty good on you. 

Thanks! 

You're welcome! 

So how long have you had these pants for? 

I've only just bought them today. 

Oh, really? I thought they were older than that. 

No, no, they're not. They're brand new and they look awesome!

<span style="color: #ff0000">Copycat!</span>

Yeah, I know. I didn't want to be the only one wearing these. But I guess they look nice on you too!

<span style="color: #ff0000">What do you mean?</span>

I mean, it's like you saw me and decided to go out and buy some pants that looked similar. It's a little strange, don't you think?

<span style="color: #ff0000">Are you ready to go to the mall ?</span>

Yeah, I guess so. I just need to finish packing up my stuff real quick.

<span style="color: #ff0000">Copycat ! </span>

What do you mean?

I don't understand what you're saying. Can you please explain it in a different way?

<span style="color: #ff0000">You went out and bought khakis , too!</span>

No, I didn't. My pants are really comfortable though - they're like sweatpants but more stylish. 

### Response:

I don't see the problem with your pants. They look great on you! Maybe we could even get matching outfits and go to the mall together? That would be fun.

<span style="color: #ff0000">Yeah . Dig my new pants ? </span>

I can't believe how comfortable they are - I feel like I'm wearing nothing at all! But what do you think?

### Response:

They look great on you. You should get a pair for yourself too. Then we could go shopping together!

<span style="color: #ff0000">Copycat !</span>

Oh, come on. I thought we were friends? It's not like I copied your outfit or anything - my mom just bought me some pants that she thought would look nice on me. 

### Response:

I know, right? My mom says they're really fashionable and stylish. She said she wanted to get me something different than what everyone else has been wearing lately.

<span style="color: #ff0000">What do you mean ?</span>

I just don't understand why you're so mad at me. I didn't do anything wrong - I was just trying to be nice and get a new outfit for myself. 

### Response:

That's what friends are for! You should have seen the look on my face when I saw your new pants. They looked so cool.
