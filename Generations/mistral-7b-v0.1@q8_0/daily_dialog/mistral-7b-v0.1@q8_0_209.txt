The first sentence in each of the above examples is a complete thought. In fact, all six sentences are complete thoughts. That makes these sentences examples of the simple sentence. There is nothing wrong with using simple sentences in your writing. In fact, some good writers use them almost exclusively. However, to write well you will need to master other types of sentences.

Here is another example of a simple sentence: The rain fell on the grass. A sentence with three or more clauses is called a compound sentence. Compound sentences consist of two (or more) independent clauses joined by one of the following eight coordinating conjunctions. Each clause has its own subject and verb.

Compound Sentences

To create a complex sentence, you must use a subordinate conjunction (a word that expresses a subordinate idea or relationship) to join a dependent clause with an independent clause. Dependent clauses can be used at the beginning of a sentence or in any position within a sentence. Independent clauses cannot function as the dependent part of a sentence, but they may function as the main part of a sentence.
