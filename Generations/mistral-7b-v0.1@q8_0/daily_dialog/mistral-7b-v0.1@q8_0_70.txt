I'm trying to write in this style:

"Well, I'm afraid I must be going now. It was quite late, and I didn't realize it until after we'd finished dinner.

"Stay for dinner with us."

"Thanks so much, but I've already got a dinner party scheduled for tonight. You see, I have to leave for England the day after tomorrow."

"All right then, I won't keep you any longer. It was nice seeing you again. Goodbye."
