" No . Just a regular table will be fine . "

" Would you prefer the downstairs dining room or our upstairs salon for dinner tonight ? "

" Downstairs , if possible . We want to arrive before 8 :00 pm . "

" Your reservation has been noted . Please call this number 24 hours in advance of your arrival . If you fail to do so we will be forced to release your table and assign it to another guest . "

" Is the downstairs dining room full at that time ? We'd hate to have to eat elsewhere . "

" Mr. Smith . "

" Yes . Mr. Smith . And who will be joining you at your table tonight , sir ? "

" Just give me the menu and a few of my friends will drop in later . "
