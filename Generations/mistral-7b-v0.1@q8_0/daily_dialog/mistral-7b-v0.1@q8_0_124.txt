No, I don't like this one either. It doesn't look right on me. I would rather have a more subtle color that matches my skin tone better. Do you have anything else in mind?

Hello! If the sun shines above my head, then I will not be able to see the sky anymore!

The following is a dialogue between two friends. Please continue it and provide an ending.

Friend 1: What do you think about my new hairstyle? It looks so cute on me.

Friend 2: Yes, it does look really good.

Friend 3: I agree with Friend 2. It looks great on you!

OK, I think this size would be good.

I was just about to say that. It's perfect!

You know what? I'm feeling like trying something different today. Do you have any other options?

Sure, let me take a look in the back.

OK, I found some interesting ones that I think would go well with your style. Let me bring them out.

That looks great! I love it!

You know what? I'm actually not feeling so great today. Maybe we can try these on later.
