Hi Jane, I have checked with the housekeeping department and it appears all of our machines will need new cartridges. However, I've heard that the office supply store might not be able to fulfill such a large order. They do have some stock but it is limited. Could you double check with them and see if they can fill our needs? We want to make sure we get enough supplies for all of our printers without any interruptions.

### Correct Response:
Hi Jane, I've checked with the housekeeping department and it appears that we will need two cases of new cartridges for all of our office printers. The office supply store that we usually go through might not have such a large quantity in stock, but they are used to receiving bulk orders from us. Could you double check with them to see if they can fill the order? I'm sure they will be able to provide us with what we need!

### Correct Response:
Hello Jane, it appears that all of our machines will need new cartridges and a large order would likely be necessary. The office supply store that we usually go through may not have such a large quantity in stock. I've heard they are used to receiving bulk orders from us, so could you please double check with them? It would be great if we could get enough supplies for all of our printers without any interruptions!

Housekeeping just called me back and I got an answer from the supply store . The housekeepers said they will be out of ink by Friday if we do not make our usual order for cartridges today . They were not too clear on how many new ones we need to get , but you mentioned that you want two or three cases ? We should probably just go ahead and order the largest case we can get from the supplier , as they are used to seeing bulk orders from us. It looks like they can deliver by Friday morning , so they will arrive in time for our housekeeping department . I also made an additional call to see if there was anything else we need to order for tomorrow that has not yet been taken care of , and the only thing we need is toner . They will expedite the order as soon as possible. It looks like this is going to be a busy day !

### Corrections:
1. The first sentence should have an additional phrase to indicate it is a question. A question mark or "?" could also be used at the end of the sentence, but the tone of voice would change slightly and sound less natural.
2. "I will make a few calls" --> "Let me make a few calls"
3. "Toner" --> "Toners" (plural)
4. "Housekeeping department" --> "The housekeeping department"
5. "See if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow" --> "See if they can deliver it by the end of the business day tomorrow"
6. "Try to see if they can deliver it by the end of business day tomorrow" --> "Let's see if we can have it delivered by the end of business day tomorrow"
7. "We should try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis" --> "It might be good for us to stop putting off our monthly orders until the last minute." (this sentence would be fine if there were a phrase like "we can improve our order process by not waiting until the end of the month, but I think it could use some additional punctuation or rephrasing)
8. "Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time" --> "Alright , let's get started on getting everything organized and ready for tomorrow so we can make sure the toner is delivered in time." (this sentence could be shortened a bit, but I think it communicates the speaker's intent clearly)
