" Well ... okay.  "

" Anyway , how come you never mentioned your girlfriend ?"

" You asked me about my friends and family . I never said I had a girlfriend ! I thought the question was obvious and it would be weird to mention her in particular . "

" Why didn't you tell me she is so beautiful ? "

" Beautiful is in the eye of the beholder . It can't be measured . I don't want to make this about my girlfriend . I just feel guilty for not telling you earlier and I am trying to explain why I didn't . "

" Well ... okay.  "

" Don't you think you should have asked me instead ? "

" Well yes , but that was before we became close . "

" What do you mean , you knew ? "

" Of course I did , we spoke about it on the phone just last night . "

" But that was before she broke up with me ."

" That's why I was so upset this morning when I called , but when you didn't pick up, I thought maybe you were with her !"
