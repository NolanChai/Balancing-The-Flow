i began blogging when i first went to the us for my graduate studies.
what do you usually write about?
at first, i’ll write about my life there. like interesting things on the campus, travel stories, special english words that i come across. sometimes, i’ll post my pictures on my blog so my family and friends can see what i look like.
that’s interesting. how often do you write a blog?

It seems that you are not a blogger. I have been writing a blog for almost three years. What do you usually write about? It's random. If there happen to be a lot of things going on, I may add several new entries in a week, and if I've got nothing to share, I may leave my blog untouched for weeks. Do you still update your blog?
