" a lot of things , whatever comes to my mind actually . I've written about everything from politics and religion to sports and music . "

" cool ! Can you tell me some examples ? "

" sure , I'll be glad to . I wrote about the recent elections in my country , about the political situation in the Middle East , about my favorite bands and musicians . I also blogged a lot about American football , baseball , basketball and hockey . "



" yes , I am . In fact , I just updated it yesterday . "

" I guess , the more you write , the better your English will be , right ? "
