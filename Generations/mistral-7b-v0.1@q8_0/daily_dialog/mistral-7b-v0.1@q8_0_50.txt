Yeah, that sounds great! I could go for some General Tso’s chicken. Do you want to call in the order or should I?

I'm hungry, and there's a take-out restaurant near here. We can have them deliver and then watch the news on TV while we eat.

Yes, that sounds great! I would like some General Tso's chicken. Do you want to make the order, or should I?

Sure ! 

I would be happy to go out with you for some all-you-can eat steakhouse. 

I am just not feeling Chinese tonight. I'm just sick of having the same dish over and over again. I like variety in food. 

Plus, I think that Al's Steakhouse has a lot more to offer than Chinese food. 

Also, it is located near our place so we can go there quickly. 

I would love to try their steaks. They are said to be quite juicy and tender. 

And who doesn't like fried fish? 

The salad bar sounds really good too. I would love to try it out. 

What do you say? 

Let's go out together then! 

Also, thank you for considering my request. I appreciate your understanding. 

I will see you there at 6pm tonight. Let me know if that works for you or not.

You would rather go out for some food instead of ordering delivery. You tell me that Chinese food here is different from your home and you want to try something else like the all-you-can-eat place we passed the other day called Al's Steakhouse.

I ask you if it's the place that serves such large portions of meat? I then reply yes, their steaks are enormous sometimes you can't even finish them!
