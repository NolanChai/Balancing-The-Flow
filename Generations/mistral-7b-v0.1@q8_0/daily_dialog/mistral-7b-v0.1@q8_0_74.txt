" yeah , we're great . She's now my wife actually . We had the most romantic wedding , just the two of us on a little island near Hawaii . And look at her now - she's just glowing with happiness and I feel so proud to be her husband . You know I can't believe you have yet to get married yourself . "

" hey , what's this ? Is there something wrong with me ? Just because I'm single doesn't mean I'm a loser . I don't need to settle down in order to be happy . "

" oh come on Bob , you know that we all thought the same thing when we were still at school . You were a catch then , so why aren't you now ? "
