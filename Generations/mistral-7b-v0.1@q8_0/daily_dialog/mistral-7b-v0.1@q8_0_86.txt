Instructor: I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.

Oh, yes, I remember when we first arrived in Guangzhou. My girlfriend and I were bargaining with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone. She was really good at haggling, and she managed to get the price down by quite a bit. I was impressed by her skills!

Do you know Chinese better now? Of course, I do! After being here for four months, my Chinese has improved a lot. It's not as fast as before, but it's still getting there.

Yes, I remember that day in the electronics store. We were haggling with the clerk and it was quite an intense negotiation. The salesperson was trying to get the highest price possible, while my girlfriend was bargaining for a better deal. It was exciting to see them both going back and forth!

At first I felt like it was going too fast for me to follow along with everything they were saying. But after a few minutes of listening intently and focusing on their body language, I began to understand more of what was being said. It took some time but eventually I got used to the speed of conversation here in China!
