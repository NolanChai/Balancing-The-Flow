" But anyway , at that time she used lots of Chinese words to persuade him . I knew nothing about it and she just took me for granted as a foreigner . She didn't even give me any chance to join in the conversation and when they reached an agreement I was still wondering what they were talking about ! "

" So , do you have any plans to stay here or go back home ? "

" Well , it's up to me now . You know , I could extend my visa by another year . But that depends on how much progress I make in Chinese . My company may also send me to some other places . We are planning to open an office in Shanghai next year . That means a big promotion for me if they choose me as a manager ! "

" Good luck . Well , anyway it's getting late and I have to catch the last bus home . See you later then . Bye-bye .

" But you should have seen my face , I thought I was going to die . It was the first time that I realized how different Chinese is from English . In the beginning , I didn ’ t think it could happen . I thought that if I listened hard enough and tried hard enough , I would be able to understand what they were saying . But I was so wrong ."

" Well , it’s interesting . At least now I know what to do . I should just let them argue and fight for a few seconds . I ’ ll say something like : ’ Oh dear God , can ’ t you guys settle down ? ’ or maybe ’ Please calm down and think about your children . ’ Then they ’ ll stop fighting , as if you ’ ve threatened their lives ."

" You ’ re right . It’s very effective . I have always told my foreign friends not to be afraid of the loudness . Usually , it is just an expression of passion or enthusiasm . "

" By the way , how do you feel about this city ? Do you like Guangzhou ? "
