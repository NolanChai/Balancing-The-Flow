ingling in the water near the Bahamas, with just one great hammerhead shark swimming past them. Researchers claim that this shows how schools of fish have learned to protect themselves from predators such as sharks by moving together in big groups. They say the fish are able to avoid detection from the deadly creatures and can also move away from danger far more quickly when they are with a large group. The shoal was spotted near the Tiger Beach, an area close to Grand Bahama Island. It is one of just a few areas around the world where hammerhead sharks come into shallow water to hunt for fish such as tuna and grouper. Researchers say that the fish have learned to protect themselves from the deadly creatures by moving together in big groups. They claim the shoal was able to avoid detection from the shark because they were all moving together in unison, making it harder for the predator to detect its prey.
