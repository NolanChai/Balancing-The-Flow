The 24-year-old, who scored twice in Wednesday's 5-0 Champions League win over Galatasaray, has been playing with ankle ligament damage since December and will sit out against Eibar before returning to action on March 9 at home to Real Sociedad.

"He needs rest, that is the most important thing," Ancelotti said in his news conference. "It's not a serious injury but it's one he can only overcome with rest."

Bale has been playing through pain for a few weeks now and appeared to be limping at points during Real's 5-0 win over Galatasaray on Wednesday. He scored the third and fourth goals in that game and also hit the post in the first half.

Meanwhile, Kroos will miss this weekend's match as he serves a one-match ban after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season against Galatasaray.

"Toni had to be suspended because it was his fifth caution, but he hasn't lost form and we know how important he is for us," Ancelotti said. "He will play on March 9."

James is also suspended after receiving a red card against Galatasaray that will rule him out of this weekend's game as well as the clash with Real Sociedad.
