 jungle, the calf, who is now three years old, arrived at the gates of the Tung Yai National Park in southern Thailand.

The elephant’s mother was reportedly surprised when her child appeared after so much time away from the park and returned to the wild.

While the pair were reunited on Tuesday afternoon (31 January), it is unclear how long they had been apart for – or if their separation was a deliberate one by the animal’s owners. However, the calf appears to have grown since its mother last saw her and would have been about six months old when she left the park, according to the national park authorities.

According to reports in Thailand, the baby elephant may have come from a camp that was previously located outside of the Tung Yai National Park but was later moved within the park’s boundary. A video of the reunion shows the calf and mother, who appeared to be very emotional about being reunited, engaging in a joyful greeting before going into a small holding area together.

According to Thailand’s Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation (DNP), it is possible that the baby elephant was separated from its mother when it was six months old to be kept with other calves for training purposes in another part of the park where there are more tourists. The young elephants could also have been relocated due to a conflict with the human population in the area or as a result of poaching, according to the DNP’s chief of national parks and protected areas, Pichit Krisdawut.

He added that they had no plans to return the elephant to her owners but would be keeping a close eye on it during its time at the park. The young animal has been fitted with an ID tag so officials can monitor its movements in the future.
