acardi Gutierrez was allegedly groped by the movie mogul during a meeting at his office in New York on March 18.

The 23-year-old was secretly recording their conversation when Mr Weinstein asked her to come back to his hotel room and "watch TV and eat popcorn", according to reports. It is claimed that after he invited her to the hotel room, Ms Gutierrez said she did not want to go and told him that she wanted to keep working in the industry.

When Mr Weinstein asked if she had been sexually abused before, it was reported that he denied touching Ms Gutierrez's breasts. "No, of course not," he allegedly told her during the conversation on April 10, according to the New York Daily News.

He then asked the model: "Was I hitting on you sexually?" to which she said "not at all". But it is reported that Mr Weinstein responded by saying: "I was trying to kiss you" and later told her "I'm used to that, you know."

In the conversation, the 64-year-old reportedly admitted groping Ms Gutierrez during their meeting in March.

"If I'm wrong, I apologise," he said on the recording, according to reports. "I can tell you right now, when I put my hands up your skirt, that's a problem." It is claimed that Mr Weinstein told her she was "asking for it" by wearing a low-cut dress.

The New York Police Department has launched an investigation into allegations of sexual assault against Mr Weinstein after he was accused of groping Ms Gutierrez in March.
