The Quins No 15 is set for another spell on the treatment table after suffering a second concussion in less than a month, following the blow he took during last week’s win over Northampton Saints at Twickenham Stoop.

It means Brown will sit out the clash with Wasps today and perhaps even longer as he continues to undergo assessments.

Quins head coach O’Shea admits that the risk of concussion in rugby is becoming a real concern, but stressed his belief that the game has to continue to adapt as it tries to limit injuries to players.

He said: “It is a worry when any player gets injured and I think Mike’s injury last week was probably one of the worst examples of how you can get an injury from a legal tackle – the fact that it is so easy for him to get that knock shows you the power there is in modern rugby.

“The game has changed dramatically over the years and that is one reason why concussion injuries have increased because players are playing faster, they’re fitter, stronger, they carry more speed with the ball and with the amount of tackles that are being made, it is an area of concern.”

O’Shea revealed he had discussed Brown’s latest injury with England manager Eddie Jones and Harlequins medical staff.

The Irishman added: “It is a difficult one because I don’t think anybody has got the answer to it. The players are playing faster, harder, more collisions, so it is not necessarily that players are being targeted in their heads any differently, they’re just getting caught up in more collisions and then you’ve got the speed at which they play.

“But we have got to try and find a way of reducing those injuries because I think there will come a time when people won’t want to see players playing rugby if it is going to lead them to that sort of injury.”
