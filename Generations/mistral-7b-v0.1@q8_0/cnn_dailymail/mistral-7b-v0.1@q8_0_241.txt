ers with a thigh injury but could start at Old Trafford in the Premier League meeting of title rivals.

"I can say yes, he will be available," Moyes told MUTV. "He is going to take part in training on Friday and hopefully there won't be any problems from that." Moyes also said Wayne Rooney is set to start after recovering from an illness that forced him out of the midweek victory against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League.

"He had a really bad throat infection," added Moyes. "It's really been quite nasty for him. He hasn't felt very good at all and he is still not feeling 100% but, having said that, I think we have to get him into training today and see what happens from there."

Moyes was asked if he would play the in-form Rooney alongside Van Persie or leave him on the bench to protect his fitness. "We will make a decision closer to kickoff," he said. "It is only going to be between two players who we are really happy with anyway. But, as I've just said, we have to wait and see if he gets through training today."
