Mayweather is currently training for the fight with trainer Roger Mayweather at the Mayweather Boxing Club. Roger's grandaughter Iyanna, 16, has also been working alongside her father to get fit and lose weight.

Iyanna was born in Las Vegas, Nevada, on August 11th, 1998, and is Floyd's youngest daughter. The youngster also has an older sister named Jirah Mayweather. Iyanna has been regularly attending the Mayweather Boxing Club with her dad since she was a child and clearly enjoys being around boxing.

Taking to Instagram last week, Iyanna posted a photo of herself inside the gym with the caption: "Training for fight with my daddy."

She also shared an image of her toned legs, writing: "Leg day... I hate it but I love how I look after I finish #fitlife #diet."

Meanwhile, Floyd and his father Roger have been in training camp for some time now. The 38-year old welterweight has a 47-0 professional record with 26 knockouts. In the May 2 fight, he will face eight division world champion Manny Pacquiao (57-5-2, 38 KO's), who is one win away from tying Mayweather with 48 career victories.

As for Iyanna, she recently shared an image on Instagram which shows her posing with a man who looks like former NBA star Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers. The caption read: "I've got the whole world in my hands."
