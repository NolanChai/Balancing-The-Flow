The secret drawings and letters belonged to the co-pilot of Enola Gay bomber which dropped the bomb and reveal Captain Robert Lewis's immense guilt following the mission. He wrote a letter following the first nuclear test at Bikini Island in 1946, just months after he had taken part in the Hiroshima bombing. In the letter, Lewis confesses to his wife that "I feel as if I was involved in something so horrible, and it seems to haunt me all of the time." He drew a cartoon depicting himself, dressed as a soldier from World War II, holding up a sign reading: "Wanted for Dropping an A-bomb on Hiroshima. Dead or Alive." The letter is now part of Lewis's archive at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where the Enola Gay bomber is housed. —Geraldine Pearce

A personal look at a controversial subject
I'm not much for war documentaries, but this one was done very well. It really puts the subject in a personal viewpoint which I found to be quite moving. This is not a political documentary, and it does not take sides, but simply tells the story from the perspective of the co-pilot of the Enola Gay, Robert Lewis. He was interviewed several years ago about his thoughts on dropping the bomb, and he wrote a letter to his wife shortly after doing so that basically says what an awful thing it was. After seeing the bombing of Bikini Island by the US navy in 1946, he felt even more guilty about it. This documentary shows these two things, along with some drawings Lewis made when reflecting on the event. The interviews and re-creations were done very well and I learned quite a bit from this one. Well worth seeing if you are interested at all in WWII or the history of the atomic bomb.
