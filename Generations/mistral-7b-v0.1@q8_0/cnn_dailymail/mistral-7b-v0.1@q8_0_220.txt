 Mohamed Ali Malek is being held at a prison on the Greek island of Lesbos following the tragedy this morning in which hundreds of people trying to make their way across the Aegean sea drowned after their vessel sank near the small island of Farmakonisi.

He was pictured wearing handcuffs and a black T-shirt as he sat in an interview room at the prison on Lesbos.

According to local reports he is a 23-year-old from Tunisia who had been trying to make his way into Europe for some time before the tragedy occurred today.
