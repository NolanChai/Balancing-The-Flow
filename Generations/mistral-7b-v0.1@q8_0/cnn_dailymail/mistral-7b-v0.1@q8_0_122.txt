Rory and Caroline, who have been dating for nine months, are believed to be planning a summer wedding. It's thought the pair were keen on marrying in Ireland, but may now choose to marry at Rory's family home in Holywood, Northern Ireland because it is easier to host guests than his homeland.

Rory and Caroline met in 2011 through mutual friends. They have been seen together at various high-profile events around the world including the Oscars, Wimbledon and the Monaco Grand Prix.
