, sherbet lemon and gummy bears - will be available for shoppers to buy by weight from the new counters at the supermarket in Stoke-on-Trent.

The sweets are being made with only halal ingredients and there is no pork gelatine used in any of them. The move comes after complaints from local Muslims that they were having trouble checking the labels on jars of sweets to find out whether or not they contained gelatine, which isn't permitted by their religion.

Morrisons has worked with Muslim members of staff and a local imam to make the sweets. The new counter will open next month. A Morrisons spokesman said: "We're committed to providing customers with what they want so we asked some of our Muslim colleagues in Stoke-on-Trent to help us find suitable products."

Asked why Morrisons had not brought the sweets into other stores, the spokesman said: "We are currently only launching them at the store in Hanley but will look at rolling them out further if it is a success."
