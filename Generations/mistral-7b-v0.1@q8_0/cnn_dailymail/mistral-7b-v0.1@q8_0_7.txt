24-year-old former University of Melbourne student, Mohammad Ali Baryalei (aka Abu Hamza al-Australi), urging people to join the IS militants because it is "the best country on Earth."

Baryalei says in the video that he has been given permission by the leader of IS to establish a health service for its fighters in the northern Syrian province of Raqqa. The doctor, who was a trained paediatrician, claims there is a shortage of doctors and nurses at the hospital.

In the 36-minute video titled "Islamic State Health Service," Baryalei says that the health services in Raqqa are being provided with modern medicines by a pharmaceutical company in Turkey. He also talks about setting up a dentistry clinic in Syria's largest city, which was once a major industrial centre for Iraq and Syria under the Assad regime.

Baryalei said the terror group has recruited doctors from Pakistan, Egypt, Iraq, Morocco, Algeria and Jordan. "We have specialists and general physicians, paediatricians, dentists and optometrists. They are all ready to work with us in this blessed land," Baryalei said.

The video shows Baryalei touring the hospital where he is seen talking with patients about their health issues. The IS-controlled Raqqa city has become a major centre for terror groups because of its proximity to the Syrian border with Turkey and it is easily accessible from there.

Baryalei, who was born in Australia, is known as one of the most influential militants of the Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq. He joined IS after returning to his homeland from a medical conference in Istanbul. Since then he has made several appearances in propaganda videos by the group.
