15 Minutes Of Fame, can be seen casually smoking in bed while a giant tarantula climbs up the side of his cheek and onto his nose.

The 50-second clip was uploaded to YouTube on 21 February with the title "Limmy has a spider in his mouth". The comedian captioned the video: "Spiders are just people who don't like having their feet touched."

It is not yet known whether Limmy is responsible for creating the freaky footage. One user commented: "He's got a f***ing tarantula in his mouth, I hope that's not real!" Another said: "I have to say this looks real... He's got an eight legged friend in there!"

In 2015 the comedian was caught up in controversy when he posted footage of him throwing a dog into a river. In the clip he can be seen approaching a dog that is tied up on a lead and throwing it into the water. It was later revealed the animal was actually his friend's pet and Limmy apologised for "upsetting" viewers.

The Glasgow-born star also found himself at the centre of another scandal last year when he posted an image of a girl that looked like her head had been chopped off on Twitter. It is believed to have been part of a publicity stunt in conjunction with his second novel, which was released in March 2015.
