10 feet away from their faces.

The button is set to reset at 24 hours every day, so if someone has clicked the button and it has been reset already, they will be unable to test themselves again until tomorrow. As of now, only 72% of people have been able to refrain from pressing the button, with 28% giving in.

Redditors who gave into temptation were quick to explain their reasoning for doing so, whether it was an accidental tap or a compulsive need to give into it: "I don't know how long I stared at that button," one user said. "But after about 10 minutes of just staring at it my hand went and pressed it."

Others explained their decision by saying the button was tempting them. One Reddit user, who gave in after a few days, claimed they were "not in complete control" because they were "thinking about pressing it all the time," which seems to be a common response.

There are some interesting outliers that have given into temptation, like this Redditor, who said, "I went out and bought a new phone just so I could set up a timer on my home screen." Or this user, who claimed they gave in because it was their "destiny," adding, "This is not the first time I've been challenged by fate to press that button. We are destined to be together."

The button challenge isn't new — it has existed online for some time now — but this particular thread is a few days old and shows no signs of slowing down, with over 350 comments already in. The person who created the thread claims that they "lost the bet" as well, meaning they have already given into temptation.

There are only two options you can choose from: to press or not to press the button, but what do you do if your brain is telling you to push it?
