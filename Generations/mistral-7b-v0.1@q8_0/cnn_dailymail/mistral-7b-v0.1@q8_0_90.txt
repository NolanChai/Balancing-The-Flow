 shows water rapidly filling the platform at Milsons Point Station in the heart of North Sydney as people rush to board trains. It is one of several dramatic videos posted online as Sydneysiders were forced to endure yet another downpour that came out of nowhere. The video was shared on Twitter by NSW Transport Minister Andrew Constance, who said: "If you think it canâ€™t get any worse this rain season, then think again". Another video, recorded at 12.50pm from the front door of a unit building overlooking the station, shows the water cascading down the stairs as people wait for trains. The Milsons Point Station was one of several in Sydney to be flooded during the storm. Other images and videos showed people wading through floodwater on platforms at Town Hall, North Shore, Wynyard and Crows Nest stations. A video of a train pulling into Circular Quay station as water rises on the platform has also been posted online. The downpour is the latest in a series of heavy rain events in Sydney in recent weeks that have caused major disruptions to public transport, traffic chaos, flooding and property damage. Earlier this week NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it was likely to be one of the wettest years on record for Sydney, following extreme weather across the country and widespread flooding in northern parts of the state.
