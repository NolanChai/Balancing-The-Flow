is Vytautas Zukauskas, 48, known as ‘The Tick’, was found guilty by a Lithuanian court in his absence and jailed for 12 years in December after failing to turn up for his trial.

But when he refused to get on the flight back home from Heathrow yesterday morning, immigration officials had to take him to hospital to be assessed by a psychiatrist. In a bizarre twist, Zukauskas has since been moved to Wandsworth prison in south west London after it was deemed that he was not depressed enough and did not need treatment.

After the farce, his lawyer said he would not return to Lithuania and will instead apply for asylum in the UK. Zukauskas was arrested at Heathrow on December 8 last year after landing from a flight from Vilnius, but has been held in Barking prison since then after refusing to answer questions about his involvement in organised crime.

He had been on Lithuanian police’s ‘wanted’ list for two years after being accused of murdering businessman Gediminas Paukste in 2005 and killing a man called Valerijus Slepnevicius five years earlier, according to the Mail.

A spokeswoman for the UK Border Agency told the paper: ‘We are working to remove this individual from the country but he is refusing to board his flight back to Lithuania. In the meantime we are continuing with our investigation and considering all options.’
