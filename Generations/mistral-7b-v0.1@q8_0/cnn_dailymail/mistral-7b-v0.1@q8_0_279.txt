ars a deal between the two companies.

The meeting is scheduled for later this week at the DOJ's office in Washington DC. In attendance will be attorneys representing Comcast and Time Warner Cable, along with representatives from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Reuters reported.

Those attending the meeting are expected to discuss concerns raised by Comcast's proposed deal with Time Warner Cable. It is understood that the Justice Department has particular reservations about the cable company's plan to acquire Time Warner Cable, and what impact this would have on competition in the marketplace.

It was reported earlier this month that DOJ officials were likely to approve Comcast's planned $45 billion merger with Time Warner Cable only if the deal includes conditions to preserve a level of competition among cable providers.

The DOJ is said to be concerned about how the merged entity will operate in markets where both companies offer their own Internet service, Reuters reported at the time.

Comcast and Time Warner Cable agreed to the acquisition earlier this year after talks between the two companies broke down last year. The merger would create a dominant provider of cable services. It would also result in Comcast acquiring control of about 30 percent of the high-speed Internet service market.

A combined company would have 30 million broadband customers, up from 22 million today, and 45 percent of US TV subscribers. Comcast and Time Warner Cable said at the time that the deal is expected to be completed in the second half of this year.
