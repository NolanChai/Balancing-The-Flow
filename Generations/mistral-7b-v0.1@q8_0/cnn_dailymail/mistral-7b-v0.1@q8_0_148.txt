 f Berkshire Polo Club launched the High Court action against the brand after it was approached by an American fashion firm called “The Royal Polo”.

They were approached with a view to launching their own clothing and accessories line, including polo shirts, hats and even gilets. The company’s founder Richard Thompson, said he wanted to use the name as it was the “Royal County” of Berkshire. However the fashion firm is registered in California under the “The Royal Polo” name.

In the High Court action, a judge ruled that the polo club could not register the name The Royal County of Berkshire and protect it from other traders. A spokesman for the polo club said:

“We are obviously disappointed with this ruling but we will continue to work closely with our existing brand partner on a range of new products.”
