 severe than it looks.

The video shows passengers boarding their Aeroflot plane to Moscow as the bus enters the frame, driving straight at the aircraft's tail fin and smashing into the rear left of the fuselage.

A second bus can then be seen reversing away from the scene as a crowd of people stand around in shock.

The bus is believed to have been transporting workers from the airport and collided with the Aeroflot plane during rush hour on the morning of July 23, 2015.

Two Aeroflot planes were stationed at the airport's apron in the immediate aftermath of the incident to transport passengers onward.

The Airbus 320 was undamaged and flew out on time, said Russian news agency Ria Novosti.

Russia-based website Aviasuperjet claims the plane was a Sukhoi Superjet, an aircraft produced by Russia's only Western-built factory.

Earlier this year it emerged that an unidentified passenger had been found dead in the wreckage of one of the jet's toilets during a flight from Moscow to Khabarovsk.

The dead body was discovered just two weeks after the Russian Ministry of Transport issued a report declaring the Superjet to be "the safest in the world", The Siberian Times reported.
