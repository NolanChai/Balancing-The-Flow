 a sudden change of heart – after he was convinced to eat vegan food for three days.

Bolt said that before starting the challenge he never thought he could do it, but after being forced to try new plant-based dishes including sweet potato and squash stew, he said his eating habits have now changed forever.

“The last thing I expected was that I would actually like the food,” Bolt told Vegan Food & Living magazine. “But when you put it in your mouth and you taste it – it’s different.”

Bolt tried out a number of vegan dishes and said he “thoroughly enjoyed them”, adding that he had not noticed any difference in his performance levels at the track. “I ate the same food for three days,” Bolt explained. “It was new to me so I didn’t know what to expect, but it was delicious.”

He added: “I was surprised because I love chicken nuggets and KFC hot wings. But I really enjoyed everything that was put in front of me.”
