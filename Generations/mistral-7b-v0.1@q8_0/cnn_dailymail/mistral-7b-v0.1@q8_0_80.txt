na Hasting was returning to the United States from a vacation in Greece when her luggage was lost by her airline. In the bag were her daughter's ashes.

The young girl died while still-born during childbirth earlier this year, and Jenna had packed her daughter's remains to take home after the family vacation. When her luggage failed to turn up at the airport, she frantically tried to contact the airline in the hope that her luggage was still somewhere in a plane or on an aircraft tarmac. The airline couldn't help. "I couldn't even get anyone from Delta Airlines to acknowledge that I had called them," Hasting said.

She contacted US Embassy in Greece, which was unable to help her. In desperation, she took to social media and posted her story on Twitter. A series of tweets caught the eye of an employee at the Abu Dhabi airports company who suggested that Hastings get in touch with Etihad Airways, one of several airlines flying between Greece and the UAE capital. "I've been speaking to our team over there, and they're currently trying to locate your luggage," said the employee, Zahra Aljaberi.

The airline managed to locate Hastings luggage after just a few hours and return it to her.

"We were able to get in contact with the airport authorities in Athens and they located the bag and transported it to us," said Etihad spokesman Peter Baumgartner. "The bag was then returned back to Hasting's hotel. It took less than 6 hours from her first tweet."

Hastings says she is very grateful to everyone who helped reunite her with the remains of her daughter, but especially Zahra. "She was so kind and worked very hard to make sure that it happened quickly," Hasting said.
