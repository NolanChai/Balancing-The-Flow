48-gram (1.7oz) hen’s egg ever recorded. It was laid at her family’s smallholding near Lochgelly, Fife, on Christmas Eve by the youngest member of their flock, a five-month-old Silkie bantam named Squidgy.

Shannon said: ‘My dad had to do some emergency surgery on it. The shell was so thin that he couldn’t put it under my mum because they would have crushed it. He had to sit with it for 10 days.’ Shannon and her mother, Linda Hayes, took the egg to the veterinary surgeon at Dunfermline to be weighed – the smallest hen’s egg in Guinness World Records measured 64g (2.3oz).

But after getting an official certificate of authenticity from the vets, they are now waiting for a reply from Guinness about whether it has made the record books. Linda said: ‘We will definitely let them know that it’s the smallest hen egg, but we’ll be happy to let Shannon keep the record.’
