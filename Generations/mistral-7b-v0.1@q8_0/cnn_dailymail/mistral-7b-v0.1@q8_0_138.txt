12 rounds of mayhem, but the build-up has been dominated by a number of things other than just boxing.

Pacquiao’s personal life, his weight gain, his tax issues and his political ambitions have all hit the headlines in recent times and Mayweather has taken great pleasure in poking fun at them, particularly when he was on Jimmy Kimmel Live. He even made a joke about Pacquaio’s wife Jinkee.

The Filipino star, who is 55-5 with two draws, spoke to reporters after an intense training session this week and revealed his disappointment that Mayweather has gone down the route of insulting his wife in order to get attention.

He said: “I’m not happy about it because I know that if I was married to a beautiful wife like Jinkee then I would feel the same way. It is important to me because we have three kids and they are all young so you want to show them how to be a good man or woman in life.

“You don’t want to say anything bad about somebody else.”

It’s clear that Pacquiao is keen for this fight not to turn into an ugly spectacle and while there have been some fiery exchanges between the two fighters, it has yet to reach the levels of trash talk that we saw from Mayweather in his fights with Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton and Shane Mosley.

He is keen to focus on the fight itself and the importance of this weekend’s clash, but he knows that for the fight to live up to its hype, the pair will have to perform.

“I feel it will be a good fight if we are both in our best shape, I’m sure,” Pacquiao added. “We always try to give the people the best of what they want and what they paid for. This is my dream come true that this fight is happening.”
