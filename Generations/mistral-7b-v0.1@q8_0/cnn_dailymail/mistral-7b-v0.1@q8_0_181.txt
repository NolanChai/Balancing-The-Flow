 will replace them.

Filipe Luis was an important player for Atleti, but his sale is understandable: he wanted to leave on good terms and so the club gave him a move to Chelsea, where he could make more money, win some trophies and maybe play in the Champions League. The Brazilian left-back was sold at a profit after arriving as a free transfer two years ago, so the deal has been good business for Atleti.

As long as the club can find an adequate replacement then there is little reason to get upset about the departure of Filipe Luis, and they have done just that by signing a 21-year-old Brazilian called Filipe Augusto Luiz: he is also a left-back who has been described as “a future star”.

Filipe Augusto Luiz currently plays for Brazilian club Sao Paulo and has been at the club since 2005. He made his professional debut in 2012 and scored his first goal later that year against Corinthians, earning him a place in the starting line-up.

The player has shown considerable promise this season, having already played over 30 times for Sao Paulo this campaign – which is more than he managed throughout his whole professional career before 2013/14.

He is now set to make the move to Europe with Atletico Madrid, who are expected to pay a fee of around €2 million (£1.8m) for the player. This means that the La Liga club will be paying just over half what Chelsea did in order to get their Filipe Luis back in 2012: at least they’re getting a younger model this time!

The young Brazilian is expected to sign an initial five-year deal with Atletico Madrid, although there may well be clauses allowing him to extend that agreement if he proves himself over the next few seasons.
