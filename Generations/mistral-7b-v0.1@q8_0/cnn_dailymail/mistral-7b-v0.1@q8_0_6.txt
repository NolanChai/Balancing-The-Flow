underland’s visit to the Emirates tomorrow.

The 24-year-old has scored just twice this season and only one of those was from open play in the 1-0 win over Fulham on September 15.

He was handed his first England start for six months during the 3-2 friendly defeat to Sweden last Wednesday but failed to make a major impact and was taken off after 69 minutes as Roy Hodgson’s side struggled against the underdogs. He also started the goalless draw with Poland on Tuesday, again failing to sparkle.

Walcott will now sit down with Wenger in a bid to get his season back on track – although the Frenchman has refused to be drawn on whether he intends to drop him against Sunderland.

“He is not happy,” said Wenger when asked if Walcott had been affected by England’s setbacks this week. “I have said that many times and we will speak again about it because it has been difficult for him since the start of the season. But he is an intelligent player, I don’t think he needs to change his attitude or anything like that. It is a case of finding the right place in the team.”

Arsenal have scored just five goals in their past six matches and Walcott’s absence from the side has been keenly felt, with Olivier Giroud the only other recognised striker on the books. The Gunners boss will make changes to his starting XI against the Black Cats as he looks to end a three-match winless run in all competitions.

“I am not sure if it is a crisis,” said Wenger. “We have played well and we have been punished by our lack of efficiency, so maybe I’ve chosen the wrong word there. We will change some players because it is a very demanding period for us, playing every three days. We need to rotate a bit.”

Midfielder Jack Wilshere should be fit after he returned from an ankle injury in the 2-0 defeat by Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night, but Aaron Ramsey will miss out through suspension and there are fresh injury concerns over Bacary Sagna, Lukas Podolski, Mathieu Flamini and Abou Diaby.
