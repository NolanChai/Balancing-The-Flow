a half years in jail last November after being arrested over a Facebook posting and a mural at his Mandalay bar.

Blackwood had said he is innocent of all charges and the mural contained no religious images – but an appeal against his sentence was rejected earlier this month. ‘We are very concerned about Phil’s welfare,’ said Chris Dawson of the Prisoners of Conscience Burma campaign group. ‘He has been left abandoned by the British Foreign Office for over a year now.’

British Embassy staff visited Blackwood last week and were able to send him money to pay for a prison uniform and toiletries, but it was not enough for his needs and he has sent them an appeal. Dawson said: ‘Phil has been left with no family and little support from the British Foreign Office.’

The British Embassy said it is aware of Blackwood’s case and is providing consular assistance.
