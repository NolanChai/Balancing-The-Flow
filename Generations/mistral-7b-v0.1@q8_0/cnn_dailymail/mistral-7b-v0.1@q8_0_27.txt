ponsored by the Eleva Methodist Church and the Eleva Lions Club, the annual event had raised $25,000 to $30,000 for local charities. The mud-wrestling was one of several activities during the fundraiser at a nearby farm that also featured horseshoes, volleyball games and rides on a tractor. But last year's event saw pigs being abused by members of the public as they took part in the wrestling, according to footage obtained by animal rights charity People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).

The group said it was informed by a PETA volunteer that: 'The pigs were punched in the face, body slammed and jumped on. They struggled to get away from the men holding them as they fought to escape the muddy ring.' The event has now been cancelled after Eleva Lions Club President Michael Tilgner said its members had 'serious concerns' about the way animals were being treated at the fundraiser, and decided that the wrestling should not take place again. In a letter (above) to PETA, Mr Tilgner wrote: 'It was a very difficult decision as it will be hard for our small community to come up with an event of this magnitude in one evening.'

The fundraiser had been running since 1978. PETA said that despite the wrestling being cancelled, members of the public would still be able to throw 'balls and vegetables at live pigs' at another part of the farm during the event on July 20. A petition calling for all pig activities at the fundraiser to be scrapped has now been launched by PETA. It states: 'We want to thank the Eleva Lions Club and the Eleva Methodist Church for recognizing that pigs are sensitive, intelligent individuals who do not deserve to have vegetables thrown at them or wrestle with drunken revelers. The next step is to ban all cruel activities involving animals from this year's event.'
