100 percent confirmed it, they believe that the toddlers accidentally wandered away from their home around 6:30 pm on Sunday.

According to the local news station ABC 15, Eli and Silas Keslar were playing in a dirt lot across the street from their home when their parents realized that they were missing.

The twin boys' parents searched for them before calling police at 8:30 pm, according to authorities. It was then that searchers located the children submerged in an irrigation canal roughly two blocks away from where the family lived. The twins were rushed to a local hospital, where both were pronounced dead.

“I think there was some other adults with them also who didn’t see where they went,” Yuma Police Sgt. John Priebe said. “It doesn’t seem that the children would have known that they could get into the canal.”

Authorities have not determined what caused the boys to end up in the irrigation waterway, but investigators believe it was an accident. An autopsy is being performed to confirm cause and manner of death.
