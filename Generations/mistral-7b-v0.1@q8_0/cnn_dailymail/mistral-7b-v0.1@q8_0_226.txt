 mind about the gay marriage issue.

As she explained to an audience at New York's Columbia University on April 21, 2013: "I would like to think that someday we will look back on this debate and wonder what the concern was all about."

She also stated: "I think it is time for our laws to catch up with our social relations," she said.

Ginsburg's comments at Columbia University in New York City were widely reported, but the Supreme Court didn't make a ruling on gay marriage until 2015. When it did, Ginsburg dissented from the majority opinion authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy and sided with Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan in finding that states were prohibited from denying same-sex couples the right to marry.

### Gay Marriage Decision - 2015

The Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states came down on June 26, 2015. It was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who also authored the majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges - a case about Ohio's refusal to recognize the same-sex marriage of two men, Jim Obergefell and John Arthur, in Maryland, where they had lived for years. The couple sued after Arthur died from Lou Gehrig’s disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), before their marriage could be recognized by the state of Ohio.

Kennedy wrote that "The history of marriage is one of both continuity and change." He quoted Justice Robert Jackson's statement that "Liberty finds no refuge in a jurisprudence of doubt," then noted: "It would misunderstand these men and their legacy to say theyagreed on everything. In any event, one central value of liberty guarantees --in our system --is that individuals are free to believe and affirm as they choose."

### Justice Kennedy's Dissent

Justice Anthony Kennedy was the author of both the majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges and his dissent when it came down on June 26, 2015. He had been appointed to the court by President Ronald Reagan in 1988; he was confirmed by a Senate vote of 97-0. Kennedy did not consider himself a conservative or liberal justice, but someone who tried to make decisions based on an interpretation of the Constitution.

As the author of the majority opinion in Obergefell v. Hodges - and the author of his dissent as well - Kennedy wrote: "It would misunderstand these men [Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan, who wrote the majority opinion in Loving] and their legacy to say they agreed on everything. In any event, one central value of liberty guarantees --in our system --is that individuals are free to believe and affirm as they choose."

### Ruth Bader Ginsburg Dissent - Obergefell v. Hodges 2015

Justice Ginsburg's dissent in Obergefell v. Hodges came down on June 26, 2015. She wrote: "The Court’s decision today is an act of will, not legal judgement. The right it announces has no basis in the Constitution or this Nation’s history."

Justice Ginsburg's dissent was joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas, while Justice Alito wrote a separate dissenting opinion which was joined by Justice Kennedy.

### Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Gay Rights - 2017

Ginsburg explained her views about gay marriage in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper in February of 2017, saying: "I think the court did the right thing [in Obergefell v. Hodges]."

She also said that she was not concerned that legalizing same-sex marriage would affect heterosexual marriages or lead to polygamy, as some opponents of gay marriage predicted it would do. Ginsburg explained: "There is no reason for thinking [the legalization of gay marriage] will have any effect on the institution of marriage."

### Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg - 2019

Ginsburg died in her sleep at the age of 87 on September 18, 2020. She had been appointed to the Supreme Court by President Bill Clinton in 1993 and had served as an associate justice since that time. Ginsburg was a staunch defender of women’s rights, gay rights and civil liberties during her tenure on the court.
