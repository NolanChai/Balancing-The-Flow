2018 champion Patrick Reed was an all-but afterthought in his native country before he became a major winner here — this is surely Jordan Spieth’s year to shine. And he showed at Colonial last week that the 30-year-old former world No 1 can still mix it with the best around when he is firing on all cylinders. A lot of people will say Dustin Johnson deserves more credit but the South Carolina star, who is enjoying a career-best season after a couple of lean ones, has already got his green jacket.
