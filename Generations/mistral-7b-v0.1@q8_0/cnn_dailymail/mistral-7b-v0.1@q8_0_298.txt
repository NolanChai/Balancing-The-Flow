Ronald Bert Smith, 65, had been sentenced to death for killing a pair of grocery store employees in Mobile. His conviction relied on an eyewitness who later recanted and a shaky fingerprint match, prosecutors said.

“There is no reliable evidence that connects Ronald Bert Smith to the crime,” prosecutors wrote in a motion filed Monday in Circuit Court. “The state cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr Smith committed this offense.”

In an interview with WALA-TV, Smith’s lawyer said she was elated by the decision and he will be released on Friday. “This has been a 30 year nightmare for Ronald Bert Smith,” she said.

Smith had long maintained his innocence in the fatal shooting of Willie Lyons and Walter Williams, who worked at the convenience store that prosecutors say he robbed. The eyewitness identified Smith only after watching a television report about the killings, according to court records, which also say investigators matched his fingerprint to a partial print on a bag found in the store.

Prosecutors said in their motion that there is no longer sufficient evidence to prove he committed the murders. “This is not an exoneration,” they added.
