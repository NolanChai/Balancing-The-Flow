The F train, which goes between the boroughs over and through the East River, was stopped just before 8:30 a.m., according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The New York Police Department said that no one was injured in the blaze.

Emergency vehicles responded to the scene at the Second Avenue stop on the Lower East Side, and video from the scene showed firefighters wearing breathing apparatuses walking through the tunnel toward the smoke.

Video posted by the New York City Fire Department shows a thick blanket of dark smoke inside the subway car. A train crew member can be heard saying "everybody get out" to the passengers, as he himself leaves the car. The fire was located in an electrical room under one of the cars, according to the NYPD.

"We are currently evacuating all customers from the Second Avenue station at 63rd Street and will provide more information when it becomes available," the MTA said. "Please expect significant delays on the F line due to smoke conditions."

Photos posted on social media showed a long line of passengers exiting the train car through a door at the rear of one of its cars and walking along the tracks toward an exit.
