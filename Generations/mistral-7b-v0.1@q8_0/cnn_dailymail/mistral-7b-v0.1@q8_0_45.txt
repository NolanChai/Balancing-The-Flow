## A hardware store worker has been found guilty of ejaculating in his female colleague's coffee in a bid to get noticed.

John R. Lind, 34, admitted on Thursday to tainting Pat Maahs’ drink with his sperm because he was ‘disappointed’ when she didn’t seem interested in him and wanted her to take notice of him at work.

The perverted employee worked alongside Ms Maahs at a hardware store in the US state of Wisconsin, where he would regularly ask her out but was turned down.

It was revealed during Lind’s trial that on March 15 last year, he decided he wanted to make his co-worker “more aware of him”, and so took a break from work and went into the men’s toilet at the store where he masturbated into a water cup and then into Ms Maahs’ coffee mug.

He then walked back out and gave her the drink, telling her it was his own special blend of coffee.

Ms Maahs didn’t realise what she had been given until later that night, when she took a sip of her drink at home and vomited.

She went to the doctor, who found traces of sperm in the cup and the victim reported Lind to police, who collected DNA from the pervert which was later matched with samples taken from his coffee cup.

Lind admitted to masturbating into the coffee and told the court he had not been “thinking clearly”. He also said he never intended for Ms Maahs to drink the semen-filled liquid.

The jury rejected Lind’s defence that he was mentally ill at the time, finding him guilty of first degree reckless endangerment, second degree sexual assault and battery.

Lind is due to be sentenced next month and faces up to six years in prison, as well as a £10,000 fine and being ordered to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.
