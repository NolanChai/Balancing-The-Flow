 wipes, was cleared from the Victorian sewer beneath Belgravia in central London after it blocked the flow of waste.

The blockage took three weeks to remove and involved clearing 130 tonnes of waste, according to Thames Water.

A Thames spokesperson said: "It's as big as an elephant and weighs as much as two double decker buses."

The fatberg has been broken up in the sewer where it was found before being put into special tanks that will be taken away and turned into green electricity.

Thames Water has launched a campaign called Fatberg Fridays to remind people not to pour oil down the sink, which can block sewers as they solidify.

Fatbergs have become more common in recent years as many households dispose of oils and fats down their sinks, or flush away wet wipes that are slow to biodegrade and gather together with other debris.

The latest example of the phenomenon was discovered in a 30-metre deep sewer beneath Kingston upon Thames in southwest London last year.
