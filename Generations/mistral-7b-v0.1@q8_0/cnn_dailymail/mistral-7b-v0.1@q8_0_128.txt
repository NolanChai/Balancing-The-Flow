altreatment three times after leaving their six- and ten-year old children unattended while they ran an errand. This time, their older son was arrested and handcuffed after he was picked up by police on his way home from a friend's house.

After their youngest child was first found alone in October 2014, Danielle Meitiv told the Washington Post that she had been "raised free range" herself and "taught my children to be safe and make good decisions." She added: “I’m not doing anything wrong. This is an issue of personal liberty.”

Now, the Meitivs have hired attorney Susan Basko who says her clients "will absolutely sue Montgomery County." After their children were taken by police again in February this year, the couple said: "We are not happy to see that Montgomery County has decided to continue wasting taxpayer money prosecuting us for being good parents. We feel vindicated that the judge agreed with our position that we are fit parents and did not harm our children. Unfortunately, these false accusations will have an impact on our family for a long time."
