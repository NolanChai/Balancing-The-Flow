A good Samaritan was given a parking ticket after he pulled over to help an elderly woman he thought was dying.

Student Drew Hollinshead, 21, stopped in the first space available when he saw the pensioner on the ground and phoned for help.

But he was given a Â£60 fine by Wiltshire Council Parking Services after his car was spotted parked outside a hotel in Chippenham on October 30 at 9am.

The university student says he could have walked to the nearest phone box instead of stopping but wanted to make sure she was safe and would get help as soon as possible.

Drew said: "I parked there so I could keep an eye on her, to make sure that nobody else got run over.

"There was no way I was going to walk back up the street to find a phone box because she was really struggling.

"If I had done that, I would have been worried about her being left alone on the floor. I was only gone for five minutes but it could have taken much longer if she needed an ambulance."

Drew's car was parked in the hotel's car park but outside the marked parking space and he was given a PCN (parking charge notice).

He said: "I am absolutely furious. I have been told to pay the fine or they will take it to court which means I would get three points on my licence."

Wiltshire Council Parking Services said it does not recognise Drew's claim that he was parked outside the marked space.

A spokesman for Wiltshire Council said: "The PCN issued to this vehicle states the offence as being in contravention of Regulation 12(1)(b), which clearly identifies that the vehicle must be parked 'in accordance with any other restriction'.

"The car park is privately owned, and therefore the rules governing the parking are private and not a public space. It is therefore not within the remit of Wiltshire Council to determine whether or not the driver has a valid reason for being in that particular space."
