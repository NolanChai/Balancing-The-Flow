inner is currently working as a club ambassador for Inter Miami in America and he'd like to see his old Barcelona nemesis Messi link up with his boyhood idol Ronaldo.

"I’m sure Messi and Cristiano will play together one day," he said, quoted by Marca. "I hope that’s the case."

Ronaldo was the world's most feared striker in the 2000s with his pace, power and skill allied to an eye for goal. His feats of brilliance were all too often overshadowed by his off-the-field problems but he has since made amends.

Ronaldinho was another South American star to make his name in the 2000s, but he believes Messi has been able to overcome his more wayward personality to achieve greatness on the pitch.

"When it comes to talking about Messi’s career, I think the most important thing is what he has achieved despite being a shy and quiet guy," he said.

Messi has won everything there is to win with Barcelona while Ronaldo's honours include five Ballon d'Or wins during his time at Real Madrid.

He scored 450 goals during his career and 128 of those were scored for the Selecao - including eight World Cup goals across four tournaments.

Since retiring as a player he has turned to management and is currently in charge of Corinthians in Brazil's top flight where he won his first trophy with the club, the Copa Sudamericana in 2012.

Corinthians are fifth in Serie A in Brazil at present and have one eye on making the Champions League places next season.
