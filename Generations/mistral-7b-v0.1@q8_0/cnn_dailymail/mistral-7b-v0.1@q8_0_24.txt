 England during the infamous Ashes series of 2013-14, when he left the tour for mental health reasons. He was selected for the current India tour, however, but suffered an acute bout of anxiety before the second Test in Mumbai, and returned home without playing a game.

Trott was dismissed by debutant Jasprit Bumrah, who pitched a full length ball on off stump which Trott left alone, only for it to take the outside edge on its way to wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha. The England management have suggested that Trott's recall is part of their preparation for the 2017-18 Ashes tour in Australia, but given this result it is highly unlikely he will play any further part in this series.

There was no hint of nerves from Trott at the toss, however, when he emerged on the balcony of his home ground with captain Alastair Cook and team director Andrew Strauss. Trott was visibly calm as he spoke to Sky Sports before the start of play: "I'm really looking forward to it; it's a big day for me. I think it'll be a great Test match. It's been a long time coming, and I'm just very excited that I can get out there on the pitch now."

Trott was immediately under pressure when he came into bat, with England in trouble at 72 for three after electing to bat. His opening partner Adam Lyth also struggled against Bumrah, who had him caught behind soon afterwards. Trott's return to the side meant that the Yorkshireman missed out on a debut, as Gary Ballance came into the team alongside Trott in the middle order.
