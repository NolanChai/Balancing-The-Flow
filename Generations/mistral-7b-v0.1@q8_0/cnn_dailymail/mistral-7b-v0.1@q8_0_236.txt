 Copenhagen on Sunday, which ended in a 3-2 defeat to FCN.

Agger was red carded by referee Lars Christoffersen for an elbow which saw him make contact with Jorgensen’s head as he jumped up from his initial tackle of the Danish international. The incident happened at the end of a game that had seen Brondby score three times in the first 15 minutes before conceding two late goals to draw level.

Jens Andersen, who was part of the Danish national team’s coaching staff, has since condemned Agger for his actions. He said:

> “He should have left it there [the tackle] and not made contact with the head. It is unfortunate as he is such a good footballer”

Agger will now miss Brondby’s home game against Esbjerg this weekend before he sits out again the following week when they take on Aalborg at home in the Danish Superliga.
