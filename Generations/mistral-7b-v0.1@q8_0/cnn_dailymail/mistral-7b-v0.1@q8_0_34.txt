 Unit (TAU), went to visit his parents at about 2 p.m. ET, according to NBC News. His mother and father were among four people found murdered inside their Manhattan apartment on the Upper West Side.

Police believe that the killer entered through a rear window before slitting the throats of Hugel's parents â€” who had been stabbed and hacked multiple times in their own home, according to NBC News. They also allegedly killed a 65-year-old guest and the husband of the landlady, who was found with his throat slit on a nearby floor.

"They were all murdered in a very grisly fashion," New York Police Commissioner James O'Neill said at a press conference. "I have been in this business for 42 years and I have never seen anything like it."

The New York City medical examiner's office has not officially identified the victims, but police sources reportedly confirmed that they were Hugel's parents, 76-year-old Marion, and 81-year-old Arnold. They also confirmed the identity of the man found with his throat slit on a nearby floor: 65-year-old Joseph Lozito.

The landlady, who was married to Lozito, was reportedly not home at the time of the attack and has since been reunited with her family, according to NBC News. The fourth victim has yet to be identified.

Hugel's mother reportedly told neighbors that she believed they were being watched, but police have no leads on any suspects. Authorities have not yet confirmed how or why the suspect may have targeted this specific apartment building.
