istically Stephen or Jimmy to his friends, has quite the body that he doesn't shy away from showing off.

In fact, he embraces it, and now works full time as a fitness model and personal trainer in London. "I get people telling me they love my tattoos," he said. "It's great that I can use my body for good."

The 6 ft. tall Londoner started getting into shape after an unfortunate knee injury put him on the sidelines for a long time. He was forced to find another way to get his adrenaline fix, so he turned to CrossFit. He got addicted to the new workout and began training intensely.

He had already gotten a few tattoos by this point, but decided to cover most of his body in ink after he learned it could help him connect with people. "I’d always been an outspoken, confident person, but I had a bad experience in my mid-teens and it was difficult for me to get close to people," he explained.

"After years of work, I got back on track and began to love my body again."

Jimmy also said his tattoos help him stay motivated. "Every time I look at them, they remind me that my body is a temple and it’s up to me what happens with it," he said.
