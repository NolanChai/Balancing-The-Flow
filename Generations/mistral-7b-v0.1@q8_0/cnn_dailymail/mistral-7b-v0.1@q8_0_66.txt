romatosis Type I, which causes multiple lumps to form along the nerves of the body.

Heslip was bullied throughout his school years, and as an adult he says many people still look at him in a strange manner because of the way he looks. Heslip said he finally feels accepted after meeting other people who also have the condition.

"I've always been the odd one out," Heslip told InsideEdition.com. "I used to get bullied, even as an adult people will stare at me and not say anything but it's clear they're judging."

He added that he feels like a "freak" when he goes out in public.

Heslip said his condition began to worsen five years ago after a bad reaction to medication caused 40 new tumors to grow on the side of his face and neck. He has since quit taking any medicine for the condition because of the complications he experienced with it. Heslip currently takes three medications, including steroids.

Heslip said he was born with the condition but that it worsened after a traumatic car accident at age 19. He has more than 200 tumors all over his body, and doctors say they're inoperable.

"I can't get a job," Heslip said. "The only work I could do would be working from home."

His condition also caused him to have hearing loss in one ear and damage to his eyes. He suffers from chronic pain that causes him to lose sleep every night, and he is currently taking opioids as a result.

Heslip said he's hoping the upcoming documentary about his life will shed light on the condition and help people understand what it's like living with Neurofibromatosis Type I.

"I hope this documentary will make people understand how hard it is for me to go out in public," Heslip said. "The only thing that's different about me, physically speaking, is my lumps."
