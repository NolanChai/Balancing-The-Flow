udicrous, scientists are convinced the rogues have plenty of food and water - even if they are not warmed by a star.

One theory is that these so called 'rogue' planets (also known as free-floating planets) could have a magnetic field that traps heat and energy from space - much like Saturn, which is also sunless, has rings that heat up because of the solar wind.

Astronomers say these planets could even harbour alien life, because their magnetic fields would create an environment similar to Earth's ozone layer - helping organisms survive.

It was thought rogue planets were unable to hold onto their atmosphere for long, meaning they had no chance of developing life. However, the latest theory suggests they are not so bad after all.

The idea is backed up by observations taken by scientists at NASA's Kepler space telescope - which have revealed that one rogue planet, called PSO J318.5-22, may be home to an ocean of liquid water.

Scientists said the discovery was surprising because it meant there was a good chance there are other planets out there with oceans, like Earth.

Dr William Welsh, at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, who led the research, said: 'The discovery of PSO J318.5-22 suggests that we could be looking in the wrong places for life.'

Another scientist involved in the work added that, while it was unlikely this particular rogue planet had any life forms, there were plenty more out there.

'We're not saying PSO J318.5-22 has life on its surface, but it shows that a free-floating ocean world isn't as crazy an idea as people might think,' he said.
