, has been out of work for two years and says that because she doesn't earn any money she shouldn't have to pay for her wedding. She said: "I think it's my basic human right to get married for free - the state should pay for it."

Anna, 41, a former beautician, is now looking at using a new website called Wedding-for-free.com which she hopes will help her find a groom with a similar mindset. She said: "I'm hoping to meet someone who feels the same way as me on the website so that we can share the costs of our wedding."

"It could be anyone from the unemployed, single mums or people living at home with their parents - all these types of people should have access to free weddings. "I think if I met someone who felt the same way as me then we would split the costs equally between us and we can both look forward to a big day without worrying about money."

Anna, whose parents are divorced, says her mother's wedding was expensive so she feels she deserves one for free. "My mum and dad got married 28 years ago and I was there when they walked down the aisle but it was an expensive ceremony and I never really felt part of the day."

She said: "The idea behind the website is to provide people with the wedding of their dreams without having to fork out. "You can upload a profile, just like any other dating website, and if you match someone then you have the chance of a free wedding at a lovely hotel or venue."
