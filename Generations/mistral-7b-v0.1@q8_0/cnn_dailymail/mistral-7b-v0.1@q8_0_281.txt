ashing Marlon Samuels for two successive boundaries to bring up his 24th Test hundred.

Cook's knock took the pressure off Joe Root, who was bowled by Shannon Gabriel in the first innings for a duck. The Yorkshireman had made just 17 runs in four innings coming into this match and needed to show form if he was to get into the side ahead of Ben Stokes.

Root is in no danger of missing out on the team for the first Test, which starts on July 23, but a good performance in Grenada will only enhance his chances. In the second innings Root has yet to make an impression, although he did top score with 41 against Essex in the warm-up match at Chelmsford before England departed for the Caribbean.

England resumed on 379 for 5 and were soon on their way to setting a challenging total when Cook reached three figures with a couple of boundaries off Samuels. The tourists had already been bowled out once but only lost three wickets in the second innings as they finished on 444 all out, leaving them an improbable target of 659.

England have made several changes for the first Test with Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali in, while James Anderson is replaced by Chris Jordan. However, Root's place is not in doubt and he will be keen to put a poor start behind him as England chase their second successive series win on foreign soil.

The second Test of the three-match series begins at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados on August 2.
