ello Trotta were all absent from the squad along with Brazilian pair Souleymane Doukara and Valdas Dambrauskas.

The situation has forced Leeds manager Steve Evans to sign six players on loan before 5pm today in order to have enough players for their game at The Valley tomorrow night.

Evans revealed that he had been preparing a squad of twenty-eight players but that the club were also hoping to sign two other loanees on Saturday morning, saying: "We've got 28 players who are fit and available in our matchday squad and we should have two more tomorrow."

Amongst those signed was defender Tom Adeyemi from Norwich City. The former Coventry man has struggled to establish himself at Carrow Road since signing a four-year deal with the club last year. He made just 10 league appearances for Norwich before returning to Leeds on a six-month loan deal this summer.

Adeyemi is likely to go straight into Leeds' starting line-up as the Whites are missing five central defenders for tomorrow's trip to Charlton. However, the signing of the former Coventry City man will do little to alleviate the problems Evans and Leeds currently face on and off the field.
