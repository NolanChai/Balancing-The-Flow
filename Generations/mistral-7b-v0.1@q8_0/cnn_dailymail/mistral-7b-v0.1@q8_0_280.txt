asex.net owner and his business partner were found to have been running their sex training business from a house just yards away from some of America's wealthiest residents.

Libertyville is the most expensive zip code in Florida, with properties there selling for as much as $5million, according to the Wall Street Journal.

But on Friday night at least 10 people were heard partying until 3am at the huge house owned by James "Jay" Taylor - who runs a website that provides tutorial videos and tips to help young women become successful strippers.

The neighbours complained to police about loud music, with a resident saying the noise was so bad her family couldn't sleep.

Taylor, 69, and his business partner 40-year-old Michael Wayne Anderson, were arrested on Saturday morning after police searched the mansion, which has an infinity pool overlooking Biscayne Bay.

During their search, officers found a secret room at the back of the house. The room, hidden behind a locked door and fake wall had been converted into a stripper training school.

There was a pole in the middle of the room with mirrors on one wall, so girls could see themselves performing. The floor of the room was covered with a special foam which allowed the students to practice their dance moves without slipping.

There were also posters featuring women stripping and a large banner advertising the business.

The men's bedrooms were just metres away from where the students were being taught to dance, with one bed only 10 feet from the training room.

Investigators also found that Taylor had installed a hidden camera in his bedroom which recorded videos of naked women dancing in the stripper training school next door.

The two men have both been charged with prostitution and video voyeurism, according to police. They could each face up to five years in prison if convicted on all counts.
