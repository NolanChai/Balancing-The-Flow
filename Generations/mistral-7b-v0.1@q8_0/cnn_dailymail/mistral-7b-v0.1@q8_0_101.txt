The paintings of Ben Quilty were selected for display at this year's Archibald Prize at the Art Gallery of New South Wales.

Mr Quilty is a friend of the two men and was asked by his lawyers to try to persuade the president to grant clemency, which he refused.

"Your Excellency, I am writing to you with great concern for my friends Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan. As you know, I am an Australian artist who has had a close friendship with these two men since 2012.

"In the years that I have known them they have given much to their fellow inmates. They have helped people in the most difficult of circumstances, they have taught others life skills and they have become mentors in spirituality and art therapy."

The artist said Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan were not the same men who were arrested in Bali for smuggling heroin in 2005.

He also urged President Joko Widodo to reconsider his decision and that he had an opportunity to show mercy to two people who had shown him "so much".

"Your Excellency, you are a man who has said you would like to be remembered as 'The People's President'. I am sure this is why you have been elected. If you take these men's lives you will not be remembered as such. You will instead become the man who took away two lives in the most cruel way possible and you will be remembered for your intolerance."

Mr Quilty said he was not "anti-death penalty", but had grave concerns about the execution of these men in particular.

"They have already served ten years. The courts in Indonesia found them guilty of a crime. They accepted this. In 2014 you became President, and you were voted into power to govern Indonesia. Now is the time for mercy."

Mr Quilty said he hoped President Widodo would "reconsider his decision" before it was too late and that "two good men can live long and healthy lives".
