pr showing off a near-perfect bikini body that looked nothing like most women expect to achieve when pregnant.

She announced the birth of James Hunter in an Instagram post on September 20, saying, "Welcome to the world my baby boy! I'm so excited to finally share our story with you all! James Hunter was born at 9 lbs 3 oz and 21.5 inches long."

"My entire pregnancy, I never experienced swelling in my legs or ankles, and the only discomfort I had was sciatic nerve pain for the last month," she wrote. "I didn’t gain a lot of weight during my pregnancy — just 40 pounds total! My doctors told me that I gained the perfect amount, but they were also shocked at how well my body handled such an enormous baby!"

Stage said she had never experienced any complications during her pregnancy, and had not even needed to be induced. The birth was fast and easy — so much so that Stage said she thought it was over before it started!

"James was born on the toilet and I didn't even know he was coming out," she wrote. "When I felt his head, I wasn’t sure what to do because I didn’t want to touch him or hurt him."

Stage said that when her husband told her to reach down and grab James' feet, she couldn't believe how big they were. She added that James is the perfect baby for Stage and her husband — quiet and calm — and that he sleeps through the night every night. "I know some of you guys are going to think I’m crazy," she wrote, "but our newborn routine is so easy, I love it!"

Stage said James is still in diapers but that her son is already sleeping all night long — 8 hours straight, every night. She also said that she does not follow a strict sleep schedule for herself or her baby. "We try to nap when we need to and don't overstress the times he wakes up," she wrote.
