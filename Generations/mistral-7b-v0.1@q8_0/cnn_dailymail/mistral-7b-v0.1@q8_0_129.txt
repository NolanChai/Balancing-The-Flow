, found Shirley Ann Brockwell guilty Monday.

She could face a sentence of life without parole when she’s sentenced next month for the 2017 slaying of George Fryer, who was 80 years old when he died. Brockwell and Fryer had been married for less than a year before his death.

Fryer suffered four gunshot wounds to the head. He was found inside his car on New Year’s Day in 2017 at a shopping center parking lot where he had gone to pick up some prescription drugs.

Investigators determined that Brockwell had been at the pharmacy and the parking lot about an hour before Fryer’s body was found. She then went home, cleaned up her blood-spattered car and returned to the store with a friend before going out for dinner in Placerville.

Fingerprints recovered from Brockwell’s car led police to her.

Prosecutors argued at trial that she was motivated by greed, saying she would collect $750,000 worth of life insurance and annuity benefits from Fryer’s death. She had previously been married to two other men who died under suspicious circumstances, but was never charged with any crime in those deaths.

Brockwell testified that she never killed anyone or witnessed a murder, though she admitted that she was at the scene of three deaths and saw her first husband fall to his death. She told jurors that her ex-husbands died of natural causes.

She said she cleaned up the car because she didn’t want people to know where she had been and feared she would be charged with a crime.

“I was in shock, and I just panicked,” she testified. “I couldn’t think straight.”
