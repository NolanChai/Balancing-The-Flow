The problem, according to scientists: Groundwater levels in much of the delta have plummeted in recent decades, sinking so low that it is drawing water from the underground reservoir beneath the Sacramento River.

Although some of the water is replenished as rain falls and seeps into the aquifer below, much of it isn’t, and it’s flowing through channels toward the river. A recent study found that 690 billion gallons of fresh groundwater from the delta flowed to the Sacramento River between 2014 and 2015 alone.
