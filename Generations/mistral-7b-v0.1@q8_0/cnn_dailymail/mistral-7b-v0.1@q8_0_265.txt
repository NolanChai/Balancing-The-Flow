(Washington Post)The White House said Wednesday that it has begun “targeting” more than 50 Chinese officials with sanctions for their involvement in human rights abuses against Muslims in Xinjiang, an escalation in the Trump administration’s campaign to counter Beijing’s treatment of the Uighur Muslim minority group. The measures also target entities in China that the White House said are “implicated” in the abusive practices. “Today we have begun a targeted process to sanction CCP and PRC officials who are responsible for human rights abuses against ethnic and religious minorities in Xinjiang,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. The announcement came days after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued his latest broadside on China, saying the communist country is committing “genocide” against Muslim Uighurs by subjecting them to forced labor, torture and sexual abuse in detention camps. A senior administration official told reporters that the sanctions are “the largest single set of actions taken under this EO [Executive Order] thus far,” and include people who are “involved in the implementation of these policies as well as those who are directly engaged in the creation of them.” The order, which President Trump signed in July, authorizes sanctions against any foreign person or entity found to be involved in human rights abuses, including through “gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.” It is separate from the Hong Kong Autonomy Act, another piece of legislation that allows the administration to impose penalties on those who have undermined the city’s autonomy.
