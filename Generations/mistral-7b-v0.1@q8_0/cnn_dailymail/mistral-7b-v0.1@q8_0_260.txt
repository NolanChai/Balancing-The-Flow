-ed Andrew Hutchings, 26, the scion of a Devon shipping family, was taken to a police station on Tuesday as detectives grilled him over the whereabouts of his 31-year-old girlfriend Emma James. The waitress, a mum who has worked at London nightclubs such as Mahiki and Cirque le Soir for more than 10 years, is believed to have met Hutchings while working in one of them. She was last seen on CCTV on the evening of October 12 walking hand-in-hand with her lover. Police were called on Thursday when Hutchings reported that she had gone missing.
