(CNN)The US military is sending additional troops and equipment to the Middle East amid mounting tensions with Iran, Pentagon officials said Tuesday, adding that President Donald Trump approved the deployment in recent days.

US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said during a news conference Tuesday at the White House that the deployments were ordered by Trump after the US military was hit by two separate attacks on oil tankers and oil pipelines last week.

“The purpose of these deployments is to enhance our force protection measures in response to irresponsible actions of Iran and its proxy militia groups, which have attacked American forces in recent weeks,” Esper said.

In a tweet posted shortly after the news conference, Trump announced the deployment of 1,000 more troops to the Middle East.

“In addition, I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!,” he added.

The Pentagon said the additional US forces will be sent from the United States, as well as from Europe and other locations in the region. Officials would not say how many troops are being sent or when they will arrive, citing operational security reasons.

The official said there are currently about 14,000 US troops in the Middle East. They include US soldiers who have been deployed to the region since last fall to counter potential threats from Iran and American forces that were already stationed in Iraq to train local forces.

Esper said he approved sending an additional battalion of Patriot missiles to the Middle East as well as “additional defensive missile systems.”

### US has not ruled out military action

The US military’s top officers have been weighing a range of options in response to recent attacks on oil infrastructure, including retaliatory strikes against Iran, but so far Trump has not given a final sign-off.

Trump has said he doesn’t want war with Iran but has also said the US has “a lot of options” when asked about striking back.

On Monday, he told reporters aboard Air Force One that he wasn’t sure whether or not there would be a military strike against Iran, adding that he didn’t have any immediate plans to meet with his national security team over the matter. He said he had not spoken to the US military about it “in the last 24 hours.”

Trump also said he doesn’t think the US is “going to have war” but did not rule out a military response.

“It would certainly be devastating for Iran if we decided to do that, I can tell you that,” Trump said during an interview with Fox Business Network.

Esper echoed those comments at Tuesday’s news conference.

“There are no plans for the President to issue additional orders,” he said. “The US does not seek conflict with Iran or any other country.”

### ‘Escalatory acts’ by Iran

Iran has denied responsibility for either of the two attacks on oil infrastructure that occurred last week in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

“We have no doubt that these two actions were committed by Iran,” a US official told CNN. “They are part of a pattern of escalatory acts by Iran, which also includes attacking commercial shipping.”

The first attack occurred Saturday when four oil tankers — two Saudi and two Emirati ships — off the coast of Fujairah in the UAE were damaged in an act that was blamed on limpet mines. The US military later released video that they said showed Iran’s Revolutionary Guard removing an unexploded mine from one of the tankers.

Two days earlier, two Saudi oil pumping stations were hit by explosive-laden drones. The US has since said the attack was launched from northwest Iran and involved a minimum of 10 drones.

A senior Pentagon official told CNN that while the US military still believes those attacks originated in Iran, they’re “still working through details on how to attribute the drones.”

The US military has also been working with its allies to investigate the two incidents and share information.

### ‘No doubt’ about Iran

Speaking at a press conference alongside Esper in Washington, Acting Secretary of State John Sullivan said the US is “absolutely confident” that Tehran was behind the attacks on Saudi oil tankers off Fujairah last weekend. He called it an “act of war.”

“These are blatant assaults on the freedom of navigation and commerce and they must end,” Sullivan said Tuesday.

The US is in close contact with its allies over what to do next, Sullivan added.

“We will continue to work closely with our partners to de-escalate tensions and support a diplomatic solution that addresses Iran’s malign behavior across the region,” Sullivan said.

Esper reiterated those comments at Tuesday’s news conference, saying the US will “continue to explore all options” when it comes to pressuring Iran. He added, “I believe that we can resolve this in a diplomatic way.”

But he also said the US is prepared for any eventuality.

“We must be prepared and that means all options are on the table,” Esper said.
