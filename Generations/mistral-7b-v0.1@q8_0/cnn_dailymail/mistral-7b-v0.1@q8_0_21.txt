 discovery happened on the outskirts of Chiclayo city on the Pacific coast. It is believed that the mummies of a woman and her child were taken from an ancient cemetery, which may have been disturbed by looters.

Experts believe that the mother’s body was in good condition with little sign of decay or insect damage. She is thought to have died aged 20 to 30 after a long period of malnutrition. A mummified foetus was also found next to the woman.

Peruvian archaeologist, Daniela Serrano said that she believed the mummies were at least 900 years old and that they had probably been taken from an ancient cemetery. She said: “We know there are tomb robbers in this area of Chiclayo who are looking for archaeological remains to sell, but we cannot be sure it was them.”

The mummies were taken to the Museum of Culture of Lambayeque province in Chiclayo city.
