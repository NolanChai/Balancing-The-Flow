 Eric held her hand, he looked over at her mother and asked what she should do. She replied, “Just go get married.”

So on September 16, 2012, she did. In a wheelchair with her new husband by her side, Rachelle Friedman Miller walked down the aisle to marry Eric Miller. At this point, Rachelle had already written her first book, No Pity for Me: My Story of Faith and Resilience, which was released in October 2011. The couple was also expecting their first child on November 15, 2012, but as the wedding reception began, Rachelle went into labor.

As she walked through the pain to deliver her baby girl, the room went silent. In awe of this beautiful woman, even the caterers paused for a moment before resuming their work. When she was done, Rachelle walked over to Eric and whispered in his ear, “You have a daughter.”

The couple named their little girl, Charlotte Rae Miller. Her middle name is a tribute to the late actress from The Facts of Life. The baby is a sweet reminder of what Rachelle Friedman Miller has been through. She was determined to be a mother and she did it in style.
