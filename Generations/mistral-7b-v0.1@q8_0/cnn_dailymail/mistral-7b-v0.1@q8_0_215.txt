2-1 win over Celta Vigo and will monitor his progress against Real Madrid on Wednesday night.

Koke, whose contract is due to expire at the end of next season, has made 20 appearances in all competitions for Atletico so far this campaign. He has become a key figure in Diego Simeone's squad since breaking into the team three years ago and scored six goals in all competitions last term as Atletico won La Liga and finished runners-up in the Champions League.

Mourinho has already strengthened his midfield this month, having signed French teenager Omar Niasse from Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow and the Portuguese boss is eyeing further reinforcements in that position during the summer.

Atletico are keen to extend Koke's contract but have failed so far to agree terms with the player, who wants a better deal than the one he is currently on. Chelsea could try to persuade him to move to Stamford Bridge by offering him significantly more money. However, Mourinho would also have to fight off interest from several clubs in Spain and abroad.

### Barcelona's Messi to sign new contract

Meanwhile, Lionel Messi is reportedly set to sign a new contract with Barcelona, which will keep him at the club until 2018. The Argentine's current deal expires in 2016 and talks between his representatives and the club have been ongoing since November.

Messi's agent Jorge Mendez revealed on Saturday that a new contract has already been agreed but will only be announced when he returns from South America after Argentina's World Cup qualifiers against Paraguay and Venezuela in March, according to Sky Sports News HQ.

The Barcelona forward joined the club as a teenager in 2001 and has gone on to become one of the best players in the world, winning the Ballon d'Or four times. His previous deal was reportedly worth Â£630,000-a-week and it is expected he will earn an increase to his earnings at the Nou Camp.
