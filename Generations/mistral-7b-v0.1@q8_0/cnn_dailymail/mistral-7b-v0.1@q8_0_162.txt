-blonde beauty couldn't have been more obvious about how she felt towards the man she married, James Thompson, on the show, it took her a few days for her to admit it publicly.

After a series of ups and downs, including one emotional breakdown on her honeymoon, it looks like Sarah has finally accepted that she is attracted to James and wants to work on her marriage with him. “I’ve never been married before so I didn’t know what to expect. All I knew was the media perception of what a wedding should be,” she told The Daily Telegraph.

“James was the complete opposite to what I thought he would be.”

The 27-year-old added that she now realises how much of a role her parents’ divorce played in her attitude towards marriage. “I never wanted to get married because of my mum and dad,” Sarah revealed, noting that it took time for her to realise the importance of compromise in marriage. “When you are married it is important to be able to have that level of give and take.”

“It’s not about James changing for me or vice versa. It’s about being willing to understand each other,” she said. “It took us a couple of days into the experiment to understand the value of each other – both the good and the bad.”
