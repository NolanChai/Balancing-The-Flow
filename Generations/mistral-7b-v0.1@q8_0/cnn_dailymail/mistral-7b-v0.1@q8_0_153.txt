ury on Saturday as second-placed Liverpool beat Arsenal and third-placed Chelsea drew with Hull to close the gap between them.

Their poor form means they now face a tough trip to Selhurst Park to play Palace, who sit just two points above the relegation zone but have lost only one of their last three league games, keeping clean sheets in all three. “We can’t drop any more points if we want to try and win this title,” Pellegrini said at a press conference on Monday ahead of the game.

“We must win at Crystal Palace or it will be impossible for us to fight for the Premier League. It is clear that we need to recover confidence, but it’s not just about winning games, but also performing well.” The Chilean said he expected a tough test in south London and added: “I think Crystal Palace is one of the most difficult teams to play away from home.

“Their team has speed, their players are very strong physically, they work as a team and defend very well. They will be difficult opponents.” Manchester City are just three points behind fourth-placed Southampton, who occupy the final Champions League qualifying spot and host Liverpool on Sunday.

But Pellegrini said: “There are five teams fighting for that place in Europe and we have to win the games at Crystal Palace or Southampton to fight for it.” Manchester City’s last trip to Selhurst Park, which saw them draw 1-1 with Alan Pardew’s team, was marred by a pitch invasion by fans protesting against club owner Sheikh Mansour, who was accused of not paying wages on time.

But Pellegrini said the situation had since been resolved and he expected nothing but good treatment from Palace supporters on Tuesday. “It is clear that we are talking about Manchester City, one of the biggest teams in Europe, and people want to see us play,” he said.

“The only thing I know is that we will have a very warm welcome in London and I hope that our fans can give their support as they always do.” – Agence France-Presse
