icetag on the keeper’s head.

Lloris has been linked with an Old Trafford switch for the past few months after Sir Alex Ferguson made him his top transfer target ahead of the summer window. The 26-year-old is believed to be open to the move and has already agreed terms on a bumper five-year deal.

However, United are wary that Spurs could pull an ambitious transfer tactic as they did with Gareth Bale last summer, according to the Mirror.

The Red Devils are keen to keep their spending down this summer but Lloris would be a decent long-term option in goal and a deal seems inevitable now with the Frenchman keen on the move. But Ferguson has already admitted that they are unlikely to go above £20m for any player.

Spurs are believed to be looking for closer to £40m for Bale, while Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy is also said to have slapped a £35m price-tag on Lloris’ head. United will now assess their options as they decide whether or not to take the offer to Ferguson.

The club are already likely to spend around £20m on Leighton Baines with the Everton full back top of Ferguson’s wish list.
