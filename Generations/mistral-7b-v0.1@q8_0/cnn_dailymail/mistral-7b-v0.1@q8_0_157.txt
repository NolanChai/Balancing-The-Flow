He claimed nationalists were 'very negative' about the UK, adding: 'I don't believe we should be letting them hold back the progress of this great nation.' Mr Cameron said it would be a disaster for Plymouth if Labour leader Ed Miliband took over No 10 - and that his party would invest Â£23m in improving the city centre.

The PM said: 'What does Labour offer for our armed forces? Less ships, less troops, less equipment. What does Labour offer for our veterans? We will carry on with Operation Recovery. The only party that is going to help veterans get back into work and rebuild their lives is the Conservative Party.'
