 Dallaglio about the situation but admits he still does not know whether he will keep his place as skipper when the World Cup begins next month. Robshaw is understood to have apologised to Harlequins coach Conor O’Shea and the RFU has also received a report into the incident. “I’ve talked to Andrew Strauss who gave me some really good advice and Lawrence Dallaglio, who was the first person I rang,” said Robshaw.

“He (Dallaglio) told me it is not a big issue – he said everybody does things like that, especially when you are a young captain with a young family. It’s a case of learning from the experience and putting things right.”

Robshaw, who has been married to Kerslake for three years, insists he did nothing wrong but accepts his actions could damage his standing. “I am very aware that my actions have not been great,” said Robshaw, who is hoping to make the final cut in Stuart Lancaster’s 31-man World Cup squad which will be announced on August 28. “When you are captain of your country and representing England, things are going to come out in the media and there will be a lot more scrutiny than before.

“I have never done anything wrong but it could look like I have. I am a big believer that people should do as they please so long as it is not damaging their health or others. It is my life, this is who I am, this is the way I act and I cannot change. If you don’t feel comfortable with me then there is nothing I can do about that.”

Robshaw admitted he felt “relieved” when he was named in Lancaster’s final pre-World Cup training squad on Tuesday but he still does not know whether he will be England captain at the tournament. “It’s an honour to be part of the squad and I would love to be England captain,” said Robshaw, who has led his country for 20 Tests since taking over from Dallaglio in 2012.

“We all know there are two big players coming back (Tom Wood and Dylan Hartley) so it is down to me to show I am worthy of the position.”
