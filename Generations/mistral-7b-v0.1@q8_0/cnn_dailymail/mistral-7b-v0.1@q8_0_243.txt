The four-year-old died after falling into an artificial lake at the foot of the slopes near Le Grand Bornand in France.

French police said the little boy, who lived in St Albans, Hertfordshire, was skiing with his father when he fell off a chair lift and landed in the water on Saturday.

Police added that the boy's body was retrieved from the lake within 20 minutes of the accident by members of the mountain rescue team who were skiing in the area.

The youngster suffered multiple injuries as a result of falling into the icy water and died before an ambulance could get him to hospital.

An official investigation is underway but Carwyn's father has told French police that it was an accident.

A statement from Carwyn's family on Saturday said: 'It is with great sadness that we must confirm the tragic death of our beloved son, Carwyn, who was skiing in France yesterday and died while doing so.

'We ask that our privacy be respected at this extremely difficult time. We are grateful for the messages of support we have received.'

The ski resort in the French Alps said it would open on Sunday as normal 'in remembrance of Carwyn'.
