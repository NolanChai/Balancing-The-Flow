adates' photographs which are then posted on Instagram and Facebook. She says: 'I’m very into butts. I just think they’re such a sexy part of the body that gets forgotten about. So I decided to draw them because it makes people happy. 'When I started posting, people really liked them so I kept going with it.' Catalina's most popular portrait is one of singer Beyonce Knowles and she says it took her a week to paint. She adds: 'She was hard as the dress is so colourful. It's my favourite so far because she has such a nice butt. 'I think I’m getting better as I go along - it takes me around three or four hours per portrait.' Catalina, who studied graphic design in Barcelona before moving to America, says her subjects are all celebrities from the entertainment industry and the internet. She adds: 'There are so many beautiful bottoms on the internet and on TV that it makes my job easy. 'I’d love to meet one of them but I don’t think they know about me yet.' Catalina has a degree in graphic design but says painting was her passion from an early age. She adds: 'When I was younger, my parents would send me to art classes and when I grew up I got a job designing t-shirts for a company. 'Now I am doing my own thing which makes me feel more independent and creative.'
