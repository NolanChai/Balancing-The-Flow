“We didn’t expect anything like this. It’s pretty rare and I think the first time we’ve seen it in five years,” said lifesaver Brad Hackett, who was on duty for the Royal Life Saving Society NSW. “It’s not really good for the pool to get filled up with sand.”

The swell came as the mercury dropped across much of the state. A cold front hit Sydney late yesterday evening and temperatures are expected to be cooler today. A southerly change is predicted to bring in even colder air, with a top temperature of just 20 degrees.

In Sydney’s inner west, some residents have already begun preparing for winter by switching on their gas heaters. However, there may be an influx of new tenants this winter as people try and avoid the skyrocketing prices of electricity bills.

The NSW government is considering a “warm homes” scheme to help struggling households. The plan would involve offering financial assistance with heating costs, but it could mean an increase in electricity prices for other consumers.

It’s not just Sydneysiders who are shivering as the mercury drops – many Queenslanders have also felt the cold snap over the past two days.

“It’s been very cold,” said lifesaver Ben Vanderheide, who was on duty in Brisbane this morning. “The waves were probably only about 2 metres but they were big enough to push right up to the pool.”

He added that he’d seen similar conditions before at Bondi Beach. “It just depends how far south the swell is travelling from. But it happens here every now and again, so we’re prepared for it.”
