3 out of every 10 calls were answered and 84 percent of the callers who did get through spent more than half an hour on hold, according to an April report from the National Taxpayer Advocate.

As a result, taxpayers often faced hours-long waits and ended up with no answers to their questions. "It's infuriating," says Jodi Ziskin, a CPA in Washington, D.C. "I get frustrated every time I call them, but this is the worst I've ever seen."

In recent years, the agency has slashed its budget for customer service operations from $180 million in 2010 to just $61 million last year (with additional cuts of more than a quarter planned for fiscal 2014). That means fewer operators available and more automated systems. It also means that those who do get through to a human being may find that person lacking in the knowledge department: The IRS has also cut back on training, says the National Taxpayer Advocate report.

"Taxpayers are understandably confused and frustrated about the lack of service," writes taxpayer advocate Nina E. Olson. "They simply do not understand why the IRS has chosen to reduce staffing levels instead of improving technology."

The bottom line: You're on your own, says Ziskin. Don't expect the IRS to be able to give you a clear answer about your situation or help you solve it quickly. If possible, go into your appointment armed with an answer to the question "What do we want from the IRS?" so that you can keep the agent focused. And if you have to call the agency, make sure you are prepared to waitâ€”and that you're calling at a time when you aren't likely to need to go back to work right away.
