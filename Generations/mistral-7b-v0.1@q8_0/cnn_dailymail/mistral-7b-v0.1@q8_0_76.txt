ovic's side claimed a 2-1 win at Barnsley, which coupled with Brighton losing at home to Derby sealed Watford's return to the top table of English football after a four-year absence.

Brighton looked set to secure their own promotion to the Premier League when they led Derby 2-0 at half-time on Saturday thanks to a pair of goals from Jamie Murphy, but Tom Ince pulled one back for the Rams in the second period and then equalised with four minutes remaining.

Watford took advantage, and ended up celebrating wildly after Troy Deeney's penalty on 76 minutes saw them past Barnsley.

"It was an important game for us because we wanted to play Premier League football," Jokanovic said afterwards.

"We had the opportunity to achieve that today, and it's not easy - there are a lot of good teams in this league and some of them will be angry they haven't got promoted."

Watford finished just outside the play-offs last season, but have been consistently among the top six all campaign.

Jokanovic has been building a side for the top flight and has said he wants to take Watford up into European competition - with their owners the Pozzo family having achieved that feat before with Udinese and Granada in Serie A and La Liga respectively.

"We have been preparing for this promotion," Jokanovic added. "We are well-organised, and we want to achieve good results next season."

Jonathan Hogg was one of the players who kept Watford in the division when they were relegated from the top flight in 2013/14.

"It's a big relief," the midfielder told Sky Sports. "I said before the game that we had to get promoted on Saturday and thankfully it was possible to do that.

"We have been waiting for this all season long, and now the hard work starts for next season."
