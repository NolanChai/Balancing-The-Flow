24 hours later by the hackers and had to change their passwords before reclaiming access to the account. The family-friendly coffee shop has since apologised for the pornography which was posted on its Facebook page by a hacker who gained access after an employee clicked on a malicious link in an email.

A staff member at Scooter's Coffee, located near 204th Street and Harrison Street, Omaha, received a phishing email from scammers pretending to be one of the company's vendors. The employee was prompted to click on a malicious link in the email and this gave hackers access to their computer and ultimately led to them taking over the company's Facebook account, according to The Omaha World-Herald.

The scammers posted pornographic content on the coffee shop's Facebook page before locking staff out of the site for 24 hours, said a report in The Omaha World-Herald. The hacker changed the company's password and locked its employees from accessing it until they were able to change the details and log back into Facebook.

Facebook is often targeted by scammers who post pornographic content on user profiles and fan pages of brands in order to boost views for their own sites, according to a report in The Inquisitr. Scammers are also known to steal photos from users and alter them before posting them online as part of what they call a "prank".

The coffee shop later apologised to customers through its Twitter account and said: "We're sorry our FB page was hacked yesterday, we were locked out for 24 hours. It's been fixed."
