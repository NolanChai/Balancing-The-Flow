Police say Ms Scott was raped before being shot multiple times with a single-barrel shotgun. Her body has not been recovered. At a hearing on Tuesday, Mr Stanford's parents said they were sorry for the pain their son had caused and offered their condolences to those close to Ms Scott. "We wish we could take it all back," Mr Stanford's father told the court. "What happened is unspeakable ... Our hearts go out to her family, friends and colleagues." "All we can do is try our best to keep him in check (in jail)."Â  Mr Stanford pleaded not guilty in court on Tuesday. His case was adjourned until his committal hearing next year. Ms Scott's funeral will be held at the Leeton High School on Wednesday. Australian Associated Press
