 - who came off the bench at the Bernabeu to help his side overturn a 1-0 deficit with two stunning strikes in the space of six minutes - had been left out of the starting XI for Saturday's La Liga victory over Getafe, meaning he hasn't played from the start since Real's 3-2 win over Sevilla on August 25.

Bale was given a one match ban following his red card against Espanyol earlier this month but even before that, Zinedine Zidane was using the Welshman sparingly. Bale has now made 14 starts for Real Madrid in all competitions this season (including pre-season) and he has been subbed on as a substitute in eight of the other matches.

But despite being left out, Bale is still playing an important role. He scored a stunning strike in the 2-1 win over Getafe and then netted twice in Real's 3-0 Champions League win against Atletico - including that stunning overhead kick.

Zidane has said he believes the 28-year-old is happy at the club, despite talk of a move to China, and there have been rumours that he could return to Tottenham next summer. But it's not just Zidane who wants Bale at Real Madrid - it seems his teammates do too.

Real players reportedly turned on Isco when he refused to play in the 7-3 win over Elche in August and they have since been singing a special chant for Bale after every match - a song which translates as "Gareth we need you" and is also known as the 'Bale Bale Song'.

And if Real are going to continue their winning run, Zidane will be hoping Bale continues to come off the bench. He was replaced by Marco Asensio on 67 minutes in Wednesday's Champions League win but he could come back into the side when Real face Sevilla at home this weekend.
