 t form of artistry that has since been lost: cave painting.

A team led by archaeologist Joao Zilhao from the Universidade Nova de Lisboa in Portugal discovered the remains of the woman, estimated to be 18,000-22,000 years old, near the Sierra de Aracena and Picos de Aroche Natural Park in southwest Spain.

"This is a truly important find," Zilhao says. "The human remains are the oldest yet discovered in the region." The body was interred with several artifacts: a bead necklace, a large blade made of flint and ochre, an arrowhead, a small stone hammerstone and some yellow flowers.

"This discovery is very important because it changes our perception of the people of that time," Zilhao says in a release. "These individuals were not savage people with no cultural development. This lady was buried with many ornaments."

The researchers also found evidence for ancient paintings deep within the cave, but have yet to investigate further. "There is still much work to be done on this discovery and we hope that this find will generate new questions for future research," says Zilhao.
