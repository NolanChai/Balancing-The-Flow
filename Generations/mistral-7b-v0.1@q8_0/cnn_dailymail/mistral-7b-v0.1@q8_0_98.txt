etg, and will launch a bid of £30million when the market officially opens tomorrow morning.

The 20-year-old has been the subject of two rejected bids from City, with both offers worth in excess of £15m. However, having failed to get their man during the summer, and with Liverpool unlikely to strengthen themselves by selling their prize asset, the club are set for a fresh approach.

The fee would represent a world record deal for a teenager, and one that could also potentially break the record fee for an England international.

Manuel Pellegrini is a big admirer of Sterling’s potential, but with no sign of progress in negotiations, Liverpool remain confident the winger will be staying at Anfield next season.

However, City are still determined to bring him to the Etihad and have been buoyed by Brendan Rodgers comments that there is no chance of any agreement being reached during this transfer window.

It leaves Sterling in a dilemma with the England international still having two years remaining on his current contract, and having rejected City’s advances earlier in the summer.
