lrd No.1 on his favourite surface and he will meet Robin Haase next.

The Dutchman won in three sets against Juan Martin del Potro, who has had some injury problems recently, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2. The pair last met at the US Open in 2013 when Nadal beat Haas in straight sets on his way to winning his second US Open title.

Nadal’s victory was the first of four wins for Spaniards in the first round on Wednesday night as David Ferrer, Pablo Carreno Busta and Roberto Bautista Agut also won.

Ferrer defeated Borna Coric 6-1, 7-6(4), Carreno Busta saw off Mischa Zverev in two close sets 7-6(2), 7-6(3) while Bautista Agut beat Alexandr Dolgopolov 6-3, 6-4.

Ferrer, who is seeded second this week, was quick out of the blocks against Coric and in the first set he only conceded a single game. In fact, it wasn’t until the sixth game that Ferrer lost his serve but even then he quickly broke back to win the set 6-1.

The second set was much closer but Ferrer broke at 4-3 and held on for the win. Next up for Ferrer is Diego Schwartzman who beat Pablo Andujar in three sets.

Carreno Busta, meanwhile, had a tough battle with Zverev as both men lost their serve twice and fought out two long tiebreakers before Carreno Busta finally closed out the match to record his first ever win against the big-serving German.

Carreno Busta faces Richard Gasquet in the second round after he came through against Nicolas Mahut, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(4).

Bautista Agut is also seeded and he recorded a comfortable victory over Dolgopolov, 6-3, 6-4. He will face either Marin Cilic or Viktor Troicki in the second round after both men won in straight sets.

Pablo Cuevas beat Damir Dzumhur 7-5, 6-2 to set up a clash with Albert Ramos Vinolas who defeated Mikhail Youzhny 7-5, 6-1. And finally, another Spanish player, Guillermo Garcia Lopez won in straight sets against Leonardo Mayer 6-3, 6-4. He will face Benoit Paire next after the Frenchman beat Fernando Verdasco, 6-2, 7-5.
