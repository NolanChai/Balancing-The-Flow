6,000 square feet of indoor and outdoor space in a new state-of-the-art habitat.

"They are an important addition to our population," said Jim Breheny, WCS Executive Vice President & Bronx Zoo Director, in a statement. "As part of a cooperative breeding program with other AZA institutions, these gorillas will eventually help further the conservation efforts for this critically endangered species."

According to the zoo, the pair, named Ndjia and her brother Imani were born on January 20 and 22 respectively. The mother, Maliyah, gave birth to Imani after a two-hour labor without complications. While Maliyah was carrying Ndjia, she developed an infection that affected her liver. She had a C-section, which has been the cause of her being unable to care for both babies herself.

Instead, gorilla keepers are handing feedings and grooming both gorillas, as well as providing "round-the-clock supervision" so that they can thrive. Both parents have been able to spend time with their babies since their births. The Bronx Zoo is also home to the world's largest gorilla troop in any zoological facility outside of Africa, numbering 17 individuals and three generations.

Western Lowland Gorillas are critically endangered, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Their population has dropped from more than 100,000 just a few decades ago, down to between 96,000 and 235,000 today. In fact, these gorillas are thought to be the most numerous of all four species in the wild. But they're threatened by poaching, deforestation, disease and war.

"These gentle giants share 98% of our DNA, yet their continued existence is dependent on a world that can provide them with space," said Breheny. "We want to educate our visitors about the challenges this species faces in the wild so they know how to protect them."
