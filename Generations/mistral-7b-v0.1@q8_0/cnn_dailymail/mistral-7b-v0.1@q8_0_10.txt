Hillsborough investigators have launched an appeal to track down  fans who tended to the wounded as they lay dying on the pitch at the 1989 disaster. Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards the action have been released in a bid to identify them, according to The Sun.

The images capture the moment Sheffield Wednesday fans rushed onto the pitch after the 3pm kick off on April 15 1989. But with only one survivor of that day in a position to provide any information, police are asking for help to identify people who helped to save lives.

The photos have been released by investigators from Operation Resolve, which was set up after the new inquests in 2016. The jury found that fans had not caused the disaster and that South Yorkshire Police were responsible for it. They also concluded that Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish and his assistant Ronnie Moran tried to help clear away victims from the pitch.

Operation Resolve is looking for those who attended to the injured or comforted the dying after the crush happened.

DCI Peter Marsh, from South Yorkshire Police, said: “We are hoping that this will lead to us identifying a number of people in our database and others we have identified from other photographs."

“They could be important witnesses, particularly for families of those who died. This is why we want to try and track them down,” he added.

The appeal comes ahead of the release of the Hillsborough Lawyers film by Channel 4 on Tuesday night.
