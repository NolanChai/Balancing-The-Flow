ing, of Los Angeles, was pronounced dead after being admitted to the hospital Tuesday evening. He was previously reported as "clinically deceased."

A Navy official confirmed to News4 that the swimmer is from Northern Virginia and graduated from West Springfield High School in Fairfax County.

Maring's death follows an announcement Monday morning that 20-year-old Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Kyle Mullen, of San Diego, died at a hospital after he was injured in a swimming pool accident on Sunday afternoon at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, near Virginia Beach.

A Navy official confirmed to News4 that Mullen graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria.

"He was such a wonderful young man. He was an athlete but he really loved science," said Mary Cullinan, Mullen's high school swim coach. "He had this amazing enthusiasm for learning."

Cullinan said Mullen loved swimming, and was on the team from seventh to 12th grade. She remembers him as a fun-loving kid with an infectious smile.

"This is the best sport in the world," Mullen told his coach after graduating high school.

Mullen planned on studying engineering at UC San Diego. He was planning to marry his fiancee next summer, Cullinan said.

"He had this wonderful enthusiasm for learning and he wanted to make a difference in the world," she said. "It's just so hard to understand that something like this could happen."

Little Creek is home to several units from Naval Special Warfare Command, including SEAL teams and support personnel, according to Navy officials.
