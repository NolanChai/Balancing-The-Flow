He told the officers he had no documents and that his car, an Audi A4, had been stolen. He also admitted having taken cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines and ketamine but said he was in possession of just £5.

He then attempted to drive away from the scene at speed – sparking a police chase through central London. Ali eventually pulled over in Camberwell New Road and was arrested after a struggle with officers.
