 falls on Saturday or Sunday and the following Monday is an official holiday. This year Anzac Day falls on Friday, April 25 which means that for many states and territories it will be a normal working day. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced last month that Anzac Day in 2019 would not result in the holiday being moved to another date. "The reason is because of an agreement made between all states and territories to honour those who have served our country," she said. That means that theÂ 44% of Australians living in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and Western Australia will be working on Anzac Day itself. There are 230 public holidays in Australia. In all but six cases they fall on a Monday. The only exceptions to this are Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Christmas Day, Boxing Day, New Year's Day and Anzac Day. With Anzac Day falling on a Friday next year the Saturday will be the only day off for most Australians. While many will head to local dawn services or the Gallipoli commemorations at the memorial in Martin Place Sydney, others may feel disappointed not to have a public holiday. "The Anzac legend is as important today as it has been historically," Ms Berejiklian said last month.
