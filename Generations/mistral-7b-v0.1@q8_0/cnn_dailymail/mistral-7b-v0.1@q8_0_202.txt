 is being called a freak accident by the highway patrol.

The concrete barriers are used to protect pedestrians walking under the freeway. At some point, one of them gave way and came crashing down on the car. The baby was found dead inside the vehicle, with his mother and father still alive but critically injured. They were both transported to hospital where they later died from their injuries.

Washington State Patrol have said that it was a freak accident and no one is going to be held responsible for what happened.

The incident is being investigated by the Washington State Department of Transportation.
