 room after the incident but later contacted police.

Aaron Lennon has denied all claims that he assaulted the young waitress during a night out at The Sugar Hut, a celebrity haunt in Brentwood, Essex.

The Tottenham Hotspur footballer is reported to have arrived at the club with his brother Andrew and another man on 29 June, where they were taken to the VIP area by waitresses. A few hours later, Lennon was accused of assaulting the young woman when he grabbed her from behind, pushed her into a corner and slapped her several times.

The girl has claimed that she was left with red marks on her neck and arms after the attack.

"She told police she was shocked by what had happened and fled to the toilets to compose herself," said a source, who spoke anonymously to The Sun. "After calming down, she then reported the matter to staff who took her to another room to call the police."

Lennon is currently on trial for dangerous driving after he crashed his car in north London in December 2016. The footballer, 30, pleaded not guilty but admitted that he was "highly intoxicated" at the time of the accident, which occurred when he tried to evade police as they were questioning him about an earlier crash.

The Spurs winger was later arrested on suspicion of drink driving and charged with dangerous driving after he drove his BMW into a lamppost in Ilford, Essex, and then crashed into another car while attempting to get away from police officers who were trying to question him about the first collision. Lennon also crashed into a second vehicle while making his escape.

A Tottenham Hotspur spokesperson has denied any wrongdoing by Lennon in the nightclub incident, saying that he and his friends were "behaving in an appropriate manner" during their night out at The Sugar Hut.
