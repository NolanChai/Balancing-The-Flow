 reported contain the spores and can trigger hallucinations.

A team of scientists at the University of California have spent several months examining 20 years worth of data from ghost hunters in the UK to try and discover why they believe in paranormal activity. They discovered that people who think they are being haunted suffer from “hallucinatory paranoid disorder” caused by exposure to mould.

The team were able to come to this conclusion after a man called Alan, from North Yorkshire, reportedly witnessed the ghost of his dead wife in their house for several years. He said that it was only when he renovated and removed the mould from the walls did the ghost disappear.

Researcher Dr David Holmes believes there is some scientific truth behind the claim that hauntings are a result of exposure to mould. He claims that Alan’s story and many others like it provide evidence for this belief, but he does admit that more research would need to be conducted before his theory could be confirmed.

Dr Holmes also said that while paranormal activity might not exist in the way most people believe it does, there is a possibility that there are other forces at work which cause these “hauntings”.

Dr Holmes’ team have been collecting data from people who say they have experienced ghosts or spirits. They hope to use this information to prove their theory by examining old buildings with high levels of mould and seeing if anyone reports paranormal activity there.
