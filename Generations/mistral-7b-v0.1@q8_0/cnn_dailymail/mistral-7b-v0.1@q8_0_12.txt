 Dortmund at the end of this season.

The 47-year-old German is expected to be linked with a number of top European clubs once he leaves Westfalenstadion but Beckenbauer believes his former club could make an approach for the charismatic manager.

"Jurgen Klopp would fit in at Bayern Munich," the World Cup winner told Kicker, as quoted by the Daily Star. "The question is whether there will be a vacancy."

Beckenbauer's comments come amid reports that Guardiola could leave Germany to join Manchester United this summer. The 44-year-old Spaniard has been strongly linked with Louis van Gaal's post, especially after the Dutchman confirmed he was leaving Old Trafford at the end of the season.

Bayern Munich CEO Karl-Heinz Rummenigge recently admitted Guardiola is aware about the club's interest in him and a move could be possible only if his former assistant Toni Kroos leaves Allianz Arena for Real Madrid this summer, as per the Express. The German midfielder has confirmed he wants to join Los Blancos this summer following Bayern Munich's failure to land him an extended contract.

Bayern Munich are also keen on appointing a director of football, who is likely to be tasked with identifying potential candidates for the managerial post, if and when Guardiola leaves the club at the end of his current contract in 2016.
