able King's Road in South West London (or even better, the designer stores at Harvey Nichols). So when we heard they were jetting off to one of our favourite cities for the new series we got very excited. And judging by the first episode, it didn't disappoint.

In case you missed the premiere last night, Jamie is trying his best to mend fences with Binky after his drunken antics at her birthday bash in the last series (which resulted in him being thrown out of her house) and we follow Mark Francis on a shopping spree to find a new suit for his forthcoming wedding. And it seems that there's a new girl in town who is making waves with the guys as they try their best to woo her.

So, in honour of this week's episode (and our love of all things Milan) we've picked out some of our favourite pieces from one of our go-to sites for designer goods - Farfetch.com. The site is a treasure trove of designer brands from across the world and whether you're shopping for something for your man, yourself or even your home this is the place to shop if you want the very best of everything.

We'd happily spend the night in any of these beautiful designs from Missoni, Marc Jacobs and Christian Louboutin. And if you're looking for the perfect gift for your partner (or yourself) this Valentino dress is simply divine.

The perfect way to accessorise a white shirt - or a black t-shirt for that matter, these Lanvin heels are just what we need to get us through the winter months.

Every girl needs a classic handbag in her wardrobe and the latest addition to our own is this beautiful Dior design which we spotted on Binky last night.

Now this is how to wear a coat! This Mulberry design is a thing of beauty. We'll be wearing it with our favourite pair of jeans and a cashmere jumper for that perfect winter weekend look.
