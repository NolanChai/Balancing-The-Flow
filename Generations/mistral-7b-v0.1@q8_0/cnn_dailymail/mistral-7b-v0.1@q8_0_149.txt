uck into the "Holy" Bible, with a vengeance. It had taken me 21 years (I'm 37) to get around to reading my own religion's holy book.

It was Easter Sunday morning and I was still in bed -- not exactly a devout start. But there is an old saying: "The devil finds work for idle hands." So I opened the Bible at random, just to see what would happen. The opening page (which happens to be Genesis 1:1) read: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."

That was it. And that was how I was going to start reading the Bible. With "the beginning" itself. So, there were no bells, no prayers -- just me and a big book of the word, in the beginning...

But what did "God" actually mean? The dictionary gave me an idea. But it wasn't until I had reached Genesis 1:2 that I got my answer: "The earth was without form and void, and darkness was over the face of the deep."

In other words, God was a force of chaos and destruction. Forget about light being the first thing he did -- it was "without form" at this point. And while there is some beauty in the creation process (as described in Genesis 1:3-18), the next section (Genesis 1:20-26) is not very nice. It's a lot about "Let us make mankind."

This was very different from what I had read before -- and it left me wondering if I could actually finish reading this book in one sitting. But it turns out that Genesis 1:27, "So God created man in his own image," is just the beginning of the story.

The Bible then describes how Adam and Eve were kicked out of the garden of Eden, where they lived with the animals. And I'm still reading!
