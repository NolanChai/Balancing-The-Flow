Cambiasso has lifted 12 trophies in a stellar playing career with River Plate, Inter Milan and Real Madrid including Serie A, La Liga and the Champions League.

But the 34-year-old Argentine is desperate to avoid relegation from the top flight for the first time as Leicester's only Premier League survivor from their title-winning campaign last term.

"I have won everything in football but it would be a huge achievement if we can stay up," Cambiasso told Sky Sports. "It's not easy to stay in this league, you need to win every game and it is very difficult to do that."

Leicester have lost eight of their opening 13 Premier League games and sit 18th in the table, just one point above the relegation zone.

"I'm a player who has won titles but I can tell you that if we stay up this season it would be one of the best things I have done in my career," said Cambiasso, who joined Leicester on a free transfer in September 2014.

"It would mean so much to me and all the players and staff here. We have had great results in the past and we need that again. The last time we won was against Manchester United, when I played, and this is what we have to do."

Leicester travel to Sunderland on Saturday in a match that will be overseen by former England midfielder Claudio Ranieri.

The Italian replaces Nigel Pearson, who was sacked in the summer after a series of rows with players and fans.
