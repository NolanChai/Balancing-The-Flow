our spot in the Premier League and both remain in contention in the FA Cup â€“ it is an important fixture.

United have asked that kick-off is delayed until 4pm to allow fans extra time to get to Old Trafford following the conclusion of the previous game, Liverpool's home match with Chelsea at Anfield. A police spokesman said: "We are working closely with Manchester United on this issue. We do not believe there will be any impact in terms of safety or policing."

Police say they have no concerns about traffic or crowd congestion outside the stadium after the Chelsea-Liverpool game, but United feel supporters should be given extra time to arrive at Old Trafford by pushing back kick-off.
