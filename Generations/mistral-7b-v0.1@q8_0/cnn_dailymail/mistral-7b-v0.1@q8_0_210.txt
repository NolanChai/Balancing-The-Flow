 was found by police divers about 4pm on Saturday in a creek off the Paterson River near Rutherford. Ms Jarmain's car was swept from a causeway along Wollombi Road during heavy rains overnight on Friday. Neighbours told The Chronicle she was trying to get home after getting her car stuck in a flooded driveway. Police said they were called about 6am when the vehicle was located with Ms Jarmain inside. "The woman's vehicle had washed from the causeway and downstream into a creek that joins the Paterson River," Acting Inspector Robbie Brown said. "We will be doing an investigation into what occurred." Ms Jarmain had lived in Maitland her entire life. Her family described her as a loving, caring person who would do anything to help someone else. A great-grandmother to two and grandmother to six, she was the oldest of nine siblings. She is survived by children Ian, Robert, Peter and Robyn. The funeral director said there was a big turnout for Ms Jarmain's service in Rutherford on Tuesday morning. Acting Inspector Brown said they were "relieved" police found Ms Jarmain alive when they first went to the scene at about 12.30am on Saturday. However, she died at John Hunter Hospital shortly after being taken there. The causeway where her car was found will remain closed until the flood waters recede. Acting Inspector Brown said Maitland had received 46 millimetres of rain in just three hours. "It's a terrible outcome for her family," he said. The Chronicle understands Ms Jarmain's daughter and two granddaughters were among those at her funeral, with other members of the family coming from as far away as Darwin. One family member told The Chronicle she was looking forward to getting out to buy milk when her car got stuck in flood waters on Wollombi Road. "She wanted to go and get some milk and went down there for a few minutes," she said. "It's really sad."
