The woman was filmed getting into an altercation with the man at a butcher store in Coogee on Saturday afternoon, and she has posted a video of it online.
She claimed the man had been rude to her over the phone while ordering her chicken, before becoming even more belligerent once she arrived in-store to pay for the bird.
But when 9News spoke to the butcher yesterday, he denied he was responsible for the altercation, saying the woman was trying to scam him out of a free chicken.
"I said if you want a chicken, I can give it to you for $30. She went away and didn't buy anything," the man said.
"She called me back later in the afternoon and wanted a chicken again. I said no, we've already sold out."
He then claimed he agreed to sell her another chicken at 6pm.
"She came in when it was dark and tried to get it for $15," he told 9News.
"I don't know why she made up this whole thing. I didn't do anything wrong."
But the woman is insisting she is the innocent party, saying she is a regular at the butcher shop and would never try to swindle him out of his money.
She says the man tried to charge her for the chicken twice, before eventually giving it to her free-of-charge.
