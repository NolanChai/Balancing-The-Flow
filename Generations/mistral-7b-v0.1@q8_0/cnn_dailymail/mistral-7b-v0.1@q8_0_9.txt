 The girl, named only as Anju, has been told she will be married off to a man 20 years older than her, and the wedding date is set for April 4. Now she has written to her teacher, saying: “I am so afraid of marriage. I don’t want to marry at this age, but my parents have made all arrangements for my marriage and they are forcing me to get married.” Anju went on to say that she wanted to study further and become a nurse, but was unable because of the financial difficulties caused by her father’s alcoholism. A friend who works with underprivileged children in India passed on the letter to Childline India Foundation, an NGO which aims to help disadvantaged youths in the country. The NGO contacted Anju, and is now working with her family and the police to find a way for her to be able to continue studying.
