50-over tournament, last played a Test against Bangladesh in December.

The 34-year-old was included as a reserve batsman for the World Test Championship final between India and New Zealand. However, Guptill did not feature in the match, which India won by eight wickets after bowling out Kane Williamson's side for just 217 runs in their second innings.

In addition to Guptill's recall, left-arm pacer Neil Wagner will make a return to the squad for the England series. Wagner was also part of the World Test Championship final but did not get an opportunity as he recovered from a shoulder injury. The 35-year-old last played a Test against the West Indies in February.

Meanwhile, left-arm spinner Ajaz Patel and paceman Matt Henry have been rested for the England series which will begin on June 2 with the first Test at Lord's in London. The two teams will then move to the iconic venue of Edgbaston in Birmingham to play the second match starting from June 10.

"Ajaz has played a lot of cricket recently, including three Tests and an IPL campaign, while Henry has had back issues over the last couple of years. The rest is really important for him at this stage of his career," selector Gavin Larsen was quoted as saying by Stuff.co.nz.

"With the World Test Championship final and the West Indies series we played a very similar group of players, so there are a few changes for this one. We also feel it is important to give opportunities to those players who haven't been involved in red-ball cricket recently."

New Zealand squad for England tour: Kane Williamson (captain), Tom Latham, Devon Conway, Will Young, Ross Taylor, Henry Nicholls, Rachin Ravindra, Daryl Mitchell, Colin de Grandhomme, BJ Watling (wk), Kyle Jamieson, Ajaz Patel, Neil Wagner, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Trent Boult and Martin Guptill.

Reserves: Tom Blundell and Will Somerville
