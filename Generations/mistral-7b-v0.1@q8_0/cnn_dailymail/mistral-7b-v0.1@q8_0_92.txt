 yard of their owner's home when they were snatched from a neighbour on Thursday. Their heartbroken owner Lorraine Kelly has urged anyone who sees them, or recognises their distinctive blonde-coloured thief, to contact police immediately. The 61-year-old said: "It's just like stealing your kids." Ms Kelly was away at the time but her sister Debbie, 65, saw what happened while she was out walking her dog. Ms Kelly, who works for a financial services company in Brisbane, said she had seen the neighbour before and thought they were friends. "She just went up to them with no words, took Marley off of his back and Mitzy off of her back and ran down the street," she said. "The woman was holding both dogs and just taking off, running down the street with my dogs." Ms Kelly's neighbours have since been looking for the dogs but had not managed to find them by last night. The thief is described as being blonde-haired and aged between 20 and 35 years of age. She was wearing a white top and jeans and was carrying a large black bag. The neighbour, who lives on Hastie Street in Stafford Heights, has been reported to police but Ms Kelly said her sister thought the thief "might be mentally unwell". Ms Kelly said Marley had suffered from bladder stones in the past and could not hold his urine. She also described him as the more sociable of the two dogs, while Mitzy was a little bit quieter. "He loves everyone and will go up to people," she said. "He's always the first one to come over if you've got a dog." Anyone with information is urged to contact police on 3621 9710 or Policelink on 131 444, quoting reference number QP2001485439.
