­seen on CCTV footage at about 2am on Saturday, June 25, 1988.

Today officers used an excavator to dig up the patio at the back of the pub after a member of the public reported seeing bloodstained concrete there in the summer of 1988. Detective Chief Inspector Iain Macrae, who has led the investigation from the start, said it was too early to say if the latest discovery would help solve the case or if human remains had been found.

A source at the scene added: ‘They are going through the back patio with an excavator and filling buckets with dirt in case they find any evidence.’ Deborah was last seen on CCTV footage from a camera positioned outside the pub, which she ran with her husband Graham. She was seen talking to a man in his 20s.

Her body has never been found and police say they will not give up their search for answers until they catch whoever was responsible for Deborah’s death. The new investigation is being carried out by detectives from Cambridgeshire Constabulary’s major crime unit, with the help of specialist officers from Leicestershire Police.

A total of nine people have been arrested in connection with Deborah’s disappearance since 1988. Six have since been released without charge. Two more were arrested earlier this year and charged with perverting the course of justice, but a court ruled there was insufficient evidence to continue their prosecution.

The final person has also now been cleared. Investigating officer Det Chief Insp Macrae said: ‘We are still confident that we will find answers for Deborah’s family and today’s investigation is yet another step in the right direction.’

A spokesman for Leicestershire Police said: ‘There have been a number of lines of enquiry during the course of this investigation, including excavating some areas of land.’
