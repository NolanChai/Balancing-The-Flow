360-style with our latest technology.

From today, we're introducing our virtual reality holidays - where you can get up close and personal with some of the world's most iconic landmarks without leaving home! We've teamed up with Google Street View to bring you a unique, immersive 360-degree experience using Google Cardboard.

We're launching two virtual reality holidays, both including our Virtual Reality Headset, an iPad Mini and a three night break at a choice of hotels for two people in a twin or double room.

## How it works

To book, just choose from one of our two holidays - a seven night tour of Abu Dhabi or a seven night South African adventure. Once you've got that sorted, we will send you a Virtual Reality Headset so you can see everything through your own eyes and even experience what it would be like to visit the locations in person!

The 360-degree videos mean you can look around every location as if you were really there. Plus, with the new Street View app from Google, you can get a fully immersive view of places all over the world - so your holiday planning just got that little bit more exciting!

## How to use the app

1. Download the Google Street View app on your iPhone or Android phone
2. Put your mobile phone into your VR Headset (you can buy a kit here for around £15)
3. Tap the 360-degree image icon and choose a destination, such as Cape Peninsula in South Africa
4. You'll see the location in full 360 view - it's that easy!
