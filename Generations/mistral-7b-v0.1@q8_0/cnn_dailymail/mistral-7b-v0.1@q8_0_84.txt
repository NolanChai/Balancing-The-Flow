Ahead of the bout – dubbed The Fight of the Century – Pacquiao is training in general camp and will move into the ‘tough’ phase this week.

The 5ft6 fighter is set to undergo the most intense preparation of his career as he prepares for the biggest boxing match ever, a record-breaking fight that will bring in an expected $400m revenue.

In the past, Pacquiao has received motivational gifts from Mayweather’s team, with Floyd sending him a gift basket on the day of their first press conference earlier this year, but Manny’s latest present could not be more different.

The 36-year-old posted an image of the gift he was sent by Shapiro – who represented OJ Simpson during his infamous 1995 trial.

The lawyer has been a friend of Pacquiao since the early days in his boxing career and is now sending him gifts to help fuel his fight against Mayweather.

Pacquiao’s latest gift was an engraved gun, which included the words ‘Manny 13-4’.

The Filipino’s record is currently 57-6 with 38 knockouts and the fighter is aiming to add Floyd’s name to that list on May 2.
