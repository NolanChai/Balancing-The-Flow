“I didn’t feel great out there and I just had to pull something out of myself,” said Williams, who will be bidding for an Open Era record-tying 24th Grand Slam singles title at the U.S. Open later this month. “It was definitely a lot tougher than I thought it would be.”

Williams had not dropped a set in her previous nine Fed Cup rubbers and 38 of her past 40 sets. The American star needed 10 break points to claim the first set against Giorgi, ranked 75th.

“I knew I was going to be tested today and she really came out and played a great match,” Williams said. “It could have gone either way.”

Giorgi took advantage of four unforced errors by Williams as she grabbed a 3-0 lead in the first set with breaks in her first two service games. The American, who has been ranked No. 1 for the past 68 weeks, battled back and finally broke Giorgi’s serve at love to draw level at 4-4.

Williams then wasted three chances in the 10th game before clinching the opening set in the tiebreaker. The American looked sharp from the start of the second set, breaking Giorgi’s serve in the first game and cruising through the rest of the match.
