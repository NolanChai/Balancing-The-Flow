.e. six months before US regulators swooped on him in a bid to shut down his alleged high-speed trading scheme.

The bragging came days after he had been accused of artificially inflating markets by selling stocks and then buying them back at a lower price. Sarao is being blamed for triggering the 'flash crash' on 6 May, in which shares plunged and recovered within seconds before resuming normal trading.

The US Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has now filed a lawsuit against him accusing him of manipulating markets by making a series of fast trades over several years. Sarao is believed to be the first person ever to be charged with such activity and could face fines or prison. He lives in a three-bedroom semi in Hounslow, West London, which he bought for Â£450,000 ($682,331) in 2007.

His family has lived in the area since the 1950s and his mother still lives nearby. One neighbour told The Times: "He seems a nice enough bloke." Another added that he had not been seen for several days but "he is very quiet, always closes his curtains". Sarao is currently living with relatives in Leicester and has been banned from leaving the country by CFTC lawyers.

The charges filed against him include spoofing and manipulation of markets in US Treasury futures, S&P E-mini contracts and Eurodollar contracts between December 2011 and April this year. Spoofing is defined as entering or cancelling orders with no intention of executing the trade. Sarao has been charged with making more than one million "spoofs" over a three year period.

A spokesman for the CFTC told the BBC: "It's extremely difficult to establish who is behind these trades and even if you do find out it's very hard to prove they have done something wrong."
