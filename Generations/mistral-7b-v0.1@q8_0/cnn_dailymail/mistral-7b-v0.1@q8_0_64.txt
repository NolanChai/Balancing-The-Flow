ognosed with multiple health issues at birth, including a rare genetic disease called Schinzel-Giedion syndrome, Malakai has undergone two open-heart surgeries and is currently in a medically induced coma.

The family from Fort Worth, Texas, have been told they can't take him home because he needs to remain in intensive care, according to the Mirror.

"I didn't think it was possible," Malakai's mother, Jasmine Odom, said of her son's illness. "We're still holding on with prayer and hope."

"He's not able to communicate or see, he can't move his hands. It's been a really long time since we've had any interaction from him," Odom continued. "It's pretty heartbreaking for us every day because we want to know what's going through that little head of his."

The family has been told Malakai won't be able to walk, talk or see, but the 27-year-old mother is hopeful her baby will surprise them all. She recently shared a photo of her son on Facebook, and wrote: "Even in all that he can not do he still manages to smile with such beauty."

Odom, who has been by his side since day one, said she feels "blessed" and "overwhelmed" by the support they have received from strangers. She hopes to take her son home soon so he can live out his final moments with his family.

"We would love for him to be at home and we would love for our family to come see him because right now we are limited on who can see him," she said.

"We need prayers, we need people to keep praying and we need God to be with us during this time because it is really hard," she said. "He's a fighter and I just know he's got something to fight for."
