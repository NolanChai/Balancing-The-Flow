ing it one of the shortest in living memory. But people were still able to watch as the sun, Earth and moon aligned to make a partial eclipse that started at 7:38 pm, peaked just before 9 pm and ended at 10:45 pm - all visible from North America. The next lunar eclipse will be in two years, on August 28, 2007. This one was not quite as good a spectacle as the last major total lunar eclipse on July 16, 2000 - which lasted a little over an hour and a half.

The moon appeared slightly reddish at its peak due to light bouncing off Earth's atmosphere and then being filtered through the smog covering many cities. The last time the moon was completely hidden by shadow for longer than five minutes was on March 16, 1982, when it took about six-and-a-half hours before peeking out from behind Earth. But even that pales in comparison to the total lunar eclipse of Feb. 20, 1879 - which lasted more than two hours and seven minutes.

So next time you see a lunar eclipse, take a few extra minutes to gaze up at the moon - it might be years before you get another chance like this one.
