30 years ago today meant to him and why, if he could go back in time, he would try to stop the game going ahead.

# A Brief History Of…John Helm

The man who was John Helm was born on June 28th 1947, at The General Hospital, Bradford. His parents were James and Annie and his father had been in the army but had come out of service after being injured during WW2. As a boy he moved with his family from East Bowling to Thornton Road, and then later to Whetley Hill.

“We used to live behind Bradford City’s old ground,” recalls John. “I can remember going down there when I was really young and seeing them play. We used to go along the road, through the gates at the side of the ground – right where the car park is now. They had a wooden stand right in front of us.”

In his teens, he was a goalkeeper for his school’s team and then played in an intermediate league for a club called West End. He was also involved in youth football coaching and took a team from Thornton Road to play against the local police team – and they won! In the early 70s, John was given a trial by Bradford City but, after playing in a pre-season friendly at Chesterfield, he was told that there wasn’t enough money left for him to be offered a contract.

“I went back to school teaching,” he said. “I thought I’d missed the boat.” He took up a teaching post at Whetley Lane Secondary School, which later became Whetley High School and then finally Tong High School, where he taught for 37 years – until retiring in June 2005.

John had been interested in broadcasting from his late teens and after being encouraged by his first wife, he applied for a job with the BBC when they were recruiting announcers. He was accepted and took up a position at Radio Leeds.

“I did the radio news and read the evening bulletins,” John recalled. “It was hard work but I really enjoyed it.”

He remained in touch with Bradford City during his time at the BBC and when he moved to Yorkshire Television (YTV) in 1975, where he presented the weather forecasts for Calendar News, he began working as a match announcer on Saturdays.

“I used to travel with the team,” said John. “We’d get up at about 4am and be on the bus by six. I remember one game that we travelled down to London for and we had to have a change of plane because of fog but I can’t remember who we were playing – or what happened in the match.”

On the radio John was heard doing some football commentaries, which was something that he would go on to do regularly over the next two decades. However his biggest claim to fame was providing commentary for Yorkshire Television’s coverage of the Tour de France. He had been chosen because he was a cyclist himself and had worked with YTV as a freelancer for several years.

“I used to be in the studio during the Tour de France,” said John. “It wasn’t that long after the French team had been caught up in a doping scandal and I remember getting a phone call from someone saying ‘Do you know what they’re using?’. I was on the radio at the time, but I couldn’t say anything.”

John also worked with YTV as a commentator on their coverage of snooker during the 1980s and was given the job because he had been an avid player himself. He admitted that he enjoyed the work even though he felt it could sometimes be “very boring”.

In 1975, John moved to Yorkshire Television (YTV) where his most famous role was commentating on the Tour de France – and he’d previously been a keen cyclist himself.

“It was hard going,” said John. “I’d be up at around four o clock in the morning, but it was worth it.”

The following year, he joined Yorkshire Television (YTV) where his most famous role was commentating on the Tour de France – and he’d previously been a keen cyclist himself. He admitted that he enjoyed the work even though he felt it could sometimes be “very boring”.

# What happened at Valley Parade?

At 3.45pm, Bradford City were leading Lincoln City 0-2 when the fire started on the main stand roof. The fans, however, were unaware of what was happening.

John Helm said: “I have a vivid memory of going up into the commentary box with a crowd that were in full voice and then hearing this explosion.”

It was clear that something was wrong so John left the commentary box and went down to the front of the stand to see what had happened. He said: “The back of the stand was engulfed in flames, it must have been absolutely terrifying for anyone who was still in there.”

John described what he saw as a “sea of people” running away from Valley Parade and said that he felt compelled to try to help them but there was nothing he could do. He recalled: “I don’t know if it was my imagination, or whether it really happened like this – but I thought I heard someone calling out ‘Help! Help!’.

“I ran down towards the front of the stand and then I saw two men running up towards me carrying a young boy between them. They were screaming for help as they ran past and I said to myself ‘That’s got to be a child in there.’ It turned out it was the son of one of the people who had died.”

John also described how he saw a fireman trying to break into the stand but being prevented from doing so by a wall of flames. “I saw him get to a certain point and then he just couldn’t go any further because the flames were too hot,” said John.

When the fire brigade eventually managed to reach those trapped inside, they found that there had been more than 50 people killed or missing. Many of those who had died were children and they included 21 members of the same family – all aged between two and ten years old.

John Helm recalls trying to help a young boy from Bradford City’s supporters club, but he couldn’t get through to him because there were too many people blocking his way. “I ran down towards where I thought he was,” said John. “I managed to get as close as I could and then I saw this little lad with his hands in the air screaming ‘Help! Help!’.

“He was crying and shouting ‘Mummy, Daddy’ but nobody would move out of the way so that we could get through.”

John said that he didn’t know what had happened to him after that because he had been told not to speak about it. He said: “I was told I couldn’t say anything until we’d found out exactly where everybody was, and then it would be too late for most of them anyway.”

He later described how he saw a fireman trying to break into the stand but being prevented from doing so by a wall of flames.

# What happened afterwards?

Bradford City have never played at Valley Parade again. In 1986 they moved to a new stadium called The Coral Windows Stadium and have since then been known as Bradford City FC or simply ‘Bradford’. John Helm said: “The club had to move because of what happened there – it wasn’t just the fire that killed all those people. There were also 80-odd people who had been seriously injured in the riot afterwards.”

The Coral Windows Stadium is a much smaller ground than Valley Parade and it has been suggested that this was deliberate because Bradford City didn’t want any more tragedies like what happened there on that fateful day. John said: “They wanted to make sure they didn’t get into another situation where someone could be killed or injured.”

# The man who wasn’t a hero

John Helm was asked if he felt guilty about not being able to save any of the children who had been killed in the fire. He said: “No, I don’t think so at all – but maybe I should have tried harder than I did.”

He admitted that it had taken him many years before he could talk about what happened at Valley Parade and still struggles with his memories of that day.

John Helm said that he didn’t know what had happened to him after the fire until 2001, when he received a letter from someone who was one of the survivors. “I hadn’t heard anything since then,” said John. “I suppose I thought they were all dead.”

He added: “When I got this letter it was like opening an old wound again and I didn’t want to do that. I decided not to read any more letters, but then two years later another one came through – this time from a man who had been injured in the fire himself.”
