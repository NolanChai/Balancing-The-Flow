Geronimi says the LFP chief "wasn't present on the pitch during the warmup or before the match" as his side beat Lyon 2-1 in Paris, a decision he called "a lack of respect".

> "It's unacceptable," Geronimi told L'Equipe.

He added: "I would like to see Frederic Thiriez resign from the LFP presidency. I don't want to be nasty, but it was a lack of respect for Bastia."
