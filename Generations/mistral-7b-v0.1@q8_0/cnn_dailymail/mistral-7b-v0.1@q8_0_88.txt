avolta, 79, was taking questions from the audience when one youngster stood up and said, "What is the reason I have hair on my balls?" The child then pointed at his crotch while grinning sheepishly before sitting back down in his seat. Alex quickly responded with a chuckle, saying: "Well, you've just won over the female audience."

The moment was broadcast on US television just weeks after Jeopardy introduced its first same-sex couple as contestants. On November 20, married gay couple Cedric and David Lujano took part in the quiz show together - a feat that is becoming more commonplace thanks to the increasing representation of LGBTQ couples across the US media landscape.

The Lujanos are also just one example of a growing number of same-sex couples who have appeared on American TV shows in recent years. In October 2018, for example, ABC broadcast its first-ever lesbian wedding episode when The Bachelorette season finale featured contestant Rachel Lindsay marrying her partner Brianne. And later that year, Netflix's hit drama Orange Is the New Black featured an entire episode devoted to exploring gay marriage as part of its sixth season.
