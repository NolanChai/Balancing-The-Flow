-old also insisted he would have no problem with taking over from Luiz Felipe Scolari at some point in the future should he ever be given the chance.

"I will have no problem if I am invited to take over the national team," he told O Globo. "When they call me and offer it, I will be happy to go."

Carlos has previously been linked with the role following Brazil's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The defender's former team mate Ronaldo was eventually handed a brief period as manager before Dunga took over and went on to guide the team to glory at the Copa America last summer.

The two-time world champions now have the services of Tite, but that did not stop Carlos from revealing his desire to one day take charge. "I always wanted to be a coach," he said. "My plan was to finish my career in Brazil and then go and coach here."

"In Brazil it is very easy to work as a coach. In Europe there are many pressures, so many demands. Here in Brazil you do not need the same pressure as in Europe. The players want to learn."
