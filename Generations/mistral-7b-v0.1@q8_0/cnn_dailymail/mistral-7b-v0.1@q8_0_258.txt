Aston Villa may be able to sign Cordoba striker Florin Andone for as little as £2.5million.
The Spanish side are poised to be relegated and need to raise funds.
Sportsmail revealed Villa have held talks over a £6million deal, which could rise to £10m depending on Andone’s performances.
However, Cordoba now face the prospect of dropping down to the third tier after defeat by Deportivo left them five points from safety in La Liga 2.
