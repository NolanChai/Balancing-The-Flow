 trauma, while 40 per cent of his brain tissue was missing, a coroner's report said yesterday. The court heard the boy claimed a 'big man' had beaten the dead child and taken him to hospital in his car, but he would not identify the man.

Lee's mother, 39-year-old Cheryl Bonneau, is being charged with second degree murder after Lee died in hospital. She allegedly claimed she was asleep when her son was killed. But police say she lied to them about the events and her son, who had learning difficulties, later recanted his story.

The boy also told his mother that Lee's body was missing, but officers found him wrapped in a blanket under his bed at their home in New Westminster, British Columbia. The boy is currently in foster care, pending the outcome of a hearing to determine whether he will be found mentally fit to testify against his mother.

Crown prosecutor James Gorman said he would seek an adult sentence for her if she is convicted.
