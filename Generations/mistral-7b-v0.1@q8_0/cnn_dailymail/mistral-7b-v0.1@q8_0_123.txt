 their 10-point advantage at the top of the Premier League, but defeat could see them lose ground in their pursuit of a second consecutive title. However, Ramsey insists it is just as important for Rangers to claim all three points and notch up their first home win since December 20  when they beat Stoke City.

"It's very important because we haven't won at Loftus Road in a long time," he said. "We want to get back into winning ways. If you can win the derby and then you can go into the international break on a high." QPR are currently third bottom, but Ramsey is keen to focus on the fact that they are only one point behind Newcastle United in 14th place.

Ramsey also believes Chelsea's position as title favourites will come under increasing pressure as the season progresses and he believes that will make them more vulnerable against a QPR side that has won their last four games against their local rivals. "They [Chelsea] have got to be (favourites)," he said. "If you look at where they are, you've got to give them that accolade. But I think there is a lot of water to go under the bridge. There's a long way to go in this Premier League season and it will become a little bit tighter."
