 2012 despite being ranked third in the world and won a silver medal at the 2015 European Games in Baku, told BBC Sport that he has been training with the Moldovan team since the end of last year. “It’s my best shot at getting to Rio and it was either Moldova or not making the team,” Cook said. “It was a difficult decision but I just want to be in Rio.”

Cook will make his debut for Moldova at the World Taekwondo Championships, starting in Chelyabinsk in Russia on May 12-17.

He will fight in the men’s 68kg division which has a maximum of one place available.

“If I get that Olympic place, it will be mine,” he added.

Cook, who will become only the second British fighter to compete for another country after London 2012 bronze medallist Lutalo Muhammad switched allegiance to Italy last month, said he had been training in a group of eight fighters, and would compete for Moldova at both Olympic level and in World Taekwondo Federation events.

“I’ve got my own personal coach as well,” Cook added.

The British Taekwondo Olympic qualification pathway saw the governing body introduce a new selection criteria for the Rio Games, which includes an international ranking system for the first time.
