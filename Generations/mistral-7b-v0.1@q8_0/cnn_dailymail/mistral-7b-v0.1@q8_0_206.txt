His question came after a series of questions about the government shutdown. The president replied, "Well, you know, we're in an unusual time right now...so I would counsel caution on all fronts." That’s when Yaya cut him off and said, “I know that, but is it a good idea to buy a home or rent one?”.

“What do you think?” the president replied.

"That's what I was thinking," Osman told CBS News later. He added he hopes the president will answer the question now that the shutdown has been resolved.
