y walk 200 metres when it turned out he walked for hours every day has been fined £795.

Paul Gregory, 51, of Bedford, had the blue badge for three years but after his neighbours complained to the council he was found to be cheating the system.

Luton Magistrates’ Court heard that Mr Gregory claimed he could only walk around 200 metres and could not stand for any length of time when applying for the badge in July 2016.

He received a blue badge under the Blue Badge Scheme which provides disabled people with a badge to help make their journey easier by providing free parking. However, his neighbours became suspicious and told Central Bedfordshire Council about his behaviour.

The council carried out surveillance on him at various times and found he was walking for hours every day. The court heard that the blue badge had been used 172 times from 2016 to 2018.

A spokesman from Central Bedfordshire Council said: "We are determined to crack down on the minority of people who try to cheat the Blue Badge Scheme and exploit it for their own gain. We know that the scheme is a lifeline for many disabled people, but Mr Gregory clearly didn't need or deserve one.”

He was found guilty after trial of dishonestly using his blue badge on 39 occasions between January 2017 and June 2018. He was fined £795 plus a victim surcharge of £79, as well as having to pay prosecution costs of £400.

He was also ordered to pay compensation of £20 per use of the badge between January 2017 and June 2018 amounting to £3,400, making a total of £5,296 which has to be paid within four months or he will face another trial.

A blue badge should only be used if you need to park close to where you are going because of the mobility problems that your disability causes. You can apply for a disabled parking permit on the gov.uk website.
