igrini could be sacked if the run of poor results continues.

However, former England boss Stuart Pearce believes that Manuel Pellegrini should not lose his job at this stage as it will affect the team and take them away from the top four.

“I’d be surprised if he gets the boot,” he told talkSPORT. “The club are going to have a huge rebuild over the summer, so I think they would keep him in situ for that. He did a fantastic job last season.

“It would affect the whole football club and the team itself.”
