 new state law requires all license plates to be approved by the Utah Department of Veterans Affairs, but officials say the license plate denied for Steve Hutchison violated that policy because it said "1968" -- when he got hurt -- rather than "Purple Heart."

"I'm just absolutely floored," Hutchison, who was 20 and a member of the Army's 8th Infantry Division in 1968, told KUTV. "They had no reason to deny it."

The state has no records of previous license plates that referenced the Purple Heart, but Hutchison says he didn't want it to read "Purple Heart" because he was not actually awarded the medal for his injury.

He was wounded in a grenade attack and taken prisoner after being separated from his unit in Vietnam's Dak To Valley. He was later freed during the Tet Offensive, according to KUTV. Hutchison is now the commander of the American Legion post in Layton, Utah.

"This man did serve his country," said state Sen. John Valentine, a Republican who sponsored the bill that requires all personalized plates to be approved by the Department of Veterans Affairs. "There's no reason he can't have this plate."
