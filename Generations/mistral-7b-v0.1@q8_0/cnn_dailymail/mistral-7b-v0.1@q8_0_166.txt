United's manager is looking to bring in one or two new players ahead of the 2015-16 campaign and has also been tasked with guiding his side through their third consecutive Champions League qualifier before embarking on a gruelling Premier League schedule, which is likely to see United involved in both domestic cup competitions.

Van Gaal wants his players to be fitter than ever ahead of next season and has persuaded Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, not to stage one of his trademark tours of Asia. Instead United will travel to America for three games against clubs yet to be decided.

"You have to see that I am very ambitious," said Van Gaal, who took Netherlands on a tour of Australia in the lead up to last summer's World Cup finals. "I want to prepare as well as possible. We did it with Holland and I also like it when you play three matches against different opponents. I think it is the best preparation for a new season."

Van Gaal added that United, who won the FA Cup at Wembley on Saturday, had been given special dispensation by Fifa to travel to America despite still being involved in the Champions League qualifying process.

"It has already started," he said. "We are playing against Club Brugge on July 30 and we have permission from Fifa so that we can play friendly matches. The preparation for a new season is very important."
