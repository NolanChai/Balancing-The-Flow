 Junction in Massachusetts.

Hernandez, 23, was led out of prison this afternoon in handcuffs after being found guilty of first-degree murder last month. He will be sentenced Friday and could face life in prison or even the death penalty.

The number is a far cry from his former life as an NFL star, which brought him fame, money and the adoration of his fans. Hernandez earned $40 million over the course of his short football career with the New England Patriots - including a $12.5million signing bonus after he was drafted in 2010.

The number W106228 is etched on a prison ID card issued to Hernandez, which Daily Mail Online has obtained. It confirms that the former NFL player's prisoner ID number is 106228 and lists his name, date of birth and arrival time at Cedar Junction in Walpole, Massachusetts.

Hernandez was sent to Cedar Junction after being found guilty on April 15th of the murder of Odin Lloyd. He is the first inmate at the facility since the death of notorious mobster James 'Whitey' Bulger, who died in his cell in October.

Hernandez will be locked up there for life or until he receives a new trial that could possibly lead to a death sentence. The ex-NFL star was sentenced to life in prison after being found guilty of first-degree murder on April 15th, with no possibility of parole for at least 15 years.

Hernandez is accused of gunning down Lloyd, the boyfriend of his fiancee's sister, in an industrial park near his North Attleborough, Massachusetts home on June 17 last year. Hernandez was arrested on June 26th and has been in prison ever since.
