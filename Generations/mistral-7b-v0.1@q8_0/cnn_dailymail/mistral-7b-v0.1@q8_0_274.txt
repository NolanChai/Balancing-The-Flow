The photograph shows the right landing gear partially detached from the aircraft, which was on its way to Brussels, Belgium, with 98 passengers and five crew members. The photo, obtained by the Mail Online, shows a large hole in the metal where the wheel should have been attached.

In a statement issued to the paper, an Easyjet spokesperson said: “On January 16, 2015, one of our aircraft operating from East Midlands Airport landed safely on the main runway after reporting a problem with its landing gear.”

“The aircraft taxied off the runway onto the apron and all passengers disembarked normally. As a precaution, we have arranged for alternative transport to bring customers to their destination.”

Passengers on board the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 10:45am that day, were forced to wait five hours in Brussels after the plane was grounded. They eventually touched down at East Midlands Airport around 3.30pm.

The airport’s operator said the aircraft landed safely and no one was injured in the incident.
