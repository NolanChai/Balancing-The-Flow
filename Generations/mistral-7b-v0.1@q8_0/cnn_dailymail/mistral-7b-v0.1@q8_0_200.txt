he window of my room at the Four Seasons Resort Maldives at Kuda Huraa is of white-washed villas on stilts lapped by waves of turquoise water, and dotted with palm trees so tall they look like pencil sketches. Every morning I watch from my balcony as a group of dolphins cruise by the reefs, jumping in sync out of the sea.

At low tide, tiny crabs scuttle across the sand and baby fish swim in shoals around my ankles. The air smells like salt water and coconuts. On land, everyone is barefoot (there are no pavements to speak of) and the people smile so broadly it looks as though they're wearing braces. There is something almost surreal about this place – in its tranquillity and natural beauty – and yet it feels completely real, like a perfect dream.

In 1973, the Maldives was one of the last countries in the world to be granted independence from colonial rule. As the country's only official language is Dhivehi, which has no alphabet but is written in Arabic script (influenced by Sanskrit, Hindi and English), it took a long time for the government to be able to communicate with its citizens. This was one of the reasons it took the country so long to develop a tourism industry, something that was not fully established until the early 1980s.

Since then, Maldives has become a favourite destination for honeymooners and anyone in search of a dream holiday: its resorts are world-famous. It's easy to see why, as the Maldivian islands are surrounded by some of the best diving sites on the planet, which offer the opportunity to swim with sharks, manta rays and whale sharks. The country is also a paradise for surfers (as well as other water sports enthusiasts), who travel to the Maldives from all over the world.

Today, the Maldivian government is trying hard to make itself more appealing than ever to tourists; this year it has made visas available on arrival at Male airport and it's investing millions of dollars in promoting itself as a "different" destination for those looking for an authentic cultural experience, not just a luxurious beach holiday.

With the opening of the Four Seasons Resort Maldives at Kuda Huraa – a new resort on its own private island in the North Male Atoll – I was invited to discover first-hand what the country has to offer visitors beyond the typical picture-postcard beaches and crystal clear waters.

There are 102 guest rooms here, including 69 beach bungalows and 33 over-water villas. Each has a private deck and direct access to the lagoon and every day guests are greeted at their door by an army of friendly staff carrying fresh fruit (and cocktails).

The resort's dining options include seafood buffet restaurant Reef Club, which boasts great views across the ocean, and Japanese restaurant Koi Ni, where I had the best sushi of my life. The food here is as spectacular as the island itself – especially at sunset when there is an extra helping of romance in the air.

There are a number of other activities to enjoy, from sailing (on traditional boats called dhoni) to snorkelling, and even surfing lessons; all of them can be booked through the resort's concierge service. But what I found most enjoyable about Kuda Huraa is its relaxed atmosphere – you feel as if you have arrived in a new home (and one where everyone is your best friend).

This is partly because of the staff, who are all extremely helpful and friendly (I was greeted by name every time I saw them) but also due to how comfortable it is here. There are no stressful moments during my stay: everything is taken care of so that you can relax without worrying about a thing; the only decision you need make is what food to eat next. It's as though all your problems have been magically whisked away along with those waves lapping at the shore, and replaced with endless possibilities for fun and adventure.

The resort's spa – which features an indoor/outdoor pool where I had my first ever open-air massage – is a great place to relax after a day spent exploring the islands (or if you just need some time alone). The treatment rooms here overlook the ocean, so it feels as though you are floating on water while someone rubs your feet. It's not uncommon for guests to spend hours at Kuda Huraa; most of them never leave their room once they arrive and it isn't hard to understand why.

For those who do want to see more of the Maldives than just their resort, however, there is plenty on offer beyond its famous beaches and underwater world; from visiting a local village to taking a day trip around Male or even exploring some nearby islands that are off the beaten track (like Kuda Huraa itself).

For those looking for something really special – such as diving with whale sharks – there are also a number of operators based here who can organise trips for visitors. The Maldives is not just about luxury hotels and beachfront resorts; it has much more to offer than that, from local culture (including traditional music) to the stunning natural beauty of its surroundings.

I left Kuda Huraa feeling refreshed, relaxed and ready to tackle anything life had thrown my way – which was just as well because within hours I would find myself back on a plane bound for London.

The Maldives has everything you could ever want in a holiday destination: stunning scenery; crystal-clear waters teeming with marine life; friendly locals and excellent food (not to mention some pretty impressive cocktails). It's no surprise that it's become one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.

But if you're looking for something different, more authentic – or simply want to get away from your everyday life for a while – then this could be just what you need.
