ith a stunning £900 dress at this year's Labour party conference.

The 43-year-old, who is now Scotland’s first female First Minister, has opted for some more glamorous looks in recent weeks including a floor length red gown and a figure hugging black and white ensemble, which was reminiscent of 60s style icon Twiggy.

So what has she done to achieve this makeover? And is it all down to her new glamorous lookalike, a 37-year old mum-of-three from Edinburgh who recently appeared on ITV's 'The Lookalikes' show?

Mhairi Macara told the Daily Mail: "I think we are very similar, but I would say that wouldn’t I?"

"She has a beautiful figure. It was a shock when she said it, because I’m not used to being compared to someone famous," she added.

Sturgeon is said to have been so impressed with the likeness between them, that she sent Macara an autographed copy of her biography, "Nicola Sturgeon: The Inside Story".

A source told the newspaper: "Mhairi was quite starstruck. Nicola is very gracious and sent Mhairi a signed copy of her book."

Sturgeon’s new look could also be down to a new stylist, as well as the fact that she has ditched her trademark glasses, which made her appear stern and unapproachable to some.

"I didn't think she'd make any major changes with her clothes or hair," said fashion expert Debbie Harper. "The change in image is not as drastic as the change in personality. It has become much softer."
