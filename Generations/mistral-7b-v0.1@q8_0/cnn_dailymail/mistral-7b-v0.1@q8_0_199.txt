154-foot-tall Mount Sharp while it was taking an image of the landing site called Gale Crater.

Curiosity, which is officially named Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), landed on Aug. 5 and is now in its third week of exploring the surface. The rover has sent back some incredible images of the planet’s geology so far as it tries to figure out if life ever existed on Mars.

Nasa said the orbiter took the image on Sept. 12 while it was flying over Gale Crater at an altitude of 8,500 feet and the sun was shining from the west.

The image shows Curiosity near the center of the frame, just below Mount Sharp’s base. The rover has already traveled more than half a mile from its landing site, which is marked by the dark triangle. It appears that it has turned to face east so it can charge its solar arrays with sunlight.

"We're delighted MRO had the opportunity to take this picture of the car-size rover during one of its routine observation periods,” said Nasa project scientist Rich Zurek in a statement. “It helps us all put Curiosity into perspective."
