aters to meet Home-Grown Player quotas.

James Milner, Gareth Barry and Micah Richards have all been touted as possible targets in recent weeks. And now Henderson – a reported £20million target for City rivals Manchester United earlier this season – is said to be a target of the club.

But who exactly are these players? Let’s take a look…

Jordan Henderson, 23 – Sunderland

Henderson was a boyhood Liverpool fan and joined the Reds as a schoolboy. But he has since developed into one of the best young midfielders in the country. He scored Sunderland’s first goal against City earlier this season to help the Black Cats clinch their first top-flight away win over Roberto Mancini’s side for 38 years.

He played in all five games at Wembley as Sunderland reached the FA Cup final and was named man of the match in the third leg against Everton – scoring in a 1-0 win that sealed their passage into the final. He has also been linked with Liverpool, where he will be back playing next season if the Reds avoid relegation.

Jack Wilshere, 20 – Arsenal

Wilshere is the man who replaced Henderson as a schoolboy at Liverpool, although he moved to North London before making his mark on first-team football there. He has been a regular in the Gunners’ midfield this season and was part of England’s squad for Euro 2012 – although he only featured in one game.

He is a combative midfielder with a great eye for goal and also excellent distribution skills, which are much-needed at the Etihad Stadium. He will be keen to avoid following in the footsteps of fellow England midfielders Milner, Adam Johnson and Joe Cole, who were all lured away from the Emirates by City’s Premier League rivals.

So there you go, two players who have been linked with City this week but are actually both on Sunderland and Arsenal’s books respectively.
