4-1 underdog for the "Fight of the Century" at MGM Grand and has vowed to "take control early" if he is to beat his rival and claim a piece of boxing history. Pacquiao, who turns 36 this month, will become the oldest man ever to win a world title when he takes on Mayweather (47-0), who is four years younger than him. The 5ft 6in Filipino has never been knocked out but his punch resistance and ability to keep going in the latter stages of fights is not what it was. Pacquiao won back the WBO welterweight title from Tim Bradley last December after losing it to him two years earlier and is now back as No.2 on Mayweather's pound-for-pound list behind his fellow American Andre Ward. He said: "I have to fight like my life depends on it because that’s what we are fighting for. I need the win more than he does. So I will take control early, but I can’t go crazy and get caught by a left hand. "I am going to go after him from the first round. My style is aggressive and exciting so I will be going forward looking to knock him out." Pacquiao was not at his best when he faced Bradley in their rematch. He suffered swelling around both eyes after being hit with some powerful left hands in the early stages of the fight but recovered to win a unanimous 12-round decision. His trainer Freddie Roach said: "If I am not happy with the performance I’m not going to send him out there." Pacquiao added: "I have trained so hard and my goal is to go in there and bring my best game. "My goal is to dominate Floyd, but if that doesn't happen then I will do the best I can. I feel great at 147 pounds."
