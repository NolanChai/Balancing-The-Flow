0 buy marijuana products legally, with the company itself handling all legal issues so that it complies with California state law.

The service currently only operates in California but is quickly expanding, with over 50 employees working for the company to handle logistics, administration and product quality. It's a fairly straightforward process: users order from a range of products listed on Eaze’s website; they receive an email confirmation and then their driver contacts them by phone within 15 minutes to arrange delivery.

Eaze was launched in February this year by Keith McCarty, who previously co-founded cloud company Heroku which was acquired by Salesforce for $212m (£138m) in 2010. Speaking to Wired at the time of its launch, McCarty said that it aims to be "the easiest and fastest way" to get marijuana products delivered.

California has a long history with cannabis – it was the first state to legalise the use of medical marijuana in 1996. However, when users place an order for weed on Eaze they are not legally allowed to smoke or ingest the product – instead they can only consume it for medical reasons such as pain relief and glaucoma treatment. The service is aimed at those who do not have access to a dispensary in California, although some local laws allow customers to use it if their dispensary is closed.

McCarty believes that the service will be an essential one for cannabis users – with medical marijuana legalisation spreading across states and countries, he predicts that “pretty soon people are going to be able to order pot in a lot more places than they can today”.
