 for giant pandas.

The previous record holder was also called Zhen Zhen who mated with the panda Le Le in China's southwestern province of Sichuan last year. The pair lasted a total of six minutes and 17 seconds.

Pandas have been known to mate for over an hour, but that is unusual. Usually they last between one and three minutes, according to reports.

In a bid to encourage the pandas to breed, zoos in China have now introduced artificial insemination techniques as well as matchmaking services.

The mating season only happens once a year for giant pandas during their breeding season which lasts from March through May.
