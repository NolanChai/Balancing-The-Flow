# High school teacher murdered and dismembered before being burnt is finally identified

The remains of high school teacher and bride-to-be Stephanie Scott have been formally identified.

The 26-year-old's burned body was found around five metres from a road in Cocoparra National Park, north of Leeton in southwest New South Wales on Friday.

Police were able to match the body using dental records.

Ms Scott had been missing since April 14 after she failed to show up for work at Leeton High School where she taught drama and music.

A coroner will now examine Ms Scott's remains.
