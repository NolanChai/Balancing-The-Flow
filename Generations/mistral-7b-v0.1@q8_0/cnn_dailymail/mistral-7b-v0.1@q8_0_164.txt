r his retirement from elite competition following the Rio Olympics, had not raced in a US long course meet since he won the same event in the same state two years ago. The 31-year-old's time of 52.09 seconds at Arizona State University was enough to give him victory by a full second as he came home ahead of Olympic team-mate Andrew Wilson and Californian Tom Shields. It was Phelps' first 100m butterfly race in three years, with his last coming at the London Olympics, when he set an Olympic record of 51.21 seconds to win gold.

He has swum only freestyle races since retiring after Rio and had also been aiming to make a return to the pool by racing a 200m freestyle. But his preparation was interrupted when he contracted gastroenteritis during the first week of training for the Arena event.

"I haven't done the butterfly in forever," Phelps told usaswimming.org after winning in Phoenix. "The goal this time was to not overdo it, but just do what I could and see how it felt and see where I am."

The 31-year-old has been training with a group of athletes at the University of Michigan with coach Bob Bowman, the man who guided him through his career. But there is no pressure on Phelps to compete again in Tokyo in 2020, having achieved more than any swimmer before him.

"He's happy he has a chance to do this again," Bowman said after the race. "He's very relaxed about it and he knows he can do something like that if he wants."
