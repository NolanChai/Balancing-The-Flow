 over his future at Stamford Bridge.

The 24-year-old joined the Blues from Internacional for Â£25m in January 2013 but has not hit the same heights since then, with many feeling that Oscar has not taken full advantage of his talent and is yet to find his best position in the side.

According to reports, Juventus are keen on taking him back to Serie A, as they look to bolster their midfield options. The Bianconeri are still trying to offload Arturo Vidal after he publicly expressed a desire to leave earlier this season and could be tempted by the chance to bring in Oscar as a replacement.

Meanwhile, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is also interested in the Brazil international according to reports in Italy. The German has made no secret of the fact that he wants to add new players in January but with the Reds currently 14^{th} in the Premier League table, it may be difficult for them to get a deal over the line in the transfer window.

However, should Chelsea decide to sell Oscar, Juventus and Liverpool could have a chance to sign the Brazil international on a cut-price deal.
