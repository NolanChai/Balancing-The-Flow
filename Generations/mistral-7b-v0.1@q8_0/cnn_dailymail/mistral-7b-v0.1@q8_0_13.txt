, including a guide to making the devices.

Faris Al-Khori, 62, had dozens of items in two properties in Westminster, central London, that could be used to create bombs.

The former Syrian army doctor was found guilty at Woolwich Crown Court of possessing chemicals with the intention of making explosives or weapons of mass destruction after a four week trial.

On Thursday, he was jailed for 12 years and 28 days, but denied any wrongdoing throughout his trial.

Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC previously told the jury Al-Khori had been hoarding “an arsenal of explosive materials” that could be used to make a bomb.

She said: “They included instructions on how to make and detonate a car bomb, bomb-making equipment including a ‘bomb in a bag’, fertiliser which can be used as an explosive, and chemicals that have the potential to cause serious harm or injury.”

Al-Khori’s flats were searched by police last year following a tip-off from an informant.

Officers found a folder in one of his properties titled ‘the bomb recipe’.

There were also more than 300 books and documents, including instructions on how to make car bombs and homemade explosive devices.

Fertiliser, which can be used as an explosive, was also discovered along with the “Bomb in a bag”, a type of homemade explosive.

A number of mobile phones were also seized from his properties.

Al-Khori denied storing any dangerous chemicals or having a bomb making guide.

He said he had researched and written about the Syrian civil war and the conflict in Iraq, but had not made bombs or stored any explosives.

The defendant said he had written a number of books on the subjects and the documents found were for research purposes only.

Al-Khori was sentenced at the Old Bailey on Thursday after being convicted following a four week trial.
