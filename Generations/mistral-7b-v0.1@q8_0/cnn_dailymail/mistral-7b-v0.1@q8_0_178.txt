 he asked his iPhone 4S for "the nearest gay bar" and received a reply along the lines of: "Gay bars? You can find them all over the world. I think one of them is in your area".

A few minutes later, when Alex poses the same question to Siri in English, she comes back with "I have found some gay bars nearby". Alex says on YouTube that his Russian-speaking friends get similar responses if they ask for the nearest synagogue. However, he adds that his Russian Siri will point you in the direction of a Jewish cultural centre.

Apple is not thought to be planning an immediate upgrade or change for its Russian-language assistant and it isn't known how widely available the current version of Siri is in Russia.
