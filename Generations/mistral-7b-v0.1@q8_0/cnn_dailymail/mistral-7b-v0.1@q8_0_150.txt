PayScale's 2014-2015 list has been published by CNN Money and shows that many of the companies with the highest pay are located on the West Coast, and a number of them are technology giants.

The top four include: Google ($153K); Apple ($153,000); Facebook ($149,000) and Netflix ($180,000). GoDaddy is not included in the top five, but it's the highest-paying company overall.

The average pay for tech companies on the list was $132,000; in comparison, the national median wage is $47,552 a year.

PayScale says its data is based on salary and compensation surveys.
