Antarctica has experienced its highest temperature on record, according to meteorologists.

Sensors at Argentina’s Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature of 63.5°F (17.5°C) yesterday morning local time.

It is the warmest that temperatures have been in any part of Antarctica since records began in 1958, with only three other record high temperatures coming close to this:

- 62.8°F (17.1°C) at Vanda Station on Dec 10, 2014
- 63.0°F (17.2°C) at Esperanza Base on Jan 5, 1982
- 63.3°F (17.4°C) at Signy Research Station on Dec 22, 1988

“This is the most extreme temperature that I have seen in Antarctica,” said meteorologist Dr Sharon Stammerjohn from Louisiana State University.

“We are starting to see a lot more of these really warm temperatures.”

The region where this record was set has been undergoing rapid warming, and has experienced 3.6°F (2°C) in the last 50 years. The majority of that warming happened before the year 2000, which suggests it is linked to climate change caused by man-made greenhouse gases.

Antarctic ice shelves are also breaking up and melting much faster than anticipated. This has led to scientists suggesting that we will see sea levels rise by three feet over the next century due to global warming.
