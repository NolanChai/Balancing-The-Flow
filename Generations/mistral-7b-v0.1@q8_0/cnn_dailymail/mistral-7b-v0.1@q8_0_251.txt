idi on Monday after posting a $350,000 bail.

The 48-year-old was released with strict conditions: He must report to police every three days and is banned from contacting any of the other nine defendants still being held in connection with the attacks, which took place on November 26, 2008. He has also been instructed not to leave the country or speak to the media about his case.

Pakistan’s Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said the bail was granted because Lakhvi was deemed a low flight risk. He added that he does not expect Lakhvi to escape: “He is a man of integrity and honesty… If there were any flaws in this case, it should have been exposed by now.”

The Indian government has condemned the decision, with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj saying the country was “extremely disappointed” with Pakistan’s judicial system. She added that India would be “consulting all its options” and would continue to take up the issue at “the highest level.”

The attack on Mumbai, a financial hub, involved 10 gunmen armed with automatic weapons and grenades who split into small groups and carried out coordinated shooting attacks at tourist sites, trains, restaurants, and a hospital over the course of three days. Among the victims were six Americans.
