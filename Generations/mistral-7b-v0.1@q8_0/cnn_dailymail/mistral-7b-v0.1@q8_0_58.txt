ieving his parents searched for him with rescuers, police said.

The search party found Carwyn’s body in a gully at the foot of the mountain after he had apparently fallen from the cliff face. The youngster, from Wales, was staying with his family at a hotel in Courchevel, near Meribel in France, when the tragedy happened on Thursday.

An investigation by French authorities will determine whether Carwyn fell or whether he had been pushed by another skier.

He is thought to have fallen about 160ft and suffered severe head injuries.

The boy’s father was said to have collapsed at the foot of the cliff after finding his son’s body, according to reports in France.
