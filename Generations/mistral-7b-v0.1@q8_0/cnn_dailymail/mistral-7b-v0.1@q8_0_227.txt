24-page petition with the Los Angeles Superior Court requesting custody of the embryos because he wants to bring them to term and become a father. He also reportedly has a plan in mind for how they would raise the child or children. The Colombian beauty's ex also filed documents that revealed she had asked him for $5 million dollars in hush money in exchange for custody of the embryos, but he refused.

In his petition, Loeb claimsÂ that Vergara wanted to get rid of the eggs after their breakup and the lawsuit says she "abruptly terminated" the agreement when the relationship ended in 2014, despite the fact they had planned to have children together with a child before. He also alleges that Vergara was trying to hide her true intentions for destroying the embryos by saying he should be the one who was responsible for them.

Loeb wants joint custody of the embryos and in the court documents, he wrote that he would "be a loving and involved father." He also plans on using a surrogate mother to carry his children because he does not want Vergara to raise them. According to Loeb's petition, Vergara's attorney contacted him in March with an offer of $5 million in exchange for custody of the embryos, but he refused the money and requested that she make a decision about what would happen to them by September.

"Sofia has made it very clear to me that she does not want a child," Loeb told In Touch Weekly at the time. "I want a family more than anything else in the world and I am ready to do whatever it takes."
