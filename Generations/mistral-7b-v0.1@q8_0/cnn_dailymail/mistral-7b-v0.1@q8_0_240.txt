 devastated after being knocked out by Leicester Tigers last weekend, but the 22-year-old is confident that the club will have enough time to get over their disappointment ahead of Sunday's clash with Wasps at Twickenham (10.00am BST).

"It was very disappointing to lose and we were pretty gutted in the changing room afterwards, but you can't be too disappointed for too long. You have to put it behind you and move on," he told BBC Radio Bristol. "We had a tough season with injuries so we are happy that our season isn't over yet. We want to finish the season well and play in the play-offs."

Bath were without fly half George Ford, who has been called up by England coach Stuart Lancaster for the upcoming clash against Ireland at Twickenham next week (15 March). The 21-year-old has been named on the bench for Sunday's game as part of Lancaster's squad of 30 players and Watson is adamant that the club will be able to cope without him.

"He is obviously a key player in our team, but he was out injured for seven or eight weeks anyway so we have been playing without him all year. We managed before, and now that he is back it has made us stronger," he said.

Bath have not qualified for the play-offs since the 2010/11 season and Watson believes a top four finish will be within their grasp should they string together a run of wins. The Premiership is proving to be even more competitive than ever this year, with Wasps, Sale Sharks and Northampton Saints among those who are fighting for a play-off spot along with the defending champions Saracens, Leicester and Bath.

"We want to finish in the top four, we have not been there for quite some time so we need to get back into it. It has been tough this year because every game is so close," he added. "There are no easy games against anyone in this league."
