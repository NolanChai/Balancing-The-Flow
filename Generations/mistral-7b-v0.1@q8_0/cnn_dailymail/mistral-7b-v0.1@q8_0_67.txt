razed cash handout – which landed him on his school’s ‘hall of shame’. He had been tasked with carrying out an errand for his 75-year-old grandad but decided to keep it for himself after grabbing the money.

The boy, who has not yet been named by police, was discovered as he handed out bills in the playground to classmates at Copley Middle School. A teacher spotted the teen’s actions and reported him to school leaders. According to local media, his grandfather had given the boy $25,000 (£19,000) to hold for him as part of an errand, but he kept it for himself after grabbing the money.

He was arrested and charged with theft of property, which is a misdemeanor in Ohio. Police have also notified child services about his actions. School principal Dr. Greg Daugherty said: ‘He (the boy) knew the money wasn’t his. We believe there was no intent to take it permanently. He just made an error in judgment.’ The 13-year-old has been suspended from school, and officials say he is now banned from the grounds as well as after-hours activities, such as sports games.

Medina Police Department said: ‘We do not believe any other students were involved with this incident or are at risk of being charged.’
