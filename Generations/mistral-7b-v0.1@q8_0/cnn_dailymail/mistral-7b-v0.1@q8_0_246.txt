In the 8-minute clip above, vlogger James Charles—who has over 600,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel—shows how he uses makeup products and tricks to make himself look like Jenner. It starts out innocently enough with foundation, bronzer, blush, and lip liner. But when he gets to the eyeshadow, it’s clear this isn't your average makeup tutorial.

“This is a color I don’t think anyone should own except Kylie,” Charles says about his neon pink shadow (which is actually a blush from Cover FX), which he uses for the inner corners of his eyes. He also dips a brush into an illuminator, “for that ‘I’m going to cry at any moment’ effect.”

“If you want people to be like, ‘Oh my god, who did your makeup?’ and have people not recognize you when they see you on the street, this is what you need,” he says. But it’s still not enough: “I don’t think I look very Kylie without the hair.”

So that's where Charles takes his transformation to the next level with a full wig, which he styles into two high ponytails and faux lash extensions. The finished product is pretty impressive, even if it looks more like a costume than something you’d wear IRL—which is probably why Jenner has yet to respond to Charles’s tutorial.
