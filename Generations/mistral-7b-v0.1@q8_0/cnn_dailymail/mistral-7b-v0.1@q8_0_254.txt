emy's obsessive baby spam that they decided to take matters into their own hands and prank her in the best way possible.

In a video posted on YouTube, a group of moms and their kids decide to orchestrate the ultimate prank for one of their friends who is absolutely obsessed with her newborn son. In the video, the friend's daughter - dressed as her brother - says, "Mom, I've been thinking about this for a long time, and today I want you to stop taking pictures of me and start taking pictures of me."

Her mother looks confused until her friends jump out from behind the door with a sign that reads, "We love your baby photos. You suck." They then proceed to tell her how much they hate seeing her son's face on social media so much.

One mom even tells her friend, "I unfollowed you because you post too many pictures of your kid and I'm not interested in his life story. And I want to know what's happening with your friends."

The prank ends with one friend saying that the mother should be posting photos of herself with a nice haircut since she is pregnant. She also says her friend should show off her post-baby body on Facebook so people can see how great she looks instead of being obsessed over her baby's milestones.

This prank is pretty genius, but I can't imagine it will work on all moms who are totally obsessed with their newborns. Maybe if the prankers also brought along some chocolate and a nice bottle of wine, they might be able to get through to those mothers who don't know when to stop posting photos of their baby.
