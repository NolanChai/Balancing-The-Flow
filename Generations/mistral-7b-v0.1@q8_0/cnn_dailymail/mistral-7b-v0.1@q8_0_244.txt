Don't you wish your travel photos looked like this? Young couple Jay Alvarrez and Alexis Rene love nothing more than travelling the world... and then snapping impossibly glamorous pictures at each location. The model duo have racked up more than 13 million fans on Instagram between them with their beautiful holiday pics, showing off their perfect physiques in swimwear against stunning landscapes. Jay, 20, says: "I think the most important thing is to be yourself and show people your personality - if you can't do that then you can't really capture something special." The Hawaii native, who began taking his own travel snaps at 14 when he had a GoPro camera given to him by his stepfather, has travelled the world with Alexis, 20. They have posed on yachts and in front of palm trees in the Caribbean, gone for long drives down California's Highway One and even climbed up the side of a building in Tokyo. "We are really into just getting lost in new cities," Jay says, "but we also love to hang out at the beach." Alexis, from Miami, Florida, adds: "I think it's important to be able to experience a new culture when you travel because that really makes your memories even more special. I want to take pictures of the places I go and all the things I do - they are like memories for me."
