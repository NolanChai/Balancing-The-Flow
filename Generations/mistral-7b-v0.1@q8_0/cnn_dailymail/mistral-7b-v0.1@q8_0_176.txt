 him' repeatedly while responding to questions about Kaminsky in his press conference after Saturday's game between the schools.

“I thought I knew what was going on with (Kaminsky). I didn’t think he was really good," Harrison said during a session that lasted less than four minutes.

"I’m glad we were able to pull this one out.”

Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan found it disrespectful and said as much to reporters after Sunday's practice. Kaminsky, meanwhile, chose to look the other way, saying Monday that he wasn't sure what Harrison was talking about when he read a transcript of the news conference. He did not watch the video.

“I haven’t seen any of his comments,” Kaminsky said. “My only real concern is getting ready for Arizona tomorrow.”

Kaminsky and Harrison could go at it on Tuesday night in the Final Four when No. 7 Wisconsin plays No. 1 Arizona in a semifinal game that tips off at 6:09 p.m. CT.

“That’s not my focus,” Kaminsky said of his relationship with the Kentucky players. “I’m focused on winning a national championship.”
