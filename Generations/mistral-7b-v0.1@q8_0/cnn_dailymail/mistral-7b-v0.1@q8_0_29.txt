36-year-old Chef T.Izz said in an interview: 'He doesn’t like pasta. He loves steak, potatoes, baked chicken, salmon. I know he likes fish. But if you give him a lot of fried foods he’s going to get fat.'

The 38-year-old boxer's diet consists mainly of vegetables, fish and lean meat.  Mayweather, who is the current WBC world welterweight champion, also avoids alcohol and caffeine. When it comes to his pre-fight rituals, the fighter is known for avoiding sex during training and his trainer, Floyd Mayweather Sr, said previously: 'I tell him, “Do not have sex.” But he knows that already. He knows I don’t want him having sex before a fight.'

The May 2nd showdown will be the third richest fight in history with only heavyweight contests between Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis and Lewis and Evander Holyfield producing bigger pay days than what is expected to be the most lucrative purse for two boxers of all-time.

The undefeated Mayweather will reportedly pocket $180m (£114m) while Pacquiao has a guaranteed payday of $80m (£51m). But the eight-division world champion says he's not motivated by the money, and has admitted that he may walk away after this fight if he loses.
