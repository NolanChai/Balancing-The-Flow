3:44 am today when it should have docked with the International Space Station (ISS).

The spacecraft was carrying almost three tonnes of cargo, including food and supplies for the crew of the ISS. The Progress ship is a vital supply route to keep the astronauts on the ISS in space but was unable to dock after an automated system failure.

It’s not the first time the Russian space agency has had problems with the Progress series of cargo vessels, which is the only route for supplies to reach the ISS while NASA’s space shuttle programme was grounded. Progress M-04M crashed into Siberia after a failed launch in 2011.

The Roscosmos head Igor Komarov has said that the craft has been deliberately deorbited and is tumbling out of control in space, making it unable to dock with the ISS. The Russian space agency will attempt to regain control using its thrusters over the next few hours. If this fails, the ship will be destroyed as it burns up during re-entry into Earth’s atmosphere.

“Roscosmos is now working on regaining control of the Progress M-27M cargo spacecraft,” Komarov said in a statement today.

Komarov also confirmed that the crew and the ISS itself were safe, although the Progress M-28M had to be suspended from its launch pad as the agency was unable to give it any commands due to the malfunction with the previous ship.

The problem is believed to have occurred around 30 seconds after the launch of Progress M-27M and just before its engines were fired to take it towards the ISS. The spacecraft did not make contact with the station and was spotted spinning out of control, heading for Earth.
