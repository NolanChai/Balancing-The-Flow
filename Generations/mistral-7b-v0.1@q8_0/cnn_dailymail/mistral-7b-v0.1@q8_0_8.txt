 years ago through to the modern day, the English have been shaped by countless cultural influences.

## The Ancient Celts

It seems that England has a surprisingly long history – much longer than you would expect of such a small island. Long before the Anglo-Saxon invaders and their Germanic culture, there were the ancient Celtic tribes who had lived in this land for centuries. They were largely nomadic hunter-gatherers who built their homes out of wood and stone. Their lives were dictated by the seasons – they planted seeds when the earth was wet enough to dig holes in. They hunted and fished and gathered berries and nuts from the woods. The Celts believed that the Earth was sacred, and it was only natural for them to worship Mother Nature herself.

## The Romans Invade

The Romans were another dominant force who have left an enduring mark on English culture – for instance our system of roads was originally built by them. It is also from their influence that we have the ‘square’ system of town and country planning – whereby streets are laid out in a grid pattern with a marketplace in the centre. Roman rule lasted nearly 400 years, but by the beginning of the fifth century they had withdrawn to Rome and left England vulnerable to yet another invasion: the Anglo-Saxons.

## The Anglo-Saxons Conquer

The English are descended from a group of Germanic tribes known as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, who arrived in England between 410 and 570 AD. The word ‘England’ comes from an ancient language called Old English – it means ‘the land of the Angles’. The Anglo-Saxons were farmers with a very different culture to that of the Celts: they worshipped many gods, had their own alphabet and wrote in a different language. They were not always peaceful settlers though; sometimes they fought against the Celtic people who still lived here when they arrived – for instance when King Alfred defeated the Viking invaders in the Battle of Edington in 878. The Anglo-Saxon way of life was very harsh, with little protection from the elements and no formal education system or social welfare services like we have today. They also believed that you should rule by strength and power – rather than through consensus as we do nowadays.

## The Normans Take Over

In 1066, England’s history was changed forever when William of Normandy led his army across the Channel and defeated Harold at Hastings, to become King William I. He then went on to rule over an area that became known as England – from Scotland in the North down through Wales (which he conquered) all the way to Cornwall (the most westerly tip). The Norman invasion had a profound effect on English culture, bringing with it the French language and many of its customs. For instance, under King Henry VIII (who was also partly Norman) people began wearing clothes made from wool instead of linen – which is why we still refer to ‘woolen’ clothing today!

## The Tudors Rule England

The Tudor period is often considered a golden age in English history: it spanned the reigns of Henry VII, Henry VIII and Elizabeth I. It was also a time when many important events took place such as the dissolution of monasteries by King Henry VIII, which led to the founding of Oxford University (1570). There were also many advances made during this era in literature – Shakespeare being one of its most famous authors.

## The Age Of Enlightenment

The Age of Enlightenment saw a period of change and reform in England; people started questioning everything from religion to politics as they looked for new ways to do things. This led to the foundation of many important organisations such as The Royal Society (1660) which encouraged scientific research, while also helping to create a national system for education through its support of schools like Eton College (founded 1440).

## Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution transformed England from an agricultural country into one of the world’s leading industrial powers. During this period many new inventions and machines were developed – including steam engines, which revolutionised transport and industry by making it much easier to move goods around quickly. This allowed people to live further away from their places of work, so they could now choose where they wanted to live rather than having to settle near their employer’s factory or mine as they had done before.

## Victorian Era

The Victorian era (1837-1901) was a period of great change in England – it saw the development of modern capitalism and democracy, as well as many advances in science and technology. It was also an age when people became more concerned with their appearance, which led to changes in fashion such as the corset that became popular during this time.

## Edwardian Age

The Edwardian era is often referred to as ‘the golden years’ because it saw a return to peace after many wars and conflicts had taken place throughout England during previous centuries. However, this period was not without its problems; there were still tensions between the upper classes (who ruled Britain at that time) and lower class workers who felt they were being treated unfairly by their employers.

## The World Wars

The First World War saw England fighting alongside France against Germany – many British troops fought bravely despite facing impossible odds in what became known as ‘the war to end all wars’. After this conflict ended (with England emerging victorious), there was a short period of peace before another major conflict began. The Second World War lasted for six years and again saw English forces fighting against Germany, alongside other nations such as France and Russia.

## The Post-War Years

After the end of World War II in 1945, England entered into what is known as ‘the post-war era’. This was a time when many changes took place including: greater equality between men and women; increased economic prosperity; improvements in health care; and better educational opportunities for all children.

## The Modern Day

Today, England is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world. There are people from all walks of life living here, which has led to many different cultures being represented within our borders. However, it’s important that we don’t forget about our heritage and how far we’ve come as a nation – there’s no better way to do this than by celebrating St George’s Day on 23rd April every year!
