 nto the crash on Saturday night in which her four children - aged between one and seven years - died. Her daughter, 12, is in hospital with serious injuries. Police have confirmed they are treating the incident as a crime scene, but are yet to determine whether it was an accident or a deliberate act by Guode. The investigation into the circumstances of the crash at Point Cook, in Melbourne's west, will now focus on forensic examination, including crash reconstruction, and interviewing witnesses. A 35-year-old woman has been interviewed by police and released pending further investigation. She was also taken to hospital for treatment after the crash. In a statement on Saturday night, Victoria Police said they were responding to reports of a crash near Point Cook Road at about 4pm on Saturday afternoon. "It is believed a vehicle left the roadway and entered the water," police said. A man who was fishing in the area on Sunday said he had been there for two hours before seeing the crash, which happened just after 5pm. The fisherman told Nine News he saw four children floating in the water but could not help them because it was too deep. "I saw this car coming straight towards me," he said. He told Channel Seven that a woman had emerged from the car and walked up to a nearby house, before she returned and pulled out four children. The woman then drove into the lake again, and the car sank underwater. Police were called but it took about 30 minutes for firefighters to arrive with a boat. The rescue mission was hampered by rough water and low light conditions at the time of the incident. An Air Ambulance helicopter was called in to help recover the victims. Australian Associated Press
