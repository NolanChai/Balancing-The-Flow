unting prognosis, however, didn’t stop her mom from talking to her unconscious child daily and promising that she would someday get the chance to be a mother herself.

Moser had been in a four month coma after suffering a brain hemorrhage that caused severe damage to her right side of the body. She was in a hospital when she gave birth to a baby girl named Evangeline, and doctors told Moser's mom that the baby would be better off without a mother who is "not awake, not aware and not able to do much of anything," according to Fox News.

Moser’s mother, however, disagreed and fought for her daughter’s care by moving her to another hospital so she could receive treatment from doctors willing to give Moser a chance at waking up from her coma. She also spoke to the 20-year-old daily, and made sure that Moser knew she wasn't giving up hope on her daughter getting better.

"I said ‘Anna, it doesn’t matter if you have a right side of your body or not; we will take care of this child with our other three children,'" Moser’s mother said to Fox News. "‘We are here and we believe in you. We will do anything to make sure that you are with us again.’ And that’s what got her through it."

On Wednesday, Moser woke up from the coma, and was able to see her 5-month-old daughter for the first time. She was also able to hold the baby girl in her arms, and told Fox News that she is looking forward to spending every day with Evangeline.

"I am just so happy that I get to be a mother to Evangeline and spend every minute of my life with her," Moser said to Fox News.
