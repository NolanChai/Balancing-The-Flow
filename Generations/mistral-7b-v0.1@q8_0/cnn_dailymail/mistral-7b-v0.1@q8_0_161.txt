2 years old when their father, who was also her biological mother’s brother, made the sacrifice, The Star reported.

“I got to give my little girl a chance at life,” Vietnamese’s dad, Dung Nguyen, told CTV News at the time. “It breaks my heart that she is going through this and I couldn’t do anything else to help her.”

While both girls needed new livers, Vietnamese was sicker than her twin, so it was decided to give her sister Phuoc’s dad’s organ. The remaining liver from the donor was also given to a third patient.

The procedure worked and after spending two weeks in hospital, Phuoc was sent home to recover with her father. But Vietnamese continued to suffer with life-threatening liver failure. In the end, her dad gave up his kidney so she could get an organ transplant. The operation took place last summer.

The family is still at home in the Toronto suburb of Brampton caring for their two girls and three other children from previous relationships, according to The Star. While Vietnamese had a rough start after surgery, the twins are doing well.

“We’re getting by with the help of social services, friends and family,” Vietnamese’s mother, Ling Pham, told The Star. “We’re managing. It’s just really hard to try and juggle everything.”
