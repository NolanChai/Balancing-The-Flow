, this is not possible.

According to UNICEF, around 30 percent of children living in poverty do not attend school as their family cannot afford to pay for tuition and books. While many families may earn less than $2 per day, they are forced to work to provide the bare essentials for their children. This makes a visit to an amusement park out of reach, even if it was free.

The Lahore Zoo is Pakistan's only amusement park and attracts around 500,000 people per year. However, many poor children are unable to enjoy the rides and activities on offer, with many visiting only once in their lifetime. This is why philanthropist and entrepreneur Khalid Ajmal decided to gift tickets to some of Pakistan's poorest families.

He invited 72 underprivileged children from different slum areas in Lahore and paid for their rides, food, drinks, ice-cream, and entry fees. The children were also given a certificate of appreciation and a free gift bag.

Many of the children had never been to an amusement park before and were excited about the opportunity. "When we reached, everyone was very happy," says one of the kids.

This is just one example of how philanthropy can make a real difference in people's lives, especially for those living in poverty. By providing opportunities that many children would never have access to, these acts of kindness are not only life-changing but also life-affirming.
