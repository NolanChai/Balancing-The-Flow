iley, 13, and her friend were walking home from school when they were knocked down by a van being driven by a man whose brain was flooded with amphetamine and other drugs, a jury was told.

Liberty’s mother, Natalie Bailey, broke down in tears as the driver admitted killing her daughter in the dock at Winchester Crown Court.

John Bowers, 51, was so high on amphetamine when he drove over the girls that he was not aware of what had happened, said prosecutor Stephen Faulkner. Bowers’s Ford Transit van smashed into Liberty and her friend as they crossed a road near their home in Winchester in September last year.

Liberty suffered massive injuries including fractured skull, broken spine, chest trauma and severe head wounds. She was pronounced dead at hospital shortly after the crash.

The driver initially blamed Liberty for the incident but later said he had been ‘out of control’. His van had been travelling up to 40mph in a 30mph zone and he tried to brake at the last minute, Mr Faulkner added.

A toxicology report revealed that Bowers had 80mg per litre of amphetamine in his blood – double the legal driving limit. He was also found to have trace amounts of cannabis and cocaine in his body.

He pleaded guilty on Monday to causing death by dangerous driving, two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and three other motoring offences.
