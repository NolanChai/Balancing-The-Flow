Manchester United will have to wear Nike kit during their summer tour of the US, despite their world-record deal with adidas.

The club are expected to jet across the Atlantic in July for a trip of around four weeks to play a series of matches against local opposition and friendlies against other major European clubs.

It has now emerged that United will have to don Nike strip on that tour due to a clause in their existing deal with Nike, which runs until the end of 2014-15 season.

United are yet to agree a new deal with adidas but both parties expect to get one sorted very soon, with reports claiming that United’s shirt sponsor Aon is ready to double their current £30 million annual deal for the next six years.
