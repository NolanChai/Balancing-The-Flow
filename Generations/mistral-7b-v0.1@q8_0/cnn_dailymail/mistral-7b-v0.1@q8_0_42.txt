, a central defender, an attacking midfielder and a striker.

Arsenal finished second in the Premier League last season after coming second best to champions Manchester United in 2010/11 as well. But their lack of spending over the past few years has been underlined by their poor showings at the business end of the campaign, with Henry claiming that a major overhaul is needed at the Emirates Stadium.

"If you look at Arsenal's squad, they need a goalkeeper, a central defender, an attacking midfielder and a striker - four players," the former Arsenal captain told Sky Sports.

"That would change things. I am not saying it is going to be done this summer but if you are a top team then that's what you need."

Meanwhile, Henry also criticised his compatriot Samir Nasri for leaving Arsenal in favour of Manchester City last year. Nasri played under Henry during the former striker's spell as assistant manager and left for City after falling out with new Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger. The Frenchman has also claimed that Nasri was one of his closest friends at the club, but feels the 24-year-old should have remained loyal to his employers.

"You always hope he does well, you want your friend to do well," Henry said about Nasri's move from Arsenal to City. "I was also a player before and it is not my role to tell him what to do. If I did I would be like all the people who told me not to go to Barcelona.

"As long as he is happy, it doesn't matter if it is at City or somewhere else."

However, Henry believes that Nasri should have shown loyalty towards Arsenal after playing for them over five years and helping them win two FA Cups in the process.

"I had the pleasure of meeting him a couple of times here at Monaco [where both play]. I respect him but there is a loyalty issue," he added. "You don't forget what we went through together, you are not going to be happy that he left and joined City."
