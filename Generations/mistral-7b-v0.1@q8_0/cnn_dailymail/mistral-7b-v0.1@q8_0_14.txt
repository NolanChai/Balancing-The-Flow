 the Government prepares to hand out its first income tax giveaway of £325m.

In an article for The Sun, Mr Cameron said he would not allow ‘anyone who can afford it’ to get a pay freeze or have their taxes cut.

The PM will claim that Britain is the 14th most fiscally efficient economy in Europe with only Portugal and Spain spending less of taxpayers money on public services than the UK, The Daily Telegraph reported.

He will say: “It’s time we had a national debate about how we can get our public spending under control without asking those on modest or low incomes to bear any more of the burden.”

“And I want to see it done in a way that’s fair — not by asking anyone who can afford it, whether they are a small business owner, a pensioner or someone on middle income, to take a pay freeze or higher taxes.”

Mr Cameron will also call on Conservative councils to cut council tax bills for local residents.

His comments come as Chancellor George Osborne prepares to announce his first giveaway of income tax cuts this week as part of the emergency Budget on June 22nd.

Mr Osborne has already indicated that he will use the tax cuts to target low and middle earning households.
