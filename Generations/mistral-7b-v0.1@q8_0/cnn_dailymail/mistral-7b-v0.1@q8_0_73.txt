ame all too real.

Joke: Hayleigh Mcbay, of Elgin in Moray, Scotland, pretended to dump her boyfriendÂ David Clarke . He was shocked when the 18-year-old sent him a text message saying 'It's over'.

Prank: Hayley then told her boyfriend that she had been raped and got pregnant by another man. The gullible David believed his girlfriend and told her he would support her with the pregnancy.

Dumped: But as soon as he turned up to her house, Hayleigh revealed to him that it was all a prank and that she's not pregnant at all. He felt really stupid and embarrassed when he found out that he had been fooled.

Joke: 'I thought it would be funny so I told him I dumped him and that I had gotten pregnant and been raped,' she said. 'But as soon as he turned up I confessed that the whole thing was a prank.'
