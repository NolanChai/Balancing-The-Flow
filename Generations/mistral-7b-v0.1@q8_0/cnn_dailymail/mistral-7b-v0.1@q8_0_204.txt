Sipping a glass of glorious red wine which has been carefully aged in a hand-crafted oak barrel is my idea of heaven. But until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste that has matured over months or years, is to go out for dinner or buy a bottle from a reputable supplier. Now I can have the pleasure of sipping wine straight from an oak barrel in the comfort of my own home with the Oak Wine Barrel Kit from My Gift Store.

This kit contains everything you need to create your very own barrel, including four-feet long staves which are hand-cut from oak logs sourced from sustainable forestry operations in Poland, a wooden dowel for joining the stave together and all the nails you’ll need. Assembling this wine barrel is incredibly simple as all the wood has been pre-cut so that it just needs to be placed in position before nailing into place.

The Oak Wine Barrel Kit from My Gift Store measures 16 inches across which makes it an ideal size to store on a dining room table or sideboard for easy access. You can buy the barrel with or without a wine tap and I’d highly recommend selecting this option if you want your barrel to look authentic and provide a good seal, as well as being really easy to pour from. The Oak Wine Barrel Kit also comes complete with instructions on how to season the oak barrel by soaking it in water for at least two weeks before filling it with wine or your favourite beverage.

If you want an original gift for a wine-lover, then this oak barrel is sure to fit the bill. It’s the ultimate present for those who like to enjoy a tipple in style!

Oak Wine Barrel Kit is available from www.mygiftstore.co.uk at £34.95 or with tap and tap stand for £48.95.
