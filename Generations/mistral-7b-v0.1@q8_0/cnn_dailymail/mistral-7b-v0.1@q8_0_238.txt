imble fingers and bare feet on Thursday to reach its peak in just over two hours.

The 49-year-old scaled the twisting tower, nicknamed 'the Infinity', with no safety equipment or ropes for support, using only his hands and bare feet to pull himself up the building’s exterior walls.

After making it to the top, he took a moment to celebrate his achievement by posing on an overhang – before being hauled back down again by firemen. Mr Robert has scaled 80 of the world's tallest towers, including the Eiffel Tower and New York's Chrysler Building, in the last two decades.
