First Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed his state's bill into law last Thursday, then went on a media tour trying to explain how it wouldn't hurt gay people at all, before announcing a "fix" on Sunday that would exempt gay couples from its protections. Then Indiana Gov. Mike Pence got his own "religious freedom" bill passed by the state legislature last week and took an entirely different tact: He refused to even discuss the issue with critics who protested outside his house, and he defended his bill until it was almost too late -- that is, after the NBA threatened to move its All-Star Game out of Indy. Pence announced a "fix" on Tuesday, which was also an admission of defeat.

Thus we had two different Republican governors who did not know what they wanted when they set out to pass their bills.

The real question is: How could Hutchinson and Pence have gotten themselves into this mess in the first place? For starters, both men are relative newcomers to statewide elective office. Both were elected in 2014 -- Hutchinson as governor and Pence as lieutenant governor (and then governor after the previous incumbent resigned last year). They didn't have much experience making tough political decisions; neither one had run for any state or federal office prior to his first campaign last fall.
