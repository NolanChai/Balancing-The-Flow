ar Pradesh, is the proud owner of a mane that measures 135 cm (4 ft 5 in).

Srivastava first became interested in hair care after getting married in 2000. Her husband’s family members advised her to look after her tresses and adopt some hair care practices, which included daily massages with oils. She soon noticed that the condition of her hair greatly improved – so much so that people started noticing it as well, and commenting on its length and lustre.

“I am a mother of two kids and a housewife but I still try to find time for my long hair,” Srivastava said. “I use homemade oils like coconut, almond, olive oil and castor oil to wash my hair.” The 42-year-old added that she has been doing so since the day she got married.

“My husband is a supporter of my long hair,” Srivastava said. “He helped me in keeping it safe when I was pregnant with my second child and was in the hospital for delivery. He also used to comb my hair as it would be difficult for me to do so at that time.”

In 2018, Srivastava won a local award for her long tresses, and then went on to win a national competition held by the India Book of Records in October last year. She is now hoping to get her name listed in the Guinness World Records book as well.
