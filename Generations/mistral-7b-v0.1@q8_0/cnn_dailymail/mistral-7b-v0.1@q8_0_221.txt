 next month, includes a scene about the fracas and stars two former members of The Fast Show – Paul Whitehouse and Charlie Higson.

In the episode, the BBC director general Tony Hall (played by Whitehouse) is talking with the corporation’s head of values, Ian Fletcher (Higson). “It seems to have been a bit of an incident,” says Hall. “I mean, I was told that Jeremy Clarkson punched someone on set?”

Fletcher responds: “He didn’t punch him! It was just a small scuffle. One of those things.”

Hall is shown discussing the attack with two other characters in another scene. “This one took place at an inn,” he tells them. “Apparently there were lots of other people around, and I think it’s being investigated by police.”

It has been suggested that the BBC could use W1A to make light of the Clarkson incident as part of its damage limitation strategy ahead of the Top Gear star’s expected return this autumn.
