, was relentlessly bullied at school from the age of seven for three years until 2014.

Mrs Stratton is suing Knowsley Council in the high court and wants a review of how schools deal with bullying in Liverpool, Merseyside. The council says it has not yet been served with a writ and so can’t comment on the claim. But Mrs Stratton said Tianni had been subjected to “abuse” during her time at St Aloysius RC primary school in Whiston.

## ‘Torn apart by bullying’

In an interview with ITV News, she said: “My daughter was bullied and she was left to deal with this on her own. She’s been torn apart by bullying. It has ruined our lives.” Mrs Stratton claims that in 2013 Tianni told a teacher she had been spat at, but nothing was done to stop it.

In 2014 Tianni complained to the head teacher about the same pupil and others being “nasty” to her. But Mrs Stratton alleges the school did not act on its duty under anti-bullying legislation. She said she then took legal action, but in a mediation meeting with the council was told the school had followed protocol.

## ‘Bully’ left unchecked

Mrs Stratton claims Tianni also had to sit next to the “bully” and that when she tried to avoid her she would be sent back. In 2014, the family decided to move away from the area for a fresh start, but the bullying continued when Tianni started at St Paul’s Catholic Primary School in Liverpool.

Mrs Stratton said: “When we moved school I thought that was it and she could get on with her life and she didn’t. She was picked on again. “She has been left with a permanent condition, which is post-traumatic stress disorder.” Mrs Stratton now wants an independent review of how schools in Liverpool handle bullying claims.

## ‘Asked for help’

In a statement, she said: “Tianni told the teacher she was being spat on and hit and asked for her to be removed from class. I didn’t want my daughter to go back to school but we had no choice because there is nowhere else to send her.

“We complained and it got worse. She was spat at, she was smacked and her hair pulled. “We took them [the council] to court and they said the school has followed the protocol. Tianni was sent back into that class and sat next to this bully.”

Mrs Stratton added: “I didn’t want my daughter to go to school anymore but we had no choice because there is nowhere else to send her. “We complained about it and it got worse. She was spat at, smacked and her hair pulled. We took them [the council] to court and they said the school has followed protocol.
