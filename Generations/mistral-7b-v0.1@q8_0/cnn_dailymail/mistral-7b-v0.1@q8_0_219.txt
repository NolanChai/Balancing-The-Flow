The perfect true crime story, with a tragic ending.
I watched this on True TV last night (UK). The story of Sharon and her murder by Kevin Hawke is the perfect true crime story - so many twists and turns that it was almost like a drama. It also showed how people can be incredibly manipulative - especially if they have no feelings for others whatsoever.

The ending was particularly tragic, with Sharon's father in tears as he spoke about his daughter and Kevin Hawke's trial. I've never seen such an emotional interview on a crime show.

This is a really good documentary - well worth watching. 9/10 Bethany.
