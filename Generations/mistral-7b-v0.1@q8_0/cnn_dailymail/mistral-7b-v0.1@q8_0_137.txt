The former United striker believes that David Moyes was given a tough job replacing Alex Ferguson, but Van Gaal will be better suited for the task ahead.

‘David Moyes had to replace a legend, and that’s not easy,’ Cantona said. ‘You need a lot of time to build a team.

‘Louis van Gaal is different. He’s a winner. I’m sure he will be successful for Manchester United.’

Van Gaal has been an unpopular choice at Old Trafford due to his past at rivals Ajax and Barcelona, but Cantona believes the Dutchman will bring success back to United next season.

‘For me, Van Gaal is a winner,’ he added. ‘He can do it. He showed that with Holland. It was an impossible mission: to qualify for the World Cup without winning a game. But he did it. And when you can manage that, then you can manage Manchester United.

‘For me, we have won the battle and now it’s about winning the war. And I believe we are kings of the city.’
