 zone.

As for those battling against the drop, there’s some interesting trends, statistics and facts to take a look at when assessing their chances of staying up this season…

### Leicester City – The odds-on favourites

The Foxes are 3/5 to be relegated this season, despite their current standing of seventh place. With Nigel Pearson’s men just four points above the drop zone, that’s an unsurprisingly short price for many to go with.

Leicester have had a good record against those below them in the table, winning at Southampton and Hull City earlier in the season, but also losing to Burnley and drawing with Newcastle United and Aston Villa.

The Foxes are 9/2 to beat Crystal Palace this weekend, a price that doesn’t reflect their current league position nor their recent form. Leicester have just one win in six and no clean sheet in the same period of games.

Pearson has been quick to point out his side aren’t in a relegation battle – something he knows all about after fighting to keep Hull City up in 2013/14, but if Leicester don’t beat Palace they will be just five points above the drop zone with seven games of the season remaining.

### QPR – The most likely to go down?

Harry Redknapp is looking for a fifth top-flight survival in his managerial career and the R’s are 10/11 to stay up, but it could well be the London outfit that join Burnley and Hull City in dropping into the Championship.

QPR have just six points from their last eight games and have lost their last three Premier League matches against opponents currently in the bottom half of the table.

Redknapp’s side host Tottenham at Loftus Road this weekend, where the hosts are 10/3 to beat Spurs, who could be playing for a place in next season’s Europa League as early as Sunday.

### Sunderland – The ones you can rely on

The Black Cats are 5/6 to stay up this season and after going into their last Premier League game before the international break with seven points from the previous eight, Sunderland can’t be discounted just yet.

Sam Allardyce has the experience of keeping teams in the Premier League and he will know that it will likely take until the end of the season for him to have a good idea where his side are headed.

The Black Cats have one of the best away records in the league, having won three of their last four on the road, but they haven’t won a home match since beating Stoke City 1-0 in September.
