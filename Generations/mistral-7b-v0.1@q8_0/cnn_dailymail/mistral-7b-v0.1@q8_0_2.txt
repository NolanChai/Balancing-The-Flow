ion has officially thrown its support behind Gov. Corzine.

The New Jersey Education Association announced their endorsement of the incumbent Democrat, Jon Corzine, in their annual convention in Atlantic City.

Corzine and his fellow Democrat candidate for governor, Sen. Loretta Weinberg, were both on hand to thank the union members for their support.

"I want you to know that I will be standing up for public education," Corzine said at the meeting. "I want every one of you to stand up for me as we go into this election campaign."

The NJEA is one of New Jersey's most powerful political players, with over 200,000 members across the state. It has endorsed Corzine before and helped him win his first race in 2005. This year they will also endorse candidates for the state Senate and Assembly.

The union's endorsement comes as Republican gubernatorial candidate Chris Christie continues to be at odds with teachers unions over issues such as tenure, health benefits and collective bargaining. He is also proposing a pay cut of up to $10,000 per year for every teacher in the state.

"Governor Corzine is committed to public education," said NJEA President Richard J. Bozza. "We will have many differences with him on other issues, but not on this one."

Asked whether he's worried about losing a crucial group of voters, Christie didn't mince words. He told the New York Times, "It doesn't matter to me whether they endorse me or not. I don't care."
