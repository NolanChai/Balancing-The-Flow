'If u ain't gang banging or trapping don't DM me', reads one message posted on Twitter by 14-year-old Khalil Rushn. He has used his profile, which is protected, to showcase his 'hood' lifestyle and even uploaded pictures of a gun that he claims was used in a murder.

But the youngster's bragging may have gone too far. He is now facing criminal charges for allegedly posting a picture on Twitter showing him holding a gun. Khalil, who posts his own rap videos online, has been charged with illegally possessing the weapon and reckless endangerment.

'It was a dumb mistake', he told The Smoking Gun after being released from jail on $20,000 bond last week. 'I thought it would be funny because it is a different type of gun.'

The teenager said he had bought the 9mm Beretta semi-automatic pistol for $100 and was showing it off to his friends online when police raided his home on April 23.

A neighbour who saw police searching Khalil's bedroom allegedly told officers that the boy had been 'bragging about being a gang member'.

Officers discovered a .45-caliber pistol in a safe, which Khalil claimed he bought with money from his mother for $350. A third weapon was also found - a Ruger .22 caliber rifle that had been reported stolen to Memphis police in 2012.

Khalil's father told the court: 'I did not know my son owned this pistol. My son is not involved in any gang activity and never has been.' He said he would take responsibility for his son, who will be tried as an adult. Khalil was released on bond after a judge set bail at $20,000 - but the conditions of his release bar him from having guns or other weapons.

Khalil is facing two years behind bars and has been placed under house arrest with electronic monitoring.
