The Toffees are currently without a recognised right-back while Seamus Coleman is absent, with Bryan Oviedo having been moved into that position.

Alcaraz has started two of their last three Premier League matches at centre back, having played primarily in the middle and on the left over the past three seasons.

Distin was also handed a rare start against Swansea City in January but the former France international has not made a league appearance since.

However, Martinez is not ready to turn his back on either veteran defender.

"It's really important that we have that strength in depth because what we're asking from them as professionals is really high," he said. "I think there's no doubt in the fact that they can still be an important part of our season, but it has to be on the right conditions and obviously we want the best for Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin because they are two very good professionals who have done a lot for Everton.

"We need to find the best solution for them but, for me, they are really important players."

Martinez confirmed that Coleman is on track to make his return from a broken leg when the club face Manchester United in the FA Cup fifth round later this month, but admitted his recovery would have been longer had he not gone public with it.

"The timing of Seamus' return has been quite incredible," he added. "I think if we hadn't spoken about him so openly, it could well be that he would have missed the rest of the season and I'm absolutely delighted to see him back as soon as possible."
