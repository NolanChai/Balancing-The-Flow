ites and executive boxes were also left empty on Saturday by fans boycotting the match, with those who remained sitting and singing while the teams played out a goalless draw.

Arsenal were beaten 6-3 at Manchester City last weekend, while Liverpool are without a win in five matches. The empty seats campaign has been launched by the Arsenal Supporters' Trust (AST) and Liverpool fan group Spirit Of Shankly, with both organisations aiming to put pressure on clubs to reduce prices.

The AST say they expect more than 500 empty seats for Saturday's match and have also called for an official minute's silence to protest against "the extortionate cost of tickets". The campaign is a joint operation by the two groups, who have said they want to see "affordable football" at both clubs.

The AST and Spirit Of Shankly are calling on fans not to buy tickets in the Emirates Suite, Directors' Box and hospitality areas, which are expected to be empty for the first 10 minutes of the match. They have also asked fans to sit or stand in their seats for the duration of the game and "not clap, cheer or sing" during that period.

An AST statement said: "This action is being taken because we believe the price of tickets at both clubs is beyond the reach of many ordinary people who would otherwise support their club week-in, week-out."
