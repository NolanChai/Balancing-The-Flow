7s sides, was at home with his girlfriend on Tuesday night when shots were fired through the front door of their house in Dunmurry.

McBurney is believed to have been in the bedroom at the back of the property, away from the door, at the time. His girlfriend, however, who had been watching television in the living room, was forced to lie on the floor as she heard a number of gunshots being fired through the front door.

The Ballyclare man is no stranger to playing in front of a crowd - last month he helped Ulster beat Ospreys 29-25 at the Ravenhill Stadium. However, this week’s incident will not have been on his list of preferred ways to spend an evening.

Gardai and police officers are now investigating whether the attack is linked to a previous shooting in Dunmurry, which happened three years ago. Detective Chief Inspector John Caldwell said: “This incident could easily have resulted in serious injury or even death had it not been for the fact that the couple were sleeping.

“Our enquiries are currently underway and we would like to hear from anyone who saw anything suspicious in the area around midnight on Tuesday 24 May.”
