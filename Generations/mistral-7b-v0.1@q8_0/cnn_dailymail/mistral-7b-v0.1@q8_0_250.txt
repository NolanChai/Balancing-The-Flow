 the world of Formula E.

The vehicle uses four brushless DC motors (one for each wheel), which are capable of generating 250 kW per motor and have been supplied by UK-based Delta Motorsport. Drive eO claims that this will give the vehicle a theoretical top speed of over 300 km/h (186 mph).

The car uses an advanced battery pack which has been designed to work with all four motors, despite being split in two. The batteries have also been optimised for regenerative braking.

"As far as we know, no-one has done a full system with 4 motors yet," says Gints Silins from Drive eO. "We are pretty much at the top of the pack, because of our motors, power electronics and batteries."

Drive eO is currently working on a test car that will be ready to race in July or August next year. It's also planning to build four more cars by January 2017, which it hopes will be ready for the start of the FIA Formula E Championship 2016/2017 season.
