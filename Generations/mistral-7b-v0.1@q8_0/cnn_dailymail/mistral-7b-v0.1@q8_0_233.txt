8-year-old Kennedy Maxwell and her younger sister a ride home after finding the girls alone at a local park around noon. She later told reporters that she felt "a little uncomfortable" about leaving the children.

In response to the call, police found no signs of child abuse or neglect, but took custody of both girls anyway.

Around 2 p.m., an officer called Montgomery County Child Protective Services and CPS staff came to the scene, according to a report from the county police department. They assessed the children's well-being for more than five hours at police headquarters before releasing them to their parents.

The unnamed caller who took the kids home told a local news reporter that she felt "a little uncomfortable" about leaving the girls alone, even though she knew they were supposed to be there by themselves.

The story quickly made waves across the Internet, with many critics claiming it was an example of overzealous state interference in parenting.

CPS has since issued a statement explaining the decision to take custody of the children: "In the interest of child safety, we have established that the girls are being cared for by their parents. It is our policy not to comment further on individual cases."
