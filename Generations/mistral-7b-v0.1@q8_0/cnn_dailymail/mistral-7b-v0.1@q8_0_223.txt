iled their way into Prince William and Kate Middleton's inner circle.

The couple are said to have been "touched" by the affection shown at their wedding last year â€” and have reciprocated with kindnesses, from signing autographs for children to inviting people to visit them in private at St James' Palace. But in an unprecedented move, Prince William has agreed to be photographed with fans during this weekend's visit to the United States, when the couple will attend the 37th America's Cup sailing race.

Royal aides say it is a gesture of appreciation to those who have travelled from all over the country and world to meet them. "William has made it clear he wants to give something back to his fans," said one close friend.

The couple will take part in an informal photocall on Sunday, after their official appearance at America's Cup races. In a departure from royal protocol, they have also agreed to wave to the crowds and pose for selfies with their iPads.

This will be the first time in royal history that a member of the family has been officially photographed with members of the public. It is another example of how Prince William and Kate Middleton are trying to modernise and update the monarchy, particularly when it comes to public relations, something they have learned from their predecessors.

"Kate's attitude to her fans is very much the Queen Mum's," said one insider. "They know how important she is in keeping the monarchy relevant."
