 when someone sprayed graffiti on his backside.

The LAPD is asking anyone with information about who might have done it to come forward, but the LAPD may have solved the crime itself - because of a tag on the horse's butt.

LAPD Detective Dennis Kato tells KCBS/KCAL that Charly's tag is "a 12-inch scrawl of an 'L.'"

"It looks like he was marked by one person, but I don't think it's one of us," Kato says.
