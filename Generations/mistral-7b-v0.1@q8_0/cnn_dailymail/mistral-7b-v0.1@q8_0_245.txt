 Sunday morning.

According to WSOCTV in Charlotte, the couple was struck by a train that had just departed from Rock Hill and was en route to Charlotte, N.C., where it would eventually terminate. The accident happened in York County, S.C.

Investigators told NBC affiliate WCNC-TV that the victims were not standing on the tracks but lingering in a position that prevented them from hearing an approaching train and seeing the locomotive coming. They died instantly, police said.

NBC Charlotte reported that the train was running behind schedule when it hit the couple. It was carrying 52 passengers and one crew member at the time of the accident, which took place between Catawba and Chester stations. The incident halted rail traffic for hours while investigators examined the scene.
