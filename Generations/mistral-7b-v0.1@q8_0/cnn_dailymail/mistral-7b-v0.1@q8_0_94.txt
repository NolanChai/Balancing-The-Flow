ension between Egypt’s Muslim majority and its minority of Coptic Christians has been heightened since last year’s political turmoil, when mobs attacked several churches. The court in the capital Cairo ruled that the defendants — most of whom were Muslim — had acted premeditatedly to attack the church, burning it and a neighboring Christian house. It also ordered 33 other defendants to stand trial, while ruling that two had been illegally detained during their arrests, state news agency MENA reported Friday. The court case began in January, with prosecutors seeking the death penalty for five of the defendants and life sentences for 20 others.
The violence occurred as thousands of supporters of ousted President Mohamed Morsy clashed with security forces following the military’s overthrow of Egypt’s first democratically elected leader. More than a dozen people died, including two Copts killed by mobs. The attack in Kafr Hakim came on the third day of demonstrations against Morsy’s ouster, after protesters attempted to storm a police station and local government office.
