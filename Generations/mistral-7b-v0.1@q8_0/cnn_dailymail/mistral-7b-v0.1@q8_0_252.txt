 wave’ of inspirational quotes flooding classrooms, in a new paper entitled The Folly Of The Motivational Poster In Education.

It claims that teachers are relying on “mindless” phrases to engage pupils and boost learning and wellbeing when the evidence for this is weak or non-existent, he warns. He says: “We now live in a world where the motivational poster has been elevated from its home on office walls to classrooms across the country and even beyond. The motivational poster is the product of an age of uncertainty, a time when people are searching for meaning and purpose.”

Mr Hendrick’s research suggests that while some of the slogans may be useful, they can have a detrimental effect by being “off-putting” to pupils. He adds: “They simply don’t work. They seem to have been popularised not because there is evidence to show that they are effective but because they reflect what people think about motivation.

“But even the most inspiring and uplifting of motivational quotes will fail unless they are backed up by a carefully constructed classroom environment.”

Mr Hendrick cites an example of one pupil who was told during a lesson that “no-one cares” about them, which he claims was unhelpful.
