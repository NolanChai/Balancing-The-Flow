ations, after being told that it can help with their master's plans for the future, which he now realizes will be for his own demise. The object had a purple gem in it and as such was quite beautiful.
 
 `` Bring forth the vessel.'' He said as two angels came forth to do so. He watched as they brought forth a vessel made of the same metal the rod is made of. It is not a large vessel, about half his size, but he will make due with it. He grabbed the rod and placed it in the middle of the vessel, on top of a few sheets of paper he had written many instructions and notes on.
 
 `` Ready!'' The angels chanted as they came before him with a book.
 
 `` I'm ready.'' He said as he began to chant words which are long forgotten in this time, yet still remembered by the last batch of servants and as such were recorded for future generations. As he finished chanting the words, a flash of light occurred. He could see his face within it, along with some other unknown faces that were probably of previous generations, as he was not the first to use this spell. After the flash is gone, the vessel's top lid has vanished and in its place is a purple gem, just like the one from the rod.
 
 `` So good.'' He said as he took the gem in his hands. He looks at it and chuckles as he thinks of how he will be able to destroy his enemy with this gem, for his enemy is currently thinking they are unstoppable due to their own projection, yet the truth is that he has been planning for this day and has taken precautions which have rendered his projection useless in front of him.
 
 As such, he will be able to defeat his enemy with ease and will enjoy it. The enemy's death shall not come as a surprise but as a punishment for all their wrongdoings against the innocent people. He looks up into the sky and sees the stars above, his eyes lighting up with joy.
 
 `` It is settled.'' He said to himself as he placed the gem in front of him and began to chant words which were again forgotten over time but remembered by the last batch of servants, who had written them down for future generations. After chanting for a while, he ended his speech with a final sentence:
 
 `` May the power of this vessel be given to me.''
`` Ah, so this is the object I shall use. It is settled. Angels, bring out the object.'' 
 
 The object was a metal rod, given to him by the last batch of servants during one of his projection's visitations, after being told that it can help with their master's plans for the future, which he now realizes will be for his own demise. The object had a purple gem in it and as such was quite beautiful.
