ain, then shrugged. 
 
 `` Alright,'' he said, `` but I want to know what you do with all of these people.''
`` People?'' Johnson said, a puzzled expression on his face.
`` The people that you save and take into your Godly realm,'' Mark explained. `` Where are they going? What do they do there?'' 
 
 `` They die here!'' he answered in a frustrated tone.
 
 `` Well, yeah, but where did they go before they died here? And what happens to them afterwards? Are they stuck as ghosts or something? Or does everyone just go to heaven/hell/limbo?'' Mark continued.
 
 `` I have no idea!'' Johnson bellowed in frustration. 
 
 `` Well, that's kinda a problem, isn't it?'' Mark asked.
`` What? It's not like anybody cares what happens to them after they die!'' he replied angrily. 
 
 `` So why do you care if people die here? Why do you want us to go to your heaven or whatever it is?'' he continued. 
``Because I am the God of life!'', Johnson stated, proudly. 
 
 `` But where do we go when we die? What happens to us afterwards?'' 
``You just stay dead!''
``Why?''
``I don't know! I don't want anyone to think I care what happens to them after they die or anything.''
 
 Mark looked at him in silence for a moment. Then, he stood up and walked to the door, where Johnson stopped him. 
``You can't go,'' he stated.
``Why not?''
``Because you know that if I let you go, you would tell everyone about me.''
``And that's wrong? What gives you the right to force us to stay here and live out our lives in fear of you or whatever it is that you do? Don't you think we should have a choice? And isn't this whole thing against your rules anyways?''
``The rules are there for a reason,'' Johnson replied, ``and if you don't like them then I suggest you find another place to live.''
 
 Mark sighed and shook his head. He walked back over to the desk, sat down in the chair across from him, then looked at him with an expression of concern.
``Mr. God,'' he said, ``you seem awfully depressed. Are there any other things that we can do for you? I mean, this job sounds awful.''
 
 Johnson shrugged off the question and stood up to leave, but Mark reached out and grabbed his arm before he could leave.
``Please tell me what it is that I can do to help,'' Mark begged him.
``If you want to help me, then you will do as I say,'' Johnson replied sternly. 
 
 ``What?'' 
``You will become one of my servants. You will serve me for the rest of your life and never question me again.'' 
``No way!'' Mark exclaimed in surprise. ``I have to go home, but I'll be back later!'' He walked out of Johnson's office without another word.
 
 
 When he got outside, he took a deep breath of air and looked up at the sky. It was late afternoon now and the sun had just started to set. Mark could feel his eyes starting to get heavy as he made his way down the street towards home. He walked past several people on their way home from work or school, but they all ignored him as they passed by him without even looking at him.
 
 As soon as he got close enough to see his house from where he was standing, he stopped walking and stood still for a few moments before going inside. When he entered the door, it slammed shut behind him with such force that Mark could feel it vibrate through his body. He walked up the stairs to the second floor of the house, but when he got there, something strange happened; instead of going into his bedroom like normal, he found himself standing at the top of a flight of stairs leading down into an underground chamber.
 
 There were two doors on either side of the entranceway and each one had a sign hanging over it reading ``Johnson'' in large letters with arrows pointing towards them. Mark walked through the door marked Johnson without thinking about where he was going, but when he entered the room inside, he found himself standing in front of a desk. 
 
 A man wearing glasses sat behind it and smiled at him as if they had been expecting his arrival. The man looked familiar to Mark but he couldn't place who this person might be. He tried to speak, but before he could get out any words, Johnson spoke first.
``You have come for an interview,'' he said with a smile on his face. ``Would you like to know more about our company? I am Johnson, the CEO of our organization.''
