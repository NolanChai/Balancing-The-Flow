of it and to question whether or not it exists. Then you grow up and you go through life, you get a job and pay bills and all of that, then one day, one day the fear is gone and you’re sure of yourself. You realize that whatever was in the corner is just your imagination and you learn to live with that. But then one day you find yourself in the same situation and for some reason you feel the fear again, but you know you can’t be afraid of it because your grown up now.
So what do you do? I don’t know about you but I just ignore the feeling, keep my head down, tell myself there’s nothing to see here and move along. But sometimes that doesn’t work. Sometimes the fear is still there and no matter how hard you try to fight it, or to be strong in spite of it, it gets to you.

I have two friends who are both getting married soon (one tomorrow!) and I don’t know why but my brain seems to want to focus on what could go wrong rather than the beauty of their big day. I hate that I am like this. I hate that I can’t be happy for them because the fear is overcoming me. It’s not going away either, it’s just growing stronger every time I try to fight it off and I don’t know why.
I thought I was past all of that but apparently not, because today the corner of my eye is alive once again.
