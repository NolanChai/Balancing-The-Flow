 all the horror movies that have tried to tackle that idea, no one has been able to come up with an answer. Until now. 
 
 ``The Belko Experiment'' is set in an office building where the workers are told there's an unseen gunman killing people from another country, but everyone knows it's them shooting each other. It's a movie about how far we'll go to survive, and what it takes to kill someone close. 
 
 ``For me,'' says Tony Goldwyn, ``that was the question: Could you kill your friend? Could you do something that is so awful in order to save your life?'' 
 
 The actor has spent two decades trying to answer that. In 1997, he made his first movie for director Kevin Williamson, in a film called ``Scream.'' That was the beginning of a collaboration that would last more than two decades and spawn countless sequels, all of them dealing with the same question: ``How far do we go to survive?'' 
 
 When they were working on a movie about a group of people trapped in an office building, Goldwyn says he told Williamson, ``The only way I'm doing this is if it's real. It can't be an idea.'' 
 
 For two years, he worked with the filmmaker to develop a script that would not only answer that question but also make audiences understand why they might feel compelled to do something so awful. ``The Belko Experiment'' is not just about people being told what to do. It's also about how far we go when it comes to survival and what it takes to kill someone close. 
 
 ``This movie has been my favorite thing I've ever done,'' says Goldwyn. ``I love that it asks all these questions but doesn't provide any answers, because then you start thinking about them.''
 
 The idea for ``The Belko Experiment'' came from Williamson himself, who had wanted to make a movie about an office building where there was no exit. ``When I first read the script,'' says Goldwyn, ``I thought it was just a really good thriller.'' 

 But as he worked on it with Williamson, he began to realize that this wasn't going to be your typical slasher flick. Instead of being about a bunch of teenagers being hunted down by an unknown killer, this would be about people who are trapped in an office building and forced to kill their friends or die themselves. ``We were really trying to make something different,'' says Goldwyn, who is also a producer on the project. 
 
``I think what Kevin did was take the idea of `Saw'' but instead of having one killer, he had 20 different killers. And rather than just showing people getting killed, they show how the victims react to it.'' 
 
 He adds that while ``The Belko Experiment'' isn't as graphic as some of the other horror films out there, it still packs a punch. ``You see things in this movie that you don't see in any other movies,'' he says. ``But I think it's really important to show what people go through when they have no choice.'' 
 
 That was one of the most challenging aspects of making the film, according to Goldwyn. ``You want to show these characters struggling with this situation,'' he says, ``but you also don't want them to be too sympathetic because it makes it harder for the audience to root for them.'' 
 
 For example, one scene in the film shows a woman being forced to watch as her boyfriend is killed right before her eyes. She then turns around and kills his killer. ``You know that she doesn't want to do it,'' says Goldwyn, ``but you understand why she has to.'' 
 
 That scene was shot in just one day, says the actor, because they didn't have much time left on their schedule. But even though it was rushed, he thinks it came out pretty well. 
 
 ``It took us a couple of takes,'' he says, ``but by the end of the day I think everyone had a clear understanding of what needed to happen.'' 
 
 The cast and crew worked hard to ensure that the movie wasn't just another slasher flick, but something more realistic and thought-provoking. Goldwyn says they wanted to make sure viewers would leave the theater thinking about how far we go when it comes to survival and what it takes to kill someone close. 
 
 ``This is a different kind of movie,'' he says, ``and I hope people come out of it feeling challenged rather than shocked.''
``The Belko Experiment'' premiered in theaters nationwide on March 13th.
