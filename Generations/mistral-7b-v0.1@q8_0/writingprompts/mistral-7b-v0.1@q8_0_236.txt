The internet is a magical place where we can interact and share ideas. We have an opportunity to make friends and share our passions with people from all over the world. I say that with a little bit of sarcasm because what I really mean is the Internet is a huge waste of time, and now it's even more so.

I love Twitter for keeping up with news, but lately I have been noticing something a little disturbing. If you follow enough people who share their life on social networks you will notice that these days every second person has just been to the doctor or hospital or worse. It's almost as if everyone is sick all of the time and can't stop posting about it, sometimes multiple times in the same day.

I'm not sure why we are so interested in knowing when people go to the doctor but I think it may have something to do with feeling like you're part of a group or tribe that is just as sick as you are. You see the posts and know you're not alone, which is nice. But wait, maybe there is more to this than meets the eye. What if these people aren't actually sick? What if they have figured out how to game the system so they can get likes by sharing their experience?

## Likes Make People Feel Good

This may be the real reason behind why we are all so obsessed with going to doctors or hospitals and posting about it on social media. We want attention, and more importantly we want it from strangers. Our brains release a hormone called dopamine when we get likes on our posts that make us feel good. And if you're not getting any likes then maybe your post isn't as interesting to others as you think. Maybe they don't care about what happened at the doctor's office with you because it doesn't affect them or their life in any way shape or form, and now your brain has stopped producing dopamine because there are no more likes coming through for your post on Facebook, Twitter etc....

This is why some people will do anything just so they can get a like or two from someone else who does not know them personally but only knows about them through their social media posts. This is also the reason why some doctors and hospitals will post about how many patients they have seen that day with certain types of illnesses/conditions etc.. just to get more likes on their page which makes them feel better about themselves because they are getting attention from strangers who may never even visit them in real life but now know all kinds of things thanks to what was shared publicly online.

## Why I Think People Share Their Illness Online

I think that people share their illnesses and problems online for a couple of reasons. The first is to make themselves feel better about the situation, if they can get others to commiserate with them it makes them feel less alone. It also gives them an excuse as to why things are not going right in their life right now, they are sick after all! Another reason I think people do this is because of social media algorithms and the need for more followers and likes on posts so they will get more attention from strangers which again makes one feel better about themselves.

## It's Not Just Sickness

It's not just illness that we seem to be posting about anymore either, now people are posting pictures of their dinner or breakfast with a long caption as if it was something special and someone needs to know what they had for breakfast at the same time everyone else in the world is having it too. The point being there seems to be this need for attention on social media that wasn't there before because now we can get it instantly without going anywhere or doing anything which makes us feel better about ourselves even when nothing has actually changed in our lives except maybe how many people like our latest post.

The internet is a great place where you can find friends and share your passions with people from all over the world, but it also seems to be an addiction for many who use social media to get attention no matter what the cost. It's not just about posting pictures of your food or illness anymore either, now there are posts about things that seem more trivial than others such as having a bad hair day which doesn't really affect anyone else but us yet we post it anyway because we want others to know how unhappy we are with ourselves.

## Final Thoughts

I am not sure if this is just me being bitter or if there really is something to this whole social media thing, but I can't help but think that the more people share their life on these platforms the less happy they seem to be in real life. And why would someone want to be friends with someone who constantly posts about how much they hate everything when all you see is their negativity? It's not like it was a good idea from the start anyway because now there are more reasons than ever before for people to post these types of things online instead of talking face-to-face like humans used too back before technology took over every aspect of our lives.
