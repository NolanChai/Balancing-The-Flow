 few feet off the ground. There was no decoration or luxury, only the necessities to ensure that he could sit in his final moment of bliss.

He had heard the tales of what awaited him when he passed through, and after years of research, he finally had come up with the correct combination for a portal into the other world, the world beyond this one. He was ready.

He took a deep breath, letting it out slowly as his fingers ran across each of the twelve runes that had taken him so long to find and remember, engraved upon the four walls. He paused a moment, considering what he would see when the portal opened. It could be anything. It could be another world, it could be a void, or even his own personal hell if he had failed somehow in his calculations.

He didn't care. Not any longer. The portal was there, ready and waiting for him to open it, and that was all that mattered. With one final breath, he spoke the words that would open the gateway between worlds. The room shimmered briefly with blue light and a moment later he was gone.
