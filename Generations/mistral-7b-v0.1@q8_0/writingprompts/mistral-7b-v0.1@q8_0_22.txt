 this month, what was going to be put in our rations bag for the week? I looked down and read the text message from the government informing us that today was a bread day.
 
 A quick glance around the room told me that everyone else had gotten the same message because the whole room was moving around hurriedly. The rest of my family were already gone, probably on their way to school, leaving just my parents and I in our tiny apartment. With a sigh, I got out of bed and took my place at the kitchen table. My mom sat on one side and my dad on the other.
 
 “Today is bread day” I said to them as they continued to eat their breakfasts. It wasn’t like either of them didn’t know already but we all had our own routines that we followed in preparation for distribution day, even though it was the same thing every time. I watched my dad carefully fold his newspaper and place it on top of the table. He then stood up from the table and walked towards me, a smile on his face as he put his hand out to shake mine.
 
 “Good luck today” he said as we shook hands, then he gave me a little kiss on the forehead. My mom followed next but only offered a small pat on my back before continuing with her breakfast. I took one more quick look around and left for work.
 
 The walk from my house to my job was about half an hour long so there wasn’t much time for conversation, especially since people didn’t really like talking to each other anymore anyway. The government had done a good job of keeping everyone afraid and suspicious towards one another over the past couple decades, so I spent most of my walk listening to music on my headphones instead.
 
 When I finally arrived at work, everyone was already there and busy doing their jobs as usual. It seemed like not much had changed since yesterday or even last week because it felt exactly the same every day no matter what time it was or how many days had passed by. We were all just living our lives as normal people do but we knew deep down that everything wasn’t right anymore and we were too afraid to change anything about it.
 
 When my shift finally ended, I walked home with an empty stomach like I always did on distribution day because they didn’t allow any food in the buildings where rations were handed out. The walk from work to my house took only fifteen minutes this time since there weren’t as many people on the streets as usual but by the time I got back home, everyone else had already gone for their bread and was now busy cooking it or just eating it while watching TV with their families.
 
 Once again, we all sat at our own kitchen table waiting for bread day to be over so we could go back to living our lives like normal people do but deep down inside we all knew that something wasn’t right anymore and none of us were brave enough to change anything about it even though it would have been easy enough if only someone had the guts.
 
 When my mom finally finished cooking dinner, she served everyone their meals then sat down at her own place next to mine just like every other night before distribution day came around again. After a while, I saw my dad walk into the kitchen holding a loaf of freshly baked bread and handing it over to my mom who smiled at him with tears in her eyes as he kissed her forehead then took his seat next to me on the other side of the table.
 
 As we all ate our dinners together, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for everyone else who was still out there living their lives like normal people do even though something wasn’t right anymore and none of them were brave enough to change anything about it even though it would have been easy enough if only someone had the guts.
