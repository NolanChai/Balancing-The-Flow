t certain what it was about, but the air seemed less still, with more movement of some kind, and everything appeared brighter. My skin glowed slightly from within, as though sunshine were rising up to my surface, and then pouring through me in a way that could not be seen. I felt light as a feather.

I reached down to stroke the dog ’ s head gently. “ That was delicious, wasn ’ t it ? ”

He gave a low, rumbling purr, and rose with an effortless grace that made my heart flutter in its cage, before settling again at my feet as I pushed back my chair, and stood to clear the table. “ I think I need to go to the supermarket, ” I said to myself. “ We ’ ve only just moved here, but I have a feeling I won ’ t be going very often… ”

“ Well ? What is it ? ” I asked, gently. He tilted his head and gave a little whine. “ You didn ’ t think I needed to go shopping ? ” I sounded incredulous.

He rose again, and came over to me, where he placed his paws on my lap, and gazed up at me with such loving eyes that I almost lost myself in them. Almost, but not quite. There was too much of the unexpected here still, for me to allow that sort of distraction.

“ No, ” he said quietly. “ You ’ ll never need to go shopping again. We have everything you could ever want, right here. ”

I looked down at my husband, and felt a deep sense of sadness. “ I ’ m sorry, ” I said quietly. “ It won ’ t happen anymore… ”
