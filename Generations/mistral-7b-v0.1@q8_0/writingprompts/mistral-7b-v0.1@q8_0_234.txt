ire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.''*

A truly great writer can lift us out of ourselves and remind us that we are all one. It's been said that one day all our art will be gone. I think it's the last thing we should let go. We need art to remember who we are, what we did, why we did it, where we came from.

RIP, Mr. Pynchon.
