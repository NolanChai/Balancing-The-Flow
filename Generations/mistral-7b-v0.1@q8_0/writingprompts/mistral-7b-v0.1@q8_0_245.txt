acophony of wailing and squeaking for 4 years? It's hell, that's what it's like.
 
 And now you've gotten better at it. Now I can hear your screeching every time you take out that damned violin in the living room. Your mother's voice has never been more annoying than now. "Oh, play something for us!" she says to you every night. She laughs as if it was a good joke. I wish you could hear how horrible it is. But you can't. So you don't know that your laughter is a torture.
 
 Oh, and you've gotten better at playing the piano too! I remember how you used to practice on it in the other side of the wall when we were children. It sounded like a cat scratching its way through the walls. Now you play Chopin, Beethoven, Mozart...
 
 Well, guess what? You're still annoying. I hate you, and I always will. I wish I could kill you.

I wrote this when I was in grade school. The kid next to me used to take violin lessons.
