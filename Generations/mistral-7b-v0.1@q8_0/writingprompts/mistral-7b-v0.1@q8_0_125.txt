etechnology, and it was our turn for a glimpse into their secrets!

This is an exciting adventure story, where three human youths take their first trip through the stars aboard the starship Shenandoah. They’re joined by their shipmates of all different species, all eagerly anticipating the opportunity to explore Space Center Eros. But there are those onboard who don’t want them to see the true secrets of the center… and they’re willing to do whatever it takes to stop them!

As a human from Earth in 2015, I have to admit that I found myself confused at times with some of the terminology used, but overall it was a fun story with an exciting plot and lots of action. The characters were interesting and well developed, which helped make up for my confusion about the time period.

As someone who isn’t into sci-fi, I would definitely recommend this book to readers of all ages who love stories that take them on adventures beyond the stars. This was an easy read that will keep you turning the pages until you reach its exciting ending!
