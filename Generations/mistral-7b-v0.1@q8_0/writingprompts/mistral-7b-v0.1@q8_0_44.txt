 and an obsession with a game he called “Battleship.” He had a collection of model spaceships, Star Trek uniforms, and many other nerdy collectibles.

As a young child, August’s parents worried about his social development, because he preferred spending time with the teachers at school to playing on the playground with the other children. The other kids made fun of him for that, so much so that his mother decided to enroll him in an after-school program where she could keep an eye on him.

August’s mother was very proud of his accomplishments and his good grades at school; but as he grew older, his father was not as enthusiastic about August’s hobbies or career choice. When August first told his father he wanted to become a scientist, his father replied that scientists were for nerds who couldn’t play football.

August was devastated and thought maybe he should try something else, but then remembered the words of one of his teachers who once said that if you find something you love doing, then it’s not work at all.

Although August did well in school, his grades dropped from A+ to C average after he graduated college because the university he attended didn’t offer courses on space travel or advanced mathematics. He decided to pursue a master’s degree in physics instead.

After years of study and research, August finally got what he had always wanted: a job at NASA! He was very excited about this opportunity but nervous about being around people again after so many years alone. Fortunately for him, all the other scientists were just as socially awkward as he was; they spent most of their time working on computers or reading textbooks instead of talking to each other or playing games with one another like “Battleship.”

August didn’t feel comfortable around people very often and would spend hours alone in his office doing research. When he finally did have to interact with other people, it was usually during meetings where they discussed technical issues related to their work; not because he wanted to be friends with them but rather because the projects required everyone involved.

One day while walking through the hallways of his building, August bumped into another scientist named John who worked on a different floor. They introduced themselves and started talking about what they did for work. They quickly discovered that both had been playing “Battleship” since childhood! Soon after meeting each other at NASA headquarters, August invited John over to play some more games together.

John was surprised when August told him about how much fun he had playing the game as a kid but also realized why his mother never let him go out of their house alone—he wasn’t good with people! He could tell by looking at him that this guy was very intelligent; maybe even smarter than himself, which made them both feel awkward around each other at first.

After playing the game a few more times together, they finally decided to become friends. They spent hours talking about everything under the sun; from movies and books to politics and science fiction. Eventually August convinced John to join him for dinner at one of his favorite restaurants downtown. The two would often talk on the phone or meet up in person once per week after that first night out together.

August was so happy that he finally had someone else who understood him; someone he could relate to and spend time with outside work hours too! Although it took some time for them both get used to each other’s personalities, they eventually became best friends forever (BFF). Even when August got married and moved away from their city, they continued communicating with one another via email or phone calls every now and then.

Although the two never played “Battleship” again after high school graduation, their love for space travel remained strong throughout adulthood. They often talked about what it would be like if humans ever got a chance to visit other planets or even go into deep space someday soon!
