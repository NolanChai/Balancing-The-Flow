3 days later you'd get an interview. Now, most of the places won't even bother looking at your resume if you don't have 5 years experience in that field. So I wonder why I bother anymore.

I went out tonight to a networking event and met some great people. People who were genuinely nice to me. It was so nice to talk to them, but my soul feels empty because I don't have a job or a place of my own. I feel like a burden when I go home. That I am constantly mooching off of other people. Even though my sister and brother in law have told me that it is no big deal that they let me stay here, I still feel bad about it.

I've been living out of a suitcase for so long, my life just feels like one giant mess. It's hard to find the motivation to even get up some days when everything seems so hopeless and useless. I do not want to feel this way. I don't want to be a burden on other people or make them feel bad that they let me stay here for free. That's why I will keep trying everyday to get out of this situation because it is no way to live. It may not work now, but it will in the end.
