ing to see one of our own taken by these things, we also learned from it.

But as time went on, we saw a new threat emerge in the form of modern humans. With guns, cars and all sorts of other "technology" they were able to take advantage of us without any risk of losing their lives. It was a horrible time for our species, and our population decreased at an alarming rate.

And now that the last 10 of us are left, we have finally decided that enough is enough. We can no longer allow them to hunt us for sport, so we must do what they did to us - kill. Now I know it's a drastic action, but I have full faith in our ability to execute these "humans" with the skill and precision we used on our prey in the past.

Anyways, my name is Jack and I am one of those last 10 wolves. For me this fight for survival has taken a personal toll as my mate and daughter were killed by humans. They are dead because they came too close to their city. We live in the mountains now; it's a much safer place away from the hustle and bustle of those humans.

The last few years have been rough, but we have a plan for our survival. The first thing we need is some guns. Without them, we'll be at their mercy again. So far only 7 of us know about this plan; and even then none are allowed to know the whole thing. That's where you come in - if you have the stomach for it and the skills we need, you could be the next member of the pack.

You will start as a trainee with no access to any of our weapons or gear. But if you prove yourself worthy and show us your loyalty, you could end up being one of those 7 wolves who knows everything about this plan. That's when things get interesting. It'll be a lot of work, but it'll all be worth it in the end - we will finally get revenge on those humans!

## Introduction

If you want to join our pack, there are three things that you must do:

1) You must pass a test where I will teach you how to kill and eat another animal. If you fail this test then we won't let you join. This is important because if the humans find out about it before they kill us all, they might try and stop us from continuing on with our plan.

2) You must agree that once we have guns and are ready for war, then every other person in your pack (including yourself) will die by being shot at close range with no warning or hesitation whatsoever - even if you're the last one standing! It doesn't matter whether they know about our plan or not; this is just how things are going to be from now on until we're free of these humans once and for all.

3) You must promise not tell anyone outside the pack anything that has been said during this meeting. We can trust each other because we don't have any family ties anymore - but if someone finds out about what's going on before we kill them then there will be no chance of us getting revenge for all those years of being hunted down like animals by humans!

If you can do these three things, then we will consider letting you join our pack and help us take back our freedom from those pesky humans once and for all. Are you ready? Great! Now let's get started on how to kill an animal without getting caught...

## The Test

Okay so it's been a week since my last blog post - sorry about that, things have just been really busy lately. But I finally got some time to write again and this is what I want to talk about: How To Kill And Eat Another Animal Without Getting Caught!

So first off let me just say that if you're not prepared for the sight of blood or don't mind getting your hands dirty then maybe you should stop reading now because this post isn't going to be pretty. However, if you're interested in learning more about how animals kill each other and how humans do too, then keep on reading!

The first step is finding an animal that won't fight back (unless it's a predator itself). This can be tricky since most wild animals will try and run away from danger instead of running towards it - but don't worry, there are ways around this problem!

One option would be finding some dead roadkill somewhere off the beaten path where nobody goes by often; another would be going out at night when all the other animals have gone home for bedtime because they're nocturnal creatures (which means they sleep during daylight hours). If neither of those options work then try looking up information on local farms or zoos - usually these places offer tours where you get to see various types of farm animals close up! Just make sure not to touch anything while visiting these locations since some species like cows have been known to kick visitors when provoked by their presence.

Once you've found your animal(s), it's time for step two: stalking them silently so that they don't sense any danger coming from behind! This can be tough depending on how well hidden the prey is and whether or not it's moving around too much - but remember: patience pays off more often than not! Just keep following slowly until its back is turned towards you, then make one swift movement in order to grab hold of its neck/throat area without making any sounds whatsoever...

## The Plan

You might be wondering why we chose this particular animal as our test subject. Well, it's because they're easy to catch and kill - which is exactly what we need for the plan! If you've never seen a chicken before then I recommend looking up some pictures online so that you know what one looks like; trust me when I say there are plenty of them out there...

Once we get close enough, all we have to do is grab hold of its neck or throat area without making any sounds (that way the others won't hear us). Then comes the fun part: ripping off their head with our teeth! It sounds gross but trust me when I say it doesn't take long at all - especially if you're used to eating raw meat like wolves do naturally in nature.

After that, we'll tear into its flesh and eat until we can't fit anymore inside our stomachs... But wait - there is more! Once that's done, we'll take the dead animal back home with us so that everyone else knows about how good it tasted when cooked over an open fire (just like humans cook food). This way nobody will suspect anything odd going on with you because they'll just assume everything was fine as usual; meanwhile only those who know about this plan will be able to see through the smoke screen of lies that surrounds our pack.

That was easy enough right? Now onto step two: finding someone willing enough (and skilled enough) who can teach other wolves how to do the same thing!

## The Aftermath

So after a week of trying, we finally found someone who was willing to teach us how to kill and eat another animal without getting caught. His name is Jack, and he's been doing this for years now - so you know he's good at what he does!

We got together last night (after dark) in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town where there aren't many people around anymore since they moved away long ago when things got too dangerous around here; that's why it was perfect because no one would have noticed anything strange happening over there either!

We all gathered outside with our weapons ready - then Jack started speaking about how important it is not only to take down an enemy but also eat them afterwards so you don't waste any time or energy looking for food later on down the line when things get tough again; plus eating another animal makes us stronger too!

He showed us how easy it was with just one swing of his axe - which didn't take long at all since there wasn't much left after he chopped off its head anyway... Then we followed suit by taking turns killing each other until only three wolves remained standing; those three were chosen specifically because they had proven themselves worthy enough during this training session earlier today.

Now comes the hard part: actually carrying out our plan without getting caught first! We're going to need everyone on board if we want this operation successful - so make sure you know what you're doing before starting anything here."
