ng behind a desk on the other side of the room.

`` Yes, well,'' she replied, ``I don't know how much longer we can go on with this delay. If the next one is late too...'' Her voice trailed off.

Caillou sighed inwardly and said, ``Well, let's try to stay calm. After all, there's nothing we can do about it, except hope that our suppliers are more reliable than they have been so far.''

`` No, I suppose not,'' the woman conceded reluctantly. ``All right then, what else is on your agenda?'' She leaned back in her chair and crossed her legs.

Caillou was happy to move onto another subject. He cleared his throat and began reading from the clipboard: `` This week we are having a special promotion with our line of `Hot Hotties.' ''

He stopped and looked up. The woman, who he knew as Tia Dalma, raised an eyebrow. Caillou continued: `` Our suppliers have developed a new line of women that actually glow in the dark. They also come in a variety of colors, so you can be sure to get one that will go with your decor. They're also very easy on the eyes.''

Tia Dalma was amused at Caillou's enthusiasm for their latest marketing campaign. `` And how much are they going to cost?'' she asked.

`` I don't have an exact price, but it will be well worth it,'' he answered.

She sighed and shook her head. `` Well, Caillou, I can see that you've worked very hard on this promotion. If it succeeds as you seem to think it will, I suppose you may keep the profits.''

Caillou grinned from ear to ear at this unexpected windfall. He knew he had done good work. `` Thank you, Ma'am,'' he said.

As he was leaving the room, Tia Dalma spoke again. `` Oh, Caillou! I almost forgot. This week is the anniversary of your appointment as my assistant. As a celebration, I'm going to let you go home early.''

`` Really? Early?'' he exclaimed.

She laughed at his surprise. `` Yes, just take a little vacation time. You can start it tonight. See how much more you accomplish with some time away from here!''

Caillou smiled and left the room. He hurried through the maze of corridors that connected the offices to the living quarters. A few minutes later he entered his room, which was quite plainly furnished. It seemed odd for such an important person to live in so simple a place.

`` I suppose this is what they call `modesty,' '' he thought, but he knew it wasn't really that. He had been told when he first took the job that he would live like a servant here. Tia Dalma didn't seem to mind, though, and Caillou tried not to either.

After all, he was happy with his position as her assistant. In fact, he loved it. He also knew that Tia Dalma had many other responsibilities besides his own small job. As the ruler of Hell, she often had to make decisions about the souls of men and women who had lived and died.

Caillou thought about this as he laid down on his bed. It was a simple thing, but it would have to do for now. `` I'm glad that my work is appreciated,'' he said aloud. `` Maybe tomorrow will be better than today.''

The next morning, Caillou woke up and realized that he was late for work! He leapt out of bed and rushed downstairs. When he got to his desk, Tia Dalma was already there and looking at him with a disapproving glare on her face. `` Oh, I'm sorry,'' he apologized, ``I didn't mean to be late.''

She shook her head. `` It doesn't matter now. We have work to do!'' She handed him some papers and said, ``These are the names of your first assignments for today. You can start them at once if you like.''

Caillou took the papers eagerly. As he began reading over them, Tia Dalma leaned back in her chair and stared out the window. It was a beautiful day. The sun shone brightly on the clouds above, and they seemed to glow with their own light. Caillou knew that she was thinking of something important as he looked down at the paper in his hands.

He was happy with his job. He had been given an assignment today which would require him to go into Hell itself! It wasn't really a surprise; he had expected it for some time now. But he couldn't help being excited by this opportunity, so he began to read through the instructions again. ``I must be careful not to make any mistakes,'' he thought.

Tia Dalma watched him from her seat as she thought about the work that needed to be done today. It would take more than one day for them all to get done; there were many souls in need of help, and each person had a story to tell before they could go on with their lives. Caillou looked up at his boss and smiled. She seemed satisfied with what he was doing, so he went back to his work.

As the day progressed, Caillou realized that Tia Dalma was right about one thing: There were many souls who needed help. It took all of his time and energy to get through them all! But somehow, it didn't seem like too much effort; he loved his job and wanted to do everything he could for each person who came before him.

Tia Dalma watched him from her desk as the day wore on. He was working hard, but she knew that it wasn't enough for him. Caillou was still thinking about how he could make things better, and she hoped that one day soon, his work would be done. But for now, there were many souls who needed help from him.

Tia Dalma saw the sun start to set and knew that it was almost time for her meeting with Caillou. He had been working so hard all day, but now he looked tired. She stood up and walked over to where he sat. ``It's getting late,'' she said, ``and you've worked very hard today.''

Caillou smiled at his boss as he got up from his desk. He was happy with how much work he had done that day, but Tia Dalma could see that there was more to be done. ``I know,'' she said, ``but don't worry about it tonight.''

``Thank you, Ma'am,'' Caillou replied.

As they walked out of the office and down the stairs, Tia Dalma asked Caillou if he wanted to take a walk with her in Hell before he went home for the night. He thought about it and decided that he would rather sleep than go on another errand into this strange land where he had never been before. ``No, thank you,'' he answered politely, ``I think I'd like to go straight home now.''

She nodded her head in agreement with him. ``All right then,'' she said as they started down the stairs together, ``I guess we can do that tomorrow.''
