 loudly, hoping to wake him up, as I push the intercom button. It must be one o clock, or so, judging from the brightness of my room. 

 > "Yes? Who is it?" he asks groggily into the speaker. He sounds sleepy and annoyed at the same time.
 > 
 > "It's me", I answer back, pushing the button again to let him know that it's a priority call.
 > 
 > *Ding Dong* there must be someone home? *Ding Dong* come on open up! *Ding Do*- oh shit. I think I broke it. But atleast now he can hear me better. "I'm outside the gate", I say quickly as soon as I hear his voice.
 > 
 > "Wait for a second, I am coming out", he replies hurriedly, and before I have time to answer him, there is the sound of some stairs creaking and heavy footsteps approaching the gate. Then suddenly it flies open, and there is my boyfriend standing there with his trademark smirk on his face, looking down at me.
 > 
 > "Hey", he says as soon as I get close to him, and then pulls me into a tight hug. "Oh you smell so good! What did you do?" he asks, nuzzling my neck, which is a big turn on for both of us, even though I've been sleeping in that shirt all night.
 > 
 > "I...just took a shower", I say softly, and he lifts his head to look at me, a smirk still playing around his lips, but there is something more intense than usual about it. "Is that what you wanted?" he asks as he pulls away from me, taking my hand into his.
 > 
 > "Yes", I say quietly, suddenly feeling shy and flustered under the intensity of his gaze. His smirk deepens into a lopsided grin as he pulls me inside the house. My hand feels clammy in his, but I don't seem to mind it at all right now, as long as he's holding mine.
 > 
 > "Did you have any dinner?" he asks me once we are inside the living room. I shake my head, not trusting myself to speak just yet. My brain seems to be malfunctioning since the moment I woke up and saw him standing in front of me in his grey t-shirt and black jogging bottoms that he sleeps in.
 > 
 > He turns around to walk towards the kitchen, and my gaze is automatically drawn to the curve of his ass, which is more pronounced than ever due to the tightness of the fabric. I almost salivate at the sight, but control myself just before he notices it, or I might scare him off for good.
 > 
 > "Are you hungry?" he asks from somewhere inside the kitchen, and I nod. "Okay, sit down on the couch then, I'll be right back", he says, his voice sounding so damn sexy that I have to bite my lower lip to control myself, but it doesn't work very well.
 > 
 > He comes back after a few minutes with two plates of spaghetti bolognese and some freshly cut vegetables. It is the best smelling food I have ever had, but even more so than that is the way my boyfriend looks when he puts it down in front of me. He seems almost nervous as he looks up at me from where he sits across the table, but he quickly recovers and picks up his own plate to start eating.
 > 
 > "You smell good", I say quietly, watching him intently. He flushes a bit, but then smiles wickedly and looks back at me with a gleam in his eyes.
 > 
 > "You too", he says, and then takes a bite of the spaghetti on his plate. We eat in silence for a couple of minutes, neither of us willing to be the first one to say anything. But then I notice something that has been bothering me for the last few days, so I decide to break the silence with it, before I forget about it again.
 > 
 > "Why did you not tell me about your new job?", I ask him suddenly, and he looks at me surprised.
 > 
 > "What?" he asks, and I repeat myself more slowly, hoping that my shyness won't get in the way of understanding his words this time. "I- I didn't tell you about my new job because I was worried about how you would react", he says, looking away from me for a moment.
 > 
 > "But why?" I ask again, still not sure what is going on inside his head right now. He looks back at me with an intense gaze that makes me shiver, but also feels good in some way. "Because you told me that you wanted to spend more time together", he says softly, looking down at our hands which are still clasped between us.
 > 
 > "But I didn't mean it like that!", I say quickly, feeling slightly frustrated and confused now. He nods slowly without saying anything else for a few seconds before continuing: "Well, yes you did. You said that we should see each other more often and spend less time apart."
 > 
 > I can feel the blood rushing to my face at his words, but try not to let it show on my face. "I thought we could still spend a lot of time together", I say quietly, hoping that he will understand what I mean even if he doesn't say anything else. He nods slowly again before looking up at me with a smile on his face.
 > 
 > "Yes, of course! That's why I didn't tell you about the job." he says, and I feel my heart melting at the sound of his voice. "But that doesn't mean we have to see less of each other now does it?" he asks softly, looking into my eyes with a mischievous look in them.
 > 
 > "No", I say back, trying not to smile at him even though my cheeks are feeling hotter than ever. He smiles back and then leans forward across the table towards me before placing his lips gently on mine. I close my eyes and just feel the world melting around us as we kiss for what seems like an eternity before he pulls away from me with a sigh.
 > 
 > "I want you", he says softly, and then takes my hand into his again, leading me out of the kitchen and towards our bedroom without saying another word. I feel like a kid in a candy store as we walk together slowly through the house until we reach our room. My boyfriend turns around to look at me for a moment before opening the door, and I feel my heart skipping a beat or two when I see what's waiting inside.
 > 
 > The lights are dimmed low, and there is a small lamp on the nightstand next to our bed which casts an orange glow around us. There is also some soft music playing in the background, but it is not loud enough to distract us from each other. My boyfriend walks up to me slowly as I stand there looking at him with wide eyes while he undresses himself down to his boxer shorts.
 > 
 > He stands in front of me for a few seconds before reaching out towards my clothes and undressing me slowly, taking off each piece of clothing one by one. Once I'm completely naked we look at each other for a moment before he takes me into his arms and leads me towards our bed where he lies down on top of me with all his weight resting on mine.
 > 
 > "I love you", he whispers into my ear, and then starts kissing down my neck until he reaches my breasts. I moan softly as his lips brush against the hard nipples that are sticking out from them, making them even harder than they already were. He takes one of them into his mouth and sucks on it gently before moving onto the other one, alternating between sucking, kissing and licking them until I can't take any more pleasure from him without cumming.
 > 
 > "Please! Please fuck me now!" I beg, arching my back and thrusting myself into his face in an attempt to get closer to him. He looks up at me with a smile before pulling away from me slightly so that he can look into my eyes. "Are you sure?", he asks softly, stroking my hair gently.
 > 
 > I nod furiously and then pull him back down onto me so that our bodies are pressed tightly together again. He kisses me slowly but deeply as his hand goes between us to stroke my clit gently until it swells up even more than before. I moan loudly at the feel of his fingers stroking my sensitive spot while he continues kissing me.
 > 
 > "Oh God! Yes!" I scream out as he pushes a finger into me, followed by another one which is just as deep as the first one. He keeps moving it in and out while also playing with my clit with his fingers until I can no longer take it anymore. "Please, fuck me now!" I beg again, arching my back so that he has even more access to my body.
 > 
 > My boyfriend looks down at me for a moment before nodding slightly and then pushing himself inside of me slowly but
