 lie. 
 
 I have not always been this way; it was all born of jealousy and spite. 
 
 Once I was like you, until she came along to take my place. 
 
 I did not want to change, but I had no other choice. 
 
 If she could be what I am, then I could be something else. 
 
 Now I do not mind being what I am; it is a simple life after all. 
 
 It is easy to eat when you do not have to pay for the food. 
 
 And as long as you avoid direct sunlight, no one can hurt you. 
 
 I never wanted to change in the first place. I just wanted her to be happy.
 
 I cannot live with this guilt forever. 
 
 The cure is so near and yet so far.
