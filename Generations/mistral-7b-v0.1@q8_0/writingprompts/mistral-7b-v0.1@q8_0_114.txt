-screens to know what was happening. The ship had been hit hard by the enemy and they were boarding!

The crew were dead, he had seen to that himself but it didn’t matter now, all that mattered was getting the data out safely. He activated the ships last remaining shuttle and entered his access code into the systems to release the data files. The information was so vital to him that he would rather die than have them get in enemy hands.

He looked around the bridge again. All was quiet now, no life signs anywhere. He checked the status of the ship one last time as he grabbed a bottle from the liquor locker and took a long swig. The shuttle launch system was armed and ready but there were too many enemy vessels outside to make a run for it, he needed to get the files out of here before the enemy got their hands on them. He picked up the bottles again and finished them off in one swift gulp.

It didn’t matter anymore what happened now, he was about to die anyway.

He activated the self-destruct system, the timer would not reach zero for another 6 minutes and 45 seconds but it was enough time for him to get away with the data files. He grabbed his flight jacket off the hook and headed for the shuttle bay.
