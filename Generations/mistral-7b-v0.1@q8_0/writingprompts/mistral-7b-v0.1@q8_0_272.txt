20-20 vision seems like a perk when you’re trying to figure out if you’ve been abducted by aliens.

The room seemed very familiar… I looked around and recognized it as the main hall of the castle, from where I lived with my mother and father. My heart rate picked up significantly, and I started feeling dizzy. This wasn’t a dream… this was real!

I took a few seconds to compose myself, and then got up on shaky legs. I slowly walked toward the balcony railing, and looked down at the courtyard below. “My God,” I said, out loud, “that’s my dad.” He was walking around, inspecting his domain, or maybe just making sure nobody had broken into the castle while he was gone. I took a few more seconds to compose myself, then yelled, “Dad!”

He looked up and smiled. It was a genuine smile… not the kind you give someone when you’re about to tell them their pet has been found dead in the street. “I see that my little girl is all grown up,” he said with a laugh, as he approached me.

“Where am I?” I asked, unable to hide my disbelief.

He shook his head and chuckled. “Oh dear, you’ve lost your memory again…”

My heart sank… I was back in the castle.
