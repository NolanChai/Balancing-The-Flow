A man walked across the threshold and looked up to the posters that showed happy people with bright smiles on their faces, or images of war, tanks rolling across fields and planes bombing cities. “I remember the old days when this room was filled with hope,” he said to himself as he sat down in front of the bed. He picked up the black t shirt, turned it over in his hands several times. The back of the t shirt was covered in writing and images that were barely visible.

The man looked out into the yard outside the window. It was a hot, clear summer morning with not a cloud in sight, but he felt cold. He shivered slightly.

“I’ve come home to bury my son,” he said softly and put the shirt over his head and pulled it down to cover him as best he could.

The man was dressed in a tuxedo that looked like it was made for a much larger person than himself. He sat in the back of an old Buick with his wife and his two daughters. It was a cold, dreary day with dark clouds covering the sky. The car pulled up to a huge house with dozens of cars parked in front.

The man turned to his wife as they got out of the car. “It’s so quiet here,” he said as they walked toward the house. “I don’t remember it being like this.”

They were led into a large room with two long tables set up for the buffet. There was no music or other noise in the room, just the sound of people whispering and the occasional sniffle. The man looked around, trying to find someone he knew. He saw a young woman sitting by herself at one end of a table. She seemed lost in her own thoughts.

The man walked over to her and stood behind her chair. “Excuse me,” he said quietly. “I don’t know if you remember me, but I went to high school with your son.” The woman turned around slowly and looked at him for a moment before recognizing him. She smiled faintly and nodded.

The man sat down across from her and reached out to shake her hand. “It’s good to see you again,” he said softly. They sat in silence for a few moments, both lost in their own thoughts. The man finally broke the silence by asking, “Do you remember what he was like? He always seemed so happy.”

The woman nodded. “He had such a big smile,” she said quietly. “It’s hard to believe he’s gone.” She began to cry and the man put his arm around her shoulders. They sat in silence for several minutes before the woman finally spoke again.

“I never thought it would be like this,” she said softly. “He was always so full of life, but I guess that’s what happens when you die.” The man nodded silently and they continued to sit there, lost in their thoughts. Finally, the woman stood up and said, “Excuse me for a moment.” She walked away from the table and into one of the side rooms off the main hall.

The man watched her as she disappeared into the room. After a few minutes he got up and followed her, hoping to comfort her in some way. When he entered the room, he saw that it was a small chapel with pews lining both sides of an aisle leading up to an altar. There were candles burning on either side of the altar and a cross hanging from the ceiling above it.

The woman had already taken her seat in one of the pews at the back of the room. She turned to look at him as he entered and nodded slightly before turning away again. The man took a seat next to her and they sat in silence for several minutes before she finally spoke again. “It’s hard to believe he’s gone,” she said quietly. “He was always so full of life.”
