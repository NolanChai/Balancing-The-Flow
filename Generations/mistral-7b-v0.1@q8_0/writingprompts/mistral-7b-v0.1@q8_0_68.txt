 monsters, something new, but still too close to being a weapon.

They are also the last hope for humanity. The world is dying and there's nothing that can save it, so they need someone who can kill. They don't ask questions about why you have no soul, or why your body doesn't age. They don't care where your allegiance lies because in their world there's only one goal: to survive, but at what price?

This is a dark tale of demons, angels, war and love that will change the fate of humanity forever.
