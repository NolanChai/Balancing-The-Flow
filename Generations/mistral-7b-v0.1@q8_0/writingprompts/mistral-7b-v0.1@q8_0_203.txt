 into my mind and stealing my thoughts. Now the site owners are laughing their heads off at me while I click on each ad in the hopes that maybe it will send me somewhere else - somewhere not so embarrassing!

I had to laugh too. My boyfriend was looking over my shoulder as I clicked on ads, one after another.

`` What a dork!'' he said. `` Why don't you try to find something interesting? You know, like this stuff you always tell me about: the new books, movies and music that I never would have heard of otherwise.''

He had a point. So I deleted the app and fired up my laptop instead, logging onto Amazon.com and browsing through the books they recommended. It was interesting to see what they chose for me, but it was no substitute for the ads on the site where I could click away until I found something that interested me.

I wish someone had told me this when I first got a computer: There is no substitute for real browsing. But I'm not complaining; after all, it keeps my boyfriend coming back to see what's new.
