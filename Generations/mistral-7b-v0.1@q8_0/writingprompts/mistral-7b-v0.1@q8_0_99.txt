igs that were on my table at the time.

As I ran out of the building, I saw hundreds of people running, screaming, panicking… and then, I realized it was a drill. Somewhere along the way, I lost track of the pigs in my arms, and never found them again. But there’s no sense in dwelling on the past; all I can do is move forward from this point.

The most important thing now is that I have to get back to work. All those people who lost their lives – they weren’t doing any work before they died, were they? And when people are dying all over the place and you’re just sitting there watching it happen, what kind of job are you doing anyway?

I mean, if I wasn’t at work today because I was too busy mourning for those poor souls who died in the fire drill (and there are probably more than one), then somebody else would have had to do my job. And they would have been just as stressed out as I am now because they wouldn’t know how much longer their jobs were going to last before someone else took them over again!

The most important thing is that we all get back to work tomorrow morning – even if it means showing up late or missing the first hour of business. Because if everyone shows up early and on time tomorrow, then there will be no one left behind who needs our help when things go wrong again next week…and the week after that…

I am going to work because my job is important and because I know that if I don’t do it, someone else will. I am going to work because I want to make a difference in this world by doing something meaningful for others. I am going to work because I enjoy helping people.

I am going to work today because tomorrow will never come unless we all put our hearts and minds into what matters most: the lives of those who need our help, love and support more than anything else right now.
