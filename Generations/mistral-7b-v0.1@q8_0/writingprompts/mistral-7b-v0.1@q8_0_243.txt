inker around with things that I find interesting.

There is no real name for my shop. It does not matter much really, as long as people know where to go when they need something fixed. Most of the items in my shop are mundane: bolts, screws, hammers, tools, and a few toys. I do have some things that are less mundane such as an enchanted axe and a handmade mirror.

There is no particular style to my shop, it just looks like a lot of stuff piled up against the wall in a dark corner. The door is always open unless I am sleeping.
