3158 karma from a single comment, I think, but I can’t really be bothered to find out.

The next day I checked back and noticed I had only -4k, so maybe someone was getting to me. The next day I had gained 6k and they were still getting to me. The third day I checked at work, so I couldn’t do much about it. It was now down to -2300 or something and still going down.

I didn’t know what they were doing or how they were doing it, but I had a pretty good idea and it didn’t seem worth the effort to figure it out because nothing could be done about it anyway. It’s not like Reddit admins are going to investigate an isolated incident of downvoting in r/funny.

I was tempted to get petty, but I couldn’t bring myself to do something so low as trying to manipulate someone else’s karma with my own or even reporting it as harassment (because Reddit doesn’t care about that shit anyway). So I did the only thing I could think of: I posted a picture of an angry cat and some people upvoted it, which was kind of funny.

So I didn’t get my karma back, but at least I got to see someone else get downvoted for no reason by random people.

This is why I love the internet.
