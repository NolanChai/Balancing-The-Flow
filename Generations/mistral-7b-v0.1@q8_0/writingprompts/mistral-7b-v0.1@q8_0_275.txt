   He looked at her as if he was admiring an old master painting.
“It’s a birthmark.  It means something special to me,” she said.
“What does it mean?” He asked in a slow tone.
“A memory of my childhood,” She replied.
She felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up at his touch and every time he spoke. The room seemed to spin as if it was going in circles, and she couldn’t stop the smile from spreading across her face. She could hear her heart pounding so loud that it almost hurt.
Anna felt her body react to Jacob’s presence, it was like a magnet pulling them closer together.  She wanted him to get even closer to her, to feel the warmth of his hands on her bare skin.  But she didn ’ t know if he would want more than what they had.
“Jacob, you are an amazing man and I wish we could spend the rest of our lives together.   We have a lot in common and a lot that is different, but it doesn’t matter because we love each other so much,”  Anna whispered to him as he lay beside her on their king size bed.
“I feel exactly the same way about you, ” Jacob said with tears in his eyes.   “ I never want to let you go.”   He pulled her into a hug that made her whole body melt against him.  She had never felt so loved by anyone before in her life and she knew this was right for both of them.
“I love you,” he said again and kissed Anna softly on her lips.
