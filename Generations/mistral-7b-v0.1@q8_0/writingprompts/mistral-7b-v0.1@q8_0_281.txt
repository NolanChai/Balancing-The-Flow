o- you know when you get older and look back on things and think 'Oh what an idiot'? And I did that. And I said to myself 'I have to stop doing this'. And it wasn't really my fault - it was because of Mike that I had to go through that, I mean... 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 When Ariel was a kid and we lived in New Jersey I remember this one time we were all together as a family and Ariel did this thing. It was at Thanksgiving I think it was when we were at my Aunt's house, which is just a big old Victorian house with these little rooms off the stairwell. There was a door in between them, I don't know why that room had a door on it, it doesn't make sense, but there was one and Ariel - this is when we were still little, I remember this very vividly - went through the door and we all heard this huge crash. And we thought Ariel had just slammed the door behind him so he wouldn't get hurt. But he didn't do that, what he did was he jumped off the stairs. He took two steps down and then just jumped off. 
 
 So my uncle went to look for him and he wasn't in the room where we thought he would be, but we found out he had actually fallen down into this weird little hole that was between the walls of these rooms. And we were really scared, I mean he could have died. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 He didn't die. And there wasn't much you could do. We just took him to hospital and it turned out he had a broken arm or something and that was the end of it. But for me, my parents got divorced at that point. They were always getting divorced then I think, but it was the most recent divorce that we went through when we were in New Jersey, and this is a time when I remember Ariel being kind of... not crazy, but I mean he had a lot of anger, you know? 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah. And he would run away all the time - for weeks at a time. My mom was really worried about him. But he always came back. He didn't have many friends, I remember we were in this little neighbourhood and there was one friend that he had, but then my parents moved us to New Jersey and Ariel... 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh God it's so funny when you look back on it. We were just kids and everything seemed like a big deal. I mean I remember when we moved to this new town I went over to this little boy's house who lived on my street, we'll call him...
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Billy
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah, I can't even remember his real name. But anyway he was there with his parents and he came out to the door and said 'Hi! What's your name?' and I just couldn't say it. My name was...I don't know how to explain this but it was really complicated. I think my middle name started with a Z, I think it was something like Zachary. I don't know why my parents named me that. 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 It was something he liked! His grandmother or something had an old English name and she loved the idea of giving her grandson this amazingly complicated name. He had some weird ideas about naming kids, I remember that. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah but anyway I couldn't tell this boy my name because it was so long and I didn't want to say it out loud. So I just said 'Hi!' And then I started to walk away really quickly. This little kid went inside the house, came back with a baseball bat, and chased me down the street. I thought he was going to hurt me so I ran into the woods behind our houses. 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 You were only six years old! What are you doing out in the woods? Why would you go there? 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 It was a big deal to me then, it didn't seem like anything now - but I thought I could get lost and nobody would ever find me. And my parents were always telling me not to do that, you know - don't go into the woods! But this time I actually went in there and stayed for a few days. 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Oh God. What did your parents say when they found out? 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 They were really angry. It wasn't very nice. I think it made them realise they had to take better care of me, you know? And after that I was always kind of afraid of my parents because they would get angry with me sometimes. So I guess I needed an outlet. That's when I started to get into this thing where I would do these weird little rituals. 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah, he used to do really weird stuff. He'd run away all the time and then come back, but we couldn't understand why he was so afraid of his parents or anything like that. And then I think after Ariel moved out on his own for good there was this point when Mike got really...he didn't seem to be himself anymore, you know? It was scary because you don't know what he's going through - and then suddenly it hits you that he's not acting like himself at all. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh God, it was horrible. I mean, there were these times when I would just come home from school and find Mike in the hallway with this weird look on his face. He would be staring into space or something like that - and then he'd say 'I can't do anything right'. And you know what? It's true! He couldn't do anything right, not even if his life depended on it! He was just this angry, frustrated mess of a kid. 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah but we were always there for him...I remember one time when Ariel had to go into surgery and my mom told me that she was going to have to be away from home for a few days, so I volunteered to stay with him until his parents got back. And we had such a good time together - it felt like he really needed someone there who would listen to him and give him attention or whatever it was he wanted. So we just hung out, played games, watched movies...it was great! But after that he never seemed quite so...normal again, you know? 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah, it's true - I mean Mike was always the responsible one in our family. And I guess I got a little too used to his attention when we were younger, so once he started getting older and I didn't need him anymore, that was when things became really weird for me. Like, what was I supposed to do with myself? 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Well you know how it is when you grow up, right? You start having these different interests and hobbies - some kids want to be musicians or artists or whatever - but for Ariel there were only two things that really interested him. And those were...well, you might not believe this but they were both kind of weird! 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 I was really into...this isn't going to sound cool at all...but I was really into Pokemon cards. That's what I would collect and trade with my friends - that's all I did for a while there. And then later on, when I was about fourteen years old, is when the real trouble started... 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah, it wasn't like he just randomly found out about this stuff or anything - it seems like Ariel has always had this really weird fascination with...weird things. And that includes horror movies and stuff like that. He would watch them all the time and get so into them! But when we were younger our parents weren't too happy about us watching those kinds of movies so we tried not to do it very often or anything like that, but then one day Ariel found out about this website where you can download horror movies for free online. 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh God...that was when everything went downhill really fast! I mean, I know my parents would have freaked out if they ever knew what we were doing - but there was no way to stop myself from watching those things because it had become such an obsession for me. I would stay up all night just watching these movies and then go to school in the morning and try not to fall asleep during class! 
 
 **Mike** 
 
 Yeah, it got so bad that Ariel was actually starting to show up at school with his hair all messed up because he hadn't had time to wash it or anything like that. And then one day we were walking home from school and I saw this little girl standing on the sidewalk - she looked pretty upset about something but I didn't really know what was going on so I just walked by her without even saying anything!
