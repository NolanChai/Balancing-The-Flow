ously proud man; however, in the moment there was nothing more than the pain and fear that radiated through him.

With a hand on his hip, he lifted himself from one foot to the other. The weight of his body pressed his eyes downward towards the dirt floor below. He stopped. A small spider hung from the edge of his boot, suspended by her web. It was then when he noticed the first thing: blood dripping from his arm. He looked up and saw another thing: a freshly severed arm hanging from a tree branch overheard. His mind raced with questions that he did not know how to answer; so he moved on.

He walked until he came to the edge of a clearing. There was a small pond in its center, ringed by grass. A large tree grew beside it, its branches draping over the water. He saw something else: another arm, this time attached to a body that hung from a branch above him. It was then that he felt the next thing: someone behind him, watching his every move.
