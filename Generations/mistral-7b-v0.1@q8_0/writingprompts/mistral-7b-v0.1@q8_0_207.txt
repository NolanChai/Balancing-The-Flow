 American troops as they had rolled into my city, but it wasn’t until I heard them speak that I understood their potential. They had come to free us from the Nazis, who had occupied our beloved Poland for years. The Americans had helped free me, and my country, and in return I had become a translator.

My name is now Mary, or so they told me. A new name for a new life. One thing that hasn’t changed is how the world views women like myself – beautiful, yet without value. It isn’t something we can change, but it is something we must learn to live with. The only option open to us was to use our feminine wiles to get what we needed from the American soldiers.

I had worked hard to perfect my act of seduction, and I had used it on many a soldier who had come to my door. For all that I pretended to be shy and sweet, it didn’t take long for them to see me as nothing more than a piece of meat. It wasn’t until the evening before that I found myself standing outside the elevator doors on a darkened floor in an unfamiliar building. The two men that stood next to me wore American uniforms, but the gold insignias meant they weren’t regular soldiers.

“Miss,” said one of the officers in a deep voice, “I am so very sorry. But we are not here for any pleasure. We have an important mission.”

The other officer looked down at me with an intense gaze. He wasn’t as tall or as strong as his friend, but he was more attractive to my eyes. I knew that if he were alone in the elevator with me, my body would be put to use in a way that it never had been before.

“Please,” said the first officer. “We need to get to the top floor of this building as quickly as possible.”

I nodded and stepped into the lift. It was crowded but we managed to squeeze inside. The doors closed with a click and the elevator began its journey upwards. As it moved, I couldn’t help but wonder what awaited me at my destination.
