acks through me, I can only think of one thing: the piles and piles of unpaid bills I leave behind. My family, once a respectable middle-class unit, will have to go down in history as debtors. I’m sure there’s some kind of tax write-off for that, but it doesn ’ t help me right now.

I look up at the ceiling and see what was once a light fixture but is now just an empty socket with wires hanging down from it. The nurse told me not to worry about these details; she said they would come back. I think she was lying, because as soon as I ’ m dead the room will become haunted. The lights will flicker and there will be strange noises in the night. She probably has her own house full of ghosts to deal with.

I try not to think about that either because it gives me more bad feelings than good ones at this point, but I can’t stop my mind from wandering off into places like that sometimes when all else fails. It is hard for me because what makes an illness so terrible are its effects on the people around you rather than just yourself alone; how your life has been changed by something beyond your control – whether it be physical or mental – will leave scars behind long after treatment ends (and even then those scars may never fully heal).

I look at my hands, which were once strong and capable but now tremble with the power of a child’s. I try to move them, but they won ’ t respond. They are cold, clammy and useless as if I am no longer in control of what happens next – only someone else can decide that for me. My body feels heavy as I try to lift it off the bed; it ’ s a struggle not to fall back into oblivion once again.

I look up at the ceiling and see what was once a light fixture but is now just an empty socket with wires hanging down from it – reminders of things that have been taken away from me, like my independence or sense of self-worth; things which cannot be replaced by anything else because they were unique to who I am as an individual person…

I think about how much harder life will become without those things in place anymore. Will people still love me? Or will they look at me with pity and disdain for what has happened to me – even though I didn’t cause it myself?

My mind races through a thousand thoughts at once, each one vying for its place on the stage of my consciousness before being replaced by another thought just as quickly. It is like watching a movie that never ends; no matter how hard I try, there is always another scene to play out in front of me. Some scenes are happy and some sad – but all of them leave an indelible mark upon my soul.

The nurse comes back into the room with her clipboard full of paperwork she needs me to sign before she can let me go home from this place. I don’t understand why she won’t just do it herself because I’m too weak right now, but maybe she wants me here so that someone will take care of me when they need me most…

I look at the nurse as she stands there with her clipboard full of paperwork she needs me to sign before she can let me go home from this place. I don’t understand why she won’t just do it herself because I’m too weak right now, but maybe she wants me here so that someone will take care of me when they need me most…

My heart is racing with fear and excitement all at once; I am both terrified by what might happen next and hopeful that this is finally the end – or at least a beginning to something better than where we are now.
