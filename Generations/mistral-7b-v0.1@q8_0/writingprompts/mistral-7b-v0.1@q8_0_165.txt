 Farmington Hills and south 
 Of West Bloomfield and Livonia, 
 
 Where a new highway was built, 
 With the funds from the Fed, 
 But no one will travel that road, 
 Because there's nothing there, instead. 
 
 It is the land of lost dreams 
 And hopes that never were, 
 All they left behind when they came, 
 Were tears and old beer cans.
 
 And you can see the ghostly trace 
 Of a life long gone by, 
 As an empty house in the trees stands, 
 Where there used to be a family.

I have driven through this area many times.  It has some nice parks.
