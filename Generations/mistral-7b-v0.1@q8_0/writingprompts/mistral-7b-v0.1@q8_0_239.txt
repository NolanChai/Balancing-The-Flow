 The armor was good. It was heavy and solid, but he could feel the power radiating out from it. His armor, that's what this is for. But no, this wasn't what he had come here to find. He knew that. He just couldn't remember why.
 
 "You there! You look strong!"
 
 He spun around to face a dwarf who looked like he was ready to throw down any moment.
 
 "I am looking for something. Something powerful."
 
 The dwarf held out his hands as if he were offering some sort of treasure. 
 
 "The power of the Mountain is in your hands, lad. If you're brave enough to wield it."
 
 "This is not what I am looking for," the young warrior said. He turned away from the dwarf and went back into the dark hall.
 
 "Wait!" called the dwarf, but the young man was gone before he could even make his way out of the chamber. He sighed. It was time to go find some new armor for this fool. Maybe he'd have more luck with the other one.
