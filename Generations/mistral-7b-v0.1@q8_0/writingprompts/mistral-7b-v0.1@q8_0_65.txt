ck? So, what happened? 
  
 I was playing a match online with someone and he said some really ugly things to me in chat after losing. Now, I don't know if that's just because we were fighting a close match or if it's because he was trying to get into my head but I think I'd like to hear from the rest of you how you react in similar situations and what your thoughts on this are. 
  
 Are you going to take any kind of abuse and then just ignore it?
 Are you going to give as good as you get or more?
 
 Is there a certain point where you think, `hey...I'm not going to respond because I don't want to get banned'?
  
 What is your reaction when someone starts talking smack to you online. Do you feel that they are trying to distract you from playing the game or do you just shrug it off as one of those things and go on your way?
User 6: I always ignore them. If a player has to stoop to trash talk then I know he's probably not very good. I don't even bother looking at what they say anymore, and if someone starts talking to me like that, I just mute him. It really does get on my nerves and takes away from the enjoyment of the game.
User 15: > If a player has to stoop to trash talk then I know he's probably not very good

Not necessarily true at all, actually. Some people do it because they're bored or to provoke you, but some people who are very skilled will talk trash if they think it will unnerve you and make you play worse. 

If someone is talking smack, chances are that he thinks that it makes him better, so the chances of beating him might actually be greater than playing against an equal player with no talking.
User 6: I don't believe that trash talk makes you better. That person probably thinks they are good, but if they were truly good they wouldn't need to say anything to distract their opponent. 

It doesn't take away from my enjoyment of the game to mute them and play against them without all the smack talk, so why would I let someone ruin my experience?
