ken a cage than a room. 
 
 We were the guinea pigs, the test subjects, for a new and dangerous drug that we had been administered. It was called 'The Serum', and it was suppose to make you stronger. To allow you to survive in any conditions. But I didn't believe that. 
 
 The Serum had killed a few of us. They were gone, just like that. 
 
 And now only ten of us remained, living our miserable lives behind closed walls. 
 
 We could talk to each other through the air vents, but it was not enough. I wanted out, I wanted to see my friends and family again! It had been months since I last saw a single person who wasn't part of this experiment. 
 
 One day, while we were talking to each other, one of the researchers came in. He was talking loudly into a microphone, probably talking with someone on the other side of it. 
 
 Then he suddenly stopped and looked at us through the vents, his eyes narrowed. 
 
 "They're ready", he said to whoever he had been talking to earlier. We all froze. Were they going to test us? How were they going to do that?
 
 I felt like screaming, but I didn't know what would happen if I did. So I kept silent as the researcher left.
 
 An hour later, there was a knock on my door. I didn't answer it, instead just sat in my chair. It knocked again and this time I heard footsteps come closer. The door opened, and I saw that it was one of the researchers, but he wasn't alone. He had two other men with him, and all three were holding guns. 
 
 "I'm sorry, but you have to come with us", the researcher said. 
 
 My heart started pounding in my chest and I could feel sweat beading on my forehead. What was going on? Why did they need me?
 
 "Please, just let me stay here." But I knew that wouldn't happen. They took me out of the room and into a small elevator. When we got to the top floor, they pushed me into a large room filled with computers and screens. 
 
 There were only two other people in there; another researcher and another man who looked just like him. He wore an armored suit that had some sort of helmet on it too! 
 
 "What do you want from me?" I asked, but they didn't answer me. Instead the researcher put something around my neck; it felt like a collar or something similar to it. It was made out of metal and had wires coming off of it that went into one side of his computer screen! 
 
 "What is this?" I asked again, but they still didn't answer me. All three men just stood there staring at me as if waiting for something to happen.
 
 Suddenly, the researcher hit a button on his keyboard and I felt an electric shock go through my body. It hurt so bad that tears started running down my face. 
 
 "Stop!" I screamed. "Please, stop! You're hurting me!" But they didn't listen. They just kept looking at me as if they enjoyed what they were doing to me! The researcher hit another button on his keyboard and this time I felt something warm and sticky run down my leg. 
 
 When I looked down, there was blood everywhere! I started crying again as more pain shot through my body and I fell to the ground. 
 
 "You're done", said one of the men in an armored suit. "Let's go." And they all left without another word.
 
 They didn't even bother to close the door behind them! I was left there on the cold floor, crying and bleeding. It had been hours since any of the researchers had come back to check on me, so I knew that they weren't coming back anytime soon. 
 
 But then something strange happened; someone opened up one of the doors in the room and a group of soldiers came inside! They were all armed with guns and looked very serious as they walked towards me. 
 
 One soldier bent down next to me and said "It's okay, you don't need to be scared. We're here to help." I couldn't believe my ears; these men weren't part of the experiment! They were actually trying to save me? 
 
 They helped me up onto their shoulders and carried me out of the room. The rest of the soldiers followed behind us as we made our way downstairs towards an elevator. 
 
 We got into it and pressed a button, but then all of sudden there was another electric shock that went through my body! I screamed in pain as they pushed me against the wall and took off my collar. It seemed like they were going to kill me after all! But they didn't; instead, they just hit another button on their keyboard and the elevator doors opened up to reveal a large room filled with more soldiers.
 
 "Take him to the medical bay!" one of them yelled as I was dragged away from them by two men in armored suits. The door closed behind me and suddenly there was another electric shock! This time it hurt even worse than before, but thankfully it didn't last too long.
 
 They took off my collar again and this time when they did so a doctor came over with a syringe filled with something clear liquid in it. He injected it into me without saying anything at all; not even "I'm sorry" or anything like that. 
 
 I felt weak after that, but somehow I managed to stand up on my own two feet again. The doctor led me out of the room and through a maze-like series of hallways until we reached another elevator that took us back upstairs. It was then that he gave me some water and told me to drink it quickly before giving me an injection in my neck which made me fall asleep immediately afterwards.
 
 The next thing I knew, I had been taken out of the elevator by two more men wearing armor suits who dragged me into another room where they removed my collar once again without saying anything at all. 
 
 This time there wasn't any electric shock though; instead, these guys gave me something that tasted awful but made me feel much better almost immediately afterwards! Then one of them took off their helmet and said "You're safe now." It was then that I realized these were the same two men who had helped me escape from the experiment room earlier. 
 
 They didn't say anything else after that, just left me in peace until I was fully healed again. After that they took off their armor suits and told me they would come back for me later on once things had calmed down a bit more inside this building where we were at now. And so they did; eventually I woke up again inside another room with no doors or windows but lots of different medical equipment scattered around it everywhere! It turned out this was actually one of those laboratories that people go into when they're being experimented on by scientists who want to study how their bodies work under certain conditions such as extreme heat/coldness etc..
 
 The two men from earlier came back in and told me they had found some clothes for me to wear while I waited here until everything got sorted out outside with those researchers who were trying to kill me earlier today! Then one of them gave me another injection which made me fall asleep once again before taking off his helmet so we could talk again later on..
 
 When I woke up next, the same thing happened all over again - except this time there weren't any soldiers around anymore (at least not ones wearing armor suits anyway). Instead, I was just lying on a bed with no one else around me anywhere except for some kind of computer terminal thing that kept beeping every now and then while it recorded what was happening outside through its camera lenses or something like that...
 
 At first, I didn't know what was going on because everything seemed so weird and out-of-place; like an illusion or dream maybe? But eventually things started to become clearer as time went by (even though it felt like forever). The two men from earlier had returned again - only now they weren't wearing any armor suits anymore but instead were just wearing normal clothes instead. 
 
 "So are you ready?" asked one of them. I nodded my head and said "I guess so." He then handed me a pair of sunglasses which helped protect my eyes from the bright sunlight outside before leading us both out through another door into what looked like some kind of hallway or something?
 
 There were other people there too - all wearing different kinds of clothes depending on where they worked (for example: scientists wore lab coats while soldiers had on armor suits). But most importantly, none of them were trying to kill me like those researchers back at the laboratory had been doing earlier today! So I knew everything was going to be okay now..
 
 After walking around for a bit more we finally reached another elevator that took us down several levels until we got into some kind of control room where there was an older man sitting behind a desk who looked like he was in charge here. He introduced himself as "Dr Smith" before telling me everything was going to be okay now - even though things had gotten pretty crazy earlier today with all those scientists trying to kill us! But thanks to these guys I survived
