 be an excellent evening.

My husband arrived home with his briefcase, and I asked him if he’d like anything from the kitchen. He didn’t answer, but just came into the sitting room. Settling down beside me on the couch, he put one arm around my shoulders, and kissed me passionately on the lips.

‘Are you feeling all right?’ I asked, stroking his hair. ‘You know there is a doctor available at any time.’

‘No, no,’ he said. He sat up and looked me straight in the eye. ‘I just wanted to thank you for the most wonderful birthday surprise you have ever given me. A house full of people, and all my friends there! I don’t know how you arranged it, but it was just perfect.’

‘I did it because I love you so much,’ I said. He gave me another kiss and stood up. ‘Have a good evening, darling, and enjoy the party.’ With that he left the room.
