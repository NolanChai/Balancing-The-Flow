 me, it must be the past. I looked around and saw what seemed to be a boy of no more than ten years old walking towards me.

“Hello,” he said, “my name is Michael.”

“My name is James,” I replied, not knowing quite how to continue, “and you look like my little brother, who has a name that also begins with M. And yes, he’s from this time period.”

“That’s weird,” he said, looking confused.

“Yeah, it’s very confusing,” I said, standing up and dusting myself off. “Where is everyone?”

“What do you mean?” Michael asked.

“I don’t see anyone else around,” I replied, walking a little further into the town, “there are no houses or cars… just farmland.”

“Oh,” he said, “you must be from the future. The city is a few miles down the road.” He motioned with his head to follow him.

I followed Michael and saw what appeared to be an old barn. It looked like it hadn’t been used in many years but it was the only cover I could see. I walked into the barn, following the boy and sat on a bale of hay.

“Welcome,” said the man who had stepped out from behind the bales. He seemed to be in his mid twenties and had a large, gaping hole in the front of his shirt. His jeans were ripped, exposing his leg, and one of his arms was covered in blood. “My name is Michael.”

I stared at him for a moment then looked back at my little brother who smiled brightly. I sat up straight and smiled back, “it’s nice to meet you too. My name is James. I came from the future but I don’t remember how…”

“The same way we all do,” the man said with a grin, “by being stupid enough to believe in time travel.” He laughed as if this were an everyday occurrence for him.

I sat there, confused and speechless. This was not what I had expected. How could he be so happy? What did it take to become so carefree?
