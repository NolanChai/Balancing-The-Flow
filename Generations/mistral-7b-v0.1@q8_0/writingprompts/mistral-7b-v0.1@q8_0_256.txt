â€¦

I paused and shook my head. No, I hadn't. Not this time at least.

Suddenly a small figure in the shadows caught my eye and I turned around.

"Julie? What are you doing up here?"

My little sister just stared back at me, wide eyes and her hair frizzy from sleep. She looked tired and scared and my heart sank as I realized she was alone.

I closed my eyes and sighed, "Okay, we'll go downstairs together."

When I turned around again, Julie was gone.
