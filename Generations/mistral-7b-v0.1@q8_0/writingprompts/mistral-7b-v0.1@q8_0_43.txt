irl of voices stopped mid-sentence at the sound of his voice.
``Thank you all for coming, especially on short notice.''

A few nods and mumbles of assent echoed about the room.

``Today, I have some bad news to share with you,'' Father Ricardo continued.

There was a pause as he let that sink in.

``Yesterday evening, I received word from my bishop that the Vatican has decided to reassign me.''

A few grumbles and murmurs rose up.

``I am disappointed to leave you, gentlemen,'' Father Ricardo went on. ``But I know that the Lord will take good care of all of you.''

``What does this mean for us?'' asked one of the men.

``Father Speranza is being sent in my place.''

Gasps and cries erupted among the men.

``The Vatican must be out of its mind to send Father Speranza here!'' someone shouted from the back.

``No need to worry, gentlemen,'' Father Ricardo said calmly. ``Father Speranza is a good man.''

``He's a pervert and a lunatic!'' another exclaimed. ``Do you want us to end up like those guys in Texas?''

The men began talking over each other, shouting their concerns about the new priest. Father Ricardo tried to speak above the din, but the noise grew louder until he gave up and sat down.

After several minutes of loud voices and angry words, Father Ricardo stood up again. 

``Gentlemen, please.'' He raised his voice until everyone fell silent. ``I understand your concerns, but I ask you to give Father Speranza a chance. Let him prove himself to you before you judge him.''

The men muttered and grumbled for a few more minutes, but eventually, they quieted down.

``Thank you, gentlemen,'' Father Ricardo said. ``Now, if you don't mind, I would like to say a prayer for all of us.''

As the men bowed their heads in silence, Father Ricardo prayed:

Dear Lord, we ask that you guide and protect Father Speranza as he takes on his new role. Help him to be a good and faithful shepherd to your flock. May your grace be with all of us in this time of change. Amen.
