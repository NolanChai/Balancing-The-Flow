Everyday, I think about why people act this way? What has become of our society?

And then, I realise that it’s not the users that are the problem. It’s those who have taken advantage of them. The social media giants that have manipulated us into thinking this is what we want and need to be doing with our lives.

The reason that I know this, is because I see these companies for what they really are: a bunch of overpaid corporate assholes, sitting in their ivory towers, coming up with new ways to manipulate your attention span, so that you click on one more ad.

It’s not your fault that you check your phone every 10 minutes, it’s the apps you are using. And guess what? Facebook isn’t the only one doing this. Every single app that is making money from ads, does this to you.

And when they tell us that they are protecting our privacy, they are lying. They may not be selling your data (yet), but they are tracking every movement and behaviour we make online and offline. And believe me, that information is more valuable than any of the things you put on their sites.

I’ve got news for you. The world will not collapse because you don’t have an account with them. You may lose your friends, but really? Do you want to hang out with people who don’t give a shit about you? If someone wants to talk to you, they will call or text you.

If we are all doing what we can to spread the message that our data and privacy is important, then hopefully one day we can take back control of the internet.

But until then, if I see another cat video, it’s going to be a cold day in hell before I hit that like button again.
