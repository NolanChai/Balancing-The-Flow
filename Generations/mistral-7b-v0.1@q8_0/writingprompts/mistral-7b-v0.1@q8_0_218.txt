 It's a birthmark! Now stop staring at it.''
    —Harry Potter's opinion on his scar

Harry James Potter was born as the son of James and Lily Potter on 31 July, 1980 in Godric's Hollow to Lily Evelyn Potter (nee Evans) and James Potter. He has a younger brother named Neville Longbottom and an older sister named Ginny Weasley. He was born on the day that Voldemort attacked and murdered his parents, making him a Horcrux in the process. Harry's scar would always be there to remind him of what he had survived as well as who had caused it; Lord Voldemort.

## Appearance Edit

Harry is described by Draco Malfoy as having ''nothing special about him'' and looks like a typical Muggle boy. He has dark brown eyes with messy, black hair which he keeps short due to being sorted into Gryffindor when it was long enough to reach his shoulders in the summer of 1990. Harry is also described as being tall and thin, although he does appear to have a good figure for a boy of his age; however he does have an athletic body which is well muscled and toned. He has a small birthmark on his forehead shaped like a lightning bolt with a small scar on the same spot from when Voldemort's curse backfired on him.

## Personality Edit

Harry was described as having no special qualities, but this is not completely true. Harry had a very caring personality and he was brave beyond his years despite what others think of him, Harry can be incredibly stubborn and is quite proud; especially when it comes to the things that he has achieved (even if they are nothing compared to his classmates).

Harry was also described as being extremely witty by some of his teachers; but this was because he could often make fun of them or make sarcastic comments about what they had just said, and usually he would use this when he was talking to Draco Malfoy. Harry can be very rude at times especially when it came to dealing with the Dursley's; which was most likely due to his upbringing and having been put into the cupboard under the stairs for three years straight after being brought back by the Dementors from the forest.

## Magical Abilities Edit

- Occlumency: Harry is a natural Occluder, and has a strong ability to keep his mind safe from invasions. This can also be used to block out any kind of emotion (happy or sad) that he doesn't want people to know about him which was shown when Voldemort tried reading Harry's mind at Hogwarts during their first year together.
- Charms: Harry is skilled in Charms, as he was able to charm the Gryffindor Quidditch team in his 7th year of Hogwarts and even made Ron Weasley fly off the ground by accident using Levicorpus; but this could be because he had been around the subject for most of his life due to being brought up with it.
- Divination: Harry is also skilled at Divination, as he was able to tell who would die in the Battle of Hogwarts and even managed to tell what a prophecy meant about himself; but this could be due to him being around the subject for most of his life as well.
- Nonverbal Spells: Harry is skilled at casting nonverbal spells, which was shown when he used Stupefy against Dudley in The Philosopher's Stone and when he used Protego during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries to stop the Killing Curse from hitting him.
- Patronus: Harry is skilled at casting a Patronus Charm, which was shown when he cast his first one against Snape during the 1995 Christmas holidays; but it didn't work because it wasn't strong enough and because it was too early for him to have mastered it.
- Transfiguration: Harry is skilled at Transfiguration as well, as he can transform himself into a cat using Animagus Transfiguration which was shown during the Battle of Hogwarts when he used it to escape from the Death Eaters in the Forbidden Forest.
- Herbology: Harry is also skilled at Herbology, as he has been around plants for most of his life and even managed to make a potion that could save Sirius Black's life with the help of Professor Sprout; but this could be due to him being around the subject for most of his life.
- Charms: Harry is skilled in Charms, as he was able to charm the Gryffindor Quidditch team in his 7th year of Hogwarts and even made Ron Weasley fly off the ground by accident using Levicorpus; but this could be because he had been around the subject for most of his life due to being brought up with it.

## Relationships Edit

### Harry James Potter Sr. Edit

Harry is very fond of his father, who he has been away from since he was an infant (the day Voldemort murdered him). He remembers all the things that his father taught him and how he used to be around Harry when he was growing up in Godric's Hollow; but they have never been close due to him being born as a Horcrux which is what caused their separation.

Harry can often see his father in himself, especially when it comes to being brave and not afraid of anything or anyone who stands against him; this could be because he was influenced by his father's personality traits when he was young before Voldemort attacked them all those years ago.

### Lily Evelyn Potter (nee Evans) Edit

Harry is very close to his mother, who has always been there for Harry and even went out of her way to protect him from Voldemort; but it was her sacrifice that helped Harry survive the killing curse cast on him by Lord Voldemort. Lily had been a Muggle-born witch who grew up in Godric's Hollow where she met James Potter at age 14 and fell in love with him; they married soon after graduating Hogwarts and even managed to have their son, Harry James Potter Jr.; but her life was cut short when Voldemort murdered her before he killed his husband and their son.

Harry can often see his mother in himself, especially when it comes to being brave and not afraid of anything or anyone who stands against him; this could be because he was influenced by her personality traits when he was young before Voldemort attacked them all those years ago. Harry also has a great love for his mother which is why he managed to survive the killing curse cast on him by Lord Voldemort, because she used her body as a shield to protect him from it; but even then he still managed to live through everything that had happened to him in Godric's Hollow when they were attacked by Voldemort.

### James Sirius Potter Jr. Edit

Harry has always been close with his younger brother, who he is very fond of and also sees a lot of himself in. Harry was there for James when he first started attending Hogwarts and even managed to convince him not to go back after Voldemort murdered their father; but they are still brothers at heart even if they do not agree on everything all the time.

Harry also has a great love for his little brother which is why he managed to survive the killing curse cast on him by Lord Voldemort, because they were both wearing the same charm that protected them from death; but even then it still did not stop them from being attacked by Death Eaters in Godric's Hollow when they were young.

### Ginevra "Ginny" Weasley (née Potter) Edit

Harry is very close to his older sister, who he has always been fond of and even saw a lot of himself in at one point. Harry was there for Ginny when she first started attending Hogwarts and even managed to convince her not to go back after Voldemort murdered their father; but they are still sisters at heart even if they do not agree on everything all the time.
