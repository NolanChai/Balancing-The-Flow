 Until they wear out. 
 And, you hope, then, that there will come 
 A different clock that is better at keeping time. 
 But no clock can change their ticking. 
 It goes on and on and on.
 
   The first poem was written on January 24th, 2017.

I was still in high school when this was written. I had a crush on a boy named Josh. I wanted to ask him out so badly but I could never find the words to say it. So instead, I wrote him poetry and passed him my notes.
