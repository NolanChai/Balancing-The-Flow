 to stand up. 
 
 I was in an office space somewhere. There were several others around me as well. 
 
 There was someone else there. ``You are the one who saved the world,'' he said, `` and you have been given this gift for your trouble.'' 
 
 What does that even mean? 
 
 I couldn't even remember my name.
``Your memory has been wiped as part of a rehabilitation process,'' He explained, `` This is so we can be certain that the world you return to will be the same world you left.''
``Huh?'' I asked.
``Your mind is linked to a device that stores all the knowledge it holds now. In order to restore your memories, you must retrieve them from this device,'' he said, gesturing toward the wall behind me, `` and reinsert them into your mind. If this sounds complicated, just follow my instructions.''
``Okay,'' I replied, still somewhat confused by everything going on around me.
``Good,'' the man in front of me said, `` first things first; let's get you situated.''
 
 He was about to tell me what needed to be done but I stopped him with a wave of my hand. 
 
 My head felt like it had been hit by an axe so I wanted to try and rest up as much as possible. 
 
 
 
 I closed my eyes and tried to clear my mind. 
 
 When I opened them again, the man in front of me was looking at something on his phone. 
 
 He handed it to me so that I could see what he was seeing. It looked like a map with little green dots scattered about on it. 
``This is an interactive map,'' he said, `` these green dots are people.''
``Where am I?'' I asked.
``You are in the city of Seattle,'' he replied, `` and this dot right here? That's you.''
``Okay,'' I nodded, `` what do I do now?''
``It's simple,'' he said, `` all you need to do is go to one of these locations marked on your phone. It will lead you there. Once you get to that spot, all you have to do is press the button and wait for someone from your organization to come pick you up.''
``My organization?'' I asked.
``Yes,'' he replied, `` they are called 'The Agency.'''
``Okay,'' I said, `` now what?''
``Well...you need to remember why you were chosen for this job.'' He paused before continuing, `` What makes you so special? Why was it important that YOU save the world? Who or what is it that needs saving? And finally, who are they? The people who want me dead...''
``Yes,'' he replied, `` I know. You were chosen because of your unique abilities.''
``Okay...'' I said slowly. 
 
 He continued, ``You have the ability to remember anything at will and can control time by using your mind. This was deemed necessary in order for us to stop our enemies from taking over the world.''
``Who are these people?'' I asked.
``They call themselves 'The Agency,''' he said, `` but they're really just a bunch of terrorists who want to take control of every country in the world.''
``Why do they want to do that?'' I asked.
``Because it will give them complete power over humanity. They believe that this is their destiny and that it was always meant for them to rule.'' 
``What can I do? How can I stop them?'' 
``You need to find your memories,'' he replied, `` you have been given a device which will allow you to do so. You must retrieve them from this device, then insert them back into your mind. The first step in defeating these terrorists is retrieving the knowledge of why they are doing what they're doing.''
``Okay...'' I said, `` but what if I can't remember anything? What if my memories have been completely wiped out? How do we know that this will work?''
``I assure you,'' he replied, `` it will. Now go and find your memories! You must save the world before it's too late.'' 
``Okay...'' I said, looking around. 
``Where am I?'' 
``You are in Seattle,'' he said again, `` and this dot right here? That's you.''
``Okay...'' I nodded, then looked up at the man with a puzzled expression on my face. 
``What do I need to do next?'' 
He smiled back at me, ``Go get your memories! You have been given a device which will allow you to retrieve them from this machine that is behind us.'' 
``Okay,'' I said slowly, then looked around again. 
``Where am I?'' I asked him.
``You are in Seattle,'' he replied once more, `` and this dot right here? That's you.''
``Okay...'' I nodded, then turned to the man with a puzzled expression on my face. 
``What do I need to do next?''
He smiled back at me again, ``Go get your memories! You have been given a device which will allow you to retrieve them from this machine that is behind us.''
``Okay...'' I said slowly, then looked around again.
