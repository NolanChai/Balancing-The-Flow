 is now sitting on the bed with a white and purple flowery dress that flowed down to her feet.
"Come, my love," she beckoned.
I got out of bed and sat next to her. She smiled and placed her hand on my face as if caressing me. I wanted to take it in mine but my hand felt like a dead weight and could not move.
"What has happened?" she asked, worried. "Can you speak?"
I nodded.
"So can you move?"
Again, I nodded.
She stroked my cheek gently, and I closed my eyes. She looked so beautiful that I would not mind dying. My eyes opened again. Her face was getting fuzzy. She turned into the wall behind her. I moved closer to touch her but she had already disappeared. The image of the wall returned.
I stood up and went to the window. It was still raining heavily. Outside, I saw people in yellow uniforms gathering around something. My heart jumped. Was it a body? Or more than one? I looked down below, and then I realized they were not dead bodies but live humans who had fallen into the rainwater flowing from the roof of a building opposite mine. Their cries for help were muffled by the loud thuds their bodies made on landing in the water.
I sighed with relief. How many people could be killed by such an accident?
I turned back to look at my apartment but I was not sure if it was an apartment anymore. I saw only a small room, a bed, a wardrobe and nothing else. It seemed as though every other thing in the room had been taken away. My heart sank even further. What would happen to me?
My phone started ringing and I reached for it quickly. The voice on the other end was that of my mother's.
"I heard you fell sick," she said. "Are you feeling better now?"
I paused, wondering if the accident had caused amnesia or some kind of hallucinations in me. "No, mummy I don't feel well at all," I lied. "Can you please send my sister to come and check on me?"
