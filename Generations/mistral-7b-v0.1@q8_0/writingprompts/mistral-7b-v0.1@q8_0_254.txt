 I have to endure everyday just to survive. 
 
 I get dropped off at school and stare at my locker. No one has any idea what’s going on in my life, except for my best friend Kris. Who is already waiting by his locker when I finally arrive at the hallway. I slam my head against the wall to try to ease my pain, but it does not help.
 
 I slump down to the floor and cry. Why did I have to be born in this hell hole? Why did this happen to me?
 
 Kris rushes over and kneels by my side. He says nothing for a long time, then he finally speaks. “You know that you can stay with me right? If it’s too much for your parents.”
 
 I shake my head. “I love them, they are all I have left.” I mumble into my hands.
 
 “Then we will stick together through this shitstorm,” Kris says firmly. We both stand up and head to class.
 
 The rest of the day is excruciatingly painful for me. I can’t stop my tears from falling as the pain courses through my body. As soon as the last bell rings, I run out of the building and find Kris waiting by his car. He smiles at me as he opens the back seat door. “I will take you home.”
 
 I nod and fall into the backseat as we pull away from the curb. Kris puts on a CD for me and I can’t help but smile when I hear my favorite song playing through the speakers. We drive in silence until we are almost at my house and then he asks “What’s wrong?”
 
 I tell him everything, my past and my present, I don’t hold anything back. He just listens to me as I pour out my heart. When I finish, there is a long pause before he speaks. His words are soft and gentle. “I will take care of you.”
 
 It seems that he has no idea of the monsters who live inside of him.
