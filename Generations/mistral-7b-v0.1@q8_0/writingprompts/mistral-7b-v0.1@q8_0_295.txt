guishing over choices and the inevitable outcomes. I’ve been a part of several battles. They’ve been fought on paper, on the computer screen. They’ve been epic in nature. There have been few victories, though a lot of losses. In the end, it all comes back to that simple desire…

Desire is a fickle thing, isn’t it? We can want things so badly but when they are ours we often don’t know what to do with them. Or, perhaps we simply forget how much we desired them in the first place. It is not so with me. I am still a woman of desires. Of course, many of my desires have changed over time and there are things I now want that I would have scoffed at years ago. And that’s okay, too.

It has been some time since I wrote about my desire to be with a man who was not just any man but the right man for me. In the last few days, I have come to the realization that this is not likely to happen for me. As I’ve mentioned before in earlier posts, I am in an open relationship and do not plan to make any changes there. My desire to be with someone else will only ever be a fantasy. And that is okay, too.

I’m happy with what I have in life. Sure, I don’t have the man of my dreams. But, I have love and friendship and family and a beautiful home. All of these things are mine and I appreciate them daily. Even if they are not all I could ever want or desire, I know that they are enough.

What is it you want? How do you go about getting it? Do you always get what you want?
