in into this spell.  The result was a black shimmering bubble.

“It’s… it’s working!” he breathed, excitedly.

He held out his hand towards the bubble, palm up, as if he were trying to catch snowflakes with his fingers.  Then he quickly dropped to the ground again and clawed at it with both hands, trying desperately to keep it from disappearing.

“Not so fast!” he commanded.  He wasn’t going to let this opportunity slip away!  “I… I need time to think.”

A moment passed, then two, before the bubble finally disappeared.  Nathaniel sat on his hands and tried not to cry.

“You must have made a mistake,” said the voice in his head.

Nathaniel jumped up.

“There was no mistake!” he exclaimed.

The voice wasn’t going to respond, so Nathaniel continued with his arguments alone.

“If there were a mistake, then I would be dead by now!  You have been telling me that you wanted my help for all of eternity and now when it is finally here you don’t even acknowledge it?!”

A cold hand gripped him on the shoulder and pulled him down onto his knees.  He felt a sharp pain in his neck, then darkness took over.
