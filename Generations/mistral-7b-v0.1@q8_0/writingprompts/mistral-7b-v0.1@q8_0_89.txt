 you get your first pair of colored contacts. Some choose blue, some green, some yellow, but most people just go for what they think looks good and matches their hair. I chose red, because it was pretty cool. It was supposed to be a rite of passage, a celebration of your coming of age, but it turned into something else entirely.

My name's Trent, and this is my story...

"You got any contacts?" the man asked. He was standing near the entrance to the store, looking around with his unnaturally white eyes. I saw him the second I walked in; there was no way I couldn't have. Everyone who steps foot into the store knows what it is before they even make it to the counter.

I looked at him for a moment, confused. "What do you want?"

He stared back with his white eyes. "You got any contacts? I've been looking everywhere and nobody seems to have any." His voice was hoarse and rough, almost like he hadn't spoken in years. He didn't say 'I need', or 'can you get me some'. All he said was 'you got any', and I knew instantly what it meant.

"Yeah," I replied, "What color?"

He stared at me for a moment longer before answering. "Red." It wasn't an answer; more of a confirmation. He knew that all the contacts in my store were red and he was only confirming the fact.

I took him back into a room in the back of the shop, a small room with a few racks of various colored contacts, some spare boxes of cleaning solution, and a shelf of eye drops.

The man leaned against the wall and stared at me. His eyes were pale white and his pupils were wide open, but not focused on anything in particular. It was almost as if he had forgotten how to focus them, or what they even meant to him anymore. He didn't need contacts to see, so why bother with his vision anymore?

"So," I said, "What do you want?"

He stared at me for a moment before answering. "I don't know."

I shrugged. "You wanted some contacts, right?"

His gaze fell to the ground and he began shifting uncomfortably. "Yeah...but I dunno if that's what I really need anymore."

"Well," I said, "What do you think you need? You seem pretty happy just standing around here."

He looked back at me with his pale eyes, almost as if he was seeing me for the first time. "I don't know...it's been so long since I felt like a human being, that all this feels kind of nice." His voice sounded a little desperate and scared, but he didn't seem to notice.

"Well, there's no need to feel like this," I said, "You can be normal again if you want." I held out a pair of contacts toward him, letting them dangle from my fingers. "Take these, put them on and go back to your life."

He looked at the contacts for a moment before answering. "What's the catch?"

"No catch," I replied, "They're just contacts."

"How much do they cost?" he asked.

I shrugged again. "Nothing, it's a free sample. We want people to try them out."

He stared at me for a moment before answering. "Really? They're free?"

"Yeah," I replied, "Come on, take them and go enjoy yourself."

The man took the contacts from my hand and put them on. His eyes turned bright red as soon as they made contact with his corneas. He stared at me for a moment before speaking again. "Thanks..." he said, almost under his breath.

"No problem," I replied, "Anytime." The man started to turn around to leave, but stopped and looked back at me.

"Wait," he said, "You didn't get my name or anything."

I shrugged again. "What do you want your name to be?"

He thought for a moment before answering. "Tom," he replied. I nodded and watched him walk out of the store.

After he left, I looked around at all the boxes of contacts on the shelf. There was one box left that had no label on it and I took it down to look at it closer. The top of the box was sealed shut with some kind of tape, but there was a small gap between where it was folded over and where it was sticking down. It looked like someone tried to pry it open before giving up, which is how I found out what was inside.

I reached in and pulled out one contact, holding it between my thumb and index finger. It was a red contact with no pattern or design on it. No brand name, nothing. Just a plain red contact. I turned the contact over in my fingers and then put it back into the box before walking over to the front counter.

As soon as I got there, my phone started ringing. I picked it up and answered without looking at the number or the caller ID. "Hello?" I said.

"It's me," a voice replied on the other end of the line. It was Tom.

"Hey," I replied.

"I just wanted to thank you again for helping me get my contacts," he said. His voice sounded like it was coming from a long ways away, like he was out in the woods somewhere.

"No problem," I said.

Tom paused for a moment before continuing. "I wanted to ask you something..."

"Yeah?" I asked.

"Do you ever get the feeling that everything around us is fake? Like it's all some kind of game or simulation?" His voice sounded like he was talking from inside his own head.

I paused for a moment before answering. "I don't know..."

He paused again and then continued. "Well, I think we live in a world that's been created by someone else and it's all an illusion to keep us from seeing the truth." He sounded like he was almost crying now. "All our lives are nothing but games; everything is fake. It's just a simulation to keep us distracted while they control us from behind the scenes."

I started to feel uncomfortable hearing him talk like this. I didn't know what to say. I felt bad for him, but at the same time, I couldn't help but wonder if he was right. Maybe we did live in a world created by someone else and it was all an illusion to keep us from seeing the truth...

"I hope you find out who is behind this," Tom said before hanging up on me.

I put my phone back down on the counter and leaned against it, staring at nothing in particular. I wondered what would happen if we really did live in a fake world created by someone else to keep us distracted from the truth? Would they let us know about it or keep it hidden away so that no one would ever find out?

As I was thinking about these things, something caught my eye. It was a man walking down the street outside. He looked familiar somehow...he had white eyes and pale skin. His pupils were wide open and unfocused. Just like the man who came into the store earlier that day, but this one wasn't wearing any contacts at all!

I watched as he walked past my shop and then turned around to look back at me. I could see his eyes through the window of my store and they were staring right at me. He was smiling...he knew what I knew, but didn't care. He was just watching me like some kind of game.

I pulled up the blinds on my shop windows so that he couldn't see me anymore and then turned around to look at the boxes of contacts still sitting on my countertop. All of them were unopened except for one: the box with no label. It was still sealed shut but there was a gap between where it was folded over and where it was sticking down, just like the other one.

I reached in and pulled out one contact, holding it between my thumb and index finger. It was a red contact with no pattern or design on it. No brand name, nothing. Just a plain red contact. I turned it over in my fingers and then put it back into the box before walking over to the front counter.

As soon as I got there, my phone started ringing again. I picked it up and answered without looking at the number or the caller ID. "Hello?" I said.

"It's me," a voice replied on the other end of the line. It was Tom.

I looked out the window to see that he had turned around and was walking away from my shop, but something else caught my eye as well: there was another man walking down the street towards him with pale skin and white eyes just like him! His pupils were wide open and unfocused as if they didn't even have any lids anymore. He had a big smile on his face and seemed to be looking right at Tom, but he wasn't paying any attention to what was happening around him at all!

"I just wanted to thank you again for helping me get my contacts," he said before hanging up on me again!

I put my phone back down on the counter and leaned against it, staring
