ion of Lake Town; the flames flickering as they reached towards the stars above. The dragon had not yet begun his reign of fire, but already he was a terror beyond compare.

"This is my gold and my home," came his terrible voice. "No one will take them from me."

Bard's eyes went wide at this; this was the first time the dragon had spoken in all their days. He stood still, silent, not quite knowing what to say next. He was no fool, he knew that Smaug would be difficult to defeat and yet if he could kill him, then so he would.

"You are not the master of anything here," he said. "We have had enough of your reign!"

He had decided that now was the time to act; they had a better chance than ever. Smaug was in his weakest state and if they could defeat him now, then so they would. He was determined to find a way to stop this dragon once and for all.

"No one will take my gold!" he roared again, and sent fire flying up towards the stars; his roar was drowned out by the crackle of the flame.
