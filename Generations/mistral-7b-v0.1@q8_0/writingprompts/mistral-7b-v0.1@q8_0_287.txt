 clicked his pen while listening to the story of a man who had seen so much more than most men, a veteran in all senses of the word. `` My father was always the type of person who stood by others regardless of their standing within society, I mean he always made sure that we were fed and had everything we needed when we needed it.'' The man explained to the reporter. `` How so?'' The reporter asked. `` Well as a child I remember my father taking me to work with him one day. My father was in charge of building ships for our country. It seemed like the perfect job, but then he came home and told us that we were being moved.''
 
`` To where?'' The reporter questioned. `` I don't know exactly. He said that they were moving us to a city near a river or something like that, and that there would be lots of ships in the water.'' The man explained as he thought back to his childhood memories of that day. `` You mean you knew you had to move, but your parents didn't tell you where you were going?'' The reporter questioned further. `` Yeah, I remember asking my father if we could stay and help build these ships too, but he said no, because it was too dangerous.'' The man explained as he continued on with the story of his fathers life during that time period.
 
`` Well it sounds like your father took care of you all, did your family ever go hungry?'' The reporter asked. `` No, we didn't have a lot of money and my parents didn't earn much but they always made sure that we were fed.'' The man explained as he continued to tell the story of his fathers life during the war period.

 Part 2

`` So you worked for the navy building ships?'' The reporter questioned. `` No, I worked in a factory where they made parts for the planes.'' The man replied as he thought back on that time in his childhood and how it felt to be working so hard every day just trying to keep up with all of those machines running around you non stop.
`` So what did you do after that?'' The reporter asked further into the conversation, hoping for more information about this mans past. `` I got married at 18 years old and then had two kids by 20'' He answered quickly before continuing with his story of how he ended up working at a factory instead of building ships as a young boy.
`` How did that happen?'' The reporter questioned further into this conversation trying to understand what led him down this path in life where he found himself working for the navy rather than being involved in some other career choice. `` Well, my father always wanted me to be an engineer or something like that but I guess it just wasn't meant to be'' He replied as if it were obvious that there was nothing else he could do with his life besides work at a factory making parts for the planes they were building back then during wartime. `` So what made you choose this path?'' The reporter asked further into their conversation trying to understand why someone would choose such an odd job choice like being an engineer over anything else when they had so many other options available in front of them.
`` I don't know, I guess it just worked out that way'' He replied with a shrug before continuing on with his story about how he ended up working for the navy building ships rather than being involved in some other career choice during wartime. `` So what made you choose this path?''
