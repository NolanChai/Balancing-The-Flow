unger sister.  The old lady hadn't looked happy when Sarah showed her what she'd found, though that might have been the fever talking.
 
 After her sisters death, she had kept them safe.  She didn't understand why Rabecca had hidden them so well, but she knew they were precious and could do no harm if they stayed where they belonged.
 
 She hadn't told anyone about them, except the priest she went to for confession.  He knew about her sin and forgave her, though he made it clear that he was still upset she'd done such a thing. 
 
 Now, in this time of darkness, where no one would know she had sinned, she looked through them again, hoping to find the right one.  She didn't know what it was called, but it would have a picture of two women holding hands and looking into each others eyes.
 
 The only reason she knew it existed in this book was because of the picture she had seen inside her own mind, a few nights ago, when she had fallen asleep while reading one of them.
 
 She didn't know if she could do what she saw in that dream though.  It was not something her parents would approve of, nor would it please the God she prayed to every night for safety and food.  Her stomach rumbled painfully at the thought of food.
 
 It had been a long time since she had last eaten anything, and that was before the plague hit.  She hadn't seen much of her parents after the disease came.  They had spent most of their time outside in the fields or out looking for any sign of life. 
 
 Sarah knew they were afraid, but she wanted them to be safe.  She missed the company, especially when it grew dark and the wind blew outside.  She had never liked being alone.  It was worse now than it had ever been.
 
 Even though Rabecca had left her alone in the house after that last dream she'd had, Sarah would have taken her back in a heartbeat if it meant never having to be by herself again.
