### Sex in Advertising: Who’s Really Benefiting?

You can call it what you like. But there is no getting away from the fact that the sex industry is alive and well and living off our children and our society as a whole. It has become so entrenched that we barely notice it anymore, even when it is right under our noses. We can see it on television, in movies, on billboards, on buses, in shops and even at the local shopping centre. But why are we seeing more and more of it? Is it just because society has become so much more accepting, or is it something more sinister?

### What’s really going on…

The truth is, there are some very powerful people who have a vested interest in making sure that this industry keeps growing. These people include politicians, lobbyists and even certain companies. They have been able to get away with all of this because we have become so desensitised to it that we don't even notice anymore. But they are not the only ones benefiting from this situation.

The truth is, there are a lot of people who are making money off the backs of women and children who are being sold into sex slavery. These men and women come from all walks of life but one thing unites them; they have all been taken advantage of by someone else's greed for profit. This is not only wrong but also illegal, yet these criminals continue to do it anyway because they know that there are very few people who will actually call them out on what they're doing.

### Who’s really profiting?

So why does this matter? Well, first of all, it matters because there is no reason why we should be encouraging our children to engage in behaviour like this when it has such terrible consequences for those involved with it and others who may be affected by their actions later down the line. Secondly, it's important because these people are not just selling sex; they're also exploiting human beings which goes against everything we stand for as a civilised society where everyone is equal under law regardless of race or gender identity.

### It’s not just about women anymore…

What you need to understand here is that this industry has grown so much over the years because people have become more accepting and even embracing of it in recent times which means there's less stigma attached nowadays when compared with past generations where things like prostitution were seen as taboo subjects rather than something normal people could engage in without feeling ashamed about doing so later down the line.

This attitude has allowed this industry to thrive because no one wants to be seen as a prude or someone who doesn't like having fun, so they'll go along with whatever everyone else is doing even though deep inside they know something isn't right here but don't want anyone else finding out about it either way.

This means that people are less likely to call them out on their behaviour which allows these criminals to continue operating without any interference from law enforcement agencies who should be shutting them down immediately but instead choose not too because they fear being seen as bigots or homophobic by doing so which is ridiculous considering how much harm has been caused already.

### What can we do about it?

We need to educate ourselves and our children about this issue because ignorance will only lead us down a path where more damage will be done in future generations due lack of awareness surrounding this problematic behaviour pattern among adults today who think nothing wrong with buying sex off other human beings just because they can afford too but refuse see how dangerous these acts are towards everyone involved regardless whether victim male or female, child or adult etc., we must speak up now before things get worse than ever before.

### Sex in advertising – it’s not just about women anymore!

It might surprise you to know that men and boys can also be victims of sex trafficking as well as women and girls. In fact, according to a report by Polaris, the average age for an American child being trafficked is 13 years old. So why are these children being targeted? Why aren't we doing more about it? And what does this have to do with advertising?

### The problem of sex trafficking

According to the US Department of Justice, “sex trafficking” is defined as follows:

“Sex Trafficking” means any person who recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides or obtains by any means a child for the purpose of commercial sexual exploitation.

And according to a 2014 report from UNICEF, there were an estimated 8 million people living in slavery today worldwide with more than half (45%) of them being children aged under 18 years old – including 27% who are under 6 years old! The number has risen dramatically since 2007 when it was only 30%.

This is not just happening overseas but right here in Australia too; there are thousands upon thousands of women and children being exploited each day through sexual servitude. And it doesn't seem like anyone cares enough about this issue either because if they did then maybe they would do something about it?

### What can we do about sex trafficking?

We all have a role to play in ending human trafficking and slavery: from the consumer who wants to ensure their products were not produced using forced labour, through to the employee responsible for ensuring their organisation complies with its obligations under modern slavery laws.

In this article, we look at what can be done by individuals and organisations to reduce the risk of being involved in modern slavery practices.

### Individuals – You Can Make a Difference!

You may think you don’t have much power as an individual, but there are things you can do to make sure that companies aren't exploiting people. For example:

- Use your purchasing power - If you see something on sale in a shop or online which looks too good to be true then it probably is! Look into where the item was made and who made it before buying it so that you don't unknowingly support forced labour practices;

- Speak out about modern slavery issues - You can use social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to raise awareness about modern slavery issues by sharing stories from survivors or using hashtags like #endmodernslavery;

- Write letters to companies whose products contain known slave labour components (e.g., cotton grown on plantations where workers are forced into debt bondage);

### The Impact of Sexual Content in Advertising

In recent years, there has been a growing concern over the impact of sexual content in advertising. This is not just because of its effect on society but also because of how it affects people’s behaviour and attitudes towards sex itself.

The first thing to understand here is that sexual content does not necessarily equate with nudity or pornography. In fact, some ads may contain only suggestive images or words without any actual nudity at all. What matters most about an advertisement is whether it is likely to lead people into thinking something they shouldn’t be thinking about themselves (such as having sex), or doing something they wouldn’t otherwise do (such as cheating).

In general, research shows that sexual content in advertising can have both positive and negative effects on viewers. For example:

- Some studies show that exposure to sexual material encourages women to dress more provocatively;

- Other studies suggest that men who see sexy images of women are more likely to objectify them;

### How Sexual Content Can Affect Viewers’ Attitudes Toward Women and Men

In addition, there are also concerns about how sexual content affects our attitudes toward women and men. For example:

- Exposure to sexual content may lead viewers (both male and female) to see women as objects rather than people;

- It can also cause men who view it regularly or often enough over time—especially those who watch pornography regularly—to become desensitized towards rape victims;

### The Effect of Sexual Content on Viewers’ Behavior Toward Women and Men

The effects of sexual content on our behavior are well-documented. For example, researchers have found that men who watch pornography often experience decreased empathy for women who have been sexually assaulted or raped (and vice versa). In other words: if you see someone being treated badly by a man and don't feel bad about it because he's got a nice body or something like that, then there's probably something wrong with your brain chemistry!

Similarly, studies have shown that exposure to sexually explicit material increases the likelihood of men engaging in sexual aggression towards women (and vice versa). In fact, one study found that among adolescent boys who viewed pornography frequently or regularly over time—especially those who watched it often enough so as not to notice any changes within themselves—their risk for committing rape increased by 20%.

### How Sexual Content Can Affect Viewers’ Behavior Toward Themselves and Others

Sexual content also affects our behavior toward ourselves and others. For example:

- Exposure to sexually explicit material increases the likelihood of men engaging in sexual aggression towards women (and vice versa). In fact, one study found that among adolescent boys who viewed pornography frequently or regularly over time—especially those who watched it often enough so
