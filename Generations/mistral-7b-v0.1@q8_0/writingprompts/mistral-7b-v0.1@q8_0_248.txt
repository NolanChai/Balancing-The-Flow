 wasn't like the other towns in the state. It was a small town that seemed to have no life left. It was mostly older folks and kids from the military base out west of the town. Not much business happened around these parts. That is, until Greg took over this little storefront on Main Street.
`` Well,'' he thought. `` The business is doing ok. But not well.''  He had taken a loan to buy the shop and was struggling to make it work. The first few years were difficult. It wasn't easy for him. His parents weren't happy about his decision. `` You're young and you need to find something better,'' they told him. But he never really cared what others thought of him. He had a vision and wanted to make that dream come true.
`` I bet i could get some extra business if i start selling some local stuff,'' he said to himself one day. `` Maybe even have a little cafe for the folks around here.''
 So, he started thinking about how it would work out. He began researching what he needed and looking up recipes online. He realized that it wouldn't be easy but was determined not to give up on his idea.
 `` I think i could start with some baked goods,'' he thought. `` Then maybe expand into other things like soups or salads.''
 Greg had no experience in running a restaurant, so he decided to take classes at the local college that specialized in this area. It took him almost two years before he felt comfortable enough to open up his own shop and start selling some of the goods he created himself.
 `` I think i can do this,'' he said to himself as he went into work one day. `` With a little hard work and dedication, i know i can make it happen.''
`` Greg, you should really consider coming back home to New York,'' said his mother on the phone one day. `` You'll be much happier there than here in Carrelhold.''  But he knew that wasn't an option for him. He had a vision and was determined not to give up on it.
`` I think i can make this work,'' he said as he hung up the phone. `` With a little hard work and dedication, i know i can make my dream come true.'' And that is what he did. He worked long hours, sacrificed time with friends and family, but in the end, it was all worth it because Greg finally had his own shop where people came from miles around just to see him or try some of his amazing creations.
`` I'm so glad i took this risk,'' he said as he looked out at the storefront that he worked so hard for. `` It may not be easy, but it's worth it.''
