ay for me. I've made my first post on here! Not that I haven't been lurking for a while, I just finally got around to actually posting. This is one of the few things I've actually finished this year, as well as probably my best attempt at a fantasy piece in any medium so far.
 
 I call it "The Shallows" because I wanted it to be open to interpretation, but also because the scene reminded me of being out in a rowboat (I don't know how to swim). So, enjoy, and feel free to ask questions!
 
 Edit: Well, my first ever post here was very well received, so I thought I'd take this opportunity to make another one. This is my first attempt at a digital painting with a human figure in it, as well as my first foray into the world of fantasy in any medium. I call it "The Maiden", and once again I feel that it could be interpreted differently by different people (even if all they see is the nudity). Anyway, enjoy!
 
Edit2: Here's a sketch of her in pencil.
