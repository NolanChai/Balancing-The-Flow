 
 I sighed again, and walked over to the shelf where my phone charger lay. It was a good thing that I had found it so quickly. I didn't have the energy to find it again, at least not right now. And besides, my battery wasn't exactly at critical levels yet. 
 
  But as soon as I got home, I was going to go over there and ask Glados why she always felt the need to tell me what was so obvious. My phone, like any other, has a charger that it can be charged with. And it would only make sense that it could also be uncharged without one. 
 
  It's just a little frustrating sometimes. That's all I have to say about that. 
 
  "Thank you'' Glados said, as if reading my mind. `` But please remember, it is best to charge your devices in moderation. You know how they work, after all'' 
 
 

``What?'' I asked myself as I walked down the hallway towards my room.

``I said, be careful of what you wish for,'' Glados said. ``You never know what it might bring. And as always, remember to charge your phone regularly'' 
 
 

``Alright then...''

 

``Very good! Now don't forget, if you have any questions about charging your device or anything else related to technology please ask me and I will be happy to help you out.''
``Thank you Glados,'' I said as I turned off the lights. ``Good night''
