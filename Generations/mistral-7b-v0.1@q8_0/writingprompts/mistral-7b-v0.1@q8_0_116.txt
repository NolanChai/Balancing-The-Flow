 a few large pipes filled with air (or in this case, compressed helium) is mind blowing. That's why I chose this particular picture to demonstrate my favorite instrument- not only does it showcase the sheer beauty of the organ, but it also shows how delicate and complex each pipe truly is.

Another reason as to why I love playing the organ is that it doesn't require you to be a virtuoso in order to produce an enjoyable sound; just hit the correct note(s) on the keyboard and enjoy! There are a few techniques and tricks to properly play this instrument, but for the most part anyone can do it.

If I could give advice to anyone interested in playing an instrument, it would be to find something that you love playing, not something that you think others might appreciate hearing (unless of course you want to become a musician). There's no sense in picking up the violin just because everyone else does- if it isn't fun or rewarding for YOU, then there is no point in learning how to play it.

I don't have any regrets about picking up the organ as my main instrument, but I do regret not starting sooner. If you have any questions about anything related to music, feel free to contact me anytime!
