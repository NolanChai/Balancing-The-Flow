ant at me, blame me for everything that goes wrong in your lives, but do not realize my importance. I am a part of this planet, as much as you are, no more, no less.
 
 But you are blind, deaf and dumb to the things that happen around you, because you have lost the ability to see beyond what is right in front of your eyes. You may not notice it, but I am there. In all forms of life, all the living species on earth, from the tiniest virus to the largest whale, every living thing has a part of me in itâ€™s body.
 
 You curse me for the disease that kills your loved one, and do not even stop to think if you were there when it was created by man himself. You do not think about how much suffering you cause the people around you when you kill another animal to satisfy your hunger, or when you slaughter a whole forest to build some building.
 
 But then again I understand you cannot see me, because of all the pollution that is created every day, from your cars and factories, that make it difficult for my breath. And I do not have the strength anymore to breathe in all this toxic gas and cleanse it by using plants. Every year people cut down more and more trees to make their lives easy. They do not think about what they are destroying.
 
 So as the pollution increases, you shall see me gradually fade away from existence, while the human race continues to exist. If only you could realize that I am no threat to you, and that I am actually helping you every second of your lives without even knowing it.
