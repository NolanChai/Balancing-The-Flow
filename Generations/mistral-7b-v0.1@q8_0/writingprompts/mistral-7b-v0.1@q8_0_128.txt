 my computer, sat down with the controller in hand, popped in the disk and loaded the game. It began to play.

The first level had me walking across this weird field of green stuff with all sorts of weird things happening around me. There were strange creatures, people, buildings, even monsters and wizards. I didn't know what was going on, but it looked like fun!
