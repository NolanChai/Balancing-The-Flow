 were, all lined up on a shelf in the classroom. One day I decided that this particular donkey would be best suited to live on my bedside table. The other donkeys didn’t seem too upset but the horses did object. They demanded that I take their place. After much discussion and deliberation I realised that no toy animal should be treated unfairly or made to feel unwanted, so I found a shelf for the horse toys. The cows were not happy but we soon reached an agreement with them too.

It was a very enlightened moment for me; even as a child I was concerned about equality and fairness for all. It would be easy to believe that such an incident had shaped my adult life and that I am now the most politically correct person you are likely to meet, but unfortunately this is not the case.

I am one of those people who say things before they think. I speak without considering the consequences of my words. So, when I was asked what I would change about my past if given the opportunity to do so, I replied that it had all worked out just fine and there wasn’t a single thing that I would alter. Then I thought about my donkey moment and realised that this one small incident did have an impact on me as a child.

There is no way that I could go back in time and take the donkey away from my bedside table. It was a nice memory for me but it had been misplaced. When I put it back on its original shelf there were a few toys missing. This is where I would alter the past, by bringing those lost toys back to the classroom.
