urgundies and greens. My mind flashed back to the memory of opening that first photo album and turning the pages one by one. I was no longer in the present, but lost in my thoughts and memories of the past.

My parents were avid photographers. Their collection included black and whites and color prints alike from every vacation and milestone they’d ever experienced together. They’d spent hours searching through shoe boxes and old photo albums for a picture that could tell a story of a certain time in their life, whether it was a trip to Disneyland with my siblings, or a picture of the two of them on their first date.

They never once hesitated from buying a disposable camera, or paying for someone to take a photograph of us in a booth at a fair or a carnival. It wasn’t about quality; they were simply capturing moments that they wanted to remember forever. Moments where they laughed and smiled together, or moments that were filled with sadness but taught them to appreciate the good in life.

That photo album was my connection to my parents. Whenever I opened it, I felt like I was a part of their lives — not just a small portion of it, but rather an integral part in every moment they’d ever experienced together. When I found that photo album, I felt like I discovered an entire new side of them as individuals and as a couple, and that in itself was comforting for me to see. It made me feel like they had a life before I came into their world; a life with many ups and downs and struggles, but at the end of the day they always held each other’s hand and found happiness together no matter how hard it might have been.

The picture I was holding in my hands brought me back to reality. As I zoomed in on the image, I was able to see a tiny face smiling back up at me from the screen — a face that I would never be able to see again without this camera in my hands. A face that belonged to a man I never met; a grandfather I didn’t even know existed until the day of my grandma’s funeral.

I was there with my mom and sister at my grandma’s house as she sorted through a box full of old photo albums, discarded magazines from the ’70s and letters that had been sent back and forth between her and my grandpa before he passed away. She began flipping through each photo album one by one, pointing out her own children in their younger days and telling us stories about how she met my grandpa and fell in love with him.

“Do you think this is the one?” She asked me, as I sat on the ground next to her sifting through the pictures. “I can’t remember if it was taken at my sister’s wedding or if we went on a trip together.”

My eyes searched every corner of the black and white photograph of two people I had never seen before in my life. They both wore smiles that could light up any room; a man with dark hair and glasses, and a woman who looked like my grandma but younger, wearing a long skirt and her hair tied into a bun.

“This has to be the one!” My mom exclaimed as she pulled another photo album out of the box. “I knew he was the one because he made me feel like I could do anything.” Her voice cracked with emotion as she spoke, tears rolling down her cheeks.

She continued flipping through the photos, stopping at pictures of them both together and then moving on to more recent ones of him smiling at his grandchildren. It was clear how much my mom adored him; she spoke fondly about him for hours until we eventually left the house so that she could rest up before going home.

As I walked through the door into our apartment, my mom and sister were still sitting on the couch looking through old photos of themselves when they were younger. They both seemed to be in a trance, lost in thought as they flipped from one page to another. The house was filled with laughter and music; it felt like home for them again after having been away for so long.

I walked over and sat down next to my mom, who had been scrolling through photos of herself when she was younger on her phone. As she held up each picture one by one for me to see, I couldn’t help but feel a sense of joy at seeing them both together again after so long apart from each other. They looked happy; they looked alive!

The house was filled with laughter and music; it felt like home for them again after having been away for so long. The room was filled with the sound of their laughter as my sister and I reminisced over old photos and memories. My mom had always said that her life was a storybook, but now I saw what she meant by that: there were times when things were good and happy, while other times they were sad and difficult. But no matter how many ups and downs their lives may have taken them through together, they never gave up on each other or themselves! They held onto hope even when it seemed impossible to do so.

As I sat there looking through these photos, I realized that I had been given a gift: a chance to see my grandparents in an entirely new light — not just as people who existed before I was born, but as real people with lives full of experiences and emotions that were just as real as mine are today.

I thought about how many times my grandparents had visited us when we were little; how they used to sing along with us at night after dinner while we danced around the kitchen table together before bedtime…and then it dawned on me: these photos weren’t just about them. They were also about me! And more importantly, about how much love they shared for each other — and all of us as well.

As I sat there looking through these pictures, I realized that this was a storybook for me too; one that would always remind me of who my grandparents were as people and as individuals: two people who loved each other so deeply that even when they had gone away from each other physically or emotionally during times in their lives where things were hardest (like after my grandfather passed away), there was still an undeniable connection between them.
