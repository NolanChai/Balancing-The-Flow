 one could see it, not yet anyway. They looked at her and saw a vibrant, young woman who worked tirelessly to take care of her family. She was the mother of three kids, wife of two husbands (that’s another story), and worked as a nurse. Her days were long and hard, but she knew it was all for a greater good.

Eve had always been a believer. A firm believer in a higher power and a force of good that resided within her. She was certain that death would not be the end for her, but merely a transition into a new realm where she could continue to love, heal, and help others.

As the day went on, Eve began to feel weaker. Her heart couldn’t keep up with her body anymore. The pains became more frequent. But still, no one noticed anything was wrong. Eve didn’t want them to see how much she was hurting. She wanted to be strong and positive for them. They had been through so much already; a divorce, the birth of three children in six years, and now this.

The hours ticked away as her body gave up fight after fight. Finally, it came time for Eve to go. As she took one last breath, she looked around at her family who was gathered in the room with her. Her husband and kids were crying and holding each other tight. She knew they would be okay.

With a final blink of an eye, Eve disappeared. But not before she sent one last message to the world: “Fear is just an illusion.”
