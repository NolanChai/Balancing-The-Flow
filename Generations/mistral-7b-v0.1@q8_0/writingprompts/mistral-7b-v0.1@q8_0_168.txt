ceptical about it myself.'' He gave me a smile and sat forward again. `` But there are ways to find out if the woman in this video is really who they say she is.''
 
``Really?''
 
``Yes, Detective Rand is just saying that,'' said Detective Yoshida, stepping between us. I nodded, my mind racing to think of what other methods there might be to identify the woman from the video. Then I remembered the video itself. ``Is it possible we could get a better look at her face?''
 
``I'll try, but the camera that captured this was a very low-tech one.'' He picked up his tablet and turned it on, holding the screen in front of my face as if to show me the video. I was just about to tell him I knew how to turn on the device when he started playing the video.
 
A few seconds later, the screen went black again, showing a message saying that there was no internet connection available and that it would be impossible to stream the video in this area. ``What's happening?'' I asked.
 
``The video file is corrupted.'' Detective Yoshida tried to explain. ``It can happen if someone messes with the original file or the data link. It doesn't matter how low-tech the camera was, the way the files were uploaded could be affected by that.''
 
``Can it be repaired?'' I asked.
 
``Well, that depends on a lot of factors. The state of the original file and the time we get our hands on it are only two. If we do manage to get a hold of the file, there is no guarantee that we will be able to fix it.''
 
``But even if you can't,'' Detective Rand said. ``There are other ways to find out who this woman is.''
 
Detective Yoshida looked at him for a long moment before turning back to me, giving me an apologetic look and saying: ``I will try my best to get my hands on that file.''
 
He nodded his head once more before standing up and leaving the room. Detective Rand stood up as well but not before handing me some paperwork to fill out. I quickly signed it, handed it back to him and then started following Yoshida as he headed towards the door. ``Can I ask you a question?'' I asked.
 
``Yes.'' He said with an encouraging smile. ``What is it?''
 
I stopped walking for a moment to think about what to say. ``Why do we have two detectives here? Wouldn't one be enough?''
 
He laughed. ``Well, Detective Rand is actually my boss.'' He said as he opened the door and led me outside into the hallway. ``The only reason I came with him is that I wanted to take a look at this video myself.''
 
``Oh.'' Was all I could say. ``So if you find out who she is, would that be enough? Or does it need to be confirmed by your boss as well?''
 
He stopped walking for a moment and gave me another smile before continuing down the corridor towards what looked like an office area. ``If we can get our hands on the file and repair it, then yes. It will be enough.''
