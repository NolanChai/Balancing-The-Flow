ly face in concentration. `` There was a kid once, who sat here for a whole day, staring out at the city.''
 
 The girl laughed. She loved the way he talked about people like they were still there, like you could hear their story by looking closely enough. It made her feel warm inside. She smiled to herself and waited for him to go on.
 
 `` He just sat here,'' the boy continued, `` Staring out at the city.'' The girl couldn't tell if he was serious or not, but she didn't want to spoil his story so she kept quiet.
 
 `` And the thing is,'' the boy said, `` It was a beautiful day! Not like today. A clear blue sky. Beautiful sunshine. But he just sat here.''
 
 The girl nodded, amused and curious at once. She wished he would go on.
 
 `` And then,'' the boy whispered, `` Just before it got dark, the wind started to pick up.''
 
 A shiver ran down her spine. What was this story? She tried not to show him.
 
 `` And it was a big gust of wind and just when he thought it couldn't get any worse, all of a sudden the trees in the park start shaking.'' He paused for effect. The girl stared at him intently.
 
 `` And then,'' the boy said, `` Just when he thinks he can't take it anymore, the sun starts to set over the city and all you could hear was this huge roar!'' He smiled wryly. She laughed. It was a terrible story but it had somehow become perfect in its absurdity.
 
 They sat there quietly for some time, watching the city fall asleep around them.
