o u t the size or the numbers, they aren 't nearly as important as you might think.

 | Handler: Our most important assets are our people, which I assume you've noticed already.

 | Handler: The ship is divided into 10 sectors. The first being the Cockpit, and the last being the Bridge.

 | Handler: Sectors are separated by a specific color of wall. If you ever get lost in this ship, find the nearest wall color. Then go to that sector.

 | Handler: If you're in the red sector, head towards the bridge. You'll see your way from there.

 | Handler: Keeping with the ship's theme of colors, sectors are also divided into sections by a specific color of floor.

 | Handler: The first section is named Red. Which is where you are now.

 | Handler: The second section is named Orange. And the third, Yellow. And so on.

 | Handler: Each sector has it 's own theme. From a bar to a restaurant. A gymnasium to an amusement park. There's even an entire sector devoted just to food. You can see why we need such a huge ship.

 | Handler: What ever you want or need, you'll find it here. No matter what time of day, this ship will always be open for business.
 
 | Handler: But in the end, everything and everyone has a purpose. Even if that purpose is simply to make your stay on the ship more enjoyable.
 
 | Handler: So why not enjoy yourself? You've earned it!
