esta to come in behind us. That was where it had spent most of its time so far—behind, looking over our shoulders at us as we headed for Mars.
 
 We'd all been waiting for that ship ever since we left. It was a long way out of our way, but the captain had insisted on going this route. He said he wanted to check up on it—we had sent the ship ahead of us, with just a skeleton crew and an automated mining robot, to mine some iron ore in the asteroid belt. We had left them supplies for five years, which should have been plenty of time for them to get the job done.
 
 Now we were getting closer, but even from this distance I could see that something was wrong with the ship. It was a little larger than our own—the captain said it was old, and we'd been upgrading ours as we went along, so it made sense that his ship would be bigger than mine. And it was. But this one was just...wrong. It looked like a piece of junk—a mash-up of different parts from different ships welded together with haphazard bolts and rivets, instead of the clean, streamlined look I was used to seeing on our own ship. The captain called it "an old sailor."
 
 A few days before we caught up to it, the captain sent out a signal to them. They didn't respond for a long time. The next day, one of their engines burst into flames. There were no other ships in the vicinity—we had been keeping an eye on our space, and nobody else was near us or coming toward us at this point. We could see the whole thing happen, with the captain watching from his cabin window.
 
 The next day, another engine went out, leaving just two. It started to look like they were going to make it after all...until one of their solar sails tore free of its moorings and flew away into the night sky. It was a long time before we caught up to them. I had been waiting for them all this time—ever since I left home, really—and now finally they were here.
 
 They were coming closer every day. Every day there would be one less engine, until today when there were only two engines still left on the ship and it was drifting closer to us. The captain had been keeping an eye on them from his cabin window all this time—I could see him sitting in there, watching as their ship grew larger every day. He was waiting for them now too, just like me; only he had waited so much longer than I did that it seemed like he was already ready when we got here.
 
 There were two engines left on the ship and they were both about to explode at any moment—one from overheating, and one because its fuel supply had run out. The captain looked up at me through his cabin window.
 
 "Get ready," he said. I nodded and ran off to prepare for what was coming next.
