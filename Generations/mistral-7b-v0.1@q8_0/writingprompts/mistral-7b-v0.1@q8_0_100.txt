20 year old boy went off the road and hit a tree, no survivors. I have to be ready at a moment’s notice, because that’s what they want. And I don’t mind it so much. But now this boy has died in the middle of nowhere, where there is no way to get him out for 15 minutes, and we are at least 30 minutes away from town. So, I just sit in my car for a few more minutes and think about how strange it is that this boy’s life was taken so quickly. And then I remember what I learned as a child. I am the one who can fix it all.
