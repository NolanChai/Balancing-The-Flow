oudnt wake up from.
I'm not sure but I know I need to get out of here soon. I want to go home. And yet, I don't even remember how my life was there anymore... so I can't be too sure about what I miss. All I know is that this place isn't for me and if I stay here much longer I am going to end up killing myself... which might be a better option than the one they are gonna make me take later tonight.
