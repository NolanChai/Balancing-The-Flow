 and I ran.

I was tired, and hungry as I dragged myself up the stairs to my apartment building. It took a while for my legs to cooperate with me so I plopped down on one of the stairs before making it inside. As soon as I made it past the door to the hall way I could hear foot steps in the distance. I looked around, and looked behind me but all was silent again.

I ran up to my room and locked it, throwing myself onto the bed. It was 5:30 in the morning when I woke up, still alone. I showered and brushed my teeth before making myself something to eat for breakfast. As I sat on the couch to watch some morning cartoons, my mom came into the room and told me to get ready to go to work because it would be too busy there later and they were having trouble finding employees to work this early.

"But- " I protested. "I was hoping to have a day off." She looked at me with a stern face. "Well, I'm not paying for you to sit around on your ass all day, young man. Go get changed or else you will be late!" she shouted and stormed away.

"But mom!" I started after her but I stopped when I noticed the woman from the night before standing in my kitchen doorway. She had a knife in one hand, and she was smiling at me with blood on her mouth.
