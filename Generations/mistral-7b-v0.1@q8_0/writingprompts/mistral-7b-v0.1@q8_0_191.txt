ification of his life for fun and to break the monotony of his job. Now he could only use the murder system if the victims had been declared legally dead. Otherwise, it was just a game. The new update made him think he could change that.

The murder system had to be the most innovative idea Dr. Gahmstahp came up with. It became an obsession to kill as many people as possible without getting caught by the law enforcement system. He kept on coming up with ways to make it harder for anyone who figured out what he was doing.

It didn't start that way, but after his first successful murder, Dr. Gahmstahp wanted to get better. He had a great idea. The victim could be declared legally dead and then the system would let him kill them. That was where it started to go wrong. In fact, he was surprised when it did not end humanity or even make it harder for him to murder people.

There was no real reason why it didn't work that way. He thought about it a lot, but the only thing he came up with was that the system couldn't tell if someone was legally dead or just dead. It had always been an idea, but now it seemed like something could be done about it.
