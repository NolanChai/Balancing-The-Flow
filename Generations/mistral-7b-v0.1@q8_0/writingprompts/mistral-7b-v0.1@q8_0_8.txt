 Hi Dad!'' said Phil with an even bigger grin. 
 
 They both laughed at that and shook hands. 
 
 `` You still have a big snow shovel?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, but it needs some work. It's been in the garage for 30 years. '' 
 
 `` Hey Phil! How are you doing with your wife and kids?'' 
 
 `` She has one son.''  

`` Oh yeah? His name is ?'' 

``Philip, Jr.'' 

``Is he still in high school?'' 

``No, he graduated last year. He's 20 now and living here at home.''  

``He still has a job?'' 

``Oh no, we pay for everything because he can't find work anywhere. But that's not his fault, is it? That's the problem with this economy.'' 

``Well, he can't live on unemployment forever,'' said Greg. ``What if he needs surgery or something and they find a cancerous tumor?''  

``We have health insurance, but what about you? Do you have health insurance? And do you pay for it all by yourself or do you get help from the government like Phil does?'' 

Greg looked away.  ``No, I don't have insurance.'' 

``Well, that's terrible!'' said Phil. ``How can you live without health care? And what if you need an operation on your heart or something? You could die from a heart attack!'' 

``That's not likely,'' said Greg. ``I'm pretty healthy.'' 

``But what about other things, like accidents?'' 

``Well, I have a car and I wear my seatbelt all the time.''  

``Yeah but that's not enough! You could be in an accident and it could kill you!'' 

``No I couldn't. If I was going to get into a terrible accident then I wouldn't have made it this far. '' 

``Well what about sickness? What if you were allergic to something that gave you cancer? Or what if you had a virus that destroyed your immune system and made you sick all the time?''  

Greg shrugged his shoulders, ``I don't know.'' 

``That's terrible! That's not fair to anyone! And what about old age? What do you think is going to happen when you get older? Are you just going to die in a nursing home and leave your family without any money? Or are they going to take care of you? '' 

``I don't know.''  

``Well, it's better than dying, isn't it?'' said Phil. ``You should get some insurance because if something happens then you won't have any money left over for your kids or grandkids.'' 

``Yeah I guess so,'' said Greg. ``But what about people who don't make enough to buy their own insurance? What do they do?''  

``The government gives them free health care, just like the military does with the veterans.'' 

``Oh that's great!'' said Greg. ``I wish we could get some of that too, but I guess it is hard to get all those doctors and nurses to volunteer their time for nothing in return.'' 

``Well what about all those poor people who live in other countries? Are they going to be able to go see a doctor if they need one?'' 

``I don't know,'' said Greg. ``Maybe the UN will help them out or something.'' 

``But how are they going to pay for it all? And what about poor people here in America? Are you going to let them die too just because they can't afford health care?''  

Greg shook his head, ``No I won't. That would be terrible.'' 

``But how are we going to pay for it all?'' said Phil. ``There is no way that you or I could ever afford such a thing.''  

``I guess you're right,'' said Greg. ``Maybe there should be some kind of tax on everyone, just like they do with income taxes and sales taxes.'' 

``But what about all those businesses who don't make enough money to pay their workers enough so that they can buy health insurance? They have no choice but to lay off employees or close down altogether because it would cost too much for them to keep paying everyone.''  

Greg nodded his head, ``That's true. I think we should just raise the taxes on the rich people so they could afford to pay everyone what they need to survive.'' 

``Oh great! That sounds wonderful!'' said Phil with a grin. ``I wish all these politicians knew how good of an idea that was.''  

``Well I don't think they do,'' said Greg, ``but maybe if we keep pushing them about it then they might eventually listen to us.'' 

``Yeah that would be great!'' said Phil with a smile. ``What are you going to do when you go home tonight? Are you going to tell your wife and kids how terrible this world is?''  

``I don't know,'' said Greg. ``They might get mad at me or something, but I think that they would understand if I told them the truth about it.'' 

Phil laughed, ``That's a good idea! You should tell them everything you just told me and see what happens.''  

``Yeah I will,'' said Greg. ``I'll make sure to do that.'' 

``Good luck,'' said Phil with another grin on his face. ``And by the way, how come you aren't married yet?''  

Greg shrugged, ``It's not easy finding someone who will put up with my long hours at work and all the traveling I have to do.'' 

``Oh that is too bad,'' said Phil. ``But maybe you'll find someone eventually and then everything will be alright.'' 

``Maybe,'' said Greg, ``but there are so many problems in this world that it is hard for me to think about anything else.''  

``I understand what you mean,'' said Phil. ``But at least we can try our best and maybe someday things will get better.''  

Greg nodded his head, ``Yeah I guess so.'' 

Phil smiled, ``Well it was nice talking to you Greg!'' 

``Yeah it was,'' said Greg. ``But now I have to go back home and take care of my wife and kids.''  

``I know how hard that can be,'' said Phil with a smile on his face. ``Take care!'
