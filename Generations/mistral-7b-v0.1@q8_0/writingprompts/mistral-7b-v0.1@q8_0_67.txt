 this moment makes me think about your advice to always check my bindings before heading out. If only I had followed your advice and checked mine. I'm sorry I didn't.
 
 Steph, if you are reading this, then you know I have passed. There was no pain. It happened so fast that I did not even have time to be scared. Please do me one last favor. You have always been a great athlete and I think it would make me proud if you would take up skiing again.
 
 I'd like for you to go back to Maine and hit those trails the way we used to. But this time I want you to wear my ashes in your ski bag so that you can carry me along with you.
 
 Maybe by doing that, you will be reminded of all the good times that we had together on the slopes and maybe it will help you find some comfort in knowing that your best friend is still out there somewhere watching over you. Please take care of yourself and be safe. I love you Steph. You are my best friend in this life and forever.
 
 Your friend,``
