ia and he had just come back to Atlantis City after weeks away from the capital city in his constituency. He wasn’t happy that he was being recognized by so many people in the city now and he wanted to get home, shower and change out of his campaign suit. He’d been on the trail of his opponent for months now but he didn’t need the attention at this time.
 
  As soon as he stepped into his apartment he heard a loud noise coming from the kitchen area. Ardin stopped short, surprised that there was someone in his house.
 
 “Who is it?” he called out.
 
 There was no response.
 
 “Hey! Who is in here with me?!”
 
 Still no answer. Ardin felt a little uneasy but decided to find the person and see what they wanted. He walked over to his bedroom, pulling off his suit jacket and tossing it on the floor as he did so. He was tired and just wanted to go to bed. He opened the door to the kitchen area and froze. There was a man there holding a gun in his hands pointed at Ardin. Ardin felt a little nervous but decided that maybe the guy was looking for someone else.
 
 “Hey, I live here! What do you want?” he asked trying not to sound too worried or scared. He didn’t want this guy to think he was weak and easy to intimidate.
 
 The man just glared at him silently. Ardin felt his heart pounding in his chest. He took a few steps back, hoping that the gunman would lower his weapon. Instead, the man slowly started walking toward him with the gun still pointed in his direction.
 
 “I said I live here! Who are you? What do you want?” Ardin asked again, now a little scared for his life. He tried to stay calm but it was difficult when he knew that this guy could shoot him at any moment and there was nothing he could do about it.
 
 The man stopped right in front of Ardin and pointed the gun at him. Ardin felt a chill run down his spine as he saw the barrel of the weapon so close to his face. He tried not to flinch but it was difficult not to react when he knew that this man could pull the trigger at any time and end his life in an instant.

 “I’m Senator Jedd Ardin, who are you?”
 
 The gunman didn’t answer; instead, he just kept staring at him silently with an unreadable expression on his face. Ardin felt a little uneasy but decided that maybe the guy was looking for someone else. He took a few steps back, hoping that the gunman would lower his weapon. Instead, the man slowly started walking toward him with the gun still pointed in his direction.
