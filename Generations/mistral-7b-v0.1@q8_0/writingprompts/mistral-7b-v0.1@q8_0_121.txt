58 years old; the second is 16. Each walks with a stick in their hand – one tall, the other short and stubby. They ’ re wearing sneakers, a t-shirt with the words “I’m from Berlin” and jeans that are too tight.

The first is carrying two suitcases on wheels. The second has a backpack strapped to his shoulders that looks like it ’ s full of books. And there ’ s something else the first is carrying – a tiny, round, red rubber ball. A red ping-pong ball. He throws it in front of him and walks after it.

The two of them walk for a while; then they stop to catch their breaths. They lean on their sticks and look at each other. “I ’ m tired,” says the first one, out of breath.

 
 “Me too,” the second answers.

They keep walking. The first is followed by the second, but the second leads.

 
 They’re heading somewhere but don’t know where. It could be a city or a town – who knows? But they have to walk a long way before they get there.

Their feet are starting to hurt now, so they slow down and take turns leading each other with their sticks. The first is 58 years old; the second is 16. Each carries something heavy on his back – one tall and thin, the other short and stubby. They walk for a long time until they stop at a river.

“It’s getting dark,” says the first one. “Let’s find a place to stay for tonight.”

The second agrees and walks over to the edge of the water. He looks down into the muddy river, then back up again at his friend. The first one is looking at him expectantly, so he nods his head and takes a few steps forward before jumping into the icy water. The first follows, splashing into the water after him. They swim across to the other side of the river, where there’s an island with trees on it.

They both climb out of the water, then sit down under one of them to dry off and rest. After a while, they start talking about their journey so far: how long they ’ ve been walking together for and where they think they might end up soon. The first says that he doesn’t know where they’re going or even who he is anymore; all he does is walk with his little red ball. But then the second one points out that maybe this is exactly what makes him so special – because if you have nothing left to hold onto except your dreams, then you can do anything at all!
