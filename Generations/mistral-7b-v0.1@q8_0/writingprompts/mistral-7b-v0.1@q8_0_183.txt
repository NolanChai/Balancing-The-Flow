## BackgroundEdit

### HistoryEdit

Kaede was originally human before he joined the demon-killing Outsiders, and was a member of their most elite group known as The Black Order. He was then sent by his leader to find a suitable candidate for the prophecy of The Chosen One which he eventually found in the form of a young girl named Luna.

## PersonalityEdit

Kaede has a very serious personality and is often quiet and reserved. In contrast, however, he has a dark sense of humor that is sometimes considered inappropriate and disgusting, especially when it comes to his love life or sex. He is also one of the most ruthless and cunning Outsiders, making him an excellent leader for the Order.

## AbilitiesEdit

- Kaede's main weapon is a scythe that can cut through almost anything, including walls of demonic flesh, due to its supernatural abilities. He also has his own powers in the form of Demon Blood Manipulation and Immortality.
- Kaede can manipulate the blood of demons into weapons such as razor sharp blades or bullets. This ability also enables him to create a powerful, poisonous gas out of the demon's blood. However, he cannot use his blood manipulation abilities on humans because of their lack of demonic blood in their systems.
- Kaede is immune to all forms of aging and is virtually immortal due to being half-demon himself. He also has superhuman strength and endurance making him one of the strongest members of The Order.
