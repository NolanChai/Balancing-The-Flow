3 rocks fell out onto the pathway. The first was a small, smooth one with no cracks or blemishes that had been sitting in my mothers garden for years. ``Perfect for a brain shot'' I thought to myself as I continued my walk home. The next rock I picked up was a little larger than a baseball and covered in moss, the green grass like substance covering most of its surface. It would be perfect for killing one or two rats if need be. But just to make sure, I reached into the bag to pull out another one that had been lying around my house. A small, grey, perfectly round rock with a large crack in it was all that was left in the bag as I pulled it out and began to walk home.
``'I don't know what you are complaining about'' I said to my mother who had just walked through the door. ``I only wanted 4 rats for dinner, not all of them'' she replied.
