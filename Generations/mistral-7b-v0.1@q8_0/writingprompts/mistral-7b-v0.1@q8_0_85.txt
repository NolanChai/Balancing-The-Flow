acitly in acknowledgment and continued on their way as Pontius strode through them. The others looked up, wondering what he would do.

A short flight of steps led him onto the plinth. From there he could see the entire Forum and beyond to the Palatine and Capitolium hills. He surveyed the scene for a few moments, before stepping off again and making his way towards the nearest building, his stride confident and sure-footed.

As he passed through the archway of the temple of the goddess Juno Moneta, the light was dimmed, as if the gods were shielding their eyes from his presence. He reached the inner sanctum where he would have found an image of the goddess herself, had she not been removed from her place by an Imperial decree several years before. Instead he found only a fading image on the wall opposite the entrance.

Pontius paused for a moment, then raised his voice to echo through the chamber: ``Where is the wisdom of old, where the justice and courage? Where are they, I ask you, where have they gone?'' He turned around, his eyes blazing. ``The time has come for them to return!''

He strode out of the temple and along the colonnade of the Forum towards the Basilica Julia, with its towering columns and majestic portico. His voice echoed off the marble pillars: ``You will find them here!'' The people began to gather again, crowding around him in anticipation. ``And if you think it time, then I, Pontius Pilatus, shall give them back to you!''

As he spoke, his eyes locked onto those of a young man standing at the far end of the Forum, staring up into the sky, his body bathed in an ethereal glow. The crowd parted before him as he moved towards his master. ``The time has come,'' Pilatus repeated as he approached.

Jesus stared straight ahead, his eyes focused somewhere above and beyond the Forum. ``I know.'' He turned to face Pontius, his voice strong but calm. ``We must make sure they do not return.''

``What are you talking about?'' Pilatus asked. ``If I have to go through with this, then at least let them be something worthwhile!'' His hand moved towards the sword at his side and then stopped. He shook his head, as if trying to clear it. ``I don't understand.''

``You are the instrument of my father's will,'' Jesus said, ``but you do not yet understand what he has planned. You must allow me to fulfill my destiny or all is lost.'' He looked around at the crowd, which had swelled in numbers again, and nodded slowly: ``The time has come.''

``What is it you want of me?'' Pilatus asked, his voice straining with uncertainty.

Jesus smiled as he turned to face Pilatus again. ``Do not be afraid. You must crucify me in the morning.'' His smile became a frown, as if he could taste something bitter in his mouth: ``They will come for you, you know - and you must be ready!'

Pontius looked into Jesus' eyes for a moment before turning away. The crowd had grown even larger now, pushing towards the Basilica Julia, and he felt himself swept up by their energy as they followed him to its entrance. ``I will crucify you,'' he said, his voice rising with each word: ``In the morning!''

Jesus shook his head slowly: ``You must not do it,'' he whispered, his eyes glittering in the moonlight. ``There is another way.''

``Another way?'' Pilatus asked. His eyes were drawn to Jesus' as if by a magnet. ``What is this other way?''

Jesus held up a hand: ``It can only be revealed through suffering.'' He smiled again, more gently this time: ``You will find it in the morning.''

As he spoke, Pilatus felt as though something was passing through him - an energy or a feeling that seemed to fill his whole body with warmth. It took all of his strength not to kneel before Jesus and offer him the crown of thorns he wore on his head. He could feel it pressing into his skull, making him dizzy, but he refused to yield: ``You will find your way in the morning!''

Jesus turned away from Pilatus again, looking up at the sky once more: ``I know,'' he said simply, before turning back towards the crowd. They had been waiting for his answer with bated breath and now they cheered loudly as he nodded towards them, accepting their applause graciously: ``The time has come!''

With that, Jesus turned away from Pilatus once more and walked out of the Basilica Julia towards the Via Sacra - the street which led to the Capitolium hill and its temple of Jupiter. As he walked, he could feel his heart beating faster and faster with anticipation: ``The time has come!'' he shouted again as he passed under the portico of the temple of Saturn, where he would soon face the wrath of the gods.

He stopped at last before the steps leading up to Jupiter's temple: ``You must be ready,'' he whispered to Pontius Pilatus, who was still standing there in silence beside him - his eyes fixed upon the heavens above. ``They will come for you!''

Pilatus did not answer but merely nodded slowly as if he understood what Jesus had said. He looked up at the sky once more and then turned away from it, towards his own destiny: ``I will crucify you in the morning,'' he repeated, his voice trembling with fear. ``In the morning!''

Jesus shook his head slowly as if trying to shake off something that had caught him by surprise: ``There is another way!'' he whispered softly before turning back towards Pilatus again: ``It can only be revealed through suffering! You will find it in the morning!'

As they stood there, looking at each other for what seemed like an eternity, Pontius felt himself being drawn into Jesus' gaze - as if his own eyes were being pulled away from him and replaced with those of another man. He looked down at his feet and then back up again: ``You must not do this,'' he said finally, trying desperately to regain control over what was happening within him. ``I will crucify you!''

Jesus smiled at him once more: ``You cannot stop me from fulfilling my destiny,'' he whispered with a sadness that seemed to fill his whole body - as if it were already too late for them both to turn back now no matter how hard they tried. ``The time has come!''

With those words, Jesus turned away once more and walked up the steps towards Jupiter's temple. He stopped just short of its entrance where he knelt down on one knee before an image of his father - a statue which represented the power and might of Rome itself: ``Father,'' he whispered as he raised his arms up towards heaven, ``I am ready!''

As Jesus spoke these words, Pontius could feel himself being drawn towards him with an unseen force - as if he were being pulled through some invisible gateway that had opened in the heavens above them both: ``You must not do this,'' he said desperately once more. ``I will crucify you!''

But it was already too late: Jesus stood up from his kneeling position and turned around to face Pilatus again - his eyes glittering with a strange light that seemed to fill them both completely: ``The time has come,'' he whispered as if he knew something which neither of them could understand at that moment. ``You cannot stop me!''

With those words, Pontius felt himself being pushed away from Jesus' presence - as if someone were trying desperately to push him off a cliff into an abyss below: ``I will crucify you!'' he shouted once more before turning on his heel and running down the steps towards the Via Sacra.

Behind him, Jesus was already walking up those same steps - towards what seemed like his destiny. ``The time has come,'' Pontius heard him whisper as he turned back once more to face the sky above them both: ``I am ready!''

And with that, Jesus turned and walked into Jupiter's temple without another word - leaving Pontius standing on the steps below where they had just stood together. As if in a dream, Pontius felt himself being pulled towards him again by some unseen force which seemed to be drawing them both through an invisible gateway that had opened up in the heavens above: ``I will crucify you!'' he cried once more as he tried desperately to break free from its grip - but it was already too late for him to turn back now.

Jesus turned around one last time before disappearing into Jupiter's temple: ``You cannot stop me!'' he whispered with a smile that seemed to fill his whole body. And then he was gone, leaving Pontius standing there on the steps below where they had just stood together - feeling lost and alone for what seemed like an eternity.

As time passed, Pilatus began to doubt his own sanity: ``It must have been a
