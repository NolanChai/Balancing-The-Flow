clipsing the moon.

A smile tugs at the corner of my lips. I’m home and I’m safe. There are no strangers here, only friends, brothers and sisters I’ve known all my life. The one who lives on the edge is like a brother to me. We share an unspoken understanding and he understands when I need him, even if it’s not what he wants.

But it wasn’t always this way. Before the war, we were afraid of the edge, afraid of our own shadows. Afraid that they might be like us, with nothing but magic to protect them from the light. So we hunted them down and exterminated their kind, until there was no one left to fear except the darkness inside ourselves.

But now, we live in peace again and I can feel my heart softening toward these creatures that were once our enemies. Perhaps it’s because they remind me so much of myself; creatures who were once hunted by humans but are now being embraced for their unique gifts.
