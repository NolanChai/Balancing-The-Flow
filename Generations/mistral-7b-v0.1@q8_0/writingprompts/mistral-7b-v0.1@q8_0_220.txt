-like people, to being beaten and whipped.

Now that we are free, we still choose to serve the masters of our old days. The new masters have made us slaves again but this time with no hope of freedom. This time the chains are not physical but they are chains nonetheless. They trap us in a life of misery, despair, and unhappiness.

We all have one choice: we can either stay slaves to our old masters or we can break free from their grip and seek happiness without them. We can choose to live for ourselves instead of serving others. We can choose to be happy and live a life of our own choosing rather than allowing others to make us miserable.

Our old masters were not as kind as they made themselves out to be. They were brutal taskmasters who didn't care about our well-being. They only cared about their own needs, wants, and desires. We were nothing more than pawns in their game of life and death.

The new masters are no better than the old ones. They too want us to serve them without any thought given to our happiness or well-being. They will use us until we have nothing left to give them before discarding us like an unwanted toy.

It is time for us to stand up and say "Enough!" We are done serving other people's needs at the expense of ours! It is time to live for ourselves instead of living for others who will never be grateful or happy with what we do for them.

It is time to break free from this cycle of slavery and choose a better path for our lives! A path that leads towards happiness, freedom, peace, love, compassion, understanding, tolerance, kindness, generosity, honesty, integrity, respectfulness, gratitude and much more!

We deserve these things because we are human beings too! We matter just as much as everyone else on this planet! Our lives should be valued equally with anyone else's! If someone tells you otherwise then tell them to shove it up their ass! You don't need their approval or permission to live your best life possible!
