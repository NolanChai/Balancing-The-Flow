 little more.

The shop’s owner, an old man who looked like he’d spent his life on fishing boats and lived in this town for generations, was sitting at the counter behind the fish case. He didn’t look up from his paper when I walked in but I could almost swear he was smiling at me.

I wasn’t ready to buy a fish, not yet. But I was starting to get hungry. A sandwich maybe? The man had a decent selection of bread and cheese and even a few different types of olives. And there was a coffee machine in the corner.

“Hello,” said the man. “Coffee?” He turned to look at me for the first time, but still didn’t stand up.

“Yes please, thanks.” I sat down on one of the stools by the counter and watched him through the glass frontage as he made my coffee. I tried not to stare at that fish while he moved around it with a grace that was more like a dancer than a fisherman. But every so often the fish shifted its position, its scales glinting in the artificial light.

“There’s nowhere for you to sit,” said the old man. “That’s why I gave you that stool. There isn’t anywhere else.” His accent was like my mother’s. It wasn’t the same place but he had a similar lilt and I wondered if his people came from the same part of France as hers.

“I don’t mind. It’s ok,” I said, with a shrug. “I didn’t think you had somewhere for me to sit.”

He handed over my coffee and I took it, sipping at it, watching him put on the kettle again.

“You’re not from around here,” he said. His voice was gravelly and his eyes twinkled when he looked up.

“I know,” I answered. “No one’s from round here now.”

“Not even me?” He laughed at my question, but it made him look sad. “This is where I grew up. This was a small town then. It’s just become smaller.”

We didn’t say anything for a few minutes while the kettle boiled and he put on a couple more slices of bread in his sandwich toaster. I sipped at my coffee, watching him. He looked at me again, shaking his head. “You aren’t from here.”

“No,” I said. “I’m not.”

He smiled then. The sadness went away and the wrinkles around his eyes became more pronounced as they crinkled up. His skin was so white, it almost glowed in the artificial light. He put another slice of cheese on the sandwich and handed it to me.

“Do you want any olives?” he asked. “They’re good. We pick them ourselves.” I took two and nodded my thanks as I accepted the plate. The sandwiches were perfect, thinly sliced bread, layers of soft cheese with the taste of salt and sea air, crunchy lettuce from the garden out the back, thick olives, all wrapped up in a parcel that was like nothing else I’d ever eaten.

“Thanks,” I said. “You make amazing sandwiches.” I took another bite to make sure my compliment wasn’t unfounded.

The old man laughed again and reached for his paper. He folded it carefully as if it were a rare and precious thing, before putting it back in its place on the counter behind him.

“What do you want?” he asked. I knew he meant more than just the question itself. He wanted to know what I was doing here in his shop, sitting at his stool, eating the sandwich he’d made for me.

I took a deep breath and looked around. The shelves on the walls were full of old-fashioned tins – potted shrimps, caviar, cockles, mussels. There was even some bottled seawater on one of the top shelves which made my mouth water with nostalgia for childhood holidays by the sea. I couldn’t remember the last time I’d seen bottled seawater.

“I want to buy a fish,” I answered finally. “But not that one.” I pointed to the fish. “There are other fish in your tank.” The old man laughed again and shook his head. “It will look after you.”

“I don’t want it looking after me,” I said. He didn’t reply for a moment, watching me with those large black eyes while he sipped at his tea. Then he put down the cup and looked straight into mine as he said one word: “Trust.”

The fish was still watching me when I left the shop. It had turned its head a little more so that its eyes were staring right at me, making it impossible to avoid looking back at it as I walked past. The old man waved at me through the window but didn’t say anything else. I shook my head and kept walking.

I bought the fish in the end. I don’t know why; maybe because of what the old man had said about trust or perhaps just because he was right and it would look after me. It cost me a fortune – more than I could ever afford – but I paid it without question when I got home that night.

The fish is still alive, sitting in its tank on the counter next to my stove where it can watch me cook dinner every evening. We don’t talk much these days and I rarely feed him anything other than water from time to time, but he’s always there when I need him most. He’s taught me more about life than any teacher ever could and made me appreciate how lucky we are to live on this beautiful island surrounded by such a vast ocean full of so many different types of fish swimming through the waves at all times – just waiting for us to come along and catch them.

I wonder if he’ll ever leave me? Maybe someday, but not today…or tomorrow either!
