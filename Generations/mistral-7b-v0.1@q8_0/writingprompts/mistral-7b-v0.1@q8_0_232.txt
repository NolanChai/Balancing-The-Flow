ight is enough for me to see clearly that I have a new scar on my right arm. It is a thick jagged line stretching from my wrist up past my elbow. A reminder of a recent mistake. There is no need to hide it, though. That’s what makes the morning chill bearable; the idea that everyone will soon see me as I am and love me anyway.
 
 The sun is coming in stronger now, bouncing off the ocean. I look out on the horizon. The waves roll in endlessly. There are no people around to break the monotony of the sea, so it’s easy for me to lose myself in its rhythm. As I watch, a single seagull breaks the silence. It swoops gracefully across the water and dives headfirst into one of the waves.
 
 I smile. The sun warms my face, but not enough to make me sweat. My smile is just for the seagull and whatever joy it finds in its daily work.
 
 The birds are chirping now, waking up with the sunlight. Soon they will be joined by the other animals of the world: cows mooing, dogs barking, cats yowling. They all have their own voices, and each is as unique as the person who calls them pet names.
 
 The sun climbs higher into the sky, burning away any doubts or insecurities that have been holding me back from living life to its fullest. I stand tall, feeling a sense of pride at how far I have come.
