 formed a chorus that was both beautiful and terrible to hear.

Five minutes passed before he finally found enough strength in himself to stand up from where he lay. Looking around him, he saw corpses piled everywhere, from the sides of the battlefield all the way back to the forest and beyond. The sight made him feel sick to his stomach.

“I am…” he took a deep breath before he continued, “I’m the first of your immortals to fall.” He paused for a moment, allowing the weight of his words to sink in. After a moment, he asked, “You will not give up?”

The woman looked down at her own body, and then back to him. For a long time she was silent before finally saying, “No, I won’t.”

“Then,” he said as he closed his eyes to concentrate on his own breathing for the moment, “I have no choice but to fall again. This time, I will be the last one to die.” He paused once more and then continued with a weak smile. “If you do not give up this time, then perhaps we may meet again in the next life.”

“A thousand years ago,” said the woman in a soft voice that was barely audible over all the noise around them, “I fell at your side in the same way and I was reborn as well. If you’re going to fall now, then so am I. After all this time, can we not be together?”

He opened his eyes slowly to meet hers. At that moment, there were no more sounds of war or death, just their hearts beating in unison. In the end, they fell again — together.
