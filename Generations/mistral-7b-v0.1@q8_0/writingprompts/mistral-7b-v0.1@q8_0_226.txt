yrthing, so there wasn’t much of that either.

The captain, a gruff man named Ryner, kept us in line with his sharp tongue and glaring eye. I knew better than to disrespect him or risk losing my place on the ship, but it didn’t make me like him any more. In fact, i hated him more now than when we first set sail. He had a way of making you feel small and stupid, always correcting what was right and finding fault in everything you said or did.

It wasn’t until the night before we arrived at our destination that Ryner told us where we were going: to the planet Ixion. It was a world with an interesting past – once it had been part of the United Republic but now it belonged to some rebel group called “The Alliance.” Rumor said they had strange technologies and were hostile towards outsiders, but no one knew for sure.

I didn’t want anything to do with them, not even when we landed on their soil. It was all I could do not to jump out of my chair and run away from the ship before Ryner could change his mind about letting us land here at all.
