 grass, waiting for their turn on the plate. For me it's the opposite. I'm not just a little different. I am different. I know no one likes me, but at least I've never been eaten.

### The Gift of Sight - By Diane de Poitiers

It is my eyes that make me see the world around me. But what if they didn't work? Then what? What would I do without them?
I could no longer admire the beautiful landscapes and art, nor read a book or look in the mirror.
How much do I appreciate what I have now? Because one day, it may all change...

### How to become invisible - By Diane de Poitiers

Being invisible can be useful. You can hear things you are not supposed to know and even steal things without being noticed. But is it really worth the trouble of becoming a ghost? I would think twice if I were you, for there is more than one way to become invisible. You could become an object or just a shadow, but that doesn't mean people will no longer see you. It does not necessarily make you invisible.

### The gift of Hearing - By Diane de Poitiers

The gift of hearing is very precious for without it, we could not enjoy the sounds around us nor communicate with anyone else. It would be impossible to listen to music or hear what others say... I believe that if you don't have a sense in your head, you are a zombie, as simple as that!

### The Gift of Touch - By Diane de Poitiers

Have you ever felt something very soft? A soft blanket or the fur of a puppy? Touch is one of the most important senses we have. It gives us the ability to know if something is rough or smooth and even helps us know what we like and don't like. And for some, touch can be dangerous.

### The Gift of Taste - By Diane de Poitiers

Tasting something sweet is great, but imagine never being able to taste anything again. It would mean not being able to enjoy a piece of candy or the crunchy crispness of an apple. Or what about eating a dish you've never eaten before? How can you know if it tastes good or not if your sense of taste is gone forever?

### The Gift of Smell - By Diane de Poitiers

Smelling things is one of our most powerful senses. It can make us feel happy and sad at the same time. It helps us to know if something is rotten or fresh, and when we are hungry. But what about being able to smell things only you can? And I don't mean good or bad smells. I mean smelling something that no one else can see or smell...

### The Gift of Sight - By Diane de Poitiers

Seeing is very important. It helps us to know what's going on around us and if there are any dangers. But without our eyes, we would not see a single thing. Imagine being able to only see things no one else can! That could be pretty scary. What if everyone could see the things you see? Would they think you were a ghost or crazy?

### The Gift of Hearing - By Diane de Poitiers

Having the ability to hear is one of our most important senses. It helps us know if something is dangerous and to communicate with others. But without it, we could no longer hear a song or even listen to a friend talk. That would be a lonely life... But what about being able to hear things other people cannot? What if you were the only one who could hear something that everyone else thought was just their imagination?

### The Gift of Touch - By Diane de Poitiers

The gift of touch is a wonderful thing. It helps us to know if something is rough or smooth and even tells us what we like or don't like. But without it, you could not know if an object is hot or cold... So, I think that it would be best to always have our senses because there are some things in life that you need them for!

### The Gift of Taste - By Diane de Poitiers

The gift of taste is one that we all take for granted. It helps us to know if something is sweet or sour and even tells us if food has gone bad. But without it, you could not enjoy a piece of candy or the crispness of an apple... So, I think that it would be best to always have our senses because there are some things in life that you need them for!
