 that. But he had to do it.
The warehouse looked like any other in New York City. An old factory turned into a building. No one really gave them a second glance, and no one ever went inside. So when a black SUV pulled up and a man in an expensive suit got out and walked in, people took notice. Not for long though. He didn't want to be seen.
Carson lit another cigarette as the man came back out of the warehouse. "I thought you were going to be here by 5," Carson said to him, looking at his watch.
"It was a little tougher then I thought it would be." He put his hands in his pockets and leaned against the car with him. "How are we doing on getting out of here?" he asked. The man pulled a gun out from his pocket. Carson took a few steps back. It was time for him to do his job.
"This is how it goes down," Carson said, handing over a small package. The man nodded, put the gun away and got in the car. "Drive around the block and meet me at the corner of 18th street."
Carson walked back into the warehouse to finish his job.
