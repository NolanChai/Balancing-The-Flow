 this city of eighty million people, its maze-like streets and labyrinthine alleys, he wondered what the hell he had gotten himself into.

There was no way out for James McGregor, who was forty-three years old, six feet tall with graying brown hair. He looked like a youngish college professor and was dressed in an outfit that made him look even more like one: dark blue suit, white shirt, red necktie. A large briefcase dangled from his left arm. The briefcase contained his life savings—his entire worldly possessions—and he couldn ’ t leave it behind if he were to survive his trip from Pudong International Airport into the city proper.

He was too far out in the suburbs, where the air was still relatively clear and the smell of horse shit less overpowering than on the streets of downtown Shanghai. He had to walk a long way before he could find a taxi. It was nearly 11 P.M., after dark, and the night-time traffic made it hard for him to get his bearings. The street lights were weak, and he walked past dozens of cars that were honking at each other, but few people were on the street. He turned down one wrong alley after another before finally finding a taxi.

The streets were still crowded when the cab pulled up in front of McGregor ’ s hotel. As he got out, McGregor noticed that there was no doorman to open the door for him. Instead, he had to push his way through the revolving door and enter the lobby, where a receptionist sat behind a counter with a plate of pineapple wedges in front of her. He handed over his passport and the hotel clerk gave him a key. She didn ’ t even bother asking for money.

James McGregor looked around at the surroundings. There were no windows in the lobby, only fluorescent lights that cast an eerie glow on the walls and furniture. The carpet was dirty, and it was covered with cigarette butts. He turned to look at his room number, 1206, and then he walked down the long hallway. When he opened his door he saw a double bed with a plastic cover over it, two night tables beside it, and another table in front of the windowless wall that faced onto an alley outside.

The window was closed but he could hear traffic noise from outside: cars honking, motorcycles buzzing by, people shouting. He flipped on the television to watch some CCTV news broadcasts with their heavy-handed propaganda about how wonderful China had become under the Communist Party ’ s leadership. Then he lay down on the bed and tried to sleep. But it was difficult for him to get comfortable in such an unfamiliar environment, so he turned off the TV and stared at the ceiling until his eyes were nearly closed when suddenly he heard someone knocking at his door.

It was 1:30 a.m., and James McGregor had just fallen asleep when he opened the door to find two policemen standing there. They didn’t say anything but they motioned him outside with their fingers and pushed him towards the elevator. There were no lights in the hallway so it was very dark.

McGregor could feel their guns pressed against his back as they walked down the corridor, turning left and right at random. Then they stopped in front of another door that had a sign over it saying “No Vacancy.” They opened the door with one hand while holding him in place with another hand around his neck, and pushed him inside. It was dark inside but McGregor could see someone sitting on a bed reading a newspaper. The man looked up at him and said something that sounded like “Good morning,” before returning to his paper.

“I’m sorry but I don’t speak Chinese very well.” McGregor replied in English as he sat down on the other bed which was covered with dirty sheets and pillows without pillowcases. The room had no windows, only a door leading into another room where there was also no window. He noticed an alarm clock on the night table beside him that read “9:30,” even though it wasn’t daylight yet outside. Then he saw something else on the nightstand: a picture of Mao Zedong hanging next to one of Deng Xiaoping, both framed in red velvet and with golden frames around them. He had no idea what these people were doing here or why they wanted him dead but he knew that if he tried to leave this room alive he would be killed by the police.

It was very hot inside this small room so McGregor took off his jacket, unbuttoned his shirt and rolled up his sleeves before lying down on one side of the bed with his back toward the door. He could hear someone moving around outside but couldn’t see anything except shadows moving around in front of him.

After a while McGregor began to feel sleepy again so he closed his eyes and drifted off into another dreamless sleep until he woke up several hours later at 7:30 am when there was still darkness outside. The man who had been reading a newspaper before had gone away sometime during the night but someone else was sitting on McGregor’s bed now, looking at him intently with his eyes wide open and his face pale and sweating profusely.

McGregor looked over at the door where he saw two policemen standing there with their guns drawn again pointing them toward him while another policeman held up an ID card that said “Police” in Chinese characters on one side of it. The man sitting on McGregor’s bed stood up slowly then took out a pair of scissors from his pocket and started cutting off all his hair until he was completely bald before putting away the scissors again behind him without looking back at McGregor who closed his eyes tightly as if trying to block out what he had just seen with his mind’s eye before opening them again slowly then getting up from where he sat on the edge of his bed before walking over to the door and opening it carefully while keeping his eyes closed tightly as he stepped outside into bright sunlight.

He found himself in an alleyway filled with garbage bags piled high next to each other against one wall so that they almost touched each other at their tops but not quite so there was room for him to walk between them if he wanted without getting too close to any particular bag or pile of trash but still close enough to smell what was inside them which was mostly rotting food scraps mixed together with feces and urine from animals who lived here along with rats crawling around everywhere trying not be seen by anyone passing by so they could get some peace but knowing that no one would ever look at them anyway because nobody cared about their existence except those who didn’t want them living near them so they tried very hard not let themselves be seen even though they knew it was impossible for them to do so since every time someone looked directly into an area where there were rats scurrying around inside it would attract more attention from others looking into that same area which meant more people saw more rats crawling through garbage bags filled with rotting food scraps mixed together with feces and urine before finally dying after being hit by cars driving by on the streets above them.

McGregor walked slowly towards a building where he could see several women sitting outside smoking cigarettes while eating rice balls out of paper boxes they bought from street vendors selling them on every corner of the city. They looked up at him as he passed by then continued talking among themselves about how much money they needed to pay their landlords before returning back inside where it was dark and quiet except for their own voices which could only be heard when someone shouted loudly enough that everyone else would stop what they were doing just long enough to turn around so they could find out who had spoken but then continue talking again as soon as whoever spoke returned back into whatever room or alleyway he came from before rejoining the others outside again where things went back exactly like they did before except now it was someone else’s turn instead of his own so there wasn’t anything special about what happened this time around either but still made him feel uncomfortable since all these people knew each other very well even though nobody actually knew who anyone else was or why any particular person had chosen to spend his life living among others like himself instead choosing instead live alone somewhere else where nobody knew him at all except those few friends he met through work when he first arrived here two years ago after leaving his last job behind in another city where everyone already knew him well enough so no one needed an introduction anymore because everybody already knew what kind of person was being introduced before anyone else could say anything about them anyway so now nobody would even bother asking questions anymore except maybe asking if somebody wanted some tea instead which wasn’t really a question at all but more like an invitation than anything else since there wasn’t really any reason why anyone should want some tea unless they were already thirsty before getting invited in by someone else who was offering them some kind of drink just so everyone would stop talking about everything else that happened earlier today except now they didn’t have time anymore anyway because someone had shouted something out loud enough that made everybody stop doing whatever it was they were doing long enough to turn around again until whoever spoke returned back inside where it wasn’t too dark anymore because there weren’t any windows anywhere near where anyone lived anymore since nobody really cared about what other people might think anymore except those few friends who had already come together beforehand just so nobody else would feel left out either way even though nothing much happened anyway after that except everyone went back inside again after everything calmed down again
