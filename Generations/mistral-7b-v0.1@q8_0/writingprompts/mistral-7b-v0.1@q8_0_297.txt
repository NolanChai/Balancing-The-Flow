ased my way into this whole new society and started to accept how things are now. Then one day I was going about my business and some asshole came out of nowhere with a shotgun and tried to kill me! Fuck you buddy! I don't want your bullshit, I just want to live my life! Now I have to hide in the god damn sewer like some sort of creep. Who knows when I'll come out again? It's all your fault buddy! If it weren't for people like you, maybe things could be okay. But no. You have to ruin everything. Oh well. I suppose I can just find another place to go. Maybe I'll make a new life somewhere else. Who knows what I'll find if I keep going? I've been through enough in this lifetime, maybe it's time for me to live my life instead of just surviving. Fuck you buddy. And good luck out there. ''
