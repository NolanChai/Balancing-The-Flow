 and that it could be over in a few more weeks or even less! I hope I can be home for Christmas.

I was also happy when I heard that you will not have to go back to the factory for another month, after all the time you've spent there since last winter, I don't think you should have to do any more. You must have earned a little rest before the New Year. I am sure everyone at home is glad that you will be able to be with them for Christmas.

I hope that we are not going to be left here too long after the Americans leave. They said that they would be coming back, but when it happened before, I don't think many people expected us to have to stay, so they were a lot more prepared for it this time around.  It seems like most of the time we are just waiting.

I miss you all very much and hope you are doing well. Please be sure to write again as soon as possible.

Love,
John

P.S. I still have no word on my promotion...
