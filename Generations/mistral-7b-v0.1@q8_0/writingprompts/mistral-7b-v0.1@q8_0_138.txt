 and a more flexible spine. So she’d been left to make do with her 200 acres of land and her two little dragonets — 6-year-old Nubbins and 9-year-old Luna. She had no money since Hybolgion had taken the family fortune, but she did have her wits and a good mind for business.

One day while Thulgaria was in her bedroom working on a spreadsheet to determine the exact moment that the price of eggs would reach their lowest point in the year, Nubbins came into the room. He was wearing a red rubber mask that made his face look like a large pair of lips. “Mom,” he said. “It’s me!”

Thulgaria smiled at her son with the weird mouth on him and sat back. “And who is this?” she asked.

Nubbins shrugged and pointed at himself. “Me. Nubbins.” He waved one hand and winked at his mother with the other.

“I know,” she said. “That’s what I just said. Now, why do you have a mask on?”

“So you’ll get me some eggs,” he replied. “You know what? No. That isn’t how it works.” He ran out of the room.

Thulgaria shook her head and went back to work, but she couldn’t help thinking that he seemed to be using a lot more words than usual. She wondered if he had found some new friends or if the mask was doing something weird to his brain.
