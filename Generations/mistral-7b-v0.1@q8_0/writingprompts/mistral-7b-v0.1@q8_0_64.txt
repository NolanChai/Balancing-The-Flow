 that was an embarrassment (I met a guy named "Kimberley," who had a profile picture taken from above at waist level while he was wearing nothing but women's lingerie). My friends have suggested therapy and self-help books, but I think it's because they just want me to shut up about my lack of sex.

My sister has been telling me about this guy she met through her friend; she says he is kind and sweet, with a job that sounds promising and an education to boot. But whenever I bring him up to her, all she can say is "He's not Jewish!" (I am.) And it makes me sad -- because, well, I'm not really looking for love, just sex.

But I don't even know how to get sex anymore.

Dear TB:

You must be kidding. This is so easy, it should make you blush with shame. First, start by becoming a woman, rather than some kind of self-flagellating, self-absorbed asshole. Second, get the fuck over yourself. Seriously, who does this? And, to the extent that there are people out there like you, I hate them all.

You know what else? You should be ashamed because this is a real person's life you are fucking with. Do you have any idea how hard it can be just to find someone to go to dinner with -- let alone the sex part?!

You don't even deserve to masturbate at this point, but if you must, I suggest finding a woman with a strong moral sense, preferably a feminist. That way, she will make sure you know that this is not about you being deprived of sex -- this is about your treatment of another human being (I mean, you would never do this to another person's dog, right?). And then I suggest you go buy yourself a ticket to Haiti where, if you are lucky, a real woman will beat the shit out of you.
