IGHT in there-''
 
 I didn 't wait. My voice rose with fear and frustration as I insisted again;
 
 `` No. Don't. They're dead.''
 
 Her face turned angry, then suddenly she was crying. 
 
 `` But they could be alive! Please? If we just go in...'' She didn 't finish the sentence, but looked up at me with her big eyes, her plea written all over her face. I stared back, as silent as if it were only a few minutes since my last words; I felt my eyes begin to fill and sting, but I managed to hold it together.
 
 `` Claire...'' I said gently, looking at the floor beside her, trying to keep my voice from wavering. She looked up again, the tears falling down her face like they were ready to wash them both away. 
 
``I'm so sorry,'' I began, not knowing how else to say it. ``But...I don 't think we could get in there.'' She gasped and sat back again, clutching her knees with her hands, hiding her face. The tears came harder now, but she said nothing.
 
`` I'm so sorry,'' I whispered again. I reached out to touch her head gently, but she pushed me away. I looked down again, my eyes stinging and blurry from the sudden emotions. I let myself think of them, my brother and sister. I saw their faces in my mind's eye, trying not to remember the last time I had seen them alive.
 
 It was a normal day, and I had come back from school. Mom was cooking dinner in the kitchen as usual, and dad was out of town on business. The three of us were sitting down to watch our favorite show when we heard a loud noise coming from the garage. It sounded like something falling over or slamming into the wall. My brother and sister ran to go check it out, leaving me alone with mom in the living room. 
 
 A few minutes later my brother came running back inside, yelling that our dog had gotten out of the yard again. I followed him outside as he ran after him through the neighborhood, calling his name until we caught up to him just down the block. The dog looked relieved when he saw us, but then started running away again before I could grab him by the collar. 
 
 ``Oh no,'' mom said when she came out and saw what was going on. She ran after my brother too, and soon all three of them were running around in circles trying to catch this pesky animal that kept getting away from them every time they tried to hold onto him. I watched them from the driveway, laughing at their antics while trying not to think about how scared and confused they looked. 
 
 They finally caught up with the dog again after a few minutes of chasing him all over town - but this time they managed to get him inside his cage before he could escape again! We celebrated by having ice cream for dinner, which made us all feel much better about what had happened earlier that afternoon. 
 
 I still remember how happy my brother and sister seemed after getting their dog back safe and sound - even if it meant they had to go through some trouble first. I wish I could see them again, but now I know why we can't.
`` I'm so sorry,'' I whispered once more before turning away from her. She didn 't say anything else after that; instead she just sat there quietly for a few minutes until finally getting up and walking towards the door of the cabin. 
 
I followed her outside, trying not to think about what had happened inside the cabin or how much my life would change now that they were gone. It was difficult for me to keep my eyes dry as she opened the door and walked out into the cold winter air without even looking back at me. I watched her walk away down the path towards town until eventually she disappeared from sight completely...
