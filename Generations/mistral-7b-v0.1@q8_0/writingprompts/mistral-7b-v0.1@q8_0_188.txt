ed teens to race their cars on late into the night. That is exactly what they did. On this particular Saturday evening, we were all tucked up in bed when our neighbour's 5 year old little boy wandered over to our house, knocked on my window and woke me up to tell me that his parents were asleep upstairs and he was scared.
 
I called the cops, told them what was going on and then called his parents (who thankfully weren't sleeping). Turns out they had left him alone with a sitter who had fallen asleep and not heard the kid's screams of terror when the car went past.
 
They were all right in the end but it scared the crap out of that poor little boy.
