tric pattersn in design and have found it really satisfying to incorporate them into my art. In fact, this piece is basically a collection of patterns.  It was pretty fun to come up with a bunch of patterns that could be incorporated into the background without getting too busy looking or distracting from the subject matter of the piece.

 I wanted to use some different shading techniques on this one as well. In previous pieces, I have used blending to create depth and variation in color in my characters. However, I felt like I could get a little more interesting results by using color gradients rather than just straight colors.
