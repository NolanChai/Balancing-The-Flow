-member me when I come home. We lived in the big house next door. The lady who owned it died, and a lawyer took her place. He didn't like cats, so he got rid of us. Then he sold the house, and all my new friends had to move.
 
 I miss you very much, and if you are still around, maybe we can be together again some day.
 
 Love,
 
 Sparky
 
 P. S. Tell Dad I've always loved him, too.
