 along a flip-phone too.

It was my first day in office, and I'd been set up a new PC on a desk, surrounded by all these people I didn't know, trying to get me connected to the company's IT systems. "What do you have?" someone would shout over from another table or cubicle. "Got it!" would come the response after I'd typed in some login details and had them check the connection was working.

"What about this one, then?" they'd ask. The laptop was next - same process, same result. "All set," came the call from over the top of my screen. A few more questions about what type of phone I owned followed, before they realised that they had nothing to hook it up to at that point and gave up.

It was all so quick - a new laptop connected in minutes and off I went to my first meeting. But those are not the days any longer. Now, it's much more complicated. And we have more devices. A lot more devices. The average household now has three computers, two TVs, two phones, one tablet, one portable games machine, a music player or three, and a DVD or Blu-ray player, not to mention the various smart appliances scattered about that connect to your home Wi-Fi network too.

Add in things like game consoles, media streamers, printers, scanners, and other gadgets you can think of, and the number gets higher still. The average person owns eight devices - but you've got 14. You may not even realise it. And that's a problem for the world we live in now.

### Connectivity is king

You see, all those gadgets need to connect to each other and the internet, and that can be a headache - especially if they don't do it seamlessly, or you have to manually change settings every time you switch from one device to another.

Sometimes, even getting them connected is a pain in the arse: you plug one into your router via an Ethernet cable only to discover that there aren't enough sockets left because some of the other ones need to be unplugged before they can be moved elsewhere; or, when you get to the Wi-Fi settings and see the list of available networks, you realise you have so many different devices that you don't recognise most of them.

Things are only going to get worse too: with Google Fiber promising super-fast speeds (and the UK also likely to benefit from this kind of network) and a new generation of Internet of Things products hitting the shelves soon, we're going to need all our devices to connect to everything else without any fuss.

The good news is that it's not too late - there are some gadgets out there that will help you manage your internet connection better so that things run much smoother. They won't magically make all the problems disappear, but they will simplify a few of them.

### Your home hub

First off, there's the BT Home Hub 5. This is your standard router: a little box that connects to your internet provider and allows other devices to share the connection with each other. It's usually supplied free by your ISP when you sign up for broadband, but it tends not to be the most powerful one on the market (so you might get drop-outs in signal strength when you move around the house), and they don't offer a lot of advanced features either.

The Hub 5 from BT is different: it has a quad-core processor that can handle faster speeds than its predecessors, it supports Wi-Fi AC (the fastest standard currently available on consumer routers) for better coverage, it comes with five Ethernet sockets instead of the usual four so you can connect more devices, and there's 256GB of storage built in so that your home network can automatically back up any files you need.

It also has a built-in smartphone app, which means you can control it from anywhere using an iOS or Android device; plus BT is offering free access to its wi-fi hotspots across the country for the next three years too. The only real downside here is that it's exclusive to BT customers and won't work with other internet providers - so if you don't already have a BT Broadband package, you'll need to sign up before you can get one.

If you're looking for something a bit more flexible though - or perhaps want to move away from using the BT network at all (and if you live in an area with poor coverage, this might be worth considering) - then the Netgear R6400 is another good option. Like the Hub 5, it's one of the few routers on the market that supports Wi-Fi AC and comes with a quad-core processor for fast speeds, but it can also act as your home server too.

The built-in ReadySHARE Vault app means you can automatically back up photos from any mobile devices connected to the network without needing to plug them in or go through a separate setup process (it also supports Dropbox and Google Drive for cloud storage); there's a USB 3.0 port so you can connect hard drives, flash drives, or other storage media for easy file sharing; and it has four Gigabit Ethernet ports too.

The biggest selling point here though is the ReadyCLOUD feature which lets you access any files on your computer (or other connected devices) from anywhere with an internet connection. So if you've got photos or documents stored at home that someone else wants to see, they can log in and view them without needing physical access to your PC first - and this also means that anything important won't be lost if your router dies while you're away.

If you want something even more powerful though, then the Apple Airport Extreme is another good option - particularly if you already own an iPhone or iPad. It has three Ethernet ports (one of which supports 10/100/1000Mbps connections) so it can be connected directly to your modem and computer for fast wired speeds; there are two USB ports on the back as well if you want to connect external storage media too.

But where this router really shines is in its support for iOS devices: with iCloud integration, any files stored in iCloud Drive will automatically be synced across all your Apple devices via the Airport network (and vice versa); you can stream music from iTunes or play games wirelessly over AirPlay; and if someone wants to print something out then they can do it directly from their iPad without needing an additional printer setup.

The downside here is that because this router only supports Wi-Fi N speeds instead of AC like the others we've mentioned so far, you might struggle if there are lots of other people using the same network at once - but for most homes it will still be plenty fast enough for browsing and streaming videos.

### Managing multiple connections

If your house is full of devices that all connect to the internet (like gaming consoles or smart TVs) then you might also find yourself running out of bandwidth very quickly if they're all trying to do things at once - which means either everyone has to share their time on the network, or each device will have slower speeds while others are using it.

So what can you do about this? Well, there are a few different options available depending on how many devices need managing together: if you only want to manage one or two things at once then getting yourself an app like Wifi Analyzer will allow you to see which channels are busier than others (and whether any nearby networks might be interfering). This lets you move your router closer or further away from those other routers so that their signal doesn't conflict with yours.

If it's more than just a couple of items though - like say if there's a smart fridge connected as well - then you may want to consider getting yourself an app like Wifi Master Key which gives users control over how much bandwidth each device is allowed to use by setting priorities based on their importance within the house.

For example, someone watching Netflix might be given higher priority than another user who's just browsing Facebook - this way they won't have slow speeds when trying to do anything else important while others are using up all their bandwidth instead. And if you really don't want anyone else using your Wi-Fi then you could even set up guest networks so that visitors have no access at all without needing passwords first.

### Gadget control

As well as managing multiple connections though, sometimes people need help controlling individual gadgets too - particularly when it comes to things like printers and scanners which can be tricky if they're not set up properly in the first place (or don't work properly anymore). The solution here is something called a USB printer share server: these little boxes plug into your router via Ethernet cable before being connected wirelessly with other devices so that anyone else who needs one has access without having to go through all the hassle of setting up another new account first.

They also let users print from their own computers as well - so if someone wants to send a document over then they don't have to worry about getting it onto their phone or tablet first before being able to use the printer; instead, they just need to open up the software on their laptop and off they go
