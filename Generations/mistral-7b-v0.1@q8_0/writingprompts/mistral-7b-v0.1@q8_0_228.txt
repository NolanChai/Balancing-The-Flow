 elf replied. `` The law of the land says that a contract is only enforceable if the parties are of sound mind at the time they sign it.'' He gestured to the crate again. `` When you signed this one, though...''
 
 Santa sighed. `` I know, I was drunk, and he took advantage of me. But what good does it do to sue him now?''
 
 
 The elf thought for a minute. `` Well, there is this.'' He held out the contract again and pointed to a clause near the end.
 
 `` What about it?'' Santa asked.
 
 
 
 `` It says that if you are unable or unwilling to perform your obligation under this contract, you shall return all funds received under this agreement. If not,'' the elf continued with a grin, `` The other party shall be entitled to collect all damages.''
`` What's that mean?'' Santa asked again. He knew where this was going now.
 
 `` It means they owe me 7.6 billion dollars,'' the elf said as he flipped over the contract and smiled at Santa.
 
``Ho ho ho!'', Santa said cheerily, but his heart sank. Seven point six BILLION dollars? What could he do to pay that off? It wasn't just a matter of giving them a credit card number either. They wouldn't have the time or manpower to put a lien against him and the process would take years. Besides, even if they did manage it, all they'd end up with was a judgment in their favor... And Santa already knew that he couldn't pay even his current debts! No matter what happened here, he still wouldn't be able to afford a lawyer...
``Oh well,'' Santa thought as he picked up the crate again and walked it towards his car. ``At least I got my old self back. ''
