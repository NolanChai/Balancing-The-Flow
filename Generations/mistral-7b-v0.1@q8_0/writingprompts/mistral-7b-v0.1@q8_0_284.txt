 in the middle of a giant rocky planet full of lush life and massive creatures? Yeah, that’d be weird.

And the first thing the aliens did was shoot at us with a gigantic energy beam? Yeah, that’s some weird shit right there!

I mean, imagine if you had no concept of how big things actually were in reality and suddenly you saw what looked to be the size of a small asteroid. I think we’d probably all freak out as well.
