th is with me, he will watch our sixes while I go in after the money.''
`Yes sir' they chorused.
With that I moved out, Jareth behind me and Todd bringing up the rear. We kept to the shadows as we walked around the back of the bank and up the fire exit steps to the roof. Jareth looked around at our surroundings.
``No cameras, no guards, no alarms? This place must be a ghost town.''
I nodded in agreement. We made our way down the hallway, taking the stairs two at a time, until we were overlooking the bank floor. The teller stations stood empty and the only sign of life was the two tellers sitting behind the counter in the middle of the floor. Jareth turned to me.
``Ready?''
I nodded. Jareth took aim with his rifle as I moved forward, taking down one teller with a shot through her neck and another through the temple before she could react. The two men that came rushing over with guns drawn weren't any better off than their colleagues, they both went down in a hail of bullets after Jareth took them out. The two women cowering behind the counter looked up at me as I walked over to them, pulling back their heads by the hair and pointing my rifle at their faces.
``Give me your account numbers or I'll start putting holes in you.''
I saw recognition dawn on one of their faces before they both began yelling out the numbers. I turned to Jareth.
``Now for the safe.''
