 and glanced away from his eyes. 
 
 `` We got the results of your bloodwork back.'' He leaned in, lowering his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. `` It is very important that you hear this directly from me.'' 
 
 `` Okay,'' I said, smiling again. 
 
 `` You have cancer.'' 
 
 The room tilted and spun and my stomach rose up into my throat. 
 
 `` *What?'* I whispered, feeling sick. 
 
 He took a moment to gather his thoughts before continuing. 
 
 `` Your bloodwork came back positive for pancreatic cancer.'' 
 
 My ears rang with the words that were not coming out of my mouth. I blinked away tears and held my breath, waiting for the doctor to continue. 
 
 He hesitated.
 
 I exhaled. 
 
 `` Mrs. Jacobs, do you have any questions?'' 
 
 `` No,'' I said.
``Doctor, what does that mean? What are we going to do about it?'' My voice sounded flat and lifeless.
``Well, the only way to confirm the diagnosis is to remove your pancreas.'' 
 
 I nodded. The room was still spinning. I blinked my eyes as tears streamed down my cheeks. 
``When?'' 
 
 He smiled weakly. ``I have a bed available right away, if you want.''
``I'll come back tomorrow morning,'' I said, wiping the tears from my face. ``Is there anything you can tell me now about how long I will live? What kind of treatment options are there?'' 
 
 He shook his head. ``No. I can't give you any information on that.'' 
``Can you recommend someone who can help us figure out the best course of action for my care? I don't want to be in pain or suffer needlessly.'' My eyes were getting puffy and red from crying but I couldn't stop. ``I know there are new treatments coming on the market that might improve my quality of life.'' 
``I'll see what I can do,'' he said, taking a step back and looking at me with pity in his eyes. 
 
 I nodded again, not knowing if it was out of politeness or because I truly understood what he was saying. ``Thank you for everything, Doctor.'' My voice quivered on the last word as I stood up from my chair. 
 
 He shook my hand and smiled weakly before turning to leave. As he walked away I felt a coldness sweep over me like a wave of ice-cold water. 
 
 I was alone again, with only death for company.
