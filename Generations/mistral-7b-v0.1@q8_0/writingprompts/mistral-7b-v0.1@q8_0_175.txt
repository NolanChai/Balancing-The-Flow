`` No! Not now.'' he shouted, then turned back to the computer monitor.  
`` The satellite picked up an anomaly on the surface of Mars, it is showing signs that there may be life on the planet.'' 
 `` Life on Mars? It's just a desert with rust colored rocks,'' Edmunds grunted.

 `` No, not life as you know it. Micro-organisms, I believe we should study them further to see if they are capable of reproduction. ''
`` You're telling me you want to go to Mars because of a single bacteria? That is what you just said?'' Edmunds exploded.  `` Go tell your bosses that you saw something interesting on the monitor.''

Edmunds threw a piece of paper in Johannes' direction and stormed out of his office, slamming the door behind him as he did so. Johannes took a deep breath before picking up the piece of paper off of his desk. It was a printed copy of his grant proposal, written for his upcoming trip to Mars. 
He knew it would be hard to get funding for such an unorthodox project but if he got approval he would get to see what was on that satellite image.  
 He sat in the chair behind the desk and thought about the last few weeks.   
``What happened?'' he asked himself, ``Why did Dr. Edmunds blow up like that?'' 
It had been a long week of planning for his proposal so it was surprising when Edmunds barged into his office to say how impressed he was with his findings. He knew the information he gathered would help him get approval and funding for his trip, but it wasn't what he expected. 
He read through the proposal again and realized that Dr. Edmunds was right about one thing- his hypothesis on life on Mars was unorthodox.  

``I need to talk to Dr. Edmunds about this, I think I can convince him that my research is important,'' thought Johannes as he got up from the chair. ``Maybe we can go into space together.''
 He walked out of his office, taking care not to slam the door behind him like his boss did earlier, and headed for Dr. Edmunds's office across the hall.
``Dr. Edmunds?'' Johannes called out as he knocked on the door. There was no answer so Johannes entered the room only to find that Dr. Edmunds had already left for the day. ``Well at least I have another week to convince him,'' thought Johannes as he started to gather his things and leave. 
``What are you doing? You don't need to be here anymore!'' shouted a voice from behind Johannes.  

He turned around to see Dr. Edmunds standing in the door. ``I'm leaving, I thought we could talk about my proposal tomorrow.'' Johannes explained as he started walking towards the door. 
``No you don't!'', screamed Dr. Edmunds, his face turning red with anger. ``You'll never get funding for that project!'' 
Johannes stopped in his tracks and turned to face the angry scientist. ``Why not? What is wrong with my proposal?''
Dr. Edmunds took a deep breath before answering. ``Because your hypothesis on life on Mars is ridiculous! It's just a desert with rust colored rocks, there is no way anything could live there!''. 
``But what about the satellite image?'' Johannes asked defensively, pointing at the computer screen behind him. 
 Dr. Edmunds took a step towards Johannes and put his finger in his face. ``That was an anomaly! It doesn't mean anything!'' He screamed before storming out of the room.  

``I can't believe he said that,'' thought Johannes as he watched Dr. Edmunds leave. 
He looked back at the computer screen, trying to make sense of what had just happened. ``I guess I'll have to find another way to convince him.'' He picked up his things and left the room, feeling more determined than ever to prove that life on Mars is possible.   
``Johannes!'' yelled a voice from behind him. 
He turned around to see Dr. Edmunds standing in the doorway of his office. ``You need to come with me,'' he said urgently. 
``What do you mean?'' asked Johannes as they started walking down the hallway towards Dr. Edmunds's office.  

``There has been a change of plans. We are leaving for Mars right now.''   
Johannes didn't know what to say, he was still trying to process everything that had just happened. ``Are you sure?'' he asked nervously as they entered Dr. Edmunds's office.  
``Yes. Pack your things, we are leaving in an hour.'' replied Dr. Edmunds without looking up from his computer screen. Johannes felt like he was in a dream, but knew this was real. ``What about my proposal?'' he asked. 
Dr. Edmunds turned to face him and said, ``You will present your findings when we return.'' 
``But-'' started Johannes, but Dr. Edmunds cut him off.  
``I don't have time for this right now! Get packing, we need to go!''.  
Johannes felt like he was being pushed out of the office, but he knew that Dr. Edmunds was serious. He quickly grabbed his things and followed Dr. Edmunds out of the room. ``We are leaving for Mars in one hour.'' Johannes repeated nervously as they entered the elevator.  
``Yes, I know,'' replied Dr. Edmunds without looking up from his computer screen. 
Johannes felt like he was in a daze, but knew that this was real. They reached the ground floor of the building and stepped outside into the bright sunlight. ``Where are we going?'' asked Johannes as they started walking towards the parking lot.   
``To the spaceport,'' replied Dr. Edmunds without looking up from his computer screen. 
``The spaceport? But that's hours away!'' exclaimed Johannes, feeling more and more confused by the minute.  
Dr. Edmunds turned to face him and said, ``We have a spaceship waiting for us. It will take us to Mars in no time.'' 
Johannes couldn't believe what he was hearing. ``A spaceship? But how-'' started Johannes, but Dr. Edmunds cut him off.  
``I don't have time for this right now! Get in the car and we will talk about it on the way to the spaceport.''.   
Johannes felt like he was being pushed into the car, but knew that Dr. Edmunds was serious. They drove through the city streets towards the outskirts of town where they would find the spaceport. ``Dr. Edmunds, I still don't understand what is happening,'' said Johannes nervously as they pulled up to a large metal building with a sign that said `Spaceport'.   
``We are going to Mars in an hour,'' replied Dr. Edmunds without looking up from his computer screen. 
Johannes felt like he was being pushed out of the car, but knew that Dr. Edmunds was serious. They walked through the metal doors and into the spaceport building. ``Welcome to the Spaceport,'' said a man in uniform as they approached him.  
``We are here to see Dr. Edmunds.'' replied Dr. Edmunds without looking up from his computer screen.   
The man looked at them both, then turned and walked down a long hallway until he reached an office door. He opened the door and said, ``Dr. Edmunds is waiting for you in his office.'' 
``Thank you,'' replied Dr. Edmunds as they entered the office. Johannes felt like he was being pushed into the chair in front of Dr. Edmunds's desk, but knew that Dr. Edmunds was serious. ``Dr. Edmunds, I still don't understand what is happening,'' said Johannes nervously as Dr. Edmunds sat down at his computer screen.   
``We are leaving for Mars in one hour.'' replied Dr. Edmunds without looking up from his computer screen.  
``But why? And how?'' asked Johannes, feeling more confused than ever before.  
Dr. Edmunds looked up from his computer screen and said, ``Because our planet is dying and we need to find a new one.'' 
``What?'' exclaimed Johannes, feeling like he was in a dream.  ``But Mars is-'' started Johannes but Dr. Edmunds cut him off.   
``Yes I know what you are thinking and no it isn't dead yet.'' replied Dr. Edmunds without looking up from his computer screen.   
``Dr. Edmunds, what are you talking about?'' asked Johannes nervously as he leaned forward in his chair.  
``The Earth is dying,'' said Dr. Edmunds without looking up from his computer screen.  ``We need to find a new planet to live on and Mars is the best candidate.'' 
``But why us?'' asked Johannes, feeling more confused than ever before.
