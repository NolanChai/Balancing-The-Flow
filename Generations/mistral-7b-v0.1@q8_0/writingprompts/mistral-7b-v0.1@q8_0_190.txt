ail the customs office and have all your documentation in order. On arrival please disembark on the left. Have a nice day and welcome to earth, we hope you enjoy your stay.``

This is one of two videos I am doing for my latest video project. It is about my experience in making this video. This is a documentary type video with no commentary but with a voiceover track playing over the top. It is also accompanied by music and visual effects. It is currently being edited and I hope to have it finished very soon. Please subscribe if you like what you see!
