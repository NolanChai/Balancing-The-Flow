ank and it was damn right scary, 
 But on that day I’m just going to say; “I just didn’t care”.  
 
 
 My face was painted red and green, 
 That’s not because the fireworks had burned my eyes or anything that would seem. 
 
 
 I was walking down a narrow street, 
 It wasn’t even that cold, but then again it wasn’t that hot either. 
 
 
 The air was thick with smoke and fumes, 
 But that didn’t stop me from being out in the gloom. 
 
 
 I think I must have been insane, 
 To walk through London on that night.
