udge downstairs to face the inevitable.

I was up late last night watching videos on YouTube when I remembered I had some work to catch up on that I wasn't able to finish earlier in the day due to the fact that my laptop froze as soon as I opened it. I've had this computer for almost two years now and it has been working fine until now. As the day progressed, I was getting more frustrated with how long this simple task would take, so much that I just decided to put the work aside and play some video games instead.

So here I am once again, stuck on a computer, trying to complete something that will lead me closer to my goal. The question now becomes; do I give up or do I try to power through it? This has been an ongoing internal conflict of mine since I was young. It all started with school work and video games.

I never liked doing school work. I mean, who does? In middle school, I had this teacher that would hand us a project and allow us to choose which one we wanted to do, but there was a catch. You had to pick the hardest one in order for it to count as credit towards your final grade. After looking over all of them, I finally found something that looked interesting enough for me to attempt.

The assignment was simple; create a website using HTML and CSS code (you can find examples here). Now I didn't know anything about coding back then so it seemed like a good idea at first. It didn't take long before I realized just how complicated this task would become once I started actually working on it.

As soon as I opened up the program and began typing in my code, I was met with error messages telling me that certain elements were missing or incorrectly formatted. After spending hours trying to fix these errors without success, I decided to give up and start over from scratch. This process repeated itself multiple times until one day I finally got everything working properly.

This experience taught me a valuable lesson: if you really want something bad enough, then nothing will stop you from achieving it. From that point forward, whenever I encountered any difficulties in life, whether it be related to school work or not, I would simply push through them until I reached my goal.

Nowadays though, things aren't always so clear cut. Some days I wake up feeling motivated and ready to tackle anything head on but then other times there are moments when all I want to do is go back home and take a nap instead of dealing with whatever obstacles stand in front me. These days are especially hard because I know that if I just sit here long enough then eventually my motivation will come back and everything else won't seem so bad anymore.

But what about today? Am I ready to fight off this feeling and go through with the tasks at hand or should I give in and wait until later when hopefully everything feels easier again? It's been said before that "good things come to those who wait" but sometimes waiting can become an excuse for not doing anything.

At some point, we need to make a choice: either keep pushing ourselves forward or accept defeat and move on with our lives. The problem lies within the fact that neither option seems appealing at first glance. If we decide to continue working towards our goals then chances are good that we'll eventually succeed, however this means putting up with all kinds of problems along the way.

Alternatively, if we stop trying altogether and let go off all those things holding us back then maybe everything will become easier afterwards...but there isn't any guarantee of success either way. So now I find myself faced with a dilemma once again: should I continue putting forth effort or should I just let myself get swept away by the tide?

In order to answer this question, I must first consider why I want to accomplish my goals in the first place. For example, if my goal is to graduate college then why am I even trying so hard when failing would mean that nothing really changed anyway? On the other hand, if my objective is simply to improve myself then maybe there isn't any reason at all not to keep pushing forward no matter what stands in between me and success.

Ultimately though, it doesn't matter whether or not I decide to give up or stick around because either way I'll still end up learning valuable lessons along the way. By sticking around we learn about ourselves, our limits, and how much work is actually required before reaching our goals. On the flip side, quitting teaches us about failure, perseverance, and patience.

So next time you feel stuck between a rock and hard place, remember that no matter what option you choose, something positive will always come from it. Whether you choose to keep pushing forward or let yourself get swept away by the tide, both paths lead towards personal growth and self-discovery.

## What to do when your motivation is running low?

It can be difficult to find motivation when we're feeling down. Sometimes, all we need is a little pick-me-up. In this blog post, I’m going to share with you some tips on how to get back up again.

First of all, remember why you started doing whatever it was that made your motivation drop in the first place. What were you hoping to achieve? Did you have a deadline or a goal set? If yes, then try setting yourself another deadline or goal for the future so that you can work towards something else instead of getting bogged down by what happened before.

Secondly, make sure you're taking care of yourself physically and mentally. Sleep well each night and exercise regularly. Eat healthy foods and drink plenty of water throughout the day. Try not to dwell on negative thoughts too much because this will only make things worse for yourself. Instead, try focusing on positive thoughts whenever possible.

Lastly, surround yourself with people who encourage you and support your efforts. This could mean finding new hobbies or making friends who share similar interests as yours. Alternatively, if none of these things seem to work then perhaps you should seek professional advice from a counselor or therapist.

If nothing seems to help boost your motivation level then maybe it's time to consider taking some time off from whatever activity has caused you stress and anxiety recently. Take a break away from everything including social media, television shows, music, etc. Just take care of yourself mentally first before trying anything else. Sometimes, simply relaxing alone in silence is enough to give you the boost you need.

## How do you stay motivated when you don't feel like doing anything?

I think that motivation can be tricky because sometimes we just don’t want to do something even though we know it's good for us. Here are some things that might help:

1) Make yourself accountable – Write down exactly what goals you have set out for yourself and how long they will last before checking back in with yourself again. This way, if you don’t feel motivated after a certain amount of time then maybe it isn’t worth continuing anymore.

2) Find something fun to do instead of doing nothing at all – Sometimes we get stuck in a rut where we have no motivation because there's nothing exciting happening right now. Maybe you could try playing games online or reading books instead! Anything that brings joy into your life will help keep things going forward.

3) Create small goals along the way – When trying to achieve big goals, sometimes it helps to break them down into smaller parts so they aren’t as intimidating. For example, if your goal is to run a marathon then instead of focusing on running 26 miles straight away try breaking it up into segments like “run five miles today,” etc..

4) Set deadlines – Deadlines give us a sense of urgency and therefore make us want to complete tasks faster. So set yourself some deadlines based off your schedule so that you know exactly when certain things need doing by.

5) Talk to friends/family members who share similar interests as you do – Having someone else around while working towards your goals can really help boost morale and motivation levels. Plus, having a friend or family member there to keep track of what you’re doing means that they'll be able to motivate you when needed!

6) Reward yourself after completing each milestone reached – This is especially true for big projects where lots of effort goes into achieving success. It doesn’t matter whether the reward is small or large, just make sure that it's something special enough to make you feel proud once achieved.

7) Try doing things differently – Sometimes changing our approach completely can give us new ideas about how we could go forward with something. For example, instead of trying to read a book in one sitting, maybe try reading several pages every night instead. Or, if you find yourself getting bored easily then switch up your routine every now and again so that it stays interesting!

8) Ask yourself why – If motivation isn't working right now, ask yourself what could potentially cause this problem? Perhaps you feel overwhelmed by the amount of work required, or maybe there’s something else preventing you from getting started. Whatever the reason may be, identifying the root cause will help you find ways around it and hopefully improve your overall situation.

9) Focus on positive thoughts – Sometimes negative thinking can really bring us down, making us feel worse about our current situation. Try focusing on positive things instead of dwelling on negativity so that you're able to remain focused on the task ahead.

10) Take breaks when necessary – If you’ve been working hard all day then taking a break is definitely recommended. It gives your body time to rest and
