iran had tried to use it once and had not been able to hold it straight for more than a few minutes without feeling like he was going to break something. `` No, they don' t talk much at all,'' said Coruscan as he leaned back on his heels with the jackhammer braced in front of him, `` but they do get their point across.'' He pointed down the length of the jackhammer with his right hand.

`` Yeah, I know what you mean,'' said Liiran, standing by the drill with his own hammer in a cradle above his head. His helmet was on backwards so that he could look out through his visor while the tool did its work, and he looked down the jackhammer to Coruscan and then back at his own tool. `` You know,'' Liiran said, `` I have no idea how this thing works.''

`` It's simple. All you do is pull the trigger,'' said Coruscan, `` but if you don 't hold it right you won 't hit what you want to hit and you 'll break something.'' He smiled up at his partner through the clear faceplate of his helmet.

`` Yeah,'' Liiran agreed, `` I know that. But how do you steer it? How do you make it go up or down or sideways?''

Coruscan laughed out loud at this. `` It' s a jackhammer. You just hit things.''

Liiran looked doubtfully down the length of his hammer again. `` But I thought that a jackhammer was supposed to go back and forth, like a drill but faster,'' he said, `` like you would use in a quarry.''

`` Well yeah, that's how it works,'' Coruscan agreed, `` but we don 't need the hammer part. We just need the jacking.'' He nodded at his own tool. `` It' s easier to hit things with than a regular hammer. You can see more of what you 're hitting, and it takes less effort to get a big piece of metal off of a big piece of metal.''

`` But how do you steer it?'' Liiran asked again, sounding a bit desperate.

Coruscan laughed again and shook his head as he leaned back on his heels with the jackhammer braced between them, `` I don 't know,'' he said, `` but if I figure it out before you do I'll tell you.''
