ly ignored him. After all, he didn't want me around and I didn't give a damn if he knew it or not.

`` Dad is going to kill you when he gets back,'' he continued to whine.

I turned my head, looked at him, and smirked before taking another hit from the bong that was passed to me by some of his friends who had come to hang out with them. I looked around the room, smiling as I recognized a couple of familiar faces; the girl from last month's party, the one with the bright red hair, and her boyfriend were sitting on the couch just two feet away. They must have come early because they weren't stoned yet, but I knew they would soon be.

I turned my head back to look at my son again, this time making sure to get a good eye full of him; his long black hair was pulled back in a ponytail that hung down just past the middle of his back, he was wearing nothing but baggy shorts and a wife beater shirt, which was soaked in sweat from dancing to some band on the TV.

I knew my son would be pissed when he found out I had invited these people into our home, but I didn't care because I wanted to show him that he wasn't in control of me anymore. `` Why don't you get down?'', my granddaughter chimed in from the corner where she was sitting next to the large window in the living room.

`` Because Mommy says it's OK, and you should be grateful that I let you come over here,'' I answered, giving her a sly look as I handed back the bong.

The girl in question laughed at my comment before taking another hit of the marijuana mixed with alcohol, then passed it along to someone else. My granddaughter looked at me and rolled her eyes, then turned around and continued watching the movie that was playing on the TV.

`` You're not supposed to be here,'' he said as he walked toward me, his arms crossed in front of his chest. `` You know better than this.''

`` Oh please, get off your high horse and come over here,'' I replied with a smirk on my face.

I could see the anger growing inside him as I stood up, but he didn't say anything else. Instead, he just looked at me before going back to his friends. `` You know you can't smoke in here,'' I told her when she turned around to look at me again.

`` It's not like I care,'' she replied with a shrug of her shoulders as if to say that it wasn't worth getting upset about.

I looked at the girl next to my granddaughter and smiled, then gave them each another hit before passing back the bong again. The three of us sat there smoking until I heard someone knock on the door. My son came into the room just as I was handing back the bong, his face red with anger. `` You're not supposed to be here,'' he said as he walked over to me.

`` I told you it's OK,'' I replied before giving him a smile that made his eyes widen in surprise.

`` What are you doing?'', my granddaughter asked, looking at me with wide eyes and an expression of disgust on her face.

I ignored her comment as I continued to hand out another hit to each girl in the room. `` It's OK for us to have fun too,'' I said before walking over to where he was standing next to the door.

`` Mom, you can't do this!'' He yelled as I took another hit from the bong and passed it back to the redhead. `` This is wrong!''

`` You need to grow up and quit acting like a child,'' I said with a smile on my face as his eyes started to water from how stoned he was getting.

He looked at me for a second before turning around and walking out of the room. I watched him leave before giving another hit to each girl in the living room, then walked back over to my granddaughter who was still sitting next to the window watching the movie on TV. `` Your father is really mad,'' she said with a frown on her face as if it was my fault for making him angry.

I looked at her, smiling, then took another hit of the bong before passing it back again. `` Your mother doesn't care about his feelings, so you shouldn't either,'' I told her.

`` But what if he comes back?'', she asked with a worried expression on her face as if she was afraid that he would hurt me or something else bad might happen because of what happened tonight.

I looked at her for a second before giving another hit to each girl in the living room, then walking over to where she was sitting next to the window. `` Your father is an idiot who doesn't know how to have fun,'' I told her as she took the bong from me and passed it back again.

`` You need to get out of this house,'' my granddaughter said with a frown on her face that made me feel bad for making him angry earlier today when he came home from school early because of what happened last night at the party where he met her and his friends.

I looked at her, smiling, then took another hit of the bong before passing it back again. `` Your father needs to grow up and quit being so uptight all the time,'' I told her before giving another hit to each girl in the living room. `` He doesn't know how fun you can be when you get stoned.''

`` But what if he finds out that we're here?'', she asked with a worried expression on her face as if it would cause him to kill me or something else bad might happen because of what happened tonight at the party where they met and their friends. `` What are you going to do when he gets back?

`` Nothing,'' I told her with a shrug of my shoulders, then gave another hit to each girl in the living room before passing it back again. `` You're not supposed to be here either,'' she said with an angry expression on her face as if she was going to tell me off for making him angry earlier today when he came home from school early because of what happened last night at the party where they met and their friends.
