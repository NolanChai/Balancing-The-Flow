 The hiker stopped walking, and looked at his map. He said to himself: “I have been lost before, and I can be lost again.”

His voice echoed in a deep well, with the sound of water. Then, it disappeared. It was replaced by the cry of the infant, whose face was covered by a thin layer of sweat. The hiker could not see her, because she was under a tree, which he could barely distinguish from all the other trees that surrounded him.

The wind became stronger and gusted in a high-pitched howl, with a low vibration that made the needles of the forest shudder, until their tips touched the ground. The hiker said: “I am lost again.” Then, he heard a sound. It was not the wind; it was the sound of footsteps.

The sound came closer and became louder with each step. The hiker followed it, walking in a straight line. But then, he stopped and looked around him. He said: “I can be lost again.”

He looked at his map. It showed a forest with the trail that he was supposed to follow. He looked up, and saw that he had walked out of the forest. He looked behind him, and saw a house. Then, he heard a voice:

“Are you lost?” It was a woman’s voice, which came from the direction of the house. The hiker said: “No, I am not lost.” But then, he heard another voice:

“I think you are lost.” It was the sound of an infant ’ s cry. Then, the hiker saw the face of a girl, who looked at him with wide eyes. She had a thin layer of sweat on her face, and she said: “Are you lost?”

The hiker looked up, and saw that he was standing in front of a house, whose window was open. Then, the girl said: “I think you are lost.” The hiker said: “No, I am not lost.” But then, the infant ’ s cry became louder and more desperate. The hiker heard another voice:

“Are you lost?” It was the sound of an adult man’s voice, which came from inside the house. Then, the girl said: “I think you are lost.” The hiker looked up again, and saw that he was standing in front of a house, whose door was open. Then, he heard another voice:

“Are you lost?” It was the sound of an adult man’s voice, which came from inside the house. Then, he said: “No, I am not lost.” But then, he heard a sound. It was not the wind; it was the sound of footsteps. He followed it, walking in a straight line.
