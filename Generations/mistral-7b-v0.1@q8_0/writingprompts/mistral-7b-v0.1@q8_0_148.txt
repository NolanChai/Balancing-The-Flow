itve by nature, and I don't like to lose, so that doesn't work in my favor when it comes to this game. A game that I had played since I was a child. The one with no rules, just fun.
 
 I never took the time to think about who I am competing against. Who my opponents are. Until now. I had come home from a long day at work and decided to make myself dinner. While I was cooking, I saw them, and it didn't take long for me to get sucked in. The game that I was so used to playing alone, the one that had become second nature to me, but now there were other players in my world.
 
 Their names flashed across the screen as they passed me by. They weren't like me, I could tell. I had won every race I had competed in for the past few years, and I was the one that everyone was trying to beat. The only reason they were playing this game is because they knew they stood no chance against me.
 
 I never even realized it until now. I didn't care who I was racing against. All that mattered was winning. Winning everything. Being the best at whatever it was that I set my mind to doing. I am a perfectionist in every sense of the word. And that is what got me here today.
 
 Now, instead of just competing against myself and trying to be better than anyone else around me, now there were others out there who wanted to beat me. Who thought they could take my place as champion. Who didn't care if I lost or not, because all that mattered was them winning. And that was fine by me.
 
 I knew what had happened when I saw their names flashing across the screen for the first time. But it wasn't until now that I realized who they were competing against. Me.
 
 The person standing between them and victory. The one who had won every race they had ever competed in, and there was no way they could win if I didn't let them. And so here we are today, sitting at the finish line waiting for someone to cross it first.
 
 They don't know what they're up against. They think they have a chance. That they can beat me. But they don't understand how much this means to me, how important it is that I win. They are playing a game with their lives. And the only way for them to survive is if they beat me.
 
 But that will never happen. Because I am better than them in every way possible. I have more experience than anyone else out there, and even though I have been doing this for so long, it's still like second nature to me. I know how to win these races. And they don't stand a chance against me today or any day in the future because there is no one else who can match my skill level on this track right now.
 
 So as they wait at the finish line, I know what they are thinking. They think they have a chance to win. They think that they can beat me. But they don't understand how important this race is to me. How much it means for me to win, and for them not to even try would be an insult in itself because then they would be admitting defeat before the race had even started. So while I wait patiently at the start line with my eyes on their name flashing across my screen over and over again, waiting for someone else to show up so that this game can finally begin, I know that it is only a matter of time until one of us crosses that finish line first. And when we do, there will be no doubt in anyone's mind who has won. Because winning means everything to me right now and nothing matters more than beating every single person standing between me and my goal today.
 
 Winning means everything to me right now. Nothing else matters. I have to win this race. I need it as much as they do, but in a different way. It's not about who crosses the finish line first or if someone beats them at their own game because what matters most is how bad we want something and how hard we are willing to fight for it.
 
 Because winning isn't just about being better than everyone else out there right now; it's also about being better than ourselves when this is all over with too. And if I don't beat them today or even tomorrow then I know that they will always have the edge on me because there will never be another moment like this one where both of us are fighting tooth and nail to get what we want most in life right now: victory.
 
 So while they wait at the finish line waiting for someone else who might show up so they can begin their game, I am standing here watching them go by with my eyes fixed firmly on their name flashing across my screen over and over again until finally one day soon enough it will say "Winner." And then all bets are off as far as who wins this race because now there's no more waiting around or wondering if someone else will show up; everyone knows exactly what happens when two people compete against each other like this: someone gets left behind while another moves forward towards their goal and nothing else matters until they reach that finish line first.
 
 So today I will stand here by myself knowing that whoever crosses this finish line first has already won everything there is to win today because all that really matters now isn't what happens after we cross that finish line but rather how hard we fought against each other before getting here too. Because once someone gets beat at their own game then they have nothing left except for themselves and whatever little bit of pride or respect they might still have inside themselves when all is said and done; otherwise known as being a loser who will never win anything again unless he or she manages to come back strong enough to take what belongs to them by force next time around.
 
 So today I stand alone on this track with my eyes fixed firmly upon your name flashing across my screen over and over again, waiting for someone else who might show up so that our game can finally begin again; but if nobody does then I know that it's only a matter of time until one day soon enough, when both of us cross that finish line first, we will both realize who won this race because there will be no more wondering or waiting around for someone else who might show up someday either – now everyone knows exactly what happens when two people compete against each other like this: someone gets left behind while another moves forward towards their goal and nothing else matters until they reach that finish line first.
