'' This, It's gold, real gold.''.  
 
'Oh really Tim?'. 
 
'' Yes! 30 odd bars of pure gold.''.  
 
'' So what are you going to do with them?''. 
 
'' Oh I don't know yet. Maybe I could sell it, maybe give them away.  You could take some for your own stash?''.  
 
 '' Nah Tim, this isn't my type of thing, besides, you know what that will do to the economy! We are a capitalist society Tim. How would we fund our schools and hospitals?''.  
  
'' But it's gold Sally.''. 
 
 '' So what?''.  
 
 '' Well gold is money Sally, how could it not be money? I mean, it's money that doesn't need to be printed. Money that can't just be created out of thin air like the crap that they print today!''  
 
'' Print?''.  
 
'' Yes, printed by our central banks with no reserves behind it.''   
  
 '' How is this possible Tim?''. 
 
 '' Well Sally, it's a secret but I will tell you. Our governments and the world bank created this whole thing back in 1972, they did it to de-peg the US dollar from gold so that they could create as much money as they wanted without having to worry about losing their wealth because of inflation.''.  
 
 '' You mean like Zimbabwe?''   
 
'' Yes Sally, exactly! It is an international scam that has been going on for years and nobody knows it except the central banks. We all have just assumed that gold was no longer money, but we were wrong!''  
 
'' So what are you going to do with them Tim?''.  
 
'' I'm not sure Sally. Maybe I could sell them. Maybe I will just keep them in my attic like they did before the banks took over.''. 
   
'' OK Tim, well let me know if you want anything else.''.  
 
'' Thanks Sally!''
