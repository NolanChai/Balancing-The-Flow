However today the dart was thrown but instead of moving, I just heard the "Ding" sound. I tried again, same thing. I thought the server must be down so I logged out and then back in and it worked again. I threw two more darts and they worked as well, so I went to bed assuming there was nothing wrong.

But when I woke up I noticed that it wasn't working anymore, but I could still throw darts. I logged off and back on (again) and it worked, and then I couldn't throw the dart for 3 attempts and it worked again. I threw 2 more darts, which worked, and then went to bed.

When I woke up today it was working but only sometimes, so I logged off and back on, which didn't help. Now I am just wondering if anyone has any idea what is causing this or how to fix it?
