ent even seen my father since the age of 3 and he still has not told me where my mother is, why does he not just tell me what the hell is going on.

I am sat in the living room waiting for my father to come home from work and I am wondering whether or not this is all a joke, it cant be true! I have lived with my auntie since I was 3. She is practically my mother to me but I still need to know what the hell is going on.

The door opens and my father walks in. `` Well son'' he says as if he has no idea of this news, which means I am right! This stranger is not my real father, who the hell is this man?
`` It's good to see you'' I say as I hug him and try my hardest to act normal. My father looks at me with a confused look on his face, `` What the hell is wrong son?'' He says. `` Nothing'' I reply.
He sits down in his chair and tells me about his day. When he stops talking I decide to go up to my room for a bit and try to think straight. Once again I ask myself why does he not tell me? My father has never been a secretive man, so what is he hiding now?
I sit on my bed in the dark and I hear noises downstairs, a sound that has haunted me since the age of 3. A crying baby and it sounds like it's coming from below. I slowly walk down the stairs with one eye closed trying to make out where the noise is coming from. It seems that the kitchen is where most of the noise is coming from but still nothing is visible.

I sit at the table with my head in my arms, crying harder than ever before. My father enters the room and I can feel him staring at me but he doesn't say anything, just sits down next to me and puts his arm around my shoulders.
`` What the hell are you doing?'' I ask as I look up at him. `` Son, do not ask questions that you know will only hurt us both'' he says in a very sad voice.
`` Dad'' I say as tears stream down my face, `` please tell me what is going on!'' He puts his hand on my shoulder and gets up from the table, `` It is late son and we need to get some sleep, so just go to your room and try not to think about this too much.''
`` But dad...'' I say as he walks out of the kitchen. `` Son please!'' He says before closing the door behind him and leaving me alone. I sit at the table for a few hours trying my hardest to figure it all out. When I finally fall asleep it is a restless sleep, full of dreams that make no sense whatsoever.
