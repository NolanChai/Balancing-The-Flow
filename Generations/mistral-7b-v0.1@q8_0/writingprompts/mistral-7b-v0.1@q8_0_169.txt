 He pulls out a handful of brushes and dunks them into the water, one by one. His fingers tremble as he pulls them out and then begins to rinse them on the metal surface of the can. The water turns brown as it flows off the bristles and the rusty bottom of the can. Clay is glad his father had thought to buy him the cheapest set of brushes possible when he started art class.
  ``  `` ``  ``

 He swallows hard and moves the brush slowly across a piece of paper.  ``  `` ``  ``  ``  ``  ``  ``  ``

 When his mother first called him down to look at the picture he had drawn, he hadn’t noticed it at all. All he had seen was her face when she turned it towards him. He remembers the smile that slowly faded into confusion as he tried to figure out what she wanted from him. It took a few seconds before the realization set in: she wanted him to draw something and now he could see it.  ``  ``  ``  ``  ``  ``

 But not now, when he looked down at what he had drawn on his paper. He doesn’t remember drawing this particular picture.  ``  ``  ``  ``  ``

 It was just a figure. A human figure that seemed to be moving out of the frame, away from him.  ``  ``

 Clay looks at the picture again. The figure had no face or hair. Its arms and legs were thin and looked frail. But most of all, Clay notices, it has no clothes. He isn’t sure what it is he’s supposed to be drawing. There is nothing that tells him what to put on this thing.
  ``  `` ``

 So he made one up himself. Clay remembers thinking as he drew, that the figure didn’t look like it could get much smaller without disappearing completely. He had never known what his mother wanted from him when she asked for a drawing of something.  ``  ``

 But now, looking down at his picture again, he knows exactly why she wants him to draw something. Clay can see that there is no face on the figure because it has no eyes, or nose, or mouth. It doesn’t even have ears to hear with, just a long thin neck that sticks up from its shoulders and disappears into nothingness before reaching its head.  ``  ``  ``  ``
``  `` ``  ``

 And when he looked at the picture again, Clay knew exactly why she wanted him to draw something: because if you can’t see it then it doesn’t exist.
