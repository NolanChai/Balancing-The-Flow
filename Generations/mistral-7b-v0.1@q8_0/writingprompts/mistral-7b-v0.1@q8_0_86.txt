 the doors in the building.   As I looked down at my keys I found that all but one were on the wrong side of my fingers and I had only one left to go, so I flipped them over again.    ``Hmmm.'' 
 
   As I began to sort through the keys again I heard a knock at the door.   ``Oh great,'' I thought, ``They're back again.''  But it wasn't just any set of visitors that had knocked on my door; it was two young men in black robes with silver tassels dangling from their shoulders.   They were carrying a large, glittering cauldron and a small bag.
 
   ``Hi,'' I said, as I opened the door for them.    ``What brings you to see me on this lovely day?'' 
 
   The smaller man looked up at me with a mischievous smile, ``We heard that you were a wizard.'' he said.   He then looked at his friend, who was now studying the bottom of the cauldron, ``So we thought that you might be able to tell us something about our spellbook.''
 
   As I looked into the cauldron I noticed that it had been filled with a thick green liquid.    I also saw that they were carrying a book with them as well; one of those old leather bound books with gold-edged pages and silver clasps holding the covers together.     I reached out my hand and took the spellbook from the younger man and looked at it for a moment.
 
   ``Well,'' I said after looking through the book, ``I can see that you have a pretty good understanding of basic spells.'' 
 
    ``Oh yes sir,'' he answered, ``We know how to use magic, but we don't understand it at all.   We thought maybe you could give us some pointers on how to make better use of it.'' 
 
  ``Sure,'' I said, ``I can try, but I'll need a little more time with the book before I know what kind of suggestions to make.''    As I went to close the door they stopped me, ``Can we stay here while you read through our spellbook?'' one asked.
 
  ``Sure,'' I said, ``It's not like this place is busy or anything.''   So I closed the door and went back inside.
 
``What'd he say about our book?'' The larger of the two men wanted to know.
 
``Well,'' his friend answered, ``He said that we understand magic well enough, but don't understand it at all.''   The younger man then looked up from the cauldron and smiled, ``But he does seem like a nice guy, so maybe he can help us out.''
 
 I sat down on my bed and began to read through their book.    As I started flipping through its pages I noticed that most of them were blank, except for one small paragraph at the back.   It read:
 
``To make a potion of invisibility you will need 10 drops of blood from each person who has died within a day of drinking it and 5 drops of your own blood mixed with water.''  I chuckled to myself, ``I suppose they must be joking.   Why would anyone want to be invisible?''    But then I noticed that the spellbook was getting lighter as I read it so I continued on.
