 n to check on the load of wood. It was late in December, and the trees were bare. He felt sorry for them. The ones he'd felled had been gnawed away by some small brown animal with sharp teeth, but they weren't as lucky.

He walked around the front of the truck, inspecting the load. The truck was parked at a steep angle in a clearing on the edge of a pine forest. A half-mile behind him, the woods gave way to farmland. The land was covered with a fresh blanket of snow, except for some muddy patches near where he'd backed up the truck. He'd come through the trees early that morning with the logs piled high on the back of his flatbed. The first few were easy; it was just a matter of picking out the best-looking trees and felling them with his chainsaw. But as the day wore on, he became less picky about which tree he cut down.

He'd stopped counting after 40 or so. He knew that there wouldn't be any more for today; he was looking at nothing but stumps. It was a good thing too, because he could feel his strength and dexterity beginning to fade as the day wore on. The trees had been hard work, especially at the end of the day.

He walked around to the side of the truck and looked in through the window. The back of the truck was filled with logs, arranged so that they wouldn't move during transit. He climbed back up into the cab, started the engine, put it into gear, and backed up a few feet. Then he checked his mirrors before starting forward again.

The truck bumped along as Dexter headed down the dirt road toward town. The sun had already set, but the sky was still light enough to see by. He pulled off at an intersection and turned right onto another dirt road. The road followed a small stream for about a mile before turning into a gravel driveway leading to his house.

As he approached his home, he noticed that there were no cars parked in front of it or on the street. This was unusual because almost everyone in town had two vehicles: a car and a pickup truck. His truck was parked under a large pine tree in the front yard next to a row of evergreens. Dexter stopped his truck next to the house and shut off the engine before getting out. He walked around back and opened the door to the house with a key he kept on him at all times. Inside, there was no one home except for himself and Harry Morgan—the cat.
