ier minds had been taken over by the enemy.

"Jim! Jim!" A voice rang out in the air around the small camp. The boy turned to see two men standing before him, both of them tall and well built. Their clothes were soiled with dirt and blood, but they seemed healthy and full of energy. "Wow... you're not supposed to be here..." Jim said as he tried to focus on the one that looked more like a soldier than the other one. He had a strange hair color, it was white with brown stripes through out it.

"No... but we are..." The soldier said in a deep voice. "Your friends were supposed to be here, but they... they're gone." Jim looked at his friends and then back at the two soldiers.

"Are you serious? They're not coming?" He asked with a little bit of anger in his voice. "No, I'm sorry for your loss." The second man said to him as he walked over to the fire. "I hope we can make up for it." Jim looked at him and saw that he had the same strange hair color as the other one did, but it wasn't white with brown stripes through out, it was black with orange stripes.

"What are you guys?" He asked them. They just stood there and watched him, then they turned to look at each other. Jim tried to talk again but he couldn't. He was starting to get dizzy and his vision began to blur. The last thing he saw was the soldier with white hair staring into his eyes before everything went black...

"Jimmy!" A voice rang out in the air around the small camp, it sounded like a woman's voice but there was something strange about it, she seemed angry. "Who is that?" Jim asked as he stood up and looked around. There was no one there, but he could hear her voice echoing through the forest. "Jim! You need to get out of here!" The woman screamed at him from somewhere in the woods.

"Where are you?" He asked her while looking for her. She seemed so close yet so far away at the same time... "I'm right behind you!" She screamed back at him before disappearing again. "Jim, I don't have much time left." A new voice rang out in the air around them, but it sounded different from the last one. It was lower and deeper than before, almost like a man speaking... but not quite.

"I need you to help me find something..." He said as he walked up to him. "What is it?" Jim asked him while looking at his face... or what little of it that wasn't covered by dirt and blood. The man looked older than the other one did, but also stronger and more powerful. His skin was tanned from being out in the sun too much, but there was a strange look about his eyes that made Jim feel uncomfortable around him.

"I need you to find something for me." The man said as he pointed to an old tree that had fallen over a long time ago and grown roots into the ground. "What is it?" He asked again while looking at where he was pointing. The man looked down at his hand... or rather what used to be his hand before it was cut off... "It's my hand." He said as he held up his stump for Jim to see.

Jim stared at the stump, then back at the man who was holding it. It looked like someone had hacked into their arm with a knife or axe and then left them there to bleed out... "Why would you do that?" He asked him while trying not to look at the blood that was slowly trickling down from his stump onto the ground.

"I got in trouble." The man said with a smile on his face. "So they cut my arm off?" Jim asked him as he looked back at what used to be his hand and now was just an empty stump of skin and bone... "Yes, but that was nothing compared to what happened next..."

He walked away from him then stopped in front of a tree that was much bigger than the one before it. It was old and twisted, with its bark peeling off in places where it had been cut or burned by something long ago... "This is my hand." He said as he pointed to his stump again.

He pointed to his stump again as he looked down at Jim... "Jimmy!" A voice rang out from somewhere behind him... He turned around just as a small girl appeared out of nowhere with a smile on her face. She looked like she was about nine or ten years old, but she had an air of maturity to her that made it seem like she knew much more than most people would think... "Jimmy! I found something!" The little girl said with excitement in her voice as she held out what used to be Jim's hand before it was cut off.

The man looked over at him then turned back towards the girl who was still holding his severed arm in front of her face. He smiled at her for a moment, but quickly turned away from her when he saw that there were tears running down her cheeks... "What happened to you?" The man asked with concern on his voice while looking at what used to be Jim's hand before it was cut off.

"They... they killed me..." The girl said as she held up the severed arm in front of her face and started crying again. He looked down at the ground then back up at the girl who was still holding his severed arm in front of her face with tears running down her cheeks. "Why would you do that?" Jim asked him while trying not to look at what used to be his hand and now was just an empty stump of skin and bone... "I got in trouble." The man said with a smile on his face.
