wr finishing for the evening.

A new employee had just been hired and was going through some orientation procedures in the room next door. Jack heard his voice echo through the walls and it caused him to smile. He couldn't quite put a finger on why he found the sound so pleasant, but then again he'd never considered himself much of an audiophile.

He put down his pen and shut off the light in his office as he began packing up for home. The man's voice grew louder as the door opened and he walked out to find Jack standing there with a smile on his face. He hadn't had any intention of talking to him, but it was just such an inviting look that he couldn't resist saying "Hello".

"Good evening," said the young man who introduced himself as John, then held out his hand for shaking purposes. Jack was surprised by this sudden development and was a little slow in responding, but managed to get a smile on his face as he shook the stranger's hand. He was very pleased with how warmly John's hand felt when he gripped it, not that he thought too much about it afterwards.

John asked if Jack wanted to go for a drink and Jack accepted the offer. They walked down to the local bar where they both ordered whiskey sours. After finishing their drinks they left together and headed back up to John's apartment. John told him that he lived alone so Jack asked him if he was married or not, but John simply replied "No".

They got into bed and began kissing each other passionately as they slowly undressed until they were completely naked. The sex was great and after Jack came inside of him, he passed out for a few minutes before waking up to find himself alone again. He pulled on his clothes and went downstairs where the new employee told him that he'd been looking for him so that they could finish their work together.
