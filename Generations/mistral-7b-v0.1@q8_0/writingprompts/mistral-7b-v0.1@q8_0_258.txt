'other side, where the sun was shining in through the window, a small woman sat in her chair. She looked over the top of her spectacles and raised an eyebrow. `` You have feet?''

 Captain Sneakerpants shook his head. `` Just one.'' He pointed at the foot on his left side. The one on the right was a stump, nothing more than the remains of some bone or something that looked like bone. He had been wearing a shoe when he lost it, but had cut off the shoelaces in an effort to remove the footwear before going through the gateway. It was the only thing he could think of that might keep him from becoming a slave.

 The woman raised her hand and pointed at the door with two fingers on that hand. `` I believe we were talking about getting you out of here, Captain.''

 `` Right.'' He took his foot off of the table, but not before the glass shattered into hundreds of pieces. `` That was my plan, but I haven't been able to make any progress on it at all. This is one of those planets that don't allow humans to own slaves. There's also a rule against mind control and telepathy. Which means I can't just get into your head and find out what the hell we're supposed to be doing here.''

 `` Oh, so you are doing it the hard way?'' She shook her head and frowned at him. `` That's never a good idea.'' She got up and began to walk away from him. He was sure she was going to get up in his face, but she didn't. Instead, she walked out of his room, which was the only one he had access to. The door shut behind her with a click that made him jump slightly.

 `` I thought you said we were friends?''

 Her voice came back from down the hall. `` We are friends, Captain, but we don't have time for you to act like a big baby.''

 She paused for a moment and then continued speaking. `` It's time for us to get out of here before they can catch up with us.''

 The door opened behind him. `` What are you talking about?'' Captain Sneakerpants turned around in his chair. There were two people standing there, both dressed in black with red stripes down the middle of their shirts. He recognized them as soldiers from some distant planet called the Dominion.

 `` We're here to help you.''

 

 















`` Okay,'' said Captain Sneakerpants, getting up off of his chair and walking towards them. His foot was sore from sitting on it all day, but he didn't let that stop him. `` Who are you?''

 `` We're Dominion soldiers.'' One of them smiled at him while the other one pointed a gun at his head.
`` I don't believe you. You can't just walk up here and tell me that.''

 The man with the gun laughed. `` Of course we can!'' He pointed it at Captain Sneakerpants's chest, right above his heart. `` You might want to reconsider your decision.''

 Captain Sneakerpants took a step back and looked around the room. `` What are you doing here?''
 
 The soldier smiled again. `` We're here to help you escape from this planet!'' He grinned, showing teeth that were far too large for his mouth. `` That is what we do best.''

 Captain Sneakerpants was shocked by this news. He didn't know what to think at first but he knew that it wasn't good. `` How did you find me? I don't even remember getting here!''
 
 The soldier grinned and pointed the gun again. `` You were found when your shuttle crashed on this planet.''

 Captain Sneakerpants had no idea what to say next, but he knew that there was something else going on here. He took a step towards them and put his hands up. `` Wait a second! I don't know if you guys are even real.''

 The soldier with the gun raised it higher than before. `` You better believe we're real!' He grinned again, showing off those teeth.
 
 Captain Sneakerpants looked around at everything in sight and tried to make sense of what he was seeing. There were too many things for him to remember all at once but he could see the man with the gun in front of him as well as other people walking into his room from the hallway outside. `` Wait...who are you?''
 
 The soldier pointed at himself with a finger and nodded. `` We are Dominion soldiers, here to help you escape from this planet.'' He grinned again, showing off those teeth once more.
 
 Captain Sneakerpants looked back down at the man with the gun. There was something strange about him, but he couldn't put his finger on it yet. `` Wait...how did I get here?''

 The soldier smiled wider and then pointed a finger at himself again as if he were answering his own question. `` You crashed here when you tried to leave this planet.'' Captain Sneakerpants took another step towards him, looking around for anything that could help explain what was happening right now. `` How did I get here?''
 
 The soldier smiled wider and then pointed a finger at himself once more as if he were answering his own question. `` You crashed here when you tried to leave this planet.''
