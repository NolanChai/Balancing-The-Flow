. So when I am around people, I can feel like I am not real. Like everything is fake and everyone is just pretending to talk with me. 

 
 
 I was born with the ability to heal myself. And by heal, I mean regenerate body parts. That 's right, I'm a mutant. But even though I have powers, it does n't make me any different from everyone else. 

 
 
 My parents were very strict, and they had rules about everything. The biggest one was: 
 "Don' t tell anyone that you are a mutant."

 
 So that 's what I did. And it worked out well enough until one day when I got into trouble at school for hitting someone on purpose during recess (they were bullying me). They sent me to detention where they had cameras all around the room and there was no way out of it unless I confessed my powers. 

 
 My parents found out about this too, so now they want me to go into therapy because they think that I might be depressed or something like that (even though I told them what happened). They also made me take some pills called "Prozac" which are supposed to make me feel better but instead just made me even more tired than before. 

 
 The good news is that my therapist seems nice and he said we could talk about things like school bullies without worrying about anyone finding out who I am (or at least not right away). But then again maybe he wants to tell everyone what happened too? I dunno.
