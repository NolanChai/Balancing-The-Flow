rive on the fear in your eyes.

Around me, the world is silent. The only sound is that of my own breathing. As I move slowly through the trees, I smell her perfume: roses. It’s faint, but it draws me toward her like a bee to honey. She’s so close now, she must have felt me brush against her as I pass, but she remains oblivious.

I circle around to come from behind, and for a moment she is startled as I clamp my hand over her mouth and pull her backwards. We tumble into the grass. I press harder, covering both her mouth and nose with my palm as I pin her to the ground. She fights against me, but I am much stronger than her. Her screams are muffled beneath my hand as she frantically claws at my arm in an attempt to remove it from over her face.

I smile as I feel her body going limp beneath me and release my grip, rolling off of her onto my back and watching her from there. I have done this a hundred times before, but each time is different. Each woman reacts differently, and each reaction is different depending on which part of the body I choose to cut first.

I watch as she gasps for air, pulling in breath after breath as though trying to fill an endless void inside her lungs. It’s a beautiful sight. The struggle that comes with the realization that you cannot breathe. I reach down and pull my knife from its holster. I smile at her again, but this time it is less of a gentle smile and more of a cruel one. My eyes remain locked on hers as I begin to cut.
