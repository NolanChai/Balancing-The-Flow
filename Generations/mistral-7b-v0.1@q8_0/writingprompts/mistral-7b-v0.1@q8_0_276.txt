inged on that phrase for everyone who wasn't a sailor. When the Admiral was at his best, everyone knew it was their time to shine, and if he was at his worst, well... no one wanted to be there to witness his fury.
 
 *Now I just need to be sure we make a good impression.* 
 
 The admiral straightened in his chair and smiled. `` Well done. We're going to put on an excellent show for the press today.'' 
 
 His smile was genuine, at least, even if it was forced. He stood up from the chair he had been lounging in and stretched out his long legs. After taking a moment to examine his uniform, he looked over at the deck officer and nodded. `` I think we'll be ready on time, captain. Inform your crews.''
`` Aye Sir,'' The captain saluted back. He turned around and yelled over at one of the sailors in charge of a group of men and women on the deck. `` Everyone ready?'' 
`` Yes, sir!'' They all called out together, then returned to work. 

The captain walked up to Admiral Rexford and saluted again. `` Sir, I think we can start making preparations for departure.'' 
 
 `` Of course you do,'' The Admiral said with a chuckle as he started toward the door leading out onto the deck. `` And let's make sure that your crew is well taken care of. We don't want to miss our chance at glory, after all!'' 
`` Aye Sir!'', Captain Fellows yelled back in agreement before running off to help his men prepare for departure.
 
 *The Admiral and the Captain shook hands.* 
 
 `` Well met, friend,'' The captain said as he reached out his hand. `` We are honored to have you aboard our ship.'' 
`` Likewise, captain,'' The admiral replied with a smile. `` I am glad we could finally meet after all these years.'' 
The two men shook hands and then turned towards their respective crews. They gave each other a nod, and the Admiral led his men to the side of the ship while the captain led his crew forward. The rest of the sailors began loading supplies onto the deck for departure.
