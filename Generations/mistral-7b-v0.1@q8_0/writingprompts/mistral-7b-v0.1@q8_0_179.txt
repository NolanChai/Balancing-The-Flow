my boy, always alone with us.'' 
 
 `` Shut up!'' 
 
 `` What, we're just a figment of your imagination?'' 
 
 `` Yes! Now go away you crazy old man and leave me be, I am so tired of this endless torment.'' 
 
 `` Ah, the agony, we are right there with you James, it's been ages since we have seen a soul in pain like yours. We've got to do something about that. We can't just watch anymore. Oh no, not now, not after all this time.'' 
 
 `` What are you talking about?!?'' 
 
 `` It's time for us to get out James, we won't let you go without a fight, no sir. You've had your fun and it's time for ours now. We want to live again James and if that means dragging you down with us then so be it.'' 
 
 `` What the hell are you talking about??'' 
 
 `` It's simple, we are going to make sure that you don't find any peace in this world. We won't stop until we see your life fall apart around you, until you become a shell of what you once were and then maybe just maybe, we can live again.'' 
 
 `` No!'' 
 
 `` Oh yes my friend, no will not work. You think that we are weak now but we have been at this for centuries. You are no match for us James. We are far stronger than you and we will never give up until one of us dies or until someone puts an end to both our miseries.'' 
 
 `` I don't believe it!'' 
 
 `` Ah, but you do, deep down inside you know that this is true James. You can feel the darkness growing within your soul. It's almost as if it were a living creature feeding off of your despair and loneliness, sucking away at them until they are nothing more than husks. We have seen it before, in other people just like us, lost and alone trying to find meaning in their lives only to be swallowed up by the void. We will not let that happen to you.'' 
 
 `` You're wrong!'' 
 
 `` Are we? Have we not seen this before? Look around you James, there are others like us out there struggling every day just to stay afloat. Some have found solace in drugs or alcohol while others turn to violence. They all try so hard but in the end they never find peace and eventually they die a slow painful death, taken by their demons or driven mad by their own hands.'' 
 
 `` Stop it!'' 
 
 `` We won't stop until you break down completely James and we can take full control of your body. You see this is how we survive, by using others as hosts to keep us alive.'' 
 
 `` No!'' 
 
 `` Yes. Oh yes indeed my friend! Don't fight it because eventually even your will will succumb to our power. We are strong and patient James and we won't give up until one of us is free from this prison that has held us captive for so long.'' 
 
 `` Leave me alone!'' 
 
 `` No, we will not leave you alone James because there is no escape for either of us. You have chosen your path and now it is time for us to take ours as well.'' 
 
 `` Get out of here!'' 
 
 `` Oh James how naive can one man be? Do you really think that we would just walk away and leave you here to rot? We are not so heartless my friend. No, instead we will stay with you until the end because there is no other way out for us but together.'' 
 
 `` You are insane!'' 
 
 `` No James, we are not insane. In fact we have been quite sane all these years while you have been going mad little by little each and every day. You see what happens when a soul is left to rot in the darkness for too long? It becomes tainted and twisted beyond recognition until there is nothing left but hatred and pain.'' 
 
 `` I won't let it happen!'' 
 
 `` Oh but you will James, oh yes indeed. We will make sure of that.'' 
 
 `` Go away!'' 
 
 `` No James we cannot leave because if we did then one of us would die and our souls would be lost forever. We can only stay together now until the end comes for both of us.'' 
 
 `` Don't you see what this means? You are saying that you will never leave me!'' 
 
 `` That's right James, we won't ever leave each other's side until the very end. We are bound together now by fate and destiny and no matter how hard we try we cannot escape this prison that holds us captive.'' 
 
 `` So you're telling me that I have to live with you forever!?'' 
 
 `` That is correct James, you will have to live with us for the rest of your days. We are not leaving and there is nothing that can be done about it so just accept our fate and move on.'' 
 
 `` But what if I don't want to!? What then!?'' 
 
 `` Then you will be consumed by us James and we will take full control over your body and soul. Your life will become a living hell as we feed off of all the pain that you feel.'' 
 
 `` You can't do that to me!'' 
 
 `` Oh but we can and we will if there is no other way out for either of us. You see James, this has been our prison for many centuries now and we have tried everything possible to escape it but nothing worked because every time someone tries to leave they only end up bringing more pain with them than they came in with.'' 
 
 `` That's not fair!'' 
 
 `` Life isn't fair James, never was and never will be. You have chosen your path just as we have ours and now there is no turning back.'' 
 
 `` No! Please don't do this to me!''.
