 You approach a shady character standing in front of a closed door, in the heart of the city. No signs on this place, just some graffiti tags that say "Enter if you dare". The man gives you a hard stare and asks: - "You want to play?" You respond by handing over 100,000 credits for your entry ticket. After paying the entrance fee, he opens the door. It looks like an old abandoned warehouse. All you can see is a large dark room in front of you. You try to turn on the lights, but nothing happens. - "You can't turn on these lights", says the man behind you. - "So what do I do now?" - "I don't know. That depends on how good you are at solving puzzles." The man walks over and turns off all the lights in the room. You hear a click and suddenly there is no light at all. "Welcome to my maze!" says the man, smiling. He closes the door behind him with a bang, locking it from inside.
