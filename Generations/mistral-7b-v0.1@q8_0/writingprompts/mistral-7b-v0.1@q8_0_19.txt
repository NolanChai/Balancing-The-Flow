 up, waiting for the ship to reach its destination.

And then it happened. The screen turned red and showed that they have entered Mars's atmosphere, so he started accelerating the ship as fast as possible. It was too late anyway though, the ship started shaking like crazy and all the screens went dark...

``Hmmm...''. Andrew took a breath. ``This doesn't look good''. He looked at his seat, noticing that it was moving faster than it should, ``The ship is falling apart!''. Andrew ran around the console, trying to fix everything, but there wasn't much he could do... The ship started breaking into pieces and going down even more fast...

Andrew jumped out of his chair and ran towards one of the engines. He grabbed a tool, tried to remove some piece, but it was jammed! ``Damn, damn!'' he screamed with frustration, ``I'm gonna die here''. He turned around, seeing that there were two pieces of metal left in his ship, ``What should I do?''.

The first option - jump on one of the pieces and hope for the best. The second - try to find something to slow down the fall. Andrew ran to the second option and started looking around, but all he could see was broken stuff everywhere... He took a look at his watch, ``I have 5 minutes left''.

Andrew ran out of the ship, trying to find something to grab hold of. The pieces of metal were already very close to the ground, so Andrew had to act fast if he wanted to survive... ``I found it!'' He grabbed a piece of pipe and started climbing up. It wasn't easy though, because he was very tired from running around in his ship for hours...

Andrew climbed all the way up and landed on the first metal piece, which started shaking like crazy under him... ``Noooo!'' he screamed with fear as it fell down towards the ground again. ``I need to jump!'' Andrew jumped off of the metal piece and hoped that he would land somewhere soft enough so he wouldn't break his bones when he hits the ground...

Andrew landed on something that felt like a bed, but when he tried to stand up, he realized that it was actually a mattress. ``What the hell?''. He looked around and saw that they were in an apartment complex! ``How did we get here? We should be falling towards Mars!''. Andrew ran out of his room and found himself on the street...

Andrew looked at his watch, ``I'm late!'' he said with panic in his voice. He started running towards what seemed to be a hospital, but when he got there, he realized that it was actually a church! ``Oh my god...'' Andrew thought as he entered the building. ``Where am I?''.

``You are in Heaven'', Andrew heard a voice from behind him. He turned around and saw an old man with white hair wearing a robe. ``Welcome to our place, son. You can stay here for as long as you want''. The old man smiled at him and took him by the hand.

``Oh my god...'' Andrew said again in his thoughts when they reached the entrance of the building. ``What is going on with me?'' He asked himself. ``I'm still alive? Why did I wake up here then?''. The old man smiled at him and opened a door that led to what looked like an enormous room, with many beds on it...

Andrew stared at his surroundings in disbelief as he entered the room. There were dozens of beds on both sides of the corridor, filled with people sleeping or lying down quietly... ``What is this?'' He asked himself again. ``Where am I? Who are all these people?''. Andrew looked around one more time and saw that there was a staircase leading to another floor.

``Come up with me'', said the old man, taking his hand once again. Andrew followed him up and they went through several corridors until they reached what seemed to be an operating room... ``You will have some pain when we remove your implants'' said the old man as he pulled a chair next to Andrew so that he could sit down. ``But don't worry, everything is going to be ok!''

Andrew looked at his hand and realized that there were two strange black lines on it - like an x-ray would look like if you had one... ``Oh my god...'' He whispered with fear in his voice as he remembered all the things which happened since they left Earth... ``This can't be true! I just crashed into Mars!''

``Calm down, son'' said the old man. ``You are safe now and everything will turn out ok''. Andrew looked at him with disbelief in his eyes - he was trying hard not to cry because of what happened...

Andrew thought for a moment about all that he saw since he woke up here, but there were no answers... What had really happened? Was it some sort of dream? Or did he actually crash into Mars and somehow end up in Heaven?! ``Oh my god...'' He whispered again as he remembered the last moments before he lost consciousness...

``I'm alive! I made it to Mars!''. Andrew was so happy that he could cry, but instead, he started laughing hysterically. ``This can't be happening!'' He said out loud. ``Why did I crash into Mars if I am actually in Heaven? What is going on with me?''. Andrew looked around once again and saw a man walking towards them...

``Hello there'' said the man as he sat down next to Andrew. ``My name is John, by the way. I'm an angel here on Earth!'' Andrew stared at him with disbelief in his eyes - he couldn't believe what was happening around him. He thought that everything was just a dream...

``No, no son... You are not dreaming or anything like that'' said John as he put his hand on Andrew's shoulder. ``You really did crash into Mars and then woke up here in Heaven. We were waiting for you to arrive so we could help you out with all of your problems''

Andrew started crying, but before he could say anything else, the old man came back in and said: ``Come on son, we have another surgery for you!'' Andrew looked at him with fear in his eyes. He didn't want to go through it again - especially because they were talking about removing the implants from his head which had made him crash into Mars...

``Ok'' whispered Andrew as he got up from his seat and followed them down the hall. They stopped in front of another room, this one was smaller than the first one but still filled with beds... ``Lay down on this bed here'', said John pointing at it. ``And we will start removing your implants''

``Oh my God'' muttered Andrew as he laid down on the bed. He remembered everything that happened since they landed on Mars - how he woke up in a strange place and what was happening right now... ``This can't be true! I just crashed into Mars, why am I here?''. But there were no answers...

John started pulling out something from Andrew's head which looked like wires. He then grabbed them with his hands and pulled them all out of Andrew's skull until he didn't feel any more pain anymore. ``Ok son, we are finished!'' said John as he sat next to Andrew again...

Andrew stared at the floor for a moment before looking up at John, ``Who are you?'' He asked him in disbelief. ``You can call me St Peter if you want - I am one of your guardian angels here on Earth'' said John with a smile on his face. ``Why did you take out my implants?''. Andrew asked again...

``I have to do it because they were causing some problems for you'' explained John as he sat next to Andrew and started rubbing his head... ``But don't worry, everything is going to be ok!'' said John. ``You will be fine after this surgery and you won't feel any pain anymore!''

``Oh my God'' whispered Andrew once again while crying in disbelief. He didn't want to believe what was happening around him - he thought that all of it was just a dream... But when John told him about the implants, everything started to make sense... ``How did you know about them?''. Andrew asked him with tears in his eyes...

``I know because I am an angel here on Earth'' said John as he wiped away the tears from Andrew's face. ``You have nothing to worry about son! Everything is going to be ok!'' And that was it - Andrew fell asleep after hearing those words and woke up some time later in his own bed. He felt a little bit dizzy but at least, there were no more problems with the implants...

``So you are telling me that everything I've seen since I crashed into Mars was real?''. Andrew asked John as he sat on the other side of the bed. ``Yes son!'' said John with a smile on his face. ``Andrew, we were waiting for you to come here so we could help you out with all of your problems!''

``Ok... But why did I crash into Mars then?'' asked Andrew. He was trying hard not to cry because he didn't want to believe that everything was just a dream - but there were no answers
