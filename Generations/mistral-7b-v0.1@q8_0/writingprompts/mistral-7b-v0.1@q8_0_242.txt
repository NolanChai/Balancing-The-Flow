 again* Oh yeah that was the problem, the internet was being a pain and wouldn't let me close it for some reason... Hmm... I haven't posted on this subreddit in a while, maybe I should make another post... Nah I don't have anything to post about right now.

Okay maybe I'll just go to my inbox... Wait a second, what's that? A PM from someone called "Nikola Tesla" I wonder if this is the guy who invented electricity and stuff... Nah I don't know anyone named Nikola, so it must be a bot or something. *opens it*

What the hell... Why am I talking to myself?! And why does it look like I just got out of bed?! Wait did I go to sleep last night??? What's going on here!?
