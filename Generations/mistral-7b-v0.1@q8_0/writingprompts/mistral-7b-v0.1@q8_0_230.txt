 an obsession to be a hero and save the world.

So I asked myself the question - what is it that drives people to want to be heroes? Is it to help others or to gain recognition for their good deeds? In order to answer this, I've looked at what drives the most influential heroes in history. What makes them so powerful, and how can you use these qualities as a business owner to achieve the same greatness?

Here are three things that drive heroes into action:

### A Clear Vision or Mission

Heroes always have clear objectives. For example, when Superman is fighting against Lex Luthor's evil plan to blow up Metropolis, he knows what his end game is - to stop the blast from happening and save as many people in the process. It's never a question of 'how?' for Superman, it's just a matter of 'when?’.

As a business owner you should have an objective of where your company will be in five years time. This could mean a particular turnover figure that you want to reach or having more staff on board by the end of 2018. Whatever it is, as long as you have a clear vision, you’ll be able to achieve your goal quicker than someone who isn't sure of what they are doing.

### A Call To Action

Superman never just walks past a building that's on fire and leaves. He knows that he must act now, before it spreads throughout Metropolis. Heroes always have an urgency for their actions which means they can achieve more in less time than someone who doesn’t have this sense of urgency.

As a business owner, you should also have the same sense of urgency when it comes to your objectives and goals. If there is something that needs fixing or improving, don't wait until tomorrow - act on it now! The faster you do things, the more likely it will be completed quicker which means better results in less time for everyone involved.

### A Strong Support Network

Superman doesn’t fight alone - he has many people on his team helping him out with whatever task he has at hand including Batman and Wonder Woman. These heroes have a strong support network around them so they can achieve more than anyone else would be able to by themselves.

As business owners you too should build your own team of superheroes in order to achieve the goals that you've set out for yourself and your company. It doesn't matter if these people are employees, clients or suppliers - as long as they share similar values with what drives you then together, nothing will stop them from saving their world (and yours).

So how can we use these qualities to save our own worlds? Well... the answer is pretty simple! By developing our own superpowers. What are the things that drive us to want to achieve greatness? Is it helping others or gaining recognition for what we do? It could be a combination of both, but either way if we have an objective and the determination then anything is possible.

Just remember one thing: There's no such thing as being too late! Start today by setting yourself some goals and taking action towards them. You never know where this will take you... maybe even into a new world altogether?!
