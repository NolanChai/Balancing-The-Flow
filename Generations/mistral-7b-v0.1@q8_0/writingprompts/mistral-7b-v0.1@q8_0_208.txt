ares at him. He is so earnest! And then she remembers how he has never actually seen her school books. ``I don ' t suppose you'd be interested to hear the Latin name for it?''
 
 He frowns and shakes his head. ``No... I wouldn't, but I like the picture anyway.''
 
``Well,'' she says slowly, ``it is a rather nice one.''
 
 His face lights up with a grin so wide that it reaches right to her heart. ``Oh, you think so?''
 
 He is standing in the doorway now. Her hand is on the banister rail; he grabs the other, and pulls her towards him until she is standing between his arms, her back against the banister. They look at each other for a moment, then his lips are on hers, warm and soft and sweet. His tongue darts in to taste, then retreats with a gasp of air.
 
``That was lovely,'' he says, his voice thick with emotion. ``It was so nice.''
 
 She smiles at him shyly, her face flushing, and kisses him again. He pulls her close, kissing her again and again, until she has to break free of the embrace before she falls in a heap on the floor.
 
``I should go,'' she says. ``It's very late.''
 
``Yes,'' he agrees. He turns away from her towards the door, his back still to her.
 
 She watches him for a moment, then takes a step forward and lays her head against his back.
 
 He freezes in mid-movement, then slowly bends down until she is enveloped in his arms. He lifts her up again, and carries her through to the landing, along the corridor and into his room. He lays her on the bed and sits beside her, stroking her hair as she stares at him with wide eyes.
 
``I should go,'' she whispers, still looking at him. She can feel her heart beating wildly in her chest, her skin feels like it is tingling all over. ``I have to go home.''
 
``Yes,'' he agrees, a note of sadness creeping into his voice. He stands up and holds out his hand to her. She reaches out and takes it.
 
 ``Goodbye,'' she says, as he pulls her gently towards the door.
 
 He pauses in the doorway and looks back at her. ``It was nice while it lasted,'' he murmurs quietly.
 
 Then he is gone, leaving her staring after him with tears on her cheeks.
