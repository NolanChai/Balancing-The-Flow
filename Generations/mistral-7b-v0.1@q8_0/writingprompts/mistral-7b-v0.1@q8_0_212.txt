' he asked as he got back up.  
 
 `` What do you think?'' she answered.  
 
 Mark wasn't sure what he thought. Jessica had never been this angry before. He knew she hated him, but not to the point where she would try to kill him.  
 
 `` I don't know,'' he said, trying to keep his voice calm.  
 
 `` You still haven't figured it out?'' Jessica asked.  
 
 `` No... I haven't.'' Mark answered truthfully. He wasn't sure why she was so upset.   
 
 `` Then let me spell it out for you, moron.'' She said angrily as she stormed towards him.  `` I'm angry because you have no idea how to use your powers!''  
 
 Mark stopped her before she could hit him again by grabbing her arm and twisting it behind her back.  
 
 `` Ow,'' Jessica whined.  
 
 `` How about that, Jess? I don't know how to use my powers?'' Mark asked sarcastically as he pinned her against the wall with one hand.   
 
 Jessica growled at him. It was a very cute sound for an adult woman.  
 
 `` That...'' she began to say, then stopped and sighed. `` Okay, fine.'' She said. `` I can't really explain it. It just felt like you were trying to use the powers. Just not doing it right.''   
 
 Mark let go of her arm.  
 
 `` Is there some reason that we are having this discussion?'' he asked. `` Or are you going to keep hitting me until I figure it out?'' He added as she moved closer to him and got ready to hit him again.  
 
 Jessica stopped when Mark put a finger on her nose and pushed it upwards. She glared at him, but didn't say anything.  
 
 `` Okay, here is what I want you to do,'' he said.  
 
 Mark sat down in front of the couch and waited for her to sit next to him. He pulled his pants up as he waited, though it didn't take very long since they were already up to his belly button.   
 
 `` You need to look at me,'' he said after she was done pulling herself up.  
 
 Jessica did that, looking directly into his eyes.  
 
 `` What are you doing?'' she asked.   
 
 Mark ignored her question as he stood up and sat in the middle of the couch. He pulled a couple of pillows out from under them so he could sit down comfortably. Then he put the other two pillows on either side of him.  
 
 `` Now I want you to sit across from me,'' he said. Jessica did as she was told, though it was clear that she thought this whole thing was ridiculous and just wanted it to be over with so they could get back to what they were doing before.  
 
 Mark sat there for a minute, letting her stare at him. Then he turned his head to the side and looked out of the corner of his eye at Jessica's face. She had an expression on it like she didn't know what was going on or how this was supposed to be helpful in any way.   
 
 `` Now I want you to look at me,'' he said.   
 
 Jessica rolled her eyes and did what she was told, looking directly into Mark's eyes.  
 
 `` Okay,'' Mark said. `` Now I want you to close your eyes and listen very carefully.'' He waited for her to do that before continuing on with the lesson.  
 
 `` When you are done listening, I am going to have you open them and look at me again. And then you will know exactly what I am talking about.''   
 
 Jessica did as she was told, closing her eyes and focusing on what he was saying. When she opened them up again, her face had a blank expression on it.  
 
 `` Do you understand?'' he asked.  
 
 She nodded her head. Then he moved his finger to one of the pillows next to him and pointed at it with his other hand while he continued talking.  
 
 `` That pillow is your friend,'' he said. `` It is always going to be there for you. No matter what happens, it will never leave your side.''  
 
 Jessica listened as Mark talked about the pillow being her best friend and how she could trust it completely. When he was finished with his explanation, he put his finger back on the pillow next to him and pointed at another one.   
 
 `` But you don't always have to be friends,'' he said. `` Sometimes people change.'' He continued talking about how sometimes people can become enemies because they are jealous or hate each other for whatever reason. Then he went back to the first pillow and pointed it again, saying that even though your best friend might become an enemy, you still need them in your life because they are there for you no matter what happens.  
 
 Jessica listened intently as Mark talked about friends and enemies and how sometimes people change from being one or the other. When he was finished with his lecture on pillows and friends, he looked her directly in the eyes again and said, `` Now do you understand? ''   
 
 She nodded her head.   
 
 `` Good.'' He said as she went back to staring at him like she didn't know what he was talking about or why this was happening in the first place.  
 
 Mark smiled at Jessica's blank expression before standing up and walking away from the couch, leaving her sitting there alone with her thoughts.   
 
 After a few minutes of thinking about what had just happened between them, Jessica finally understood exactly what it was that Mark wanted to teach her. And she didn't like it one bit because it made her feel like an idiot for not knowing this stuff before now.   
 
 But if anything good came out of all of this then at least they wouldn't have any more awkward conversations about pillows and best friends anymore because she understood now what he was trying to say, even though it still didn't make much sense at all!  
 
 Mark knew that Jessica would understand eventually. He just wished there were a better way for him to explain things so she wouldn't feel so stupid afterwards.
