ocated from the arm to the top of Orville's left buttock. The sucking sounds increased with urgency until it sounded like a thousand frog tongues slapping a thousand wet surfaces.
 
``Stop that!'' Orville swatted at Harold's mouth, but it had already found its new perch on his forehead. He yanked Harold's face away from him. The baby was screeching with hunger and squirming about like a small, angry eel.
 
Orville picked up the screaming creature and headed to the kitchen. Harold kept screaming and suckling at his skin while Orville made breakfast.
 
``Eat some food!'' Orville shoved Harold's head into a bowl of Cheerios.
 
Harold stopped squirming, but continued sucking loudly until his cheeks were full of cereal. The infant pulled away from the bowl and cried.
 
``What?'' Orville picked up another bowl of Cheerios and poured it over Harold's head. ``Eat this.'' He plopped the baby back down into the bowl.
 
Harold screamed louder than ever before, but he kept his face in the cereal. The crunching was even more disgusting than the suckling had been. Orville put down the Cheerios and grabbed a can of peas. He emptied half the can into Harold's mouth, but Harold refused to eat them.
 
``I don't like this!''
 
Orville shook the can over the baby's head until he stopped talking. ``Eat!'' The baby obediently opened his mouth for more peas, and Orville poured half of the can into it. He grabbed another bowl from the cupboard and dumped some sugar in it. Harold stopped squirming again, but the Cheerios were soaking up the juice from the canned peas and turning soggy. The baby was suckling away at them with a vengeance. Orville picked him up again.
 
``You have to stop eating them!''
 
Harold continued suckling. Orville smacked Harold's face, but it was too late. He had already shoved his hand into the bowl and begun licking the Cheerios like a cat. Orville set him down on the floor with the bowl next to him and grabbed a pot of coffee from the counter.
 
``Harold! Eat those peas or I'll give you some more cereal!'' Orville shook Harold again and poured half the can of peas into his mouth. ``Eat, eat, eat.''
 
The baby continued suckling away at the soggy Cheerios. He gagged on the peas, but he never stopped eating. Orville made some toast while Harold choked on cereal. After he had eaten a few pieces, he began coughing violently. Orville set down his plate and ran over to the baby. The infant's face was redder than before and there were flecks of cereal all over the floor.
 
``I don't like this!'' Harold cried again. He reached up and grabbed the counter. ``I want some more Cheerios!''
 
Orville pulled him away from the counter and placed his face back into the bowl. Harold resumed his suckling, and Orville poured in another half-can of peas.
``Eat those peas.''
 
The baby did not stop eating, but he began crying loudly. His cheeks were full with cereal again, and he was choking on more peas.
 
``Stop!'' Orville picked Harold up and shook him by the shoulders. ``Stop!'' Harold continued suckling at his father's skin. Orville put down the baby and went to get a second can of peas from the pantry. He poured half the can into the bowl, but the baby would not eat them.
 
``I don't like this!''
 
Orville shook Harold again until he stopped talking, then dumped more peas into his mouth.
 
``Eat those peas.'' The baby continued suckling at the soggy Cheerios. Orville picked him up and held him above his head, but the baby continued eating. ``I don't like this!'' Harold screamed. He kicked his legs against Orville's chest. ``No more peas! I want some more cereal!'
 
Orville set Harold down on the floor next to his bowl of soggy Cheerios and canned peas. He picked up a newspaper and began reading. Harold reached into the bowl and began licking at the soggy cereal again. Orville shook him, but the baby would not stop eating. The infant's face was redder than before, and he continued crying loudly as he ate more peas and cereal.
 
``I don't like this!'' Harold said between mouthfuls of soggy cereal. ``Stop it!'' Orville shook him again until he stopped talking. ``Eat those peas.'' The baby began eating, but his face was redder than before and there were more flecks of cereal on the floor.
 
``No! I don't like this!'' Harold kicked his feet against Orville's chest. ``I want some more cereal!'
 
Orville set the baby back down in front of the bowl and left him alone. The infant continued suckling at the soggy Cheerios, but he kept crying louder than before. Orville put down his newspaper and walked over to Harold. He picked up the can of peas from behind the baby's head and dumped them into Harold's mouth. The baby began eating again.
 
``Eat those peas.''
