ep, there's nothing like being awoken at an unholy hour by a noise that sounds like a human being trying to get your attention.

When you hear it, you're so shocked and frightened that you freeze in bed for a minute, wondering what the heck just happened. You don't move. The sound comes again - louder than the first time. Your eyes dart around looking for anything out of the ordinary. Are there any signs of life on your front porch? Nope. Everything seems to be calm and quiet outside.

You roll over, turn off your night stand light, and go back to sleep. The next morning you're still thinking about it - what could have woken you up at that hour? You decide to tell yourself it was just a dream. Then the knocking noise happens again the next week.

This time it's so loud and close to your front door that you hear it even though your front door is locked. You get out of bed, go to the window and look outside - no one's there. So now what? Do you call the police? Do you sit by your window with a loaded gun, waiting for an intruder to show up?

Let's say you called the police and they came out to check things out. They search every room in your house and find nothing. They leave and tell you that if it happens again, give them a call. You feel safe for about a week, then it starts happening again. This time it's worse than before - someone has broken into your home!

## How to Solve the Mystery of Knocking in the Night

You wake up at 2 am to find that there is a knock at your door. You look through the peephole and see no one, but you can't help but think who could be outside? Is it someone with bad intentions or just someone trying to get into your house? How do you know for sure?

The first thing you should do is call the police. It is better to be safe than sorry. If the person outside your door has been there for a while, they may try to get in through one of your windows. They might even wait until everyone goes back asleep and then enter. So don't delay calling the cops.

The second step you can take is checking out your surroundings. Look around the house and see if anything seems different from when you last checked it out before bedtime. Is there something new sitting on the counter? Has a window been left open? Did someone come in while everyone was asleep? Make sure you check every room and closet so nothing goes unnoticed.

The third step is locking all doors leading outside. This includes front, back, side, garage, etc... Anything that leads out of your home should have a strong deadbolt lock installed on it. Also make sure to lock any windows or sliding glass doors that lead to the outside. These locks need to be secure as well because criminals love breaking them open when trying to get into someone's house.

If none of these work, then you may want to consider installing cameras around your property. There are plenty of different types available such as motion detectors, night vision cameras and even ones that record sound so you can listen back later on. It is also possible to connect them wirelessly through Wi-Fi so you don't have cables running everywhere.

## What Is a Mystery Knock?

A mystery knock is when someone knocks at your door but does not give any indication of who they are, what they want, or where they came from. It could be that there is no one there, so it's just an empty sound in the night. Or maybe someone else knocked on their way out of your house and didn't realize you were still inside. Either way, a mystery knock can leave anyone feeling spooked, especially if it happens multiple times over several nights.

If you wake up to a loud noise, something like this could happen. But what exactly causes the noises? There are many theories out there about why these mysterious knocks occur. Some people believe they're caused by ghosts trying to communicate with us. Others say it's just natural sounds being amplified because of certain weather conditions. And still others think it might be aliens trying to get our attention! Whatever the reason behind these strange occurrences, one thing remains clear - nobody likes them!

So why do people keep reporting hearing these mysterious noises? Well, there are several possibilities. First off, most likely someone is pranking us with fake knocks. Secondly, it could also be due to paranoia or stress. If you're worried about intruders breaking into your house, then obviously you might hear some suspicious sounds around the place.

And lastly, sometimes people just hear things differently depending on how they perceive noise levels. So if someone has lived alone their whole life, chances are they'll notice slight changes in their environment better than others would.

## How Do You Stop a Mystery Knock?

When you wake up at 3 am to the sound of knocking at your front door, do you jump out of bed and run over there? Or do you sit up straight and stare wide eyed into space wondering who could be outside your house? Well, if you're like most people, chances are that you fall into the second category.

But what exactly is a mystery knock? It turns out that there isn’t just one answer to this question. In fact, there can actually be multiple reasons why someone might suddenly appear at your doorstep without warning. From ghosts to UFO sightings to even burglars, here are some common causes of unexplained noises and knocking noises in the night.

1. Ghosts: There's nothing scarier than hearing a strange noise coming from inside your own home after dark. Could it be a ghost? Maybe! Ghosts tend to make loud footsteps or scratching sounds, but they also often leave behind unexplained marks on walls and furniture. And while most of us probably don’t believe in ghosts, sometimes we might hear things like banging noises coming from nowhere else but our own homes.
2. UFO sightings: We've all seen movies where aliens invade Earth by crashing into buildings. But what happens when something similar happens right here on planet Earth? Well, it would certainly be terrifying if you found yourself waking up to strange lights flashing outside your window. And if you ever do happen to witness a UFO landing somewhere nearby, chances are good that you'll also hear knocking coming from inside the house.
3. Burglars: When someone breaks into our home, we immediately think about protecting ourselves first and foremost. But what happens when someone breaks in while we’re asleep? Most people probably wouldn't even realize it until they wake up in a panic later that night. And while some intruders may just want money or valuables, others could actually be planning to harm you. So it pays off to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity around your house.
4. Wildlife: Another reason why you might hear knocks in the middle of the night is because animals are trying to get inside your home. Some common culprits include raccoons, possums, rats, and even mice! These critters often come into houses through cracks and crevices around doorways and windows. And since they usually travel at night, it wouldn't surprise us if you woke up to the sound of something banging against your door or window.
5. Natural causes: If you live in a rural area where there aren't many people living close by, then chances are good that you won’t experience any major problems with knocking noises. However, if you find yourself living near a busy street or highway, then this could also explain why you hear loud thumping sounds every once and again throughout the night.
6. Paranoia: Lastly, we want to mention paranoia. While it might sound silly to say that someone else is trying to break into your house, there are times when paranoia takes over and makes us jumpy. And when this happens, sometimes all we need is a little reassurance from others around us. So if you hear knocking noises coming from inside your home, try not to panic. Instead, take a deep breath and think about everything else that could be going on.
7. There are several things that can cause a mystery knock in the night. Some people believe it's ghosts trying to communicate with us while others think it's just natural sounds being amplified because of certain weather conditions. And still others say that these mysterious knocks may actually be aliens trying to get our attention! Whatever the reason behind these strange occurrences, one thing remains clear - nobody likes them!
8. ## Conclusion
9. So there you have it! You've been woken up in the middle of the night by a loud banging sound coming from outside your house. What do you think could be causing such commotion? Is this just another prank played upon unsuspecting neighbors or is something more serious at hand here? Let us know what you think!
