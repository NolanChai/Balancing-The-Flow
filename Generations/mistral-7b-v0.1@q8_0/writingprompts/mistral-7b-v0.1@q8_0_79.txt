 had done some productive work today?

As much as I hate it, the answer is yes. I am a procrastinator by nature. I feel that if I could only beat this habit, then maybe I would finally start to become the person that I have always wanted to be.

There's something soothing about spending an entire day dreaming of what you might one day achieve in life. But, when it comes down to making the dreams a reality, then the procrastinating stops being relaxing and starts becoming counterproductive.

So why do I continue to procrastinate? Well, I think that deep down, I have always felt like I was incapable of achieving my dreams. When faced with the task of actually taking action towards them, all the doubts in the back of my mind come flooding out and overwhelm me.

But there's one thing that I know: if you don't take action, then nothing will ever change. And that is something that I have learned to accept, which has allowed me to feel a little bit more confident about taking the next step forward.

## My Personal Goals For This Year

For 2019, I've set out to work on three big goals. Here they are:

- Get in shape
- Become financially independent
- Learn something new

Now that I have set those goals, my next step is to come up with a plan to achieve them. So, here's what I intend on doing:

For my health, I will be starting off by setting aside some time in the mornings to do yoga. If you don't know much about yoga, then let me just say that it is an amazing form of exercise and it has changed my life for the better. I also plan on eating a little bit healthier and trying to avoid junk food as often as possible.

As far as my financial situation goes, I am currently working with a financial advisor to get a better idea of how much I need in order to retire comfortably. This will allow me to come up with a plan for achieving financial independence over the next year.

Finally, I want to learn something new this year. I've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar and I've decided that now is as good of a time as any! So, once all my other priorities are taken care of, then I plan on learning how to play the guitar.

## My Personal Goals For This Month

I am not a naturally proactive person. I tend to put things off until the last minute and then try and get them done all at once. But in order to be successful with my goals, this is something that I need to change. So for February, my goal is just to be more productive than normal by completing everything on my to-do list before 12pm each day.

I've already started working towards this goal and have been doing a good job so far! This will hopefully set me up for success in March when I plan on taking things one step further by being more efficient with how I spend my time during the day.

## My Personal Goals For The Weekend

My weekend is always hectic because my wife has her own schedule of things that she needs to get done around the house. So, it's really difficult for me to find a good time to sit down and work on my goals for the week ahead! But I am determined not to let this stop me from getting them done.

I usually try and set aside some time early in the morning before everyone else gets up so that they don't bother me while I'm working on something important.

## How To Stay Motivated While Working Toward Your Goals

One thing that helps me stay motivated is finding a way to track my progress along the way. For example, if I am trying to lose weight then I will use an app on my phone that tracks how many calories I'm eating each day and how much exercise I am getting. This gives me some perspective about what needs work and keeps me from getting discouraged when things don't seem like they're going well!

Another thing that helps is finding ways to reward yourself after achieving certain milestones or goals along the way. For example, if you are trying to quit smoking then every day that goes by without having a cigarette can be considered progress towards your overall goal of becoming smoke-free! You should celebrate those small victories and use them as motivation for reaching even bigger ones down the road!

It's also important not to get too caught up in perfectionism. Everyone makes mistakes from time to time, so don't beat yourself up if things aren't going perfectly according to plan! Instead, focus on what you have already accomplished and keep pushing forward towards your final destination no matter how long it takes!

## Conclusion: We All Have Different Goals In Life But We Can Achieve Them By Following These Three Simple Steps:

1. Set realistic goals for yourself based on your own personal circumstances and abilities
2. Make a plan of action that will help you achieve these goals step-by-step until they are complete
3. Reward yourself along the way when milestones are reached to keep motivation high!
