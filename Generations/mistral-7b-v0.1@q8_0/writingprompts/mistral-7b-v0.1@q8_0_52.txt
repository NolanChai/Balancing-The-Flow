aving me over. Come. Drink it in.

The sound of the water hitting the side is music. I feel the ripples, each one a wave. The waves crash into each other as they go up and back down, then back up and down again.  And then again, until they don't anymore.

My head feels like a thousand balloons, inflating, bursting, deflating, growing, shrinking, bouncing in and out.  My chest rises and falls with each breath. I inhale, take a moment to breathe it all in; the heat of the summer day, the smell of the freshly cut grass, the taste of the sweat on my skin. The air is cool, refreshing, as it fills up my lungs; the sound of the water laps at the bottom of my belly.

I exhale and the balloons deflate a little bit more, I let go a little more, and with each breath, I take it all in.  The smell, the feel, the taste, the music. I open my eyes and look down into the water; the reflection of me in the glass is blurry but it's there. A silhouette of my head as seen from above; the contours of the cheekbones, the hair on the top of the head.  The water moves with each breath and with each movement of the body. It ripples out into a million tiny circles that ripple out like the concentric rings on the surface of the pool; all joining together to create the music.

I reach out for the glass, it feels heavy in my hand but it's not too hot. I take a sip and let the cool water wash over the back of my throat and into my belly. It feels good.  It feels so good. The balloons are still there but now they're inflating more slowly.

I drink another sip, and then another. And then another. As each sip goes down it takes with it all those little circles that have been dancing around my head for the last couple hours. It feels like I'm floating in a sea of bubbles; no gravity, no pressure. Just me and the music.

I reach up and touch the top of my head with one hand while holding onto the glass with another. The balloons are still there but they're much smaller now, almost imperceptible. And they're not moving around anymore either; just floating in place like a cloud of smoke.

I feel so light and free; like I could float away on this breeze if I wanted to. But I don't want to.

The glass is empty now. The music has stopped and the balloons are gone. I put down my glass and look around at all those little circles, still dancing in place but now without any direction or purpose.  It's like they're all waiting for something to happen; a signal to come back to life. But nothing is happening, not yet anyway.

I lean forward and take a sip of water from the glass, letting it wash over my tongue before swallowing it down. The sweet taste of the water mixed with the saltiness of my saliva makes me think about how good it must feel to be thirsty again after being out in this heat all day.  I'm not quite sure why but thinking about being thirsty makes me want to drink more water.  So I do.

And as I sit there drinking, watching the circles dance around me, I can't help but think how much fun it would be if they could somehow come together again into one big balloon of a circle; like the one we made earlier today when we were playing with those plastic balls. We were having so much fun then until Mommy told us to stop because she had something important to do.  But now that she's gone I bet we can do whatever we want and no one will get mad at us anymore.

So I start blowing on the balloon until it starts getting bigger and bigger. And then I blow harder still until it explodes into millions of tiny pieces, each one flying off in its own direction like little fireworks. But instead of being red or blue or green they're all different colors; bright pinks and purples and blues mixed together with yellows and greens and even a few blacks here and there.  And as I watch the colors swirl around me, I can't help but think about how beautiful everything looks right now; like something out of a fairytale or dream where anything is possible.
