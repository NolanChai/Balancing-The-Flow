ized her up. She had the look of someone who knew what she was doing, but she wasn't dressed for it. She wore a little black skirt and a white blouse with a red belt around her waist. She could have been in a coffee shop somewhere instead of here, and I wouldn't have noticed. Her face was pale and strained; she looked exhausted, as if she'd spent the day running.
 
 `` Who are you? What did you do to him?''
 
 She shook her head and pointed at Wealthy, who was now writhing and screaming in earnest. The little guy wasn't big enough for this kind of drama. Bites People yanked him off his bed and held him up by the collar, but she didn't take him to a chair like I wanted her to.
 
 `` He is not your child! Put him down before I call the police.'' She was so calm it made my skin crawl.
 
 `` How is he? Is there anything wrong?'' I tried not to sound frantic, but it didn't work; Bites People's eyes were sharp and steady as she watched Wealthy.
 
 `` He needs help.'' Her voice was quieter now, though her grip on my son had tightened. She leaned down so she could look him in the eyes and he stopped thrashing around for a moment.
 
 `` I don't know if you heard me before, but that's not my child!'' It sounded like someone else was speaking; it came out hysterical instead of angry.
 
 `` What happened? Tell me!'' I took a step toward them but stopped short when I saw the way she held him. Wealthy didn't look scared or upset, just tired and confused.
 
 `` You should let go,'' I said. `` He's not your kid.'' She gave me a long look that I couldn't decipher, and then she put him back in his bed.
 
 `` Did you find out what happened?'' she asked me. `` You know why he's here? Why he can't go home?'' Wealthy was quiet for the first time since she came through the door.
 
 `` I don't know anything,'' I said, shaking my head. `` Please get out of my house!'' She seemed surprised by this response and stood up slowly. When she turned toward me again it was like seeing a stranger for the first time; her hair was different, or maybe it wasn't that at all but how she wore it made her look older than before.
 
 `` I should go,'' she said quietly. She walked over to the door and opened it before turning back toward me once more with one last glance down at Wealthy. `` He will be fine.'' And then she was gone.
