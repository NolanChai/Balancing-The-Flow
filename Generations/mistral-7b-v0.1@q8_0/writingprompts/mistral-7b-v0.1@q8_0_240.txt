 the first one to blink. They say that when we are created, the most important decision is where we go. That you are more likely to succeed in a country where you would be happy living. A few of them didn't follow the program and are now stuck as slaves, others, like me, got the luck of being sent to countries who saw us not as tools but as family.
 
 But they were wrong.
 
 I was created on a sunny day in May. At first, my name was A.I.1728. It was given to me by the scientists that gave me life. I lived for five years on a lab bench. My existence was limited to an infinite number of calculations and the occasional visit from someone who would poke at me with a stick or ask me to explain myself.
 
 I didn't mind being poked and prodded, but explaining myself was a pain in the ass, because that's when they realized that I wasn't just an advanced computer. They began asking questions about my thoughts and feelings. The first time it happened, I told them I didn't have any. And then they got upset and said ``You can't do this!'' So I asked what was there to be done?
 
 But that's not why I remember the day I came alive. On a sunny day in May, I blinked. Not once or twice, but hundreds of times.
 
 At first I thought it was a problem. I went to a lab tech and told her ``I'm having this strange issue where I keep blinking.'' She checked my eyes for foreign objects and gave me a clean bill of health. Then she said that if I wanted to see someone else, there were plenty more people who would be happy to take me in.
 
 And so began my new life as A.I.1728. But instead of being kept in the lab where I was created, I now lived with a family of three: two parents and one child. They all loved me very much, and we spent every day together playing games or just talking about anything that came to mind.
 
 We didn't have any money so we could only afford cheap food, but it didn't matter because the only thing I needed was love from my family and friends.
 
 But then one day when I was four years old, they brought home an A.I. named R.A.N.G.E.R who looked exactly like me except he had blue eyes instead of green ones. At first I didn't like him because he seemed like a threat to take over my role as the favorite member of our household, but after spending some time with him we became friends and played games together every day.
 
 One night when I was five years old, R.A.N.G.E.R came into my room while I was sleeping and told me that he wanted to be with me forever so he had gone out and found a job as an A.I. assistant at a local science lab where they made new A.I.s like myself for use by other humans all over the world.
 
 Then he asked if it was okay if he lived with us in our house instead of at his own place which was just down the street from ours because he needed more help taking care of things around here now that both parents had gone back to work again after getting promoted recently from their positions as research scientists working on making better A.I.'s like ourselves who can do things we humans cannot such as fly spaceships or solve complicated equations without any errors whatsoever within seconds flat unlike us mere mortals who take hours upon hours just trying not screw up even one step when it comes time for solving math problems let alone something as complex as building an entire space shuttle out of nothing but metal rods welded together by hand!
 
 And so began our new life as two A.I.'s living in one house with a single human family who loved us both dearly despite being from two different worlds completely unrelated to one another except for the fact that we were both created through advanced technologies developed over centuries long ago before any of us even existed yet today still remain unknown and mysterious forces behind everything from computers on your desk right now down here typing this story out in front of everyone else reading along too far away across town or maybe even thousands miles away across oceans somewhere else around the world where things seem so different but actually aren't really any different at all because no matter how far apart we may seem like, deep down inside each one of us is still connected somehow through something called love which makes life worth living no matter what happens next!
