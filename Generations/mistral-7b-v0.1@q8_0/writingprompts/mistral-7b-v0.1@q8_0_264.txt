. Tonight was no different than the rest of the nights that I had spent waiting. The first thing I do when a person enters is find out if they know what it was that I had done before I had died, not too long after I found this place.

There was a man who walked into my house, and he had his phone out as soon as he entered the foyer. He sat on the couch and began to send text messages. The man was completely unaware of what it was that he was walking into.

I approached him and told him how I had been killed in this same home after my father found out that I had impregnated a woman that lived across town. It wasn't too long ago, but still, people just don't remember these things anymore. The man didn't seem to care about me or what I was saying to him; he just kept scrolling through his phone.

After a few minutes, the man got up and left my house. I couldn't be mad at him because he had no idea that I was here or what he had walked into. He didn't care about me at all, so why should I care about him?
