 the hallway, he stopped in front of one of the doors and pushed it open to reveal what I can only describe as a white room. He gestured for me to enter.

I entered the brightly lit room. It was a room with two walls and two opposing doorways. On the far wall, I could see the outline of a person through a small square cut out. The tall man closed the door behind me and stood at the opposite doorway watching me. As my eyes began to adjust to the lighting, I could now make out the faint image of myself sitting in front of an interviewer on the other side of the room.

A voice spoke from the wall with no discernable source: “Your task is simple. You must convince us why we should offer you a job here.” My heart raced. I had been looking for a job since graduating and my only interviews were through online applications that went unanswered. This was it; this was the chance to break out of the cycle of rejection. The tall man nodded encouragingly at me but said nothing.

I turned around and stared directly into the camera, a sense of dread building up in the pit of my stomach. I opened my mouth to speak and then realized I didn’t know what to say. So I started with the most basic things that came to mind: “Hello! My name is X…” The words fell flat. The interviewer gave me no response.

I thought about all the reasons why they should hire me, but none of them seemed sufficient. Then I realized something. I didn’t know anything about the job. What did it involve? What were my duties? What was their purpose as a company? How would it benefit them to have me as an employee? All these questions rushed into my mind and out the tip of my tongue.

As time passed, the sense of dread became overwhelming, and I realized that if I didn’t think fast enough or come up with something convincing, then they would reject me just like every other company had done before. So I tried again: “I am a hard worker who is passionate about…” But once again there was no response from the interviewer, only silence.

The clock ticked on as my mind raced for answers; however, nothing seemed adequate enough to convince them that they should hire me. My heart pounded against my chest; I could feel sweat beading on my forehead while I frantically searched through any last hope of persuasion left in my arsenal: “I am reliable…” But again there was no response from the interviewer.

Finally, after what felt like hours had passed without a word uttered between us, a voice finally broke through the silence: “Thank you for your time today; unfortunately…” The tall man opened the door and walked out of the room before I could even finish hearing what he was saying about me getting rejected once again.
