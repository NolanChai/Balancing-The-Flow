 I didn't even know her name.

"Hey." A voice came from behind me. I turned to see the beautiful girl standing in front of me smiling. She was as pretty as ever, but my mind went blank and all I could think about was how much she loved her eyes.

"Ummm... hi?" I said stupidly. My cheeks started burning. "Do I know you?"

She smiled at me and held out her hand. I took it and felt myself blush even more as her skin touched mine. She looked down at my name tag, then back into my eyes. "I'm Jenna, your new coworker."

"Oh... oh. That's great, Jenna." I stammered. Why couldn't I just say something normal? Maybe if I got to know her a little bit better we could be friends.

A few minutes passed before either of us said another word and by the time we did she had moved into the register beside me. "I work here too?"

"Yep, you'll be my new assistant." She handed me a sheet with my schedule on it. "It looks like they've given you some easy days to get used to things so you should be fine." I looked it over and smiled. I was going to love working for her.
