# Singer Drake's dating advice is 'dress better and go to the gym'

Drake’s dating advice for other men is simply to dress well and work out more, after his new girlfriend Sophie Brussaux recently praised him for being a “good dad.”

The Canadian rapper has been linked to former adult star Sophie – real name Stephanie Carrie Oebanda – since January, when she gave birth to their son Adonis.

The couple have reportedly had an on-and-off relationship over the past 18 months, with Drake revealing he’d been secretly seeing Sophie while still dating model Jennifer Lopez in 2017.

During a recent appearance on U.S. breakfast show Good Morning America, Sophie – who goes by her French nickname Rosee Divine – was asked if she had any advice for other women looking to land the “Hotline Bling” hitmaker as a boyfriend.

“He’s a very nice person. He’s a good dad,” she said, while also noting that Drake is a “very handsome guy.”

She then turned to the rapper and added, “And I think if you want to attract someone like him… Maybe dress better and go to the gym?”

Drake replied: “Go to the gym – and we’ll talk about it later,” with Sophie adding, “He’s a good guy.”

The couple’s relationship seems to be going strong as Drake has been showing off photos of their little boy on social media in recent weeks.
