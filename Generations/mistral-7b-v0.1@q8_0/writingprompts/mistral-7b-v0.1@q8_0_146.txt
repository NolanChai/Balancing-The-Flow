, I have to split it with my sister. We've always shared everything since we were little kids. I'll be glad when we move to our new house and she's on her own. 
 
 Now what am I supposed to do? I still have the same job I had before, and my life hasn't changed at all. My sister bought a condo with her half of the money, but I don 't know if I can afford one. We never used the winnings to buy a new car; I drove our old one until it gave up the ghost a few months ago. I needed some transportation to get to work though, so I had to borrow some money from the bank and pay $ 250 a month for an old clunker with 173,000 miles on it. 
 
 I know you're supposed to invest the rest of the money or something, but where am I going to put it? I already have all the furniture in my house that I can afford. There 's a lot of stuff there, believe me. It's just that it 's all old and cheap. 
 
 Oh well. Maybe things will change soon. My boss was supposed to get back to me about that promotion I applied for, but he said it would be a few more days. I hope so. The pay would go up to $ 600 a month, and that would help out a lot. In the meantime, I'll have to keep eating Ramen noodles every day and watching TV on my old black-and-white. 
 
 You know, maybe this winning the lottery thing isn 't all it 's cracked up to be after all. 
 
 THE END
