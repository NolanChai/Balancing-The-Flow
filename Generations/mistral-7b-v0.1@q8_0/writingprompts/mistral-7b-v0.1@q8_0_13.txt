 to her knees.

“Please,” she whispered, “please don’t let him touch me.” She begged with everything within her soul as she stared at her reflection in the stream of water from a fallen tree branch. Her blue-green eyes were wide with terror and her blonde hair was tangled and wet. A gust of wind caused her to shiver violently as she struggled against her own bonds and they cut into her wrists.

A pair of yellow-green eyes watched her struggle, moving only inches away from the young girl as he held his breath, listening for any sounds that might give away his presence. Her scream had been muffled by the rain but it still hadn’t taken long for him to find her. A smile slowly formed on his lips as his pale skin glistened in the rain and he watched her struggle against her bonds.

Suddenly, she stilled, staring into his eyes with wide terror before closing her eyes and silently praying that this was all a bad dream. She felt the ground shift beneath her as she slowly stood and stumbled blindly through the forest. She had no idea what direction she was heading, she only knew that she needed to get away from him as soon as possible.

“Run,” he whispered softly in her ear. The smell of her fear and blood made his smile grow wider and her heart race faster.

Her heart thundered against her chest as she heard him speak into her ear before running blindly through the forest. She ran with all her strength until she was sure that she wouldn’t make it any farther, before tripping and falling face first into the soft soil, a thin trickle of blood trailing from her lip. She sobbed in terror as the rain beat down upon her, pooling around her on the ground.

She slowly pushed herself to her feet with shaky hands, still not knowing where she was or even where she was going. Her vision was starting to blur and her knees shook beneath her as she continued to run blindly through the forest. The rain continued to beat down upon her, causing her already soaked clothes to cling to her skin, making it difficult for her to move. She tripped again but managed to keep from falling this time as she slowly pulled herself to her feet with a whimper.

Her breath hitched in her chest as the soft earth beneath her bare feet was replaced by gravel and the sound of running water. Her knees shook violently as she realized that she was now on a road, not sure how far it would take her or where it would lead to. She took a slow, shaky step onto the pavement, her vision blurring even more as she stumbled forward again. Her eyes were starting to close and she struggled against the urge to fall asleep and let him take her.

She didn’t know how long she had been walking for when she started hearing voices off in the distance, too faint for her to make out what they were saying. She followed the sound of their voices until she found herself standing outside a small diner, the rain beating down upon it as well.

Her heart leapt in her chest as she noticed that there was no one inside and took the opportunity to push open the door before rushing inside. The lights were dim but they were on and she didn’t want to take any chances of being caught outside in this weather without shelter, even if it meant being seen by anyone who happened to be inside.

She rushed towards the back corner of the diner where there was a small booth that had been pushed against one of the walls, too far away from the rest of the customers for them to see her and hopefully not notice anything strange about her appearance or behavior. She pulled out a chair and sat down, closing her eyes as she tried to slow down her racing heartbeat before pulling her hair back into a ponytail with shaky hands.

The sounds of people talking floated in from outside as she stared blankly at the table before her, not daring to open her eyes lest they reveal the bloodstain on her shirt. Her vision began to blur again and she closed her eyes tightly in an effort to keep them open.

Her heart raced even faster as she heard footsteps approaching from behind her but didn’t dare look over her shoulder for fear of what might be there. She slowly turned her head around, taking a deep breath before opening her eyes as the sound of a key turning in the lock caused her to freeze in place.

The rain beat down heavily upon her as she stood at the side of the road, not sure which direction was safe for her to go in. Her vision blurred again and she found herself stumbling blindly through the forest. She tripped once more but managed to stay on her feet before pulling herself back up with a gasp, taking another step forward towards the sound of running water that grew louder as she approached it.

She stumbled off the pavement into gravel before hitting her knees against the ground again, causing them to shake violently beneath her. Her vision blurred even more and she slowly pulled herself back up with a whimper before taking another step forward towards the sound of running water that grew louder as she approached it.
