: interrupting my rest so that you can ask me to do something for you. Besides, if your boss is dead then who are we going to blame?'' 
 
The figure sighed again. 
 
 `` Well, fine. I suppose it would be the perfect time to take on this mission. But only because he was my friend and not because it might save the world from some great evil.'' 
 
A few hours later a team of adventurers was assembled in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. 
 
 `` Who are you?'' one of them asked. 
 
The figure in black stood, her voice dripping with sarcasm: 
 
 `` I am Darth Vader and I shall be your guide.'' 
 
 *Darth*? The figure didn't even know what that was! And she had never seen any of these people before. 
 
 `` What?'' the figure asked, looking at her watch. 
 
It was three o'clock in the morning. 
 
 `` No, I mean it's already three o'clock in the morning.'' 
 
The figure shrugged and returned to her seat. 
 
`` What are you waiting for?'' she asked the others. 
 
They looked at each other, puzzled. 
 
 `` You don't have a clue what you're doing here, do you?'' one of them finally said. 
 
The figure scoffed. 
 
 `` No.'' 
 
... *Darth Vader*? 
 
`` Yes,'' said the figure with a sigh, 
 
 `` Darth Vader was my father. And he died because of me. Now I shall take up his mantle and lead this team into battle against evil.''
User 3: "Why don't you just go home and sleep?" asked the man in the black cloak. He looked like he had been living under a rock for many years, but he was clearly still alive. 

The woman in white nodded. "Yes. That would be best." 

The man in black nodded as well. "Good. Now let's get back to work."
User 2: "I have to go," said the man in white. "It is getting late and I must sleep."

The woman nodded, and they both left. The man in black was alone again. He looked out at the night sky. It was beautiful, but it seemed like there were a thousand stars.
User 1: "Why do you think that is?" asked the woman. She sat down next to him on the bench, her feet resting on his lap. They both stared up at the stars for a long time. 

"Because we are all so small," said the man softly. He looked over at her and smiled. "We are all so very small."
