 your feelings, and don’t let them fall 
 
 For if you fail to break down the fourth wall 
 
 You might fall into an endless pit of despair 
 
 But once you manage to break the wall 
 
 The entire world will seem so much more fair 
 
 And a new realm will open up before your eyes 
 
 A land of possibilities, where anything’s possible 
 
 So when I say “Break down that fourth wall” 
 
 Remember the price you have to pay 
 
 But if you do manage to break it down 
 
 You won’t regret a thing you did that day
