“You’ll get used to it,” The bartender said in an unconcerned tone.

Alistair made a face as he sipped his drink, it tasted of salt and chemicals, bitter yet somehow sweet on the tongue. “You’re not making this up are you?” He asked.

“This isn’t the first time I’ve heard that.” The barkeep said in an offhand voice.

“Well…” Alistair sighed as he swirled his drink, it was clear as water, but there were bubbles floating atop the liquid. “I guess I have to start somewhere huh?”

“You’ve got a long way to go my friend.” The bartender said.

Alistair sat in silence as he considered what had brought him here. He was from another world, an interloper from another plane of existence entirely and yet here he sat sipping a drink that would give him the strength to face his destiny. Destiny that he knew little about but if it involved a drink called X-Ray then he was in for one hell of a ride.
