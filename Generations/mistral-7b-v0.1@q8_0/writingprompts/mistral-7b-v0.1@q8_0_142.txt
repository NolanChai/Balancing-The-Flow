*How is it that he found me so easily?! What?!*
 
 
**Aaaaaahhhh!! You are really out of your mind, you know!? AAAAAHHH!!! Why would you come to this place?! I was just here because it's a really nice, peaceful place to be in. And now you show up... How the hell did you find me anyway?**
 
 *I couldn't have possibly known that you were going to be here.*

*This is unreal. Just too much.*

 **Aaaaaaahhhh... I need some water... Where are my keys... Aaaahhhh... where are they?! Goddamn!**

 *Here, let me get them for you*
 
**Wha-? What?! No way! No freaking way! How could you know where I keep the key? And how did you even get here without keys? You were hiding somewhere?**

 **You are out of your mind. Why would you come all the way to this place? And how could you possibly find me?**

 *I'll be honest with you, I'm not sure how exactly I found you. The only thing I know is that I was told to do so by someone. But I don't even know who.*
 
 **So you are just going around listening to people telling you what to do?**
 
*Exactly... And this person told me to meet you at this very place, which happened to be the last place where you had been.*

 *And how is that possible?*
 
**Well I guess you have some sort of a connection with that person. So I assume you must have the same ability as him/her?**

 *Yes, and it's even stronger than his/hers!*
 
 **Hm... Okay. That's interesting.**
 
 *I need to ask you something*
 
 **Yeah... Go ahead.**

 *Do you know who this person is?*
 
 **What?! No I don't! I have no idea about it, how could I possibly know that?**
 
 *He told me to find him and then meet with you. But he said nothing else... So why do we even need each other? What should I do now?*
 
 **Aaaaahhhh, I'm so thirsty. I need some water really badly.**
 
*I see that.*
 
 *Aaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!! Aaaaahh!!!!!!!!*
