asive action of a bullet.

`` It doesn't, no more than the ability to read the stars will disprove your creator. Surely, you must know that.'' The words came from an older gentleman, as Sebastian had learned during his years at Hogwarts. He had never really considered this man being able to be a Time Lord, until now.

He looked at him and sighed, `` I don't even understand your words, but yes, I know it won't.'' As the conversation continued on, Sebastian watched with an intense interest as they talked about the universe, time travel and everything else. This was all new to him, he had never considered anyone being a Time Lord before, nor did he have any idea what one even was.

It was explained to him that they were able to travel through space and time. They could go into the future and past, as well as many other places. A few examples of this were used, one of them being the TARDIS, which was a type of ship. The more he learned, the more fascinated he became in what he heard.

`` But how?'' He asked, after they had explained the process.

The gentleman looked at him with an amused look on his face and sighed, `` There is no easy way to explain this.''

`` You must try.''

`` The simplest way I can put it is, we are able to bend space and time around us as we move, allowing us to go anywhere in time, or to a different place.'' The man sighed again. `` But how do you make that work?'' Sebastian asked.

The older man looked at him and smiled, before turning back towards the other man. `` That is why I am here, I can't tell you what he wants me to tell you yet. I need to be sure first.'' The man looked back at the younger man.

Sebastian sighed and looked around, he noticed that there were two of them there now. He had heard them talking about the other one when he arrived. Sebastian turned his attention towards the second man, who was sitting down, looking like he didn't care at all about anything. `` So?'' He asked.

`` I want to know what it is you wish to do.'' The man said, still not looking at him.

`` Well, that is obvious, isn't it? It's why I am here.'' Sebastian said with a smile.

The other man looked at the young wizard and nodded, before turning back towards the older man, `` He wants to learn how to do what we can do.'' He sighed again and turned his head towards Sebastian.

`` Why would you want to? It's dangerous and has never been done.'' The man said.

Sebastian shrugged and looked at him with an amused look on his face, `` Oh come now, it can't be that hard. I mean, sure, there might be some risk involved, but don't you think I would have known that by now? After all, I have already done a lot of things in my life.'' He said as he stood up and looked down at the man.

The other man sighed and shook his head, `` No, it's not dangerous, but there is a risk involved. And if you were to be caught by the wrong people...'' The older man was interrupted by Sebastian who turned around with a smile on his face and pointed towards himself, `` Me!'' He said as he put up his hands like he was ready for them to attack him at any moment.

The man looked down at him with an amused look and sighed again before turning back towards the other man, `` So... what do you want from me?'' The man asked.

Sebastian shrugged and looked at the ground for a few seconds before looking back up at them, `` I don't know.'' He said.

The older man was silent as he tried to think of something. `` Well, I suppose it doesn't matter what you do with your life, so long as it is not dangerous, but...'' The man paused and looked down at the ground before looking back up at the other man who had been speaking. `` What about your past? That would be important to know.'' He said with a smile.

Sebastian looked at him with an amused look on his face and nodded, `` Yeah, I have a few things that need to be dealt with before we can do anything else.'' The man looked up at him again and nodded slowly before looking down towards the ground, `` Alright then...'' The man said.

Sebastian smiled and turned back around towards him, `` Great! Now I will tell you everything you want to know about my past.'' He said with a smile on his face as he sat down again.
`` You did it? You found the right place?''

The man in black nodded and pulled out an old book from inside his coat pocket. He looked through it before looking back up at me, `` Yes, this is where we need to go.'' He said with a smile on his face as he turned around and started walking towards the door again.

`` Wait, what about the others? You haven't told them yet...'' I asked him, but he didn't seem to hear me at first so I had to repeat myself loudly. `` What about them?'' He looked back at me with a confused look on his face before nodding again and walking out of the room, shutting the door behind him as soon as he was through it.

I waited for a few minutes before heading over towards the door and knocking on it twice before opening up my wand again and saying `` Lumos''. I walked inside and looked around, but there wasn't anyone else there with me so I closed the door behind myself quickly just in case someone was coming down the hallway.

I walked over towards a desk that seemed to be made from wood instead of glass like the others in this room did and sat down on one of its chairs before taking out my wand again and saying `` Lumos''. I looked around once more but there still wasn't anyone else with me so I put away my wand and started looking through this book.

`` So you have found them?'' I asked as soon as the man in black came back into the room, holding a scroll in his hand and walking towards where I was sitting. `` Yes...'' He said with an amused look on his face as he walked over towards me and handed over the scroll.

`` What is this?'' I asked him while looking at the scroll before taking it from him, `` It's a map.'' He said with a smile on his face before walking out of the room again to get something else, but before he left he turned around towards me and said `` You are welcome to stay here as long as you want...''

I nodded at him with a smile on my face before putting away my wand once more and opening up the map that he had given me. I looked down at it for a few minutes before looking back up at him again, `` Where did they come from?'' He asked me as soon as he walked into the room once more, holding something else in his hand instead of the map now.

I took out my wand again and said `` Lumos'', before looking down at what he had given me which was another map but this one looked different than the first one I had seen earlier today. It was actually made from wood and there were many more details on it that seemed to be drawn by hand instead of using some kind of computer program or something like that...

I looked back up at him once again after finishing my inspection of what he had given me, `` They came from another world.'' He said with an amused look on his face before walking out of the room again so I closed my wand and started looking through this new map which seemed to be much more detailed than the first one I saw earlier today.

`` What else do you know about them?'' I asked him as soon as he came back into the room once more, holding another scroll in his hand instead of anything else so I took it from him and looked at it before putting away my wand again. `` They have been looking for a place where they can hide...'' He said with an amused look on his face before walking out of the room again to get something else...

`` What is this?'' I asked him as soon as he came back into the room once more, holding yet another map in his hand instead of anything else so I took it from him and looked at it for a few minutes before looking back up at him again. `` This is where they came from...'' He said with an amused look on his face before walking out of the room once more to get something else...

`` What do you mean, this is where they came from?'' I asked him as soon as he walked back into the room once more, holding yet another map in his hand instead of anything else so I took it from him and looked at it for a few minutes before looking back up at him again. `` This is where they are going...'' He said with an amused look on his face before walking out of the room once more to get something else...

`` What do you mean, this is where they are going?'' I asked him as soon as he walked back into the room once more, holding yet another map in his hand instead of anything else so I took it
