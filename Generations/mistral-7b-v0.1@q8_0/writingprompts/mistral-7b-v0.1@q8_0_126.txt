outs between Senator Clinton and Senator Obama. The debates were the last chance for each candidate to persuade voters that their views represented the future of America.

Mrs. Dunbar was one of those undecided voters in a battleground state who had been wooed by both campaigns. Both sides had bombarded her with e-mails and phone calls. She’d read all she could on the Internet, watched news shows that reported on their speeches and appearances at town hall meetings. Mrs. Dunbar had seen the ads on television and listened to radio spots while in her car. But it was the debates that provided her with the most information about what each candidate actually believed.

The two campaigns knew this, so they invested a lot of time preparing their candidates. Each wanted to have their man or woman come out a winner.

Senator Clinton had been coached to emphasize her experience. She was the only one who had ever fought for families as a mother and a senator. Her husband’s presidency showed what a real leader could do. Senator Obama, on the other hand, had been told he was a different kind of candidate. He’d grown up in poverty but now represented hope for all Americans.

Mrs. Dunbar knew all this going into the final debate. She was ready to evaluate both candidates and make her choice based on what she learned. But neither campaign wanted that choice to be easy, so they used Mrs. Dunbar as a pawn in their game. Both had hoped to win her vote, but one had worked harder at getting it and had succeeded.

Mrs. Dunbar thought back over the week and smiled. She’d known who she was going to support all along, even before she’d been contacted by both campaigns. Mrs. Dunbar liked a winner and knew Senator Obama would be the next president of the United States.
