g to get through the day without sleep. I'd been up all night writing and editing; I still had another half hour before school began.
 
  I wanted more sleep, but the clock taunted me with its relentless ticking. The only way out of this was to finish my project and submit it by deadline.
 
  "Fuck," I whispered to myself as the seconds counted down.
 
  I pushed hard, determined to get through one more story before bedtime. With each keystroke came relief; with every new sentence written was another chance for escape from this endless cycle of exhaustion and frustration.
 
  The clock ticked closer to midnight and still no progress had been made on my project. I felt like a failure as the seconds counted down towards nothingness. My eyes began closing involuntarily as sleep beckoned me into its comforting embrace.
 
  Finally, after what seemed like forever, I managed to type out an ending paragraph that left me feeling satisfied with what had been accomplished that day despite all odds stacked against us both -- exhaustion and insomnia working hand in hand to bring down our morale even further than it already was! But it didn't matter now because we had made progress - albeit small steps forward but still progress nonetheless - which gave us hope for tomorrow when hopefully things will get better again thanks to those few words written down today by yours truly: me!
 
  "Goodnight," I whispered as I closed my laptop and turned out the light.

  "Sweet dreams," replied my tired brain.
