The story that the Daily Mail Reporter reported on this article was about a girl who lost an arm in plane crash. This accident happened because there was bad weather conditions at the time and the pilot wasn’t experienced enough to fly in these conditions. The pilot crashed into a windmill and the girl had to have her left arm amputated, she also has a prosthetic eye as well.
In my opinion, this is not an interesting story. I do think that it was a terrible accident and I feel very sorry for what happened to her but it does not interest me. I think if the article was written in a different way it could be more interesting because the way it was written just described the events of the story and nothing else.
In my opinion, this article should not have been published by the Daily Mail Reporter because it’s not something that people want to read about. It is very sad what happened but there are better stories out there that could be more interesting to read about.
