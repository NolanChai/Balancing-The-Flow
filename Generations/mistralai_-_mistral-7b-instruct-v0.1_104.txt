 The Interior Ministry stated that security forces conducted a raid in the Sinai Peninsula to dismantle a hideout belonging to terrorists. During the operation, two military personnel were killed and a third was injured.

The ministry did not specify which militant group was behind the attack. However, Egypt has been facing an insurgency led by Islamist militants in the Sinai Peninsula for years. These groups have carried out several attacks on security forces and civilians, including bombings and assassinations.

The Egyptian government has implemented a state of emergency in the Sinai since 2013, following the overthrow of former President Mohamed Morsi. The military has been carrying out operations to clear out militant strongholds in the region, but the insurgency has persisted.
