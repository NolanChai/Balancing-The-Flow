The first thing that strikes me is the word 'heroic'. I'm not sure I would have used this word, it seems a little exaggerated, as I don't believe the information presented here tells us anything about whether or not he was heroic, we are just told what happened.

The second thing that struck me is how it begins: 'The humble librarian who became an all-action commando'. Now this may be true and well deserved, but why start with the 'humble' part? It feels like a little put down.
