* You are right about that. But as far as I know, there isn’t any smartphone app which can be used to control all these things at once. You have a few apps that can control some of them, but not all together. So if you want your bathroom temperature controlled, the drone and the speeding robot controlled, then you need three separate devices.
* But I think that is just because they aren’t very useful right now, at least for home use. Smartphones are becoming more powerful, so these apps will get better in future. But even then there will be some problems – for example, if I want to control all of them using my phone, there needs to be a single app for that, and not multiple apps which can be controlled by one phone at most.
* It’s possible you are right about the technology being available but not yet widely used in smartphones. I’m sure we will see more integration between devices as they become smaller and more powerful. For example, maybe one app could control all of these devices if there were a standard set up for each device that was compatible with any given smartphone.
