 While forgetfulness can increase with age due to factors like stress, sleep deprivation, or medication side effects, it doesn't necessarily mean memory loss is a definitive part of the aging process starting at age 40. Mild memory issues are more commonly associated with conditions like Alzheimer's disease and dementia, which tend to affect older adults. However, everyone experiences forgetfulness from time to time, and it doesn't necessarily indicate a significant memory problem. If you or someone else is experiencing persistent memory loss that interferes with daily life, it's important to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation.
