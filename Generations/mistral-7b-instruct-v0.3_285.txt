 It seems like you're combining two different concepts: Nigella Kitchen, a cooking show hosted by Nigella Lawson, and leopard frogs, a type of amphibian. If by "amphibian-version" you mean an adaptation of the cooking show for amphibians, that would be quite an interesting concept! However, it's important to remember that amphibians can't watch TV or cook, so the leopard frogs wouldn't actually be enjoying Nigella Kitchen. If you meant something else by your statement, feel free to clarify!
