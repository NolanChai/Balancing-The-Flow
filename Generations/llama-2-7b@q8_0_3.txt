The TLC show Cake Boss is a television show that follows Buddy Valastro and his staff of cake bakers as they produce cakes for weddings, special events, and other occasions. An episode from this season was scheduled to air on June 5, but has been pulled due to complaints over a cake produced in an earlier episode which had a depiction of the Virgin Mary.

The cake had a statue of Our Lady of Guadalupe on top, with blue icing and white details. Some people found this to be blasphemous because the Catholic Church does not recognize this particular image as having miraculous properties. TLC has not explained why the episode was pulled other than a vague mention that the network had received complaints from some viewers who were offended by it and decided to pull the episode.

### Extra Info:
The Catholic Church does not recognize Our Lady of Guadalupe as having miraculous properties, so I'm pretty sure people aren't being "blasphemous" because they have a statue of her in their house that they love and believe is sacred. If someone is offended by that, then the issue is with them and not TLC or Buddy Valastro.
