After struggling to lose the last few pounds of the 9st (57kg) she had put on during pregnancy, the mother was determined to fit into a size 10 dress and went on an extreme diet. She stopped eating altogether at around 8pm each day and only consumed high protein shakes for breakfast, lunch and dinner before exercising four times a week in her local park. But now the 26-year-old mother has reached her target weight of 9st (57kg) by Christmas Eve and is aiming to lose another stone over the next few months. The unnamed woman from East Sussex, pictured, says she was inspired to shed so much weight after giving birth . She said: 'When I had my son, I was devastated that I wasn't able to fit into a size 12 dress any more. I knew I had put on a lot of weight when I fell pregnant and had been eating junk food everyday so I decided to try out Weight Watchers.' The mother-of-one added: 'It was really hard as I would get hungry in the evening, but I tried not to think about it too much. 'I made sure I didn't eat anything after 8pm and only ate breakfast at 6am so I wouldn't be tempted with anything bad.' The woman said: 'At first I was feeling really grumpy as I had lost my appetite but now I feel so much better. I have a lot more energy' . She also exercises in the park, saying it is hard at first but she can already see a difference . It took her two months to lose 7st (45kg) and when she reached her target weight of 9st (57kg) on Christmas Eve, she decided to carry on with the diet for now. 'It was really hard as I would get hungry in the evening but I tried not to think about it too much' . The woman said: 'I felt very sad when I realised I couldn't fit into a size 10 dress and wanted to start the new year with a positive mindset, so I decided to keep going.' She added: 'My friends always say that I look really good, especially in my figure-hugging dresses. It definitely makes you feel good when people compliment you on your weight loss.' The mother-of-one has now joined an all women's gym which she goes to three times a week and says she can already see her body transforming. 'When I went swimming I was really embarrassed by how big my stomach looked but I am getting smaller every day,' the woman said . She is aiming to lose another stone over the next few months so she feels better in clothes and has more energy . The mother-of-one added: 'I never thought that I could be this active. Before I was always too tired by the time evening came around but now I go for a run four times a week.' She added: 'My son is only 15 months old so it can be hard to find time, but I always make sure I have enough sleep as I don't want to feel sluggish when I exercise. The mother-of-one said her son was 'so cute and loving' and helped inspire her . She added: 'I try to exercise three times a week and also swim once or twice a week and I feel great now.' However, she still struggles with her diet as she doesn't like to eat meat so tries to fill up on salad when she is hungry. The woman said: 'I don't eat very much anymore but when I do it is usually chicken, fish or a big salad. 'I can sometimes struggle at Christmas because of all the food around and will try not to drink alcohol.' She added: 'People often ask me how I manage to lose so much weight as I don't seem like I am on a diet at all. 'But I still enjoy going out for dinner with my friends and they are very supportive of what I have done.' The woman said she was feeling so good after losing the weight that she is now aiming to fit into her size 8 clothes over the next few months. She added: 'I feel really confident now. When you start to lose weight, everything feels better and my skin looks clearer too.' Now the mother has reached her target weight of 9st (57kg) on Christmas Eve she is aiming to drop another stone . The woman said: 'When I got to this size I felt like crying as I could now wear clothes that fit me properly again' The woman said her son is supportive of what she has done and loves the new dresses she wears with him . The mother-of-one added: 'I am aiming to reach a target of 7st (45kg) in the next few months so I can fit into my size eight clothes again. 'I know it might seem hard but when you get there, it will be worth all the hard work.' Now that she is feeling much better and has more energy, the mother says she would love to go on holiday for a week as part of her New Year's Resolution.
