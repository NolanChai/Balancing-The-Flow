I think the idea that a lot of people are looking for a way to lower their car bill isn't something we see in the news too much.  We see reports on high fuel prices and things like that but I don't really feel that people are out there actively trying to come up with new ways to save money on gas or even looking into what different sources of energy might mean for their car costs.
