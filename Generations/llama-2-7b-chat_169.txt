The search for Alice Gross, a 14-year-old schoolgirl who went missing last week, has been concentrated in the area around her home in East London, but police have now revealed that they are considering the possibility that she may have been abducted. Detectives are investigating a lead that a homeless man may have seen Alice being taken away by someone in a silver car. The man, who is known to be a frequent user of the area, told police that he saw a girl matching Alice's description being pushed into a car by a stranger last Thursday evening. The car is believed to be a silver Ford Focus with a cracked windscreen. Police are urging anyone who may have seen Alice or have any information about her disappearance to come forward.
