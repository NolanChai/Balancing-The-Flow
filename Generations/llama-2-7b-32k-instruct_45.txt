Soviet spies used bugs to listen in on conversations between members of the royal family, including Queen Elizabeth II and her daughter, Princess Margaret, according to a report by the Daily Mail Reporter published on December 12th . The article stated that Soviet agents had installed listening devices in Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, Sandringham House, and other royal residences.

The report also mentioned that former Prime Minister Harold Wilson was also targeted by Soviet spies through bugging devices. The article did not provide any further information about the nature of the bugs or how they were installed. However, it suggested that the KGB had been active in trying to gather intelligence on high-profile British politicians and royal figures for many years.

The report sparked controversy and was met with criticism from some quarters, including from members of the Royal Family themselves. Princess Margaret's husband, Lord Snowdon, said that he did not believe the report and accused the Daily Mail Reporter of being "utterly irresponsible." However, other newspapers such as the Guardian and the Times also reported on the story, and it was widely discussed in the media at the time.

It is worth noting that the use of bugging devices by Soviet spies against high-profile British figures was not a new revelation at the time. In fact, there had been earlier reports of Soviet spying activities in Britain, including bugging devices being planted in government buildings and diplomatic missions.

However, the Daily Mail Reporter report was seen as particularly sensationalist and controversial due to its focus on members of the royal family and the allegations that they were targets of KGB surveillance. The story also highlights the ongoing tensions between the Soviet Union and Western countries during the Cold War era, which included efforts by both sides to gather intelligence on each other's leaders and institutions.

In conclusion, the Daily Mail Reporter report in December 1985 sparked controversy with its claims that Soviet spies had bugged Buckingham Palace and other royal residences, as well as former Prime Minister Harold Wilson. While these claims were not new revelations at the time, they nevertheless generated significant media attention and highlighted the ongoing tensions between Western countries and the Soviet Union during the Cold War era.
