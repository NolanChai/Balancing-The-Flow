Max is sitting on the couch, watching TV with her friends. Suddenly, she starts acting strange – she becomes distant and withdrawn, and seems to be having trouble concentrating. Her friends notice this change and become concerned about her wellbeing. They decide to talk to Max in hopes of getting to the bottom of what’s going on with her. After some probing, Max reveals that she’s been experiencing strange dreams and nightmares, and feels like something is possessing her from within. Her friends encourage her to seek help, and promise to be there for her through whatever happens.

Max: I knew from the moment they showed me what happened to Will that this was going to happen. It’s a shame, but I always dreamed of being the mastermind behind my own Evil plot to take over Hawkins. Now, thanks to the Mind Flayer, I am living my dreams and soon everyone will feel my wrath.

Noah: Max, what are you talking about? You’re not like that at all. You wouldn’t hurt anyone.

Max: Oh, but I would Noah. I’m a monster now and monsters do whatever it takes to get what they want. With the power of the Mind Flayer, there is nothing I can’t do. My dream of becoming evil has finally come true and no one will be able to stop me.
