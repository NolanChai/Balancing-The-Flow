- August 26th is National Dog Day. This holiday is a special day set aside to celebrate our furry friends, dogs. Itâ€™s an opportunity for us to show our love and appreciation for all that they do for us. On National Dog Day, we can take time out of our busy schedules to spend some quality time with our pup, go for a walk or take them to the park, give them extra treats and lots of hugs and cuddles. National Dog Day is also a great day to help raise awareness about pet adoption and animal rescue groups that are working hard to find loving homes for all homeless animals in need.
