Alyx watched as the G-Man helped Gordon escape their cell. They were in the holding cells of City 17’s Citadel, and Alyx had been locked away with Gordon for days now. The pair had only met each other hours before when they’d first come to City 17, so it was hard for her to know what to make of him. He seemed kind enough, though a little bit standoffish at times. They’d bonded over the past few days despite their situation and now she would do anything she could to help him escape.

The guards who had brought them in were still in pursuit of Gordon as he ran down the hallways of the Citadel. She knew that she wouldn’t be able to keep up with him, but she also knew that she needed to stay close in case something went wrong. As they ran down the halls, Alyx couldn’t help but feel a sense of urgency and fear. They were trapped in City 17 and had nowhere to go. She clutched her rifle tightly as she followed Gordon, ready to fight if necessary.

After what felt like an eternity, they finally reached the outskirts of City 17 and saw their opportunity to escape. As Gordon turned to face the guards closing in on them, Alyx took aim and began shooting at the group of Metrocops. The gunfire attracted more attention from other guards nearby, but they managed to hold their own long enough for Gordon to make a run for it. As soon as he disappeared into the night, Alyx breathed a sigh of relief. She had managed to save her new friend and escape City 17 with him. Now, all she could do was hope that their journey would lead them to safety.
