[ANS]The first paragraph in an essay is called the introduction. An effective introduction includes three elements: It introduces the topic, indicates the focus of the essay, and establishes a context for the reader. The thesis statement is the last sentence in the introduction; it states your position on the topic and previews your main points. Transitional words and phrases connect sentences and link ideas within the body paragraphs.
