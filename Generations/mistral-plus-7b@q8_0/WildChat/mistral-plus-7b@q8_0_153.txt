No, not exactly. Exposure compensation works in the opposite way to what you have described. The +2 would actually increase the exposure by two stops over the recommended setting. This would result in the grey becoming a lighter shade of gray instead of white. However, if your camera supports bracketing then you could take 3 shots using bracketed exposure settings and merge them together to produce the desired effect of making the object appear white.
