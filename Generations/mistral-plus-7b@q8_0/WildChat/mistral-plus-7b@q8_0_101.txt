Iodimetry is a titrimetric method of quantitative analysis to determine the presence of halide ions (chlorides, bromides or iodides) by measuring their reaction with potassium iodate solution. Iodometry can be used to measure the presence of oxidizing agents such as permanganates and chlorine, because they react with iodide to produce iodine. The amount of oxidant (peroxides, hydrogen peroxide or oxygen) is determined by measuring the reaction with a known quantity of standardised potassium iodate solution in acidic medium.

## What Is Iodometry?

Iodometry is a chemical technique that uses iodine as an indicator or titrant to determine the presence and concentration of certain substances. It works on the principle of oxidation-reduction reactions between iodine and other chemicals such as iron, chromium, or hydrogen peroxide. By using this method, it is possible to accurately determine the amount of these substances in a solution.

Iodometry is often used for quantitative analysis of various compounds in different solutions. It allows for accurate measurement of the concentration of oxidizing agents such as chromium and iron by using standard solutions of sodium thiosulfate as a reducing agent. In addition to this, it also serves as an important tool for determining the amount of hydrogen peroxide present in a given solution through the use of potassium iodide solution.

- 0.3259 g potassium dichromate = (0.3259 g)(1 mol K2Cr2O7)/(294.2 g/mol K2Cr2O7) = 0.0011g/L of K2Cr2O7
- 67 mL reagent = 1.018 g potassium dichromate
- (1.018 g)(1 mol K2Cr2O7)/(294.2 g/mol K2Cr2O7) = 0.03465 molar K2Cr2O7
- I_{2} is produced by the reaction:
K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7} + 6Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3} + 14 H_{2}O → 2 Cr(OH)_{3}↓ + 6 Na_{2}SO_{4} + 8 NaI
- The molarity of sodium thiosulfate is (0.03465 mol K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7})/(6 mol Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}) = 5.779 mM Na_{2}S_{2}O_{3}
