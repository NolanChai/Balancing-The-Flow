[ANSWER]

Today, organizations are faced with the challenges of globalization and the need to maintain a competitive edge. As such, different management approaches have emerged to meet these challenges. Two management approaches that are considered more appropriate for todayâ€™s managers are agile management and lean management. Agile management emphasizes flexibility and adaptability in response to changing market conditions and customer needs. It focuses on cross-functional collaboration, continuous improvement, and a focus on value delivery. On the other hand, lean management seeks to reduce waste and improve efficiency by streamlining processes and reducing excess inventory. Both approaches have proven effective for managing modern organizations and ensuring their ongoing success.

## Contemporary Approaches to Teaching EFL: A Case Study of Two Turkish Public Secondary Schools in a Post-Coup Era

This study investigates the implications of the recent political developments, especially the 2016 July coup attempt, in Turkey on English language teaching. To this end, it compares the experiences of two public secondary schools that are known to employ different approaches to EFL. The purpose is to find out what teachers and students think about the current state of their EFL programmes and what changes they would like to see.

A case study approach has been employed in order to collect data from the selected schools using semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, field notes and class observations. The data were analyzed thematically and the results indicate that there is a lack of awareness about different approaches to EFL, especially at the administrative level, which leads to insufficient support for the teachers. In addition, both students and teachers are not very satisfied with their current programmes as they have very traditional classroom environments. Therefore, there is an urgent need for teacher training and professional development in order to equip them with the knowledge and skills necessary to teach English effectively and innovatively in this post-coup era.
