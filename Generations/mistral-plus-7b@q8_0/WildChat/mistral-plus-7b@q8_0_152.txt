the door opened to reveal a tall, dark-skinned man with a handsome face. He stared at Rose inquisitively, trying to figure out who she was. Rose stammered out that her name was Rose and that Karen had asked her to come over.

The man's expression changed from confusion to understanding, and he welcomed her into his home with a smile. He introduced himself as William's friend, James. He offered her some food, which she gladly accepted, feeling like a visitor at his table. As they sat down to eat, she noticed that James was more than just a subordinate to Joseph. They were close friends who cared for and supported each other. Rose felt a sense of comfort being around them, even though she knew that they had no idea of her true identity. She was grateful for the kindness and hospitality they showed her.
