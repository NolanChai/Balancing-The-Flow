I would like you to create image prompts for a generative AI called Midjourney. For each prompt, provide a description of the scene, environment, and mood in detail. Also include a style for the image (e.g. photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, artwork, paperwork, 3D, etc.) as well as an aspect ratio (ar) and visualization value (v).
                            Follow this prompt structure: "/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [ar] [v]".
                            For each concept, create 4 distinct prompts that vary in details description, environment, compositions, atmosphere, and realization. Use a realistic photographic style prompt with lens type and size for each concept. Separate different prompts with two new lines.
                            Here is an example of what an image prompt would look like:
                            /imagine prompt: Beautiful beach, sandy shoreline, turquoise water, bright sun, palm trees swaying in the breeze, people playing in the surf, children building sandcastles, a gentle ocean breeze, capturing the joy and relaxation of a beach day. --ar 16:9 --v 5
                            /imagine prompt: A cozy and warm autumn scene with colorful leaves on the ground, crunching underfoot, a group of people enjoying pumpkin spice lattes, brightly-colored scarves and jackets, crisp air, and a sense of excitement for fall. --ar 1:1 --v 5
