As a promising electrochemical technology for capturing and storing energy, electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) has attracted great attention due to its potential as an efficient alternative for the production of sustainable chemical fuels and fine chemicals from renewable electricity. However, the overall CO2 conversion efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) of these cascade CO2RR catalytic systems are greatly affected by the CO2 single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) and EE of the upstream CO2RR. While the CO2 SPCE and EE of CO2RR are highly related to the optimization of catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions.
