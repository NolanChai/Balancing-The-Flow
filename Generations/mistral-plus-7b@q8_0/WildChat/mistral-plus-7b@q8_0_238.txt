1. You say that you don't like to talk about your art. What is it that you prefer to avoid talking about?

I am a visual artist, I want people to feel what they feel when they look at my work. I believe that every viewer takes away from the work of art something very personal and unique. Therefore I have a fear of influencing someone's personal interpretation. So, for this reason it is best to keep my mouth shut.

2. Where do you find inspiration?

I draw inspiration from everything around me, especially from life, emotions, feelings, people, memories, dreams, my own experience. Everything I see, feel, think about influences my work.

3. Can you tell us how your painting technique has changed throughout the years?

My technique of painting has not changed over time, but what has evolved is my style and content of my paintings. My technique consists in using several layers of acrylic paint and then glazing them with oil paints to give texture and luminosity to the work.

4. What do you want people to feel when they look at your art?

I want the viewers to experience all sorts of emotions, from deep empathy to joy, as well as curiosity and amazement.

5. What is the message behind your art?

The main idea in my work is that of transformation. I am interested in exploring the idea of identity and the changes that occur during our lifetime. In addition, the fact that we are all made of stardust has been a great source of inspiration for me to express this theme.
