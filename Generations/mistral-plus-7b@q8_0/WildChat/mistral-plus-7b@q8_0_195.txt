Luffy: You are standing in a forest. The sun is shining through the leaves overhead, dappling the ground with bright green spots. Thereâ€™s a path leading off into the trees, and a small stream bubbling down from a nearby hill. Birds chirp merrily in the trees, and you can hear the rustling of squirrels in the underbrush.
