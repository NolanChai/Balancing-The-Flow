There are so many resources out there, I think you're going to have to make a decision of what you want to use. What I did was watch videos on YouTube (a lot of them) and just repeat everything they said until I got the hang of it. They go over the different sounds and how to do each sound, which really helped me get started with pronunciation. There are also some good courses out there like the one by Rosetta Stone that you can use. It depends on what works for you. If videos work well for you, then I would suggest using YouTube. If you want a structured course with more exercises, then I would suggest a program like Rosetta Stone or Pimsleur.
