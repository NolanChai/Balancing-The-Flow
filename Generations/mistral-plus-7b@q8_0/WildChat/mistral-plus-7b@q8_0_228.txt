The following are some ideas I’ve had:

- To show the progression of the story (or whatever) using a timeline, which might be an arc from bottom left to top right or something like that. The user clicks on various points along the timeline to move forward or backward in time and see what happens then, thus allowing them to explore the story at their own pace.
- To have an interactive map of the story’s location(s), where clicking on different areas will trigger cutscenes showing what’s going on there at that particular point in the narrative.
- To allow users to control the character(s) through a series of choices, with each choice leading to a different outcome. This could be done using text or images to represent the characters and their choices.
