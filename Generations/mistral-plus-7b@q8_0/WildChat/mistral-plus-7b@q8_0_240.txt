Hi there! Shine On is a collection of customized jewelry. Our jewelry is made from scratch in our studio and then sent out to the customer. All of our pieces are 100% handmade and are designed to be personalized. For example, our name necklaces are cut, bent, hammered, polished, and assembled by hand.

As for being a good business, we've had some really amazing experiences with this collection so far. I love getting emails from people telling me that they're wearing their necklace to their prom or that they can't believe how much their husband loves his cufflinks. It definitely makes us feel proud of what we do and excited to keep growing Shine On!

Hi @Jessica_C,

Here are some suggestions for your online jewelry business:

- Jewelry Bling
- Elegant Jewels
- Dazzling Gems
- Shimmering Rings
- Precious Jewelry

For a logo, you could use a design that incorporates sparkly jewels and perhaps a crown. The colors you might want to use include gold, silver, and maybe even some diamonds. You could also include your brand name in a bold font that matches the style of the design.

I used to use it for a while, and I always thought of it as a pretty good tool. The reason I stopped using it was because there are better programs out there now that can do the same thing (such as JP2JPG), which makes it pointless to have this program installed. However, I did like ACE Jewels back when I used it and it worked quite well. I would suggest giving it a shot if you're in need of an image viewer for your PlayStation games.

Hello,

I’m new to Cavana, so I was wondering how long it would take to become a skilled Cavana Trader.

Hi @Peter! If you dedicate yourself to Cavana training and apply the lessons taught by our team, you can expect to master Cavana in about 3 months, provided you spend at least 1 hour per day learning and practicing.

I’ve got a confession to make…I haven’t done a single craft with my kids since the summer. I know! That’s really not like me. I’m a huge fan of arts and crafts for kids and have been trying to do some form of creative activity with my daughter each day we’re at home together. But between all the cleaning, cooking, and other fun parental tasks, I just haven’t had time to plan any crafts for her. So when Canva reached out with a collaboration idea, I was like…YES! I need some inspiration right now.

For those of you who don’t know what Canva is, it’s an amazing online design tool that lets you create beautiful graphics and other types of visual content. It’s incredibly user-friendly and perfect for beginners. You can use Canva to create flyers, business cards, posters, social media graphics, etc. It has a huge library of templates and icons that make it super easy to get started.

For this collaboration, I decided to create some fun crafts for kids with Canva. My daughter is really into arts and crafts so I knew she would love them. We made paper plate butterflies, popsicle stick art, and even a paper plate flower crown. All of the crafts were easy to follow along with and turned out great!

If you’re looking for some easy and fun crafts for kids, check out Canva. They have tons of tutorials and templates that make it super simple to create beautiful projects with your little ones.
