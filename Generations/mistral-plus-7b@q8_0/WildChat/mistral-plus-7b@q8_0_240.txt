(Vanessa: Oh... my poor sister... She had so many babies... And now she’s gone. I feel so lonely without her...)

(Araneas: Yes, it’s a sad day for us all. But we must do what we can to ensure that these little ones grow up properly... It would be a shame if they were to turn out evil like their father. Now come over here and help me take care of the newborns...)

(Vanessa: Yes, I suppose you’re right. We should do our best to raise them in the best possible way so that they become good spiders who will always follow the path of justice. Let us do our best for these children...)

It was the sound of footsteps that woke her up. They were too heavy for Vanessa to be able to ignore them, so she forced herself to open her eyes. She couldn't help but gasp as she saw the large figure standing over her. It took a moment, but then she realized that it was her father.

He looked down at her with a frown on his face, "Vanessa, what happened? You haven't left your room in days."

She felt herself start to cry as soon as he asked the question, "I'm sorry. I don't know why I did it. It was just...it all got to be too much. Everything seemed so hopeless."

Her father sighed and sat down on her bed, "I know things have been tough for you lately. But you can't give up on life. There are still so many reasons to keep going."

Vanessa couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope as he spoke those words to her. She felt like maybe there was something worth fighting for after all. And that gave her the strength to get out of bed and start taking steps towards a brighter future once again.
