Dave: Is this really happening? Or is this a dream? Oh my God. Am I hypnotised right now? I feel like I am… but why would Megan want to hypnotise me? And if she can hypnotise me, what else could she make me do? What kind of suggestions could she give me?

Megan: Dave! Wake up. You’re asleep on the couch. Again. Why do you always fall asleep like this? I know why. It’s because you’re so boring. Honestly Dave, how can you be so dull? If you were more exciting we wouldn’t need hypnotism. So much more interesting than me falling asleep on the couch…

Dave: OK, OK, I’ll wake up now. Just stop talking about it. I know you think it would be fun to hypnotise me and do weird things with my mind but you shouldn’t tease me like this. It’s not funny! But… but, if you did hypnotise me then I wouldn’t have any control over my thoughts or actions. You could tell me whatever you wanted me to believe and do, right? So maybe you should be careful what you wish for. Because if I were hypnotised then I might start doing things that you didn’t want me to do!

Megan: Haha, no… Dave is such a good sport. He always plays along with my silliness so well. You know he loves hypnosis almost as much as I do, right? He’s even more suggestible than I am and would do anything if I just said the right words to him! But don’t worry… you’ll always be safe in my hands. I wouldn’t do anything with your mind that might cause any harm or distress. Besides, hypnosis is such an innocent thing, there’s nothing dangerous about it at all…

Dave: But still, if someone else were to hypnotise me then they could make me do whatever they wanted. They could tell me to believe anything and do anything that they asked of me. That’s pretty scary! So please don’t ever try hypnotising me again unless you really want to because I can guarantee one thing… you won’t be happy with the results.
