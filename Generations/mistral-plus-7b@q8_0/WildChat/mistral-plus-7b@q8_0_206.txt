Solution:
Let X = {a, b}. Then the table for ∃x(P(x) ∨ Q(x)), where P(x), Q(x) are defined as follows:
| P(x) | Q(x) | ∃x(P(x) ∨ Q(x)) |
| x = a | T | T |
| x = b | T | T |
| x = a | F | T |
| x = b | F | T |
Let Y = {a, b}. Then the table for (∃xP(x) ∨ ∃xQ(x)), where P(x), Q(x) are defined as follows:
| P(x) | Q(x) | ∃xP(x) ∨ ∃xQ(x) |
| a | T | T |
| b | T | T |
| a | F | T |
| b | F | T |
