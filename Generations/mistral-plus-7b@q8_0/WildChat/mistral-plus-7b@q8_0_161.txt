Yes, if you take HGH for two months straight followed by one month off, then two months on again, it will work in exactly the same way. The benefits won't change and neither will the side effects. It is important to remember that any breaks from HGH should be taken under medical supervision because there can be unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking this powerful drug.
