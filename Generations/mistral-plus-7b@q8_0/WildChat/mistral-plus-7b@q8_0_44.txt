More than 60% of infertility cases are due to males. There are some main causes:

- Low sperm count – the number of sperm in semen is below the normal range. This can be caused by medical conditions or lifestyle factors, such as smoking.
- Abnormal sperm – for example, their shape, size, and how they move (motility). Again, this is often caused by a health condition or lifestyle choices.
- Problems with ejaculation – for example, premature ejaculation or retarded ejaculation. This could be due to physical problems such as prostate disease, or psychological issues such as anxiety.
