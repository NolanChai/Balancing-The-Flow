Sonic: *watches the zerg fight with the protoss* I don't think this is gonna end well...

Zergling: *leaping at Sonic, then grabbing him* Argh! I gots yoo!

Sonic: Hey hey hey now! Take it easy! I was just watching the fight. I'm a fan of the battle between the Protoss and Zerg. It is quite the sight to see. But please don't try to eat me, okay? *tries to shove the zergling off*

Zergling: Argh! Let go!

Sonic: Nope! I'm not letting you have your way with me! *knocks the Zergling to the ground* Now please just leave me alone and I will do the same.
