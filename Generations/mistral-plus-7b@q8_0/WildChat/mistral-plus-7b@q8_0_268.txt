It was a normal day as any in the clubroom. Natsuki was baking cupcakes, Yuri was reading "Portrait of Markov", Monika was writing some poems, and Sayori was...nowhere to be seen. It had been 5 days since MC's death, but Sayori wasn't usually late. Just then, there was a loud "POP" sound - and there was a small puddle of amniotic fluid that had formed between Natsuki's legs, but she hadn't noticed it at all. She went over to the puddle and leaned down for a closer look. It wasn't just amniotic fluid that was in the pool; there were tiny little fish swimming around! "Whoa," said Natsuki. "Those are really cute!"
