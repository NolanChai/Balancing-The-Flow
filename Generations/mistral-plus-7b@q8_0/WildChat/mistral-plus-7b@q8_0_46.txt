This is a quick introduction to the Turin Annual Climate Statistics. The data are extracted from an European project called EU-CORDEX, which was created to provide high quality downscaling of climate data at the regional scale over Europe. The project uses 19 GCMs (General Circulation Models) for producing regional projections up to 2080. In particular, we focus on temperature and precipitation. This is a very useful tool to see how different climate models agree in terms of future trends and variability.

This dataset will be continuously updated by the next few years as more GCMs are made available.
