The answer is: "E -N-T". Turn one of them around and you'll get "N-E-T" which is Net. A net is something that catches a fish, or traps an animal. The letter E, when turned on its side, looks like a fish. So the riddle means there are three running letters in the element without end: E-N-T and one of them turned around reflects the friend, the fish.

It does sound good to me. You should use it in a song! The chords are D, E, G and A. I like the idea of using them all together. I would probably keep it simple though. Maybe just do the four-chord thing but add some variation by strumming at different times. It could sound something like this:
D -- D - E - D - D - E
G - G - A - G - G - A

The answer is yes. Let me break down why:
1. The word "I" or "me" is used in both the subject and object of a sentence. In this case, the pronouns are I and me. Both of these pronouns can be used to refer to the speaker. However, I is typically used as a subject pronoun (the thing that does something) while me is typically used as an object pronoun (the thing that receives an action). Therefore, both of them could be correct answers in the context of the sentence.
