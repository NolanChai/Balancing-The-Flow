The surgical removal of pre-auricular pits, called sinus surgery is performed in cases where there is a pre-auricular pit or sinus. These are small holes that can be found on the outside of the ear and are usually congenital defects. The procedure for removing these small holes or sinuses is fairly simple and typically does not require an overnight hospital stay.

During the surgery, the surgeon will make a small incision near the pre-auricular pit. Using specialized instruments, he/she will then carefully remove any excess tissue or skin that has grown within the pit. In most cases, this procedure takes no longer than 30 minutes to perform and is done under local anesthesia. The patient should be able to go home shortly after surgery.

After sinus surgery, patients usually experience very little pain and discomfort. Most people can resume their normal activities within one week of the procedure. Some patients may have some bruising around the incision site for a few days.

2. Remove the air filter cover (or filter housing) from the air cleaner duct by removing the retaining screws, clips or catches. Depending on the vehicle type there may be an upper and a lower section to the cover.
3. Remove the old air filter from the air cleaner box or cartridge. Inspect it for damage, dirt, oil and wear. Dispose of the old air filter according to your local environmental laws.
