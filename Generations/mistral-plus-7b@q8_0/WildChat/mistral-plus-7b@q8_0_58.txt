Iodimetry is a type of titrimetric analysis based on the reduction of an oxidizing agent with potassium iodide (KI). Iodometry uses the reaction between potassium permanganate (KMnO4) and KI. The KI reacts with the KMnO4 to form triiodide (I3âˆ’), which is a very strong oxidizing agent. The triiodide then reacts with excess KI to produce iodine (I2). The amount of I2 produced can be determined by titrating it against standard potassium permanganate solution. Potassium permanganate is used as an oxidant in various chemical reactions, including the oxidation of organic compounds and the reduction of metals. It is also used as a disinfectant and preservative.

#### Solution

Potassium dichromate is a powerful oxidizing agent in acidic solution. It reacts with sodium thiosulfate to produce potassium sulfate and chromium (III) ion.
