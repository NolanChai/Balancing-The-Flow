Sakura had never been more terrified in her life. She was stuck on a small raft with only one other person, who she had no idea of what to do. All she could remember was the last thing Sasuke had said before they got hit by the wave. The world around them went black and everything was still for a few moments until it came back into focus. She looked at Naruto laying on the raft beside her and instantly felt guilty. Naruto is in a worse state than she is. He doesn’t know what’s going on and he has no idea where they are. The only thing that kept her going was the thought of Sasuke being out there somewhere, possibly injured or in need of help. She needed to find him and make sure he was alright before doing anything else.

Sakura pulled herself up off the raft with a lot more effort than she expected. As soon as she stood up, she almost stumbled over her own two feet before managing to steady herself. The whole situation is just so surreal right now. It feels like everything around us has been frozen in time while we slowly sink into the ocean. She looked out at the horizon and saw nothing but open water stretching as far as the eye could see. There was no land or any sign of civilization anywhere nearby, just an endless expanse of blue. Sakura took a deep breath and tried to calm down before taking another look around. The raft they were on seemed fairly sturdy but there wasn’t much else out here other than their small lifeboat. She hoped that whatever caused this would pass quickly so they could go home safely back into Port Town again, but for now she just had to focus on getting through this one day at a time with Naruto by her side until help arrived somehow.
