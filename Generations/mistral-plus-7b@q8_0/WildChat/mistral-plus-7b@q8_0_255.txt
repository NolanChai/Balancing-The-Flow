It was a very cloudy day in Ireland and we had about 8 hours to do our driving tour of the Ring of Kerry. It was pouring rain and we didn’t have rain coats with us so we were pretty cold for most of it. Our plan was to start in Killarney, head to Gap of Dunloe, then Molls Gap, Ross Castle, Ladies View, Torc Waterfall, Sneem, Kenmare, Muckross House and Gardens, Skellig Islands, Stone Forts at Cameronsiveen and finally Killarney. It was definitely a lot to take on in 8 hours but we did it! If I had the time to do it over again, I would spend more time at each stop so I could explore a bit more instead of rushing through it all. I still enjoyed the experience and wouldn’t have done it any differently.

Gap of Dunloe is definitely my favorite part of the Ring of Kerry. It has beautiful views of the mountains and the lakes are amazing. You can also take boats across them if you wish. Next, we went through Molls Gap which was beautiful as well. We saw some ponies and sheep along the way and I just couldn’t get over how green everything was. There were so many cute little villages and shops along the Ring of Kerry and it was fun to drive through them all and see what they had to offer. One of my favorite places we stopped at was Torc Waterfall, it was absolutely breathtaking. The waterfall is fairly large and it’s surrounded by beautiful green forest. After that, we went to Ross Castle where there were gorgeous views of the lake. Lastly, we went to Kenmare where we walked through town a bit and had some lunch at a cute little cafe. It was definitely a memorable experience and I would highly recommend doing the Ring of Kerry if you ever find yourself in County Kerry!
