In the Greek papyri from Egypt, Hermanubis appears as both a proper name and an epithet. The god’s personal name is attested in four documents of the first century CE (PSI 289, P.Oxy. XXII 2304, P.Lond. VII 1756 and P.Col. Inv. 256) and an amulet of uncertain date (British Museum 494). The god’s name is written with the usual Egyptian demotic script in hieroglyphs or in Greek transliteration using a combination of letters from the Greek alphabet (as well as one ligature), either as it was pronounced in ancient Egypt, or more rarely following the Greek phonology. A fifth document, P.Lond. VII 1756, contains the name Hermes-Anubis, which is perhaps to be read as an epithet of Hermanubis rather than a personal name.
