a podcast is an audio or video file which is distributed over the internet using syndication feeds for playback on mobile devices and personal computers. A podcast is made available for download via web syndication or streamed online to the listener. The term “podcast” was created by combining the words “iPod” (an Apple consumer electronic product) and “broadcasting”. Podcasts are often created by radio stations, TV networks, and individual bloggers.
