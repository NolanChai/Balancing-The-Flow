Monika: “What’s wrong with Sayori? She hasn’t been the same since MC’s funeral…”

Yuri: “I know. She seems so sad and distant. I think she’s still grieving for her friend.”

Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s understandable. The two of them were close. I remember MC always talking about her with such fondness. I hope Sayori can find a way to cope with this loss.”

Himari: “I know exactly what she’s going through. When my father passed away, I was devastated. It took me a long time to recover from his loss, but eventually, I found the strength and courage to carry on without him. Sayori will get through this too.”

Kohana: “I know it hurts right now, but Sayori is a strong person. She’ll learn to cope with her grief in her own time. Just be there for her and support her as best you can.”
