## What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence is a rapidly growing field of computer science that is focused on creating intelligent machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. Artificial intelligence can include many different techniques, including machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and expert systems. These technologies have the potential to revolutionize many different industries and are already being used in a wide variety of applications, from self-driving cars to voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.

There are a few ways to get around and I recommend you try a few different ones to see which works best for you.

- Running – Sprinting is your fastest form of travel. Use this for short distances when you need to cover ground fast. Hold the left mouse button to run, or press the shift key to sprint. The stamina bar will deplete as you use sprint. Keep in mind that if you get knocked down while running, you will fall significantly farther than you normally would.
- Mounts – You can tame and ride mounts for faster travel. You can only mount one creature at a time (although your companions can mount other creatures), so choose your mount wisely. Right click on the mount icon in your quickbar to mount, or press the ‘m’ key. Use this when you are going on long trips across large areas of the game world. The stamina bar will deplete as you use a mounted animal.
- Vehicles – You can drive a variety of vehicles from horse-drawn carts to airships. Right click on the vehicle icon in your quickbar to enter a vehicle, or press the ‘v’ key. Use this for long distance travel, or to get through areas quickly where running and mounting would take too long. The stamina bar will deplete as you use vehicles.
