This question has popped up again in a forum I’m on, and as we all know, there are two correct answers here:
affected means that something happened to you. For example, you could be affected by a disease or affected by a change.
effected means that you have an effect on something. For example, the new policy was effected in August of this year.
I don’t see how any native speaker can confuse the two; I think it must come down to people trying too hard to sound smart.
