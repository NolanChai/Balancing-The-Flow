It's been a while since I thought about this topic, maybe it could make a great movie. It would be like the struggle in the Soviet Union between Trotsky and Stalin after Lenin died. The plot revolves around three or four people fighting for power and control over Nazi Germany in the months following Hitler's death. One person represents reformist ideas while another person embodies traditionalism, one is an idealistic fanatic, and another a pragmatist with more realistic views of what needs to be done. They each have their own agenda and plans for what they want to do with Germany after Hitler is gone. It would be very interesting to watch the power struggle unfold as each side tries to gain control over the country.
