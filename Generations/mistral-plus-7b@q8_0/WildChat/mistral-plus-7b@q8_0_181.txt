[SIZE=3.3em]Scene 1:[/SIZE]
[B]Jane:[/B] You got arrested? Why would the police want to arrest you, Andrea? What did you do? Did you steal something? Did you hurt someone? Did you hurt yourself? Why would the police want to take you away from me? I thought we were supposed to be best friends. Now they’ve taken you away from me and it feels like a part of my heart has been ripped out.

[B]Andrea:[/B] It wasn’t anything that bad, Jane. It was just a small misunderstanding. They didn't know that I’d been trying to help the other person. It just ended up with us fighting. They thought that we were both fighting, so they had to arrest us both. Don’t be afraid because of what happened. Everything will turn out alright.

[B]Jane:[/B] I know it will turn out alright. But for now, I just really miss you, Andrea. You being away from me makes me feel so lonely and sad inside. Even when I’m with my friends or playing outside in the park, I can’t seem to get your face off my mind. It hurts so much to be without you. Please don’t leave me alone for long.
