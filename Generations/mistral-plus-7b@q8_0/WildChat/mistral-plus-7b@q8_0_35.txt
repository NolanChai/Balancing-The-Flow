Hi Walid,

I would be available on any day this week for our call. Please pick a day and time that is convenient for you. I am also available Saturday or Sunday mornings Irish time if that suits your schedule better. Let me know what works best.

Best,

Hi Neil,

Thank you for your reply. Sorry for the short notice of the meeting. It was an emergency meeting for our project manager and I had no time to send an invitation prior to the call. As we are still in the process of making changes to our project plan, it would be useful to discuss with you what you think about the changes that we are currently considering. Please find the details below:

- The current draft for the project is based on the following assumptions:
    - 16 weeks to complete the project.
    - An initial training of 2 days prior to starting the project.
- We are considering reducing the total duration of the project from 16 weeks down to 8 weeks. This would be a major change in the project plan and we need your opinion on it.
- We are also considering removing the training session that is planned before the start of the project. As you know this is an agile project, so most of the knowledge transfer would be done during the first iteration. By doing so we could save 2 weeks from the initial plan and reduce the total project duration down to 6 weeks.
- Another option would be to move the training session to the end of the project instead of before the start of it. This would allow us to have an official kick off meeting with you at the beginning of the first iteration and then start working immediately on the backlog items. At the end of the project, we could also have a final review session to see what went well during the project and what went wrong and how we can improve our process in future projects.

Please let us know what you think about these options and if you would prefer any other changes to the project plan. We are open to any suggestions that you may have.

Hello,

I am trying to correct the above sentence using Instant Translator but it keeps returning the same incorrect result. I would like to know if you could help me correct this sentence so it sounds more professional and grammatically correct.

Hi,
I've been looking at the code of your project. I'm interested in contributing. However, before doing that I want to be sure that there are no major problems with my code style. I think I understand most of the project, but it would still require quite some work before it is ready for production. There are a lot of things to improve. For example:

- There should be better support for multiple repositories (e.g. the user could choose to use git, svn or even hg).
- It should be possible to customize the notification system (e.g. when an email is sent and the subject of the mail). The notifications should also support markup languages like Markdown.
- There should be a way to automatically merge files, using external diff tools if necessary. For example, if the user wants to include changes from one repository into another repository.
- Currently, the program uses a lot of global variables and static methods/properties. This is not considered good practice in most cases. In fact, I think that almost all of these instances could be replaced with local variables and methods.
- There should probably be some more unit tests (although the existing tests are very thorough).
