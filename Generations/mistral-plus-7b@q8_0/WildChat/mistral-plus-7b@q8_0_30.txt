## Overview

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University’s football team, more commonly known as the Virginia Tech Hokies, had a great year in 2007. The team won eleven games with one loss, which included beating #3 Boston College and #12 Wake Forest. They also won their conference for the first time since 2004. Their only loss of the season was to Virginia Cavaliers. Despite this loss, they were able to secure a berth in the Orange Bowl, where they faced off against the Kansas Jayhawks. Unfortunately, the Hokies lost that game 17-24.

The team was led by quarterback Sean Glennon and running back Brandon Ore. Both players had outstanding seasons and contributed to their success. They also had a strong defense that held their opponents to only 15 points per game. The defense was led by linebacker Xavier Adibi, who was named the conference’s defensive player of the year.

Despite losing in the Orange Bowl, the Hokies still enjoyed one of their most successful seasons ever. They won eleven games and secured a spot in one of the nation’s top bowl games. Their performance also earned them recognition as one of college football’s best teams.
