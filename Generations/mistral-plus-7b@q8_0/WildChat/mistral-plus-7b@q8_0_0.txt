Qualification to work in Quality Assurance (QA) is not a legal requirement, but employers typically prefer people with either a bachelor’s degree or a master’s degree. Common undergraduate degrees include those in computer science, information technology, and engineering. A master’s degree can provide more specialized knowledge of QA and software testing. Employers usually look for candidates who have an understanding of project management, software design, and risk assessment. Many companies also require QA engineers to be certified testers.
