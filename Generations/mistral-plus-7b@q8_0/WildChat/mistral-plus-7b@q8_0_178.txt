3. Check if the user shot a sinking ship.
4. User win or lose
5. Allow two players to play against each other.

[CODE]let's make a flutter app for a online battleship  game [/CODE]

I have completed 1,2 and most of 3. I need help on implementing 4 and 5. Any help will be appreciated.

The first thing you need to do is download the free 30 day trial version of Vuze, a BitTorrent client. This will allow you to watch the movies in .torrent format without having to pay anything at all. If you want to keep watching movies after that period of time though then you'll have to buy some software like BitComet or uTorrent which can be purchased online from their respective websites for a reasonable price (usually around $15).

Next, once downloaded onto your computer open up the Vuze application and click on "Add Torrent". Here enter in either an exact name of your desired movie file OR just type "movies" into this box if you're not sure what title it is called. After that hit OK and then wait for your computer to start downloading! Depending on how fast your internet connection is this could take anywhere between 10 minutes up until several hours depending upon file size etc...
