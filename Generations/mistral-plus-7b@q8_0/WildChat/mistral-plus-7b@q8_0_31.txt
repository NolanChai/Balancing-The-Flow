Quantum computing is an emerging field of computer science that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to create new types of computation. Quantum computers are capable of processing information using the behavior and properties of individual atoms, molecules, and subatomic particles, leading to potentially faster and more efficient computational power than traditional classical computing.

Quantum computers work by exploiting the unique characteristics of quantum mechanics such as superposition and entanglement. Unlike classical bits which can only represent either a 1 or a 0, quantum bits (known as qubits) can exist in a state of both 1 and 0 simultaneously, allowing them to perform calculations that are not possible with conventional computers. Quantum computing also exploits the phenomenon of entanglement, where particles become connected in a way that defies classical physics, enabling new types of computation such as quantum parallelism.
