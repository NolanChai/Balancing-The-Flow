[OUT]The girl sits down on the couch in her tiny apartment, pondering for a moment as she takes a swig of her bottle of vodka. “Gosh, I’m soooo wasted,” she says to her roommate, who is lying on the floor nearby. The other girl, who has also been drinking, just shrugs and laughs.

The first girl takes another sip from her drink and then continues, slurring her words slightly. “I guess it’s a good thing that I had such a great time tonight,” she says to her friend. “All those shots we did definitely made the night more fun!” The other girl nods in agreement, smirking as she takes another swig from her own bottle of vodka.

The two girls sit there chatting for a while longer, both still slightly tipsy but having a great time together. They laugh and joke about all sorts of things, from silly stories to inside jokes they share with each other. Eventually the night draws to an end and it’s time for them to head home. As they get ready to leave their apartment, they hug one another tightly before saying goodbye until next time.
