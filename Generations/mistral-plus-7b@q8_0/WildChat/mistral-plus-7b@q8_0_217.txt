I am so sorry for the delay, this was a lot harder to make than I originally thought it would be.

First of all, there will probably be no more Freedom Planet x Shovel Knight crossover videos because I will need to put in way too much effort into making them and it takes forever and is not worth it at all. It's really hard to find good clips from both games that line up well with each other, especially with the differences between the two combat systems.

The biggest problem I had was the lack of variety in Shovel Knight's moveset. He doesn't have many different attacks compared to Lilac and this made it hard to find suitable clips from both games that would match up nicely. In addition, since the two characters play very differently, their fighting styles don't always mesh well together and there were times when I had to completely redo sections because they just didn't feel right.

Overall, this project was a lot more difficult than expected but I am glad I got through it in the end. If you like these kinds of crossovers then please keep an eye out for future ones as I will likely be making more in the future!
