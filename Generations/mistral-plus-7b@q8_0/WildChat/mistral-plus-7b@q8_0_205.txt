## How the Sun Influences Earth's Atmosphere and Magnetosphere: Overview

The sun is an important source of energy for our planet. It provides light, heat, and also drives Earth’s weather patterns. In addition to this, it has a direct impact on our atmosphere by producing solar winds and magnetic storms. The sun can be thought of as the life-force for our planet – without it we would not be able to survive!

Solar wind is a stream of charged particles emanating from the Sun. It carries away energy and matter into space at high speeds, about 500 kilometers per second. These energetic protons and electrons interact with Earth’s magnetosphere – an area around our planet that contains its magnetic field – creating beautiful auroras in the polar regions known as Northern Lights or Southern Lights depending on their location. The solar wind also affects radio waves, satellites, power grids, GPS systems and other technologies we depend upon today.
