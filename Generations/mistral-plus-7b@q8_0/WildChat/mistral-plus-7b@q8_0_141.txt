The six key financial projections for a startup include:
1. Income Statement – Also known as a profit and loss statement, an income statement shows revenue, expenses, and net income for a given period of time.
2. Balance Sheet – A balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time.
3. Cash Flow Statement – A cash flow statement shows how much cash is coming in and going out of the business over a certain period of time.
4. Break-Even Analysis – A break-even analysis calculates the sales volume that a company needs to achieve to cover all of its expenses. It can be used to help make decisions about pricing or expanding operations.
5. Capital Budgeting – Capital budgeting involves evaluating and selecting potential investments based on their projected return. This is an important tool for startups as they consider how to allocate limited resources.
6. Financial Modeling – Financial modeling involves building a detailed representation of a company’s financial performance using assumptions about future revenue, expenses, and cash flows. It can be used to help make decisions about investments, pricing, or other strategic initiatives.
