The four boys sat in a circle around a campfire. They had just finished eating s’mores and were now enjoying the warmth of the fire. Leonardo broke the silence first.

“So guys,” he began, “it was pretty dangerous out there tonight.” He turned to Mikey. “You really put yourself in harm’s way back there at that abandoned building. I’m glad you made it out okay.”

Mikey nodded in agreement and said, “Yeah, I know I took a big risk, but it was worth it. We managed to capture the bad guys and save the day.”

Leonardo nodded in appreciation. “You did great. You always do. And you can’t put yourself in danger like that without making sure you’re prepared for it.” He turned to Raphael. “Raph, what would you say is the most important part of being prepared?”

Raphael thought for a moment before answering. “The most important part of being prepared is having the right equipment,” he replied. “That includes weapons, gear, first aid supplies, and whatever else you might need to protect yourself or help someone else in an emergency.”
