### Membership Plan

With our membership plans you can enjoy your favorite content without interruption. You can watch movies and TV series from your mobile device or computer uninterrupted. For this purpose, we have two different payment methods; monthly payments and annual payments. If you pay on a monthly basis, you can use the content for one month at a time. However, if you purchase our annual subscription plan, your membership will be valid for 12 months.

Thank you so much for your reply! I just wanted to clarify that it's not a one time fee of $29. It actually costs $359/year in order to keep your license active. That's what threw me off because there was no mention of that anywhere on the site.
I understand why you didn't want to do that though, because if people knew they would be paying $359/year then most would probably not sign up for the trial. Which is totally understandable. Just wanted to confirm this with someone who worked for the company in case I had misunderstood or missed something somewhere. Thank you again!
