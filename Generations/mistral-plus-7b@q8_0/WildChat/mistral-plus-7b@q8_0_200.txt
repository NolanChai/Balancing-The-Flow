The following is a list of common Treasury Option Trading Strategies with their pattern names and descriptions. Each strategy has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it’s important to understand how they work before you invest in them.

- Covered Call – An option where the writer (seller) sells a call option and simultaneously owns the underlying stock or bond. The writer receives the premium paid for the option but risks losing money if the price of the underlying asset rises above the strike price of the call option.
- Put Spread – A strategy that involves buying one put option at a higher strike price and selling another put option at a lower strike price to generate income. This can help reduce risk by reducing your exposure to large price moves in either direction.
