After the first few episodes of season four, it was clear that Max Mayfield would be an important character this year. Not only has she developed an extremely strong connection to Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), but she also found herself in a dark place after her boyfriend, Jason Carver (Mason Dye), died.

However, the events of Episode 8 saw Max begin to show signs that something was wrong. As she sat on the couch at home with her friends, Max started to lose control of her body. She then got up and walked out of the room before disappearing from the house. This caused a great deal of confusion among her peers, who were left wondering what had happened to their friend.

While this scene may seem like a small detail in an otherwise action-packed episode, it actually hints at something much more sinister brewing behind the scenes. It could be that Max was possessed by The Mind Flayer (or another entity) and is now under its control. This would explain why she suddenly left without warning and also provides us with a clue as to what may happen next in Stranger Things 4. If this theory turns out to be correct, it means that Max will play a crucial role in helping the other characters save Hawkins from The Mind Flayer once again.

The only way I could see her wanting to be evil would be if she had some sort of trauma. Like something bad happened in her childhood and she blamed herself. Maybe her father died at a young age and she felt like it was all her fault. Or maybe her parents didn’t love her enough and that’s why she wanted to do evil things, so that they would love her more and pay attention to her. I think that could be the cause of Max wanting to be evil. She had some sort of trauma in her childhood and blamed herself for it, so now she wants revenge on everyone by doing bad things.
