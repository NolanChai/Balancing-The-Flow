I was watching Talia Mar, this British pop star, do some of the internet’s most viral challenges. One of them being “try not to laugh” while trying to hold a cup full of water. It looked so simple and straightforward, but I guess the challenge was more difficult than it seemed. She was trying so hard to hold back her laughter that she ended up spilling some of the water all over herself. That’s when it happened. As she was laughing and wiping up the water, she let out an audible fart that made everyone in the room laugh even harder. I couldn’t believe what had just happened! It was hilarious, especially because Talia seemed so embarrassed by it. She just covered her face with her hands and laughed even harder than before. She truly is such a funny, sweet girl who never takes herself too seriously.
