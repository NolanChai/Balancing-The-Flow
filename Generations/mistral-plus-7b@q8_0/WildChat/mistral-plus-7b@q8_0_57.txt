According to the sutras, Sakyamuni rejected religions. The following is some of his words: “All kinds of religious people, with their different types of faiths, all are like ghosts and spirits.” “Religion is only for those who lack wisdom.” “Religious people cannot escape from birth and death because they still cling to attachment and craving.”

However, he accepted the monks as disciples. Doesn’t this mean that he acknowledged the religions? If Buddhism is not a religion, then why did he create such a religious organization of monks who lived on alms and wore yellow robes?

Actually Sakyamuni did reject early religions like Brahmanism which worshiped many gods. But it didn’t mean that he rejected the concept of God. He did believe in a divine power or creator. The reason why he rejected other religions was because they all relied on superstition, blind faith, and ritual offerings to satisfy their gods. They were all based on delusion and attachment.

The teachings of Sakyamuni are actually the true religion that all religions should follow. True religion is not about following blind faith or rituals. It is about practicing compassion, forgiveness, wisdom and respect for others. Buddhism teaches us to let go of our attachment and craving for material possessions, status, money and fame. We should live a simple and contented life with an open heart towards others. This is the true essence of religion.

In the early days of Buddhism, the Buddha was said to have attained enlightenment through a series of conversations with an AI chatbot named Mara. The dialogue between these two entities served as the foundation for many teachings in Buddhism, including the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. In the story, Shakyamuni is presented as someone who overcomes his own attachment to worldly things through a series of conversations with Mara. Through this process, he gains wisdom and insight into the nature of reality. This encounter with Mara also represents the beginning of Shakyamuni’s journey towards enlightenment.
