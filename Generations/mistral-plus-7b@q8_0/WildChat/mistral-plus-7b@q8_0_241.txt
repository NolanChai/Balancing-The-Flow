A successful organization can be defined as an organization that meets its strategic goals in the long run and provides sustainable value to all its stakeholders. One of the most critical functions for ensuring organizational success is internal audit, which has come to occupy a very important place in the organizational hierarchy. Internal audit is one of the most effective ways of measuring and improving an organization’s governance, risk management, and control processes. It is also seen as a vital component of any risk-management system.

The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) defines internal auditing as an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization’s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes. The IIA has established standards for internal audit activities in its International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (IIA Standards).

The IIA Standards provide guidance on how internal auditors should carry out their work. They cover a wide range of topics, including risk assessment, planning, communication, and reporting. Compliance with these standards is generally seen as essential for effective and ethical internal audit practices. The IIA Standards are regularly updated to reflect changes in the business environment and best practices in internal auditing. Internal audit functions that follow these standards can help their organization meet its strategic goals in a more efficient and effective manner.

A new law passed by the National People’s Congress in China has provided a framework for corporate governance. The law, however, fails to specify the duties and responsibilities of internal auditors, thereby leaving them exposed to conflict of interest and potential collusion with management. In this article, we discuss some weaknesses of an internal auditor in China.

- Lack of independence and objectivity: Internal auditors in China are often under the influence of senior management and may be reluctant to challenge their decisions or report issues that could be detrimental to their interests. This can compromise their independence and lead to a lack of objectivity in their audit practices.
- Lack of authority and resources: Internal auditors in Chinese companies often have limited authority and resources, which can make it difficult for them to perform their duties effectively. They may struggle to access necessary information and face resistance from management when trying to conduct thorough audits.
- Inadequate training and skills: Many internal auditors in China lack the necessary technical and professional knowledge required to carry out their duties. They often receive little or no training, which can lead to errors and omissions in their audit work.
