# Project Details

This case study is a great example of an animated promo that has a distinct branding style. The use of 2D animation and motion graphics, along with the 3D camera move, give it a contemporary feel and help to create a very festive mood for Channel Four's Christmas rebrand campaign.

I've been working on this for the past few months. It'll be ready in about two weeks or so. Here's a little bit of background and character information:

Michael:

He is 16 years old, 5 ft. 9 in. tall and weighs about 140 pounds. He has sandy blond hair that reaches slightly below his shoulders and bright blue eyes. His skin is very fair with a slight tan. He is very thin and frail looking, but he seems to be rather strong for his size. Michael tends to wear T-shirts and jeans, even though he hates it. It's because of the fact that they are really comfortable to him.

Personality:
Michael is very shy and doesn't like talking to people he doesn't know or trust. He seems quite reserved but once you get to know him, he can be a lot of fun. Michael loves to listen to music, especially heavy metal. It soothes his mind and helps him relax. His favorite bands are Metallica, Guns n' Roses, Pantera, Nirvana and Pearl Jam. He also loves spending time with his best friend, Mark. Michael is very protective of his friends and would do anything to protect them from harm, especially Mark who he considers his brother.
