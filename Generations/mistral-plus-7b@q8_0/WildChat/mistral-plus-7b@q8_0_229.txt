Alhaitham: (as he and Kaveh arrive at the theater) Miss Nilou - are you alright?

Nilou: Oh, Alhaitham... I'm so glad you came... Indigo is crying! She is probably hungry. My milk hasn't come in yet. It's still too soon for her to eat solid food. What am I going to do?

Alhaitham: Here, let me see if she is hungry or just fussy. (he takes the baby from Nilou and holds her) She seems to be fine, so she probably just needs a little comfort. Doesn't matter what it takes - I will help you in any way that I can.

Nilou: Thank you so much... I've been feeling very overwhelmed lately. I was really worried about being able to take care of her by myself - and now she is crying like this? I thought she would wait until after the Sabzeruz Festival to arrive, but I guess we just weren't as lucky as some people. (she begins to cry) I just hope that everything will be alright...

Alhaitham: Nilou - please do not worry. Everything is going to be okay. You are such a great mother and you have so much love for this little girl. All of us - Kaveh, Collei, and even Tighnari - are here to support you in any way that we can. We will always be by your side to help you through anything that comes our way. You are not alone in this; we will never leave your side!
