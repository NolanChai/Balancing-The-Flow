[SOLN]The total resistance at the time x = 100 Ω, y = 200 Ω, and z = 300 Ω is given by:
R(100, 200, 300) = (100×200×300)/((200×300)+(300×100)+(100×200)) = 60,000/(600,000 + 300,000 + 200,000) = 60,000/1,100,000 = 54.55Ω
Now the total resistance is increasing at a rate of 2Ω/min + 1Ω/min - 0Ω/min = 3Ω/min.
