Hi Jimmy,

Yes your Line Manager should be entering the business objectives as part of the Performance Goal setup process. You are then required to enter how you will meet those objectives when completing the 'Planned Actions' section of the goal.



The HR Team will upload your business goals and personal goals to the Performance Management system. However, you can add additional personal development goals for yourself by selecting "Add Development Goal" on your Performance Management homepage.

Correct answer is "Since Crystal is on leave till this Friday and will be back next Monday, shall we still meet tomorrow for discussion?".

Let's go through it line by line:

- Since Crystal is on leave till this Friday: Here "since" introduces a clause that explains the reason or cause of something else. In this example, the clause is "Crystal is on leave till this Friday," which means Crystal will be away from work until Friday.
- and will be back next Monday: This further explains that Crystal will return to work on the following Monday after her leave.
- shall we still meet tomorrow for discussion?: This is a question asking if it is still appropriate to meet tomorrow, despite Crystal being on leave. It suggests that some discussion or meeting was already planned for tomorrow and now that Crystal will not be present, there may be uncertainty as to whether the meeting should proceed.
