The second point, that unsustainable fishing practices have had detrimental impacts on ecosystems, is supported by research from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), which has found that many fish species are at risk due to overfishing and habitat destruction caused by fishing operations. The third point, that illegal fishing and unregulated fishing contribute to overfishing, is also supported by data from the FAO, which estimates that up to 20% of all seafood caught worldwide is caught illegally or without proper regulation.
