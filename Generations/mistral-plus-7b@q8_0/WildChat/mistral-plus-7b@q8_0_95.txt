In chronic kidney disease, high blood sugar levels can have a significant impact on sodium and potassium levels. Hyperglycemia can cause an increase in sodium retention and a decrease in potassium excretion, which can lead to increased risk of fluid retention, hypertension, and electrolyte imbalance. In addition, people with chronic kidney disease are at increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus due to insulin resistance, so it is important for patients with chronic kidney disease to closely monitor their blood glucose levels.

1. Potassium is usually high in metabolic acidosis because of increased K excretion in the urine.
2. Potassium is usually low in metabolic acidosis because of increased K excretion in the urine.
3. Potassium is usually high in metabolic acidosis because of decreased K excretion in the urine.
4. Potassium is usually low in metabolic acidosis because of decreased K excretion in the urine.

The following are some of the pertinent data from the case above:
• The company was a family-owned business that had grown through acquisition over the years. As a result, the current management structure was not conducive to effective strategic planning or decision making.
• The CEO lacked formal leadership training and was not well-equipped to deal with the challenges of managing a large and complex organization. His leadership style was autocratic, which led to disengaged employees and low morale.
• There was no clear organizational structure or defined roles and responsibilities within the company. This made it difficult for employees to understand their own roles and the company’s direction.
• The company had a culture of silos, where different departments operated independently without a shared vision or goals. This lack of collaboration resulted in inefficiencies and duplication of efforts.
• Employee turnover was high, as many individuals felt unappreciated and disconnected from the organization’s purpose.

There are many physical findings in this case. The patient is a 16 year old female who presents with severe headaches, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea for the last week. On exam she is afebrile, but appears pale and anxious, has tenderness to palpation of her epigastric region and is having intermittent nausea and vomiting. Her physical exam findings are consistent with hypovolemic shock.

Hypovolemic shock can be defined as a state in which the circulating blood volume is decreased so that adequate blood flow to all body organs cannot be maintained. There are many possible causes of this type of shock including hemorrhage, burns and dehydration due to vomiting/diarrhea. Some signs and symptoms of hypovolemic shock include tachycardia, hypotension, decreased capillary refill time, oliguria, tachypnea, anxiety and agitation.

I have been diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma.  I was told this news at the hospital this morning by my oncologist and radiation doctor.  It's still hard to believe!  I've had a few different symptoms over the past 4-5 months, which I thought were caused from either stress or my sinus allergies (I have very severe ones).

I had a biopsy done last week on the swollen lymph nodes under my neck.  The results came back today and I was diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma stage II-A.  It's in 2 spots on my right side of my neck (in both lymph glands), as well as in my chest cavity.  It's still early stages, but it is aggressive.  My doctors have told me that I will be doing some combination of chemotherapy and radiation, and possibly some immunotherapy.  I am currently waiting for a PET scan to determine the severity of the cancer (it may spread more than just what we already know).  They said my treatment plan could change depending on the results from this test.

I will be starting chemo in 2 weeks.  I am so terrified!  Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers during this journey.

Her airway, breathing and circulation are intact and she has an open fracture of her left femur that is bleeding and a severe laceration on her face. A peripheral IV is inserted and blood is drawn for a complete blood count (CBC). The lab values for WBC, RBC, Hgb, and Hct are:

WBC: 16.3 x 10^{3}/μL
RBC: 4.17 x 10^{6}/μL
Hgb: 12.8 g/dL
Hct: 38.5%



### Answer:

- A. The history of acute onset and the associated features are highly suggestive of acute cholecystitis
- B. Abdominal ultrasound is helpful in diagnosis by identifying thickened gallbladder walls, gallstones, and pericholecystic fluid. It should be considered an initial diagnostic test.
- C. Acute cholecystitis is typically managed with antibiotics, pain medications, and surgical intervention. Gallbladder removal (cholecystectomy) is the preferred method of management for this patient.
