The answer is yes, the reddit post was not well received. Punctuations are used to determine how well a post is received by the community. A post with a punctuation of 0 typically indicates that the post has been downvoted more than it has been upvoted. In this case, the Reddit post has received significantly more downvotes than upvotes, which suggests that the majority of users on that subreddit did not find the content to be interesting or engaging. As a result, this post would probably have a negative effect on the overall quality of the subreddit and would likely be removed.
