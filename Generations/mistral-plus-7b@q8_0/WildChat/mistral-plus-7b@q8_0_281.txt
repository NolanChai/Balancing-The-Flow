This is the first writing exercise I have done in quite some time. As it was my first, I chose to use Twitter as a platform for it. The purpose of this writing exercise was to provide me with an opportunity to practice writing. The challenge was to write 10 short tweets about the topic given by the instructor. The topic was “good morning Atlantic Ocean.”

In order to complete this exercise, I needed to think carefully and creatively about ways to express my thoughts and feelings about this beautiful body of water. To do this, I drew from my own experiences and knowledge of the ocean as well as information that I had previously read or heard about it. The goal was to convey a sense of wonder, appreciation, and respect for the Atlantic Ocean in a concise and engaging way.
