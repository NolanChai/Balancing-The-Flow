## Answer:

Dialogue from a scene in the animated teen series Jane, where Jane's older sister Andrea getting arrested.

- Jane: No! Don't do this. Please! They won't let you out until tomorrow, and then you're going to be late for school. Just stay here with me; I promise everything will be fine.
- Andrea: Jane, I know you're just trying to help, but I can't do this. It was a stupid mistake and now I have to pay the price for it. You see, I broke into a building that I shouldn't have been in. The security guards caught me and now they're taking me away to be locked up until my trial tomorrow. It sucks, but sometimes you just have to accept your consequences and face them head-on.
- Jane: But why did you do it? Why would you risk getting arrested like this?
- Andrea: I was bored and curious. I saw a building that looked interesting and decided to take a closer look. Unfortunately, the place was locked up tight, so I had no choice but to break in. It was stupid, I know, but at the time it seemed like the best idea. Now I'm dealing with the consequences of my actions.
