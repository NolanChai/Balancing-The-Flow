Answer & Explanation

The magnification factor represents the change in an object's size when viewed through a microscope or telescope. It is calculated by dividing the image size by the object size. In double integrals in polar coordinates, the magnification factor r represents how much larger or smaller the area of the polar rectangle is compared to the corresponding rectangular region in Cartesian coordinates. The equation for the magnification factor r is r = dA/dA0, where dA and dA0 are the areas of the polar and rectangular regions, respectively.

[INSTR]The answer is (b). Here is how to solve the problem. Suppose that f is bounded and continuous on all of R^2, then there exists a real number K such that for all (x,y) in R^2, |f(x,y)|<=K. Let E be any Borel set in R^2. Then fdE = |{((x,y) in R^2 : f(x,y) > 0} cap E| â€“ |{((x,y) in R^2 : f(x,y) < 0} cap E| where A cap B is the intersection of sets A and B. Using the boundedness of f we get that for any Borel set E,
$$\int_{E}|f(x)|dx\leq \int_{\mathbb{R}^2}\left|\frac{K}{K^2}f(x)\right|dx=\frac{1}{K}\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}|f(x)|dx<\infty$$
So that fdA is defined for any Borel set E in R^2.

The correct answer is C

Explanation

Triple integrals can be used to compute the volume of a solid object. For example, if we want to find the volume of a box with length L, width W, and height H, then the triple integral would be: \(\int_0^H\int_0^W\int_0^L~dx\,dy\,dz\). This will give us the volume of the box. More generally, triple integrals can be used to calculate the volume of any solid object that can be described by a function \(f(x,y,z)\) over some rectangular region in space.

I know how to solve this problem, but I am unsure how to set up the limits.

The limits are: z between 0 and x, since we have y between 0 and z. We then have x between 0 and 1. So our triple integral is
\(\displaystyle{z}\in{\left[{{0},{x}}\right]}\)
y \(\displaystyle{z}\in{\left[{{0},{x}}\right]}\)
x \(\displaystyle{y}\in{\left[{{0},{z}}\right]}\)
\(\displaystyle{{\int}_{{{0}}}^{{{1}}}}{{\int}_{{{0}}}^{{{x}}}}{{\int}_{{{0}}}^{{{y}}}}{\left.{f{{\left({x},{y},{z}\right)}}}\right.}{d}{x}{d}{y}{d}{z}\)

Consider the cube [0,1]*[0,1]*[0,1] with mass density x^3+y^3+z^3. The center of mass is one of the three choices below. Without evaluating any integrals, can you figure out which answer is the only one that can possibly be correct?
- A. (2/5,2/5,2/5).
- B. (1/2,1/2,1/2).
- C. (3/5,3/5,3/5)
