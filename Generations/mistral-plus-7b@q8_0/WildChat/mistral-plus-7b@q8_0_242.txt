The first thing I remember from the Try Not To Laugh Challenge was the water. It was cold and refreshing, but it made me giggle uncontrollably. The second thing I remember is Talia Marâ€™s contagious laughter. She laughed so hard that she farted, which only made us laugh harder. As we continued the challenge, our laughter grew stronger and louder until we all fell into fits of giggles. It was a hilarious experience that I will never forget.
