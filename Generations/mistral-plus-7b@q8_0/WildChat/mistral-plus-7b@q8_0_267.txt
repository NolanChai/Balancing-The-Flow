After that night of sex and food, the next morning was a little awkward. They both knew they weren’t going to be able to avoid each other because they had a job together. So, they decided that they were just going to act like nothing happened. And for the most part, it worked. Except when they couldn’t help but smile at each other, or touch each other accidentally on purpose. They soon fell back into their routine of flirting and playful jabs at one another. It was as if the night never happened.

But that night, when they finally made love, everything changed between them. The feelings of desire and lust were still there. But now, they felt something else too. Something more intense, more deep, and more meaningful. It was like a switch had been flipped inside both of their hearts. They knew that whatever happened that night, it had changed them in some way. And for both of them, the change was good.
