Dynamite is an explosive material that contains nitroglycerin and/or other high explosives used for blasting rock, demolition, mining, quarrying, construction, and as a propellant in firearms. In 2018, the United States produced almost 69 million kilograms of dynamite, which was used primarily in the mining industry to extract copper, coal, and iron ore.

Dynamite is extremely dangerous when handled incorrectly or improperly stored. It is a high explosive that produces a significant amount of pressure and heat upon detonation. Improper handling can lead to accidents, injuries, and even death. When handling dynamite, itâ€™s important to wear the proper protective equipment, such as gloves, goggles, and a respirator, and to follow all safety procedures.

Alfred Nobel discovered and patented a new compound that he called dynamite. He made this substance by mixing nitroglycerin with sawdust. This mixture had the ability to cause an explosion, so it became useful for mining operations as well as construction projects. To make dynamite, you will need the following ingredients:

- Nitroglycerin
- Sawdust
- Charcoal
- Potassium nitrate
