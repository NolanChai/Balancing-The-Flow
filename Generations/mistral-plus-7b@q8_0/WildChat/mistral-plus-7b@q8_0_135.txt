[WRITER'S NOTE]: Julia Fairbanks is a well-known local figure and a very famous face in her hometown, so much that nearly everyone knows of her just by her name, she was born into wealth (as her family owns one of the biggest department stores in the town), and she is a spoiled rich girl (she has everything she wants), but what’s most important for this exercise is that she is incredibly insecure. [WRITER'S NOTE]

(The dialogue takes place during an assembly, in the auditorium)

Julia: Hello everyone, I’m Julia Fairbanks and I am the daughter of the owner of Fairbanks’s Department Store (which is what our family owns)… so basically I’ve been very lucky and blessed in my life so far. My father has always made sure that I have had everything I wanted. He’s always spoilt me rotten and I know that I am a very lucky girl to have the life that I have, but sometimes when you are as spoiled as I am, you tend to become a little bit insecure, because it makes me feel like people will judge me just for being rich and having everything… which is why I’m really excited to start attending this school. Because I can make my own friends here, I can be my own person here, I can finally become who I want to become without anyone judging me just based on the fact that I am Julia Fairbanks, daughter of the owner of Fairbanks’s Department Store… which is why I decided to transfer to this school. Because I wanted a fresh start for myself and I wanted to have my own friends at school that weren’t just my dad’s business associates or employees or something like that. So here I am, starting at a new school in my senior year of high school, which is pretty scary… but I think it will also be quite fun! I really do hope we can become good friends as the time goes on and I can finally make myself feel better about who I am, even though I’m Julia Fairbanks, daughter of the owner of Fairbanks’s Department Store. Thank you all for having me here today!
