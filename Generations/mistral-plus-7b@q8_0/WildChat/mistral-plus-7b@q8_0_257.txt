- The Richter scale is used to measure the size of earthquakes. It is based on a logarithmic scale, which means that each number increase in the Richter scale represents an increase of about 10 times the amount of energy released by the earthquake. The magnitude of an earthquake is a measure of its strength and the damage it causes. Earthquakes with magnitudes less than 2 are usually not felt by humans, while earthquakes with magnitudes greater than 5 can cause serious damage and loss of life.
- The Mercalli scale is used to describe the intensity of an earthquake at a particular location based on the amount of damage caused by the earthquake. It ranges from I (very weak) to XII (extremely violent). The Mercalli scale is subjective because it depends on the observerâ€™s assessment of the severity of the shaking and the resulting damage.

### Objective Scales

- Nominal Scale
    - Categorical data in which data is assigned a name (e.g., gender: female, male)
    - The value of the nominal scale has no quantitative meaning because it does not reflect any magnitude or rank ordering.
- Ordinal Scale
    - Data arranged in a rank order such as from best to worst or most to least.
    - These scales are ranked but the difference between the ranks is unknown (e.g., Likert scale).
- Interval Scale
    - The difference between each interval has the same value on the scale
    - For example, a 10-point temperature scale with each interval being 10 degrees Celsius.
- Ratio Scale
    - Measures that have an absolute zero point and all values are meaningful.
    - For example, weight or height of an individual because there is a true zero value for both measures.
