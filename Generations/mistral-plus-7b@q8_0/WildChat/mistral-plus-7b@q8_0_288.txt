Well, let's say that he could. He would have an extremely strong cold medicine prescription, or at least be very skilled at making sure he took some before doing something important so he wouldn't get distracted by it. It might come in handy for studying for a test or for doing work in advance to avoid having to do it later. It might be helpful if you were late and had to rush somewhere. You could just sneeze when you got there, and then you would have been there on time, even though you only left five minutes ago. However, there are some things that might not be so great. You would need a lot of cold medicine in case you had a really bad allergies or a sinus infection. If Jon is sneezing for hours straight he would probably go through all of his cold medication fairly quickly. Also, if he were to get distracted by something and accidentally skip ten hours forward while doing something dangerous like driving down the road, or walking in front of a car, it could end really badly. It might be best not to let Jon have this power because we wouldn't want him to do anything that could hurt himself or someone else.
