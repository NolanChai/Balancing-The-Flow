[QUESTIONS]What are the options for replacing a small chest-type freezer? It does not need to keep food frozen for a long time. But still should have decent insulation so that ice cream stays cold when the power goes out.

It should also have an adjustable thermostat, which is very handy when it is warm outside and the freezer needs to be turned down a lot lower than usual in order to keep things frozen.[/QUESTIONS]
