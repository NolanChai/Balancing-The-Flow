The beach was crowded with people. Everywhere there were women in bikinis, men in trunks and children running wild on the sand. A little girl was enjoying the sun with her family. She was playing in the sand with her sister, when suddenly she was startled by a seagull. The seagull swooped down toward the girl, causing her to scream. Her father came running over to comfort her and the family decided it was time to go home. As they walked back to their car, the little girl could not stop thinking about the seagull that had startled her. She couldn’t help but wonder what it would be like to have wings and fly through the air like the majestic birds she saw at the beach that day.

Strombilia was having a great day. The sun was shining, and the ocean was a perfect shade of blue. She loved being able to spend time with her friends on the sand. As they played Frisbee and built sandcastles, she couldn’t help but feel grateful for the moment.

She was enjoying herself so much that she completely forgot about the sandcastle contest coming up later in the day. When her mom reminded her, Strombilia quickly got to work building a castle worthy of first place. Her creativity and dedication paid off; she built an intricate castle with towers, drawbridges, and even a moat. The judges were so impressed that they awarded her the blue ribbon! It was a proud moment for Strombilia—proof that hard work always pays off in the end.

Strombolia had always been a clumsy child. She had a lot of energy and never quite knew when to stop. She was in constant trouble for one thing or another. When she was younger, her parents tried to get her to go to school. Strombolia loved school at first. But soon, she realized that it wasn’t as much fun as playing outside with her friends. So she started skipping school to play on the playground with her friends. This got her into a lot of trouble with her parents and teachers. They would constantly punish her for skipping school. But Strombolia never learned her lesson. She continued to skip school, and they kept punishing her. Finally, she decided that it wasn’t worth the punishment, so she stopped skipping school. But she still had a lot of trouble at home and in school because of her clumsiness and lack of attention span.
