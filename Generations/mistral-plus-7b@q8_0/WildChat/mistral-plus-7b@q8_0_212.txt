Natsuki: "Wow! Your first kicks - you were all so excited and curious about your new environment!" (Laughs)

(The other two triplets begin to kick as well, causing Natsuki's belly to move.)

Natsuki: "You three are so full of energy, aren't you? I can't wait to see what kind of adventures and mischief you get into as you grow older." (Smiles)
