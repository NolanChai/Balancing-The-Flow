I had the pleasure of marrying my daughter this week. The ceremony was very sweet and I am very proud of both her and her husband. Here is what I said:

Dear Sarah and Josh,

Congratulations on your marriage today. Marriage is a wonderful thing and I know you will enjoy it very much together as the years go by. You are both fortunate to have each other because not only are you handsome but also kind, thoughtful and generous. Together I am sure that you will be able to overcome all the challenges life brings your way.

My favorite definition of marriage is: “Marriage is when two people agree to live their entire lives together.” You have chosen each other for this great adventure, so my advice is that you treat each other with respect and love every day of your lives. The days can be long but the years are short, so cherish every moment you have together.

May God bless and keep you both always!

Marriage is such a wonderful gift from God. It is an opportunity to give love unconditionally, support each other in times of need and celebrate every moment together. It is truly a blessing for the couple involved and their families as well. I would like to congratulate [Bride’s Name] and [Groom’s Name] on this special day. May your life together be filled with joy, love, laughter and happiness. May you always remember that through thick and thin, no matter what you may face, you are there for each other unconditionally. May God bless you both now and forevermore.
