It's late, you're tired and your body aches all over. You have no idea where you are or why. All you know is that it's dark, there is a blue light in front of you and a TV static crackling in the background. The only source of illumination is this blue light and some faint static on one of the TVs. There are three others in your room but they appear to be off, you can hear a low hum from them. You take a few steps forward towards the blue light and as you do so the static becomes louder and clearer. What appears to be a new Channel 5 ident is flashing on the screen:

Pylons. It's a brand new channel 5 ident. The same image of the pylons flickering on and off, accompanied by some low humming noise and then a loud crackle before the picture fades out. You rub your eyes in disbelief. "This can't be real." you think to yourself. But it is. The channel 5 ident has been replaced by something new. Something unsettling. As the static slowly dies down, you hear someone speak over it:

"Welcome to Channel 5. We hope that this will provide a new and exciting viewing experience for our viewers. This is just the beginning of an entirely new era for our channel as we strive to bring you the best in entertainment and informational programming." The voice seems to come from all directions at once, echoing throughout the room as if there were many people speaking simultaneously. You shiver slightly as goosebumps rise on your arms, despite the warmth of the blue light. "We are very excited about this new direction and we hope that our viewers will be equally excited. Channel 5 is ready to take its place among the most innovative and cutting-edge channels in television today." As they finish speaking, you can hear them laughing maniacally in the background as the static increases once again before fading out once more.
