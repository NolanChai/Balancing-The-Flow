Assignment 5-4: [Instructions]How would we solve this problem using methods taught in AP Statistics?

A pharmaceutical company is developing a new drug for the treatment of depression, which they estimate will cost $80 per dose to produce. They want to price their medication so that it costs approximately $150 per prescription for patients with insurance and about $200 per prescription for uninsured patients. Using data from an earlier clinical trial on a different depression drug (see table), the company wants to determine whether these proposed prices will allow them to make a profit given the percentage of patients with or without insurance in their target population. If 50 percent of patients have insurance, what price per prescription should the company charge for insured patients? What price per prescription would they need to charge uninsured patients?
