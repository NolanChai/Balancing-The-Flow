1. What is your artistic style?
I am an expressionist, I do not consider myself a surrealist or abstract artist. I paint my visions in order to express the essence of life, love, and pain that I have experienced in this world.
2. How did you get involved in the art world?
My journey into the art world began at the age of 7 years old when I decided I wanted to be a painter after I saw Picassoâ€™s work. At first my parents thought it was just another phase, but by the time I was 14 years old they realized I had made a decision about what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. They were very supportive and encouraged me throughout my career.
3. What inspires your artwork?
I am inspired by the human condition. All the feelings I have experienced in my lifetime are reflected in my work. I also draw inspiration from history, mythology and legends from many different cultures around the world. In particular I love to study the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, Rome as well as South America, Africa and Asia.
4. Do you have any specific themes or messages that you try to convey in your work?
My artwork is an expression of my feelings about life, love, and death. It reflects on the human condition through portraits of characters that represent different types of people I know and have met throughout my lifetime. My hope is to touch the hearts of those who view my art.
