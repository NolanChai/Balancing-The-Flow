Respectful Men

Your brother, Sweet, gets into a fight and calls you to bail him out. You rush to the location and find your brother surrounded by two thugs. As soon as he sees you arrive, he runs off without even saying thanks. You take care of his attackers and call him back to thank you properly. However, instead of being grateful for saving his life, he attacks you as well and tries to shoot you with his gun.

After a brief struggle, he finally gets the upper hand and runs away. You chase after him but eventually lose him. Frustrated, you decide to go back home to get some rest. When you arrive at your house, Sweet is there waiting for you. He tells you that he knows youâ€™re angry with him for what happened earlier but it was all just a misunderstanding. He goes on to say that he has learned from his actions and will be more respectful of you in the future. You decide to forgive him and promise to do your best to make amends as well.
