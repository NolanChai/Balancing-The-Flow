Iâ€™m not sure I understand you completely but maybe this code can help:

```
Sub Button1_Click()
Dim c As Range, r As Long, lastrow As Long
Set c = ActiveSheet.UsedRange.Rows(1).Resize(12)
lastrow = c.Find("*", , xlFormulas, , xlByRows, xlPrevious).Row
With ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
  For r = lastrow To 1 Step -1
    .Cells(r, "A").Value = c.Offset(12 - r).Value
  Next r
End With
End Sub
```
