AC Compressor Superheat Calculation Formula:
Superheat= ΔT/2+∆P/5(psi)

In order to find the superheat, we need to know the temperature rise through the condenser and also the pressure drop across the compressor. The following example shows how to calculate the AC compressor superheating using this formula:

Example #1: Calculate the AC compressor superheat given a temperature rise of 20°F and an approximate pressure drop of 15 psi in a standard AC compressor.
Solution: Use the superheat calculation formula: Superheat= ΔT/2+∆P/5(psi)
Superheat = (20/2)+(15/5)
Superheat = 10°F +3 psi
Superheat=13°F
In this example, the AC compressor superheat is about 13°F.

The turbocharger system is one of the key technologies for high-speed low-emission and low fuel consumption engines. Recently, more and more manufacturers have adopted turbocharging technology in their product lineup, so it is important to understand how to properly operate and maintain the turbocharger. Turbochargers can be classified into three types: exhaust gas turbochargers, air intake turbochargers, and combined turbochargers. Exhaust gas turbocharging has the advantages of low installation cost and easy maintenance. Air intake turbocharging, which uses an air compressor to increase intake pressure, is effective for reducing fuel consumption and exhaust emissions. Combined turbocharging uses both exhaust gas and air intake turbochargers, resulting in a synergistic effect that improves engine performance and reduces emissions.

In a turbocharger, the inlet airflow is compressed to increase engine performance. This is done by forcing more air into the cylinder and increasing its pressure. The amount of compression that occurs depends on several factors, including the design of the turbocharger and the speed of rotation. One factor that influences turbocharger efficiency is inlet air temperature. The higher the temperature of the inlet air, the more energy is required to compress it. This means that a turbocharger with cooler inlet air will be more efficient than one with hotter inlet air. Additionally, an increase in inlet air pressure can also lead to an increase in efficiency by providing greater compression ratios inside the turbocharger.
