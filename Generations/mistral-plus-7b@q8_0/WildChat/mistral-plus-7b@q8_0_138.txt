Streaming services are becoming the primary way that people listen to music. They offer easy access to an almost infinite library of songs, and they allow listeners to enjoy their favorite artists without having to buy a physical copy of their album. However, streaming services have had some negative impacts on the music industry, particularly for independent musicians who rely heavily on royalties to make a living. Streaming services often pay artists a fraction of what they would receive from a sale of their song or album. This means that many artists are struggling financially due to low royalty payments and difficulty monetizing their content on streaming platforms like Spotify.
