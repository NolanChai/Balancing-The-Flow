The first thing you do is create a new project, in the New Project window, choose Blank. Name your new project PPT. Then add a new form named MainForm to your project. After that, drag the following controls from the Toolbox and drop them on your form:

1. TextBox (label)
2. CommandButton (button)
3. ComboBox
4. ListBox
5. OptionButton
6. CheckBox
7. ScrollBar (horizontal)

Now resize, rename and place these controls on the MainForm as shown in the screenshot below.

Next, set the following properties for each of the controls:

1. TextBox – Name = txtTitle, Left = 90, Top = 25, Width = 100, Height = 30. Set its Text property to “Enter Title”.
2. CommandButton – Name = btnCreatePPT, Left = 470, Top = 65, Width = 80, Height = 30, Caption = Create PPT.
3. ComboBox – Name = cmbSlides, Left = 10, Top = 90, Width = 100, Height = 25. Set its Items property to (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
4. ListBox – Name = lstSlideText, Left = 10, Top = 125, Width = 100, Height = 150.
5. OptionButton – Name = optStandard, Left = 60, Top = 220, Text = “Standard”. Set its Value property to True.
6. CheckBox – Name = chkBorders, Left = 240, Top = 220, Caption = Add Borders. Set its Value property to False.
7. ScrollBar – Name = sclFontSize, Left = 200, Top = 350, Width = 100, Height = 30. Set its Min property to 8 and Max property to 36.

What is the difference between "cannot" and "can't"? What are the meanings of these words? How are they used in a sentence?

Example:
I cannot go to the party tonight, I have an exam tomorrow.
Can't means the same as "cannot". The difference between them is that cannot is used as a negative form of can, and can't is its shortened form. Both are used to express inability or lack of permission.
