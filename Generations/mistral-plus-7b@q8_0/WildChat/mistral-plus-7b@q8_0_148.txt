Earth is one of the planets in the Solar System. It’s also known as ‘The Blue Planet’. The Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, and has evolved through many different stages since that time. It is a rocky, watery planet covered with mountains and oceans, and it is inhabited by a large range of living things.

Earth’s surface temperature is just right for liquid water to exist, which is essential for life as we know it. The Earth also has an atmosphere that protects living things from the Sun’s harmful radiation. It is the only planet known to have life on it, and humans have only existed here for a tiny fraction of Earth’s history.
