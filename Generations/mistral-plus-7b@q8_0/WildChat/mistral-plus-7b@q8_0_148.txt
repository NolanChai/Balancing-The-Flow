I want you to imagine the most strict, no-nonsense nursery you can possibly imagine. The walls are painted a pale shade of pink with bright rainbow decals spread throughout. In one corner is a brightly colored baby toy chest overflowing with jolly jumpers, bibs and pacifiers. On the other side there is a changing table where the nanny changes the diapers of the children in her care. The room is filled with cute, but mischievous toddlers running around, causing all kinds of trouble. This is the nursery that belongs to the darkly enchanted Mary Poppins, a strict disciplinarian who loves putting the naughty little ones in their place and reminding them of what a baby is. She carries with her an assortment of magical items such as a pacifier, locking plastic pants and a paddle which she uses to teach these wicked children a lesson they will not soon forget. When a child misbehaves in the nursery, it is not uncommon for Mary Poppins to scold them harshly or even spank their bottom with her magical paddle. Her stern but loving approach has helped many of the children learn to behave properly and understand the importance of following instructions.
