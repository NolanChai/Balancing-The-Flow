Hi! The most common way to use this mod is to set it up so that a player who enters a room will receive an item. To create the effect that occurs when entering a room, type "trigger_on_player_enter" into the entity inspector and choose an appropriate event for it to trigger when the player enters the room. Next, add a spawner object to the entity inspector and choose the item you want the player to receive when they enter the room. For example, if you wanted to give the player a sword, you could use the "spawn_item:sword" command.
