You are on the verge of winning a small war in a far off land.  Your side has been fighting for years and are nearing victory.  They have recently captured a city with very large military installations that will be a great benefit to your cause.  The other side, however, still has much firepower at their disposal and have called you out to negotiate a peace treaty.

You arrive in the city with a few advisors, ready to talk about an end to all hostilities.  You are seated at the negotiation table with your enemies.  They present you with the terms of a cease-fire: the land they just lost must be returned to them and any other territory that has been taken by either side.  In addition, they want full access to all military installations in their territory, as well as complete control over trade in this area of the world.  They also want your country to stop interfering with their domestic policies.  The opposing leader explains that if these conditions are not met within one month, then they will attack again and win the war once and for all.

What do you do?
