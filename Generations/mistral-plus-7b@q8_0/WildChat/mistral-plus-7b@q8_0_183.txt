This was made for the SG-Kawaii contest, held on May 18, 2017 at Bilibili. The theme of the competition was “cute drunk girl”, and this is what I came up with. I had to create a short scene depicting an extremely cute girl who was very, very drunk. It’s like the perfect storm of cute: a cute girl in a cute costume who is inebriated to the point of adorably slurring her words and stumbling around.

This girl is so cute that even when she is at her absolute worst, people still think she’s super adorable and want to help take care of her! In this scene, a group of friends are taking turns trying to lead their intoxicated friend back home safely. They all love her dearly and just want to protect her from herself. She doesn’t have a lot of money, so they pitch in to buy drinks for her and walk her back home. Along the way, she stumbles a little bit and has trouble keeping upright. Her friends help steady her and support her as much as possible while trying not to cause any embarrassment or make things worse for her. They are all extremely patient with their inebriated friend and try to be understanding of what she’s going through. In the end, they all just want to help out their dear drunken friend in any way they can!
