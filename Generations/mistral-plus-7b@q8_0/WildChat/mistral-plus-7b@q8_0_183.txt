Genetic engineering is the process that involves the manipulation of the genetic material of an organism, including plants, in order to introduce new traits or properties that are not naturally present. In genetic engineering, DNA from a source organism is cut out using restriction enzymes and then inserted into the recipient plant by using vectors such as agrobacterium. This process can be used for improving the yield or quality of crops, making them more resistant to pests and diseases, and introducing traits that confer environmental benefits.

I believe it is True, since GMOs are a mix of genetics from different species, including bacteria, viruses and fungi, USDA has jurisdiction over this type of organisms, since these are plant pathogens.

What is a viral vector?

A viral vector is an engineered viral particle used to deliver genetic material into cells for therapeutic or research purposes. Viral vectors can be used as delivery vehicles for carrying DNA or RNA sequences, allowing the introduction of genetic information into cells that lack this information. Viral vectors are often utilized in gene therapy and vaccines to target specific cell types and treat diseases at a molecular level.
