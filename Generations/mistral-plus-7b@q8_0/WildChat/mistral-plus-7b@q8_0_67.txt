The critics of Bill Hartmanâ€™s method can be divided into 2 groups. The first group consists of physiotherapists, orthopedic surgeons, athletic trainers and coaches that have not been introduced to the concepts of DNS or PRI but are still in a position of authority. In this case, it is not possible to get a fair assessment from these professionals because they have no idea what they are talking about and as such will make assumptions based on their personal beliefs. This group tends to be very dogmatic and cannot accept that other methods may have merit.

The second group consists of therapists and trainers who are more open-minded and have taken the time to learn about DNS or PRI. They may still have some reservations but will also acknowledge the potential benefits of this type of therapy. These professionals tend to be much less dogmatic than those in the first group and are willing to consider all available options when treating a patient.

- Points:
    - Deep learning models are trained on vast amounts of data, which allows them to learn patterns and make predictions. They can outperform traditional machine learning models in tasks such as image recognition and natural language processing.
    - One downside of deep learning models is that they require large amounts of training data, compute resources, and engineering expertise to build and deploy effectively. This means that developing and maintaining deep learning systems can be costly and time-consuming.
    - Deep learning models are prone to overfitting, which occurs when the model performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Overfitting can be mitigated by using techniques such as cross-validation, regularization, and dropout.
