## About the Task

You're working at a startup that has developed an online platform to help people with [a specific need]. Your job is to increase user adoption of this platform. The management team has asked you to write a detailed 3-month plan to kickstart growth for their company using Racecar's Growth Framework VIRALITY engine, which focuses on viral growth and social networking. They want the plan to include specific tactics for each stage of the user journey:

Awareness: How will you attract potential users to the platform?

Interest: How will you pique their interest and convince them to try it out?

Adoption: What strategies will you use to get new users onboarded and using the platform consistently?

### Background:

My client is an innovative startup that provides digital tools to diagnose and treat ADD and ADHD. Theyâ€™ve already gained traction with the patient population, but now they are looking to penetrate the physician market more aggressively.

### Objective:

To develop a 3-month sales strategy using virality, referrals and targeting physicians focused on ADHD as the center of it.

### Solution:

I began by researching the target audience (physicians) and understanding their pain points, motivations, and needs. I then developed a plan that included:

- Leveraging virality through patient referrals and word-of-mouth marketing to drive physician interest in the platform.
- Offering incentives and rewards to physicians who referred patients to the platform.
- Targeting specific physicians with targeted ads and promotions, focusing on those who are already treating patients with ADHD.
- Creating a sales funnel that includes educational materials, demos, and trials for potential clients.
