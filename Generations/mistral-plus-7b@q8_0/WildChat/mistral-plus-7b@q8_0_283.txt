Joseph opened the door and invited Rose inside. She was relieved to find that his apartment was brightly lit and comfortable. As they chatted, Rose felt comfortable and at ease around him. Joseph then prepared a delicious meal for Rose using ingredients he had picked up from the supermarket. They enjoyed their lunch in companionable silence.

After the meal, Rose requested some water, so William went to get it. He asked her about her day while she drank, noticing that she was quiet and shy. When William left again, Joseph gave Rose a tour of his apartment. She admired the artwork on the walls and felt at ease in the cozy space.

Joseph then led Rose to the bedroom and encouraged her to sit down. As he began massaging her shoulders, she felt a sense of peace wash over her. For the first time in a long time, someone was taking care of her. She couldn't help but fall into a deep sleep as the tension in her body dissipated.
