Monika: “Great! Let’s go. First one to the couch is IT!”

Natsuki: “I’m first!!” [leaping onto the couch]

Sayori: “Well, it looks like you have dibs on being IT today, Natsuki. Who would you like to start with?”

Natsuki: “Monika! I choose Monika!” [points at Monika and grins mischievously]

Monika: “Okay…what do I get? Truth or dare?”

Natsuki: “Dare.”

Monika: “Alright. Dare. Okay, I dare you to go up and kiss MC.”

Monika: [winks at Sayori] “I think that was easy enough for you to pull off, don’t you, dear?”

Sayori: [blushing and giggling] “Yes! That was…fun!”
