Healing Child Abuse Subliminals:

1. I forgive myself and my abusers for the abuse I experienced as a child.
2. I am safe and secure now, no longer affected by the past.
3. I release all negative emotions associated with my childhood trauma.
4. I am worthy of love and compassion.
5. I am strong and resilient despite my past experiences.
6. I let go of any guilt or shame that I may still be carrying from my childhood.
7. I am healed and whole now, able to move forward without fear.
