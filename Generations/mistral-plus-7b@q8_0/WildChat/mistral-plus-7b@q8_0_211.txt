The text is from an email. It was written by a sales manager to his sales people, encouraging them to take their jobs seriously:

“We all know that we are in the sales business and selling is our life’s work. There are many things in life which we cannot control; but what we can control is our own attitude and performance. If you want success in your life and in your career, then you need to have a winning attitude and a passion for achieving your goals.

Remember that it is not just about working hard; it’s also about working smart. You need to be focused on what you want to achieve and then put in the effort to make it happen. Persistence is key, so never give up even when things get tough. You have the potential for greatness within you – so go out there and seize every opportunity!
