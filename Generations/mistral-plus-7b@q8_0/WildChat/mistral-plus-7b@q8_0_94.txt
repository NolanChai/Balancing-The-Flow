In this game, the player takes control of one of four playable characters; Lilac, Carol, Milla, or Cerulean. Each character has a unique storyline and play style. The game uses 2D side-scrolling mechanics that are common in many platform games. While exploring the game world, players defeat enemies by using a variety of combat moves, including melee attacks and projectile attacks.

The player can also use power-ups found throughout the game to gain temporary abilities, such as invincibility or increased speed. The game features four boss fights at the end of each level, and a final boss fight at the end of the game. Freedom Planet has received generally positive reviews from critics. Critics praised the game for its graphics, music, and gameplay mechanics. Some reviewers also noted that the game had a high difficulty level.

The anime is Dragon Ball, and the game is Freedom Planet (A platformer). Lilac is a main protagonist in the game and she met Ants in the game. She was surprised seeing ants at first, but later on she felt happy meeting them because they were cute. Goku is a main character from the anime Dragon Ball, he has Super Saiyan power, but he’s really kind-hearted and protective of those close to him like Son Gohan or his friend Krillin.

Lilac would be very excited to meet Goku because she thinks they are both powerful warriors with similar strengths who could fight together against evil forces like Cell or Majin Buu. She also wants them to be friends and get along well together for their own benefit as well as everyone else’s safety too!
