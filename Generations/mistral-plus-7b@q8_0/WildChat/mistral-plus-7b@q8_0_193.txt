I used to do a few things that had adrenaline that I would associate with the experience of having adrenaline and would try to recreate them:
- getting ready for a competition (basketball, gymnastics)
- bungee jumping (this is awesome but if you can't get to a bridge/crane then there are other ways like going on some rides at an amusement park)
- riding rollercoasters
- skydiving
- paragliding/hang gliding
- white water rafting
