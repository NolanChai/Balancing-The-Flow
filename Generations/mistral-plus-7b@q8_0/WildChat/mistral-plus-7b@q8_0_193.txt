In Chapter 7, when the Striders start approaching after the explosion, Alyx shoves Gordon down. When we first see this scene she seems very scared and panicked, but her actions in this moment are surprisingly composed considering how worried she looked beforehand. She even takes time to brace herself for the fall before pushing him over.

I know Gordon is supposed to be the brave one in these scenarios, so maybe Alyx doesn't get enough credit for all that she does and has done, but I feel like her self-sacrificing act of shoving Gordon out of harm's way should be acknowledged more.
