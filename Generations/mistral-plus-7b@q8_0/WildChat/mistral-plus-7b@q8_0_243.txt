That's great to hear! So, what have you been up to lately? I've been busy with schoolwork and my job as a server at a local restaurant. It's been challenging but rewarding. When I'm not working or studying, I like to spend time with my friends, go on hikes, and try new recipes.

It sounds like you're pretty busy! What do you enjoy most about your job?

I love the social aspect of being a server. I really enjoy getting to know and help our customers. It's also great to be part of a team with my coworkers. We work together to create an amazing dining experience for each customer that comes in.
