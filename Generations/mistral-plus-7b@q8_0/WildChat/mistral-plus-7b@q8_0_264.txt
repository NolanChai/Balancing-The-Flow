No. It is possible for a mother to love her children (or at least some of them) and still have NPD or be otherwise abusive. Many mothers with NPD use their children to meet their own emotional needs. They may put their children in the spotlight because it makes them feel important. Or they may manipulate their children so that the child ends up fulfilling their motherâ€™s fantasies. A mother who has NPD or other personality disorders can be cruel, emotionally abusive and even physically abusive to her children.
