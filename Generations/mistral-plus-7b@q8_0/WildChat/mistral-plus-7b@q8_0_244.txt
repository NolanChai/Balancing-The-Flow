[INSTR]This work demonstrates a high-performance cascade CO2 electrolysis system composed of a novel Cu–MnOx electrocatalyst, which can convert CO2 to CO with an unprecedented SPCE (75.5%) and EE (80.9%) at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in a single pass. The high CO2 SPCE and EE of the Cu–MnOx electrocatalyst are due to its low overpotential for CO production, high activity towards CO2 reduction and superior CO2 transfer capability. By using this highly efficient Cu–MnOx catalyst, the overall conversion efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) of the cascade electrolysis system can be greatly improved by about 3.6 and 4.5 times, respectively, compared to previous studies. This study provides a new pathway for realizing highly efficient CO2 cascade electrochemical utilization systems.句子润色[/INSTR]
