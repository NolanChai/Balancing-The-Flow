> When trying to install php5 on IIS 7.0, when running test page, you will see this error. This is because by default, IIS does not have any PHP script mappings associated with it. The reason for this is because it is a security feature that allows the web server administrator to control which files are allowed to run on their servers. To solve the problem, go to Start | Administrative Tools | Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager. In the left pane, expand your server node and then the Web Sites node. Then right click on Default Web Site and then click Add Virtual Directory. Once you have added the virtual directory, navigate back to your newly created php folder by clicking on it. Then in the Actions panel, select the Edit Permissions link. On the resulting screen, enable the Scripts, Executables and ISAPI Extensions options, and then click OK. Now refresh the page that you were running before and you should see your PHP code instead of the error message.

Hi All

I'm writing a script that will copy the contents of a file to another. The problem is I want it to ignore blank lines. This is my first script so please bear with me. So far this is what I have:

Code: Select all
    ```set /p Input=Enter the source file name <Input>:
echo on
for /f "tokens=*" %%a in (%INPUT%) do (
findstr /v ^$ %INPUT% > OutputFile.txt
)```

I know that I'm going to need a set command for the output, but I don't know what it is yet. I would also like to get rid of the redundancy if possible and have the for loop take care of copying all of the lines into OutputFile.txt.

# Avoid PHP Deprecated

The IIS is a web server created by Microsoft that allows you to run dynamic content on the Internet or on an internal network. This server, also known as Internet Information Services, provides developers with a wide range of tools and APIs for building web applications using ASP.NET, PHP and other languages.

One of the common concerns when developing web applications with PHP on IIS is avoiding deprecated functions, which are outdated or no longer recommended for use. Deprecated functions can cause compatibility issues and pose a security risk. In this article, we will explore some tips to avoid using deprecated PHP functions on IIS.

To avoid using deprecated functions in your PHP code on IIS, follow these steps:

1. Review the official list of PHP deprecated functions provided by the PHP documentation. This document lists all the functions and methods that have been declared deprecated and should be avoided.
2. Update your code to use non-deprecated equivalents wherever possible. Many of the deprecated functions have replaced with better alternatives, so updating your code can help avoid deprecation warnings and ensure compatibility with future versions of PHP.
3. Use a tool or IDE that provides warnings for deprecated functions to quickly identify any potential issues in your code. Most modern development environments include features like this to make it easy to spot and fix problems with deprecated functions.
