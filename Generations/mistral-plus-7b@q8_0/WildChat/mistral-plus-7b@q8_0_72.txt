- Flexitarianism is a form of semi-vegetarianism, in which a person reduces their meat consumption but does not completely eliminate it from their diet. It has become more popular in recent years as people have become more aware of the environmental and ethical implications of eating meat. Many flexitarians choose to reduce their meat consumption because they are concerned about the impact of factory farming on the environment, or because they are worried about animal welfare issues. They also often want to improve their health by eating a more plant-based diet. To be a successful flexitarian, it is important to have a good understanding of nutrition and to be committed to making small changes in your lifestyle that can make a big difference over time. With the right approach, being a flexitarian can be an easy way to reduce your carbon footprint while enjoying delicious, healthy food.
