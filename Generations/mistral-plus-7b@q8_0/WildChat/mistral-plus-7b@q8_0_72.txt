[QUOTE=“wangjian2016”]Instead of having one annual statement per customer per year, can the system be changed to generate a new annual statement every month (or quarter)? That way we don’t need to wait till the end of year for the statement. Thanks.[/QUOTE]
Yes, that is a good idea and I will add it to our enhancement request. We may also have the option of having an email notification when the new annual statement is available.

This is a legal requirement of the NSW Government under the Residential Tenancies Act 2010 (NSW). All landlords who enter into an ongoing residential tenancy agreement are required to provide annual statement of rent paid. The statement of rent paid must contain details of the rent payments for the year, as well as information on bond lodgement and refund.

If the tenant has not paid any rent for the year (or at least one week’s rent in the first 3 months) then the landlord does not need to provide an annual statement of rent paid for that year.
