The Demon Slayer anime and manga came out at the same time that the Black Lives Matter movement was growing, which led to criticism and backlash over the similarity between Tanjiro's hanafuda earrings and the Rising Sun flag. This flag, also known as the Imperial Japanese Army Flag, has a long history of being associated with imperialist Japan and its military expansionism. It was used by Japan during World War 2 and is seen as an emblem of Japanese militarism and colonialism. Many people believe that using this symbol in any context is insensitive and offensive to those who suffered under the oppression of the Imperial Japanese army.

Golden Kamuy, on the other hand, has not received much criticism for its use of the Rising Sun flag. This may be due to several factors. Firstly, Golden Kamuy takes place during a time period when Japan was still at war and the characters in the show were all a part of the Japanese army. Because of this, the use of the Rising Sun flag in the show is more historically accurate than it would be for other shows or movies. Secondly, the Rising Sun flag is not used as much of a focus in Golden Kamuy compared to other media that includes it. It is only seen occasionally and never in a central role. Because of this, its use in Golden Kamuy does not seem as offensive as it would in a different setting.

It’s the same case in the West. If you write a story about Nazis but make them look heroic and the Jews look villainous, people will complain that you made a pro-Nazi story. But if you have Jewish heroes fighting against Nazi villains, then nobody complains. It’s the same with Japanese people.
