We4A (Women empowerment for Agri-business) is a project that seeks to address gender inequality by enhancing the capacity of women entrepreneurs to create wealth through agriculture. It aims at supporting 10,000 women agribusinesses over 3 years in Uganda, Kenya and Ghana. The project has supported over 2000 women farmers across these countries over the past year (January-December 2019).

We4Aâ€™s work is aligned to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting SDGs 5, 8 and 10 which focus on Gender Equality, Decent Work for All and Reduced Inequalities.
