Philo’s Biblical Antiquities is a collection of exegetical works written by Philo of Alexandria (c. 20 BC – c. AD 50), a Hellenistic Jewish philosopher and prolific writer. It consists of six books, each devoted to the interpretation of a different biblical book: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, and Joshua. Philo’s exegetical method was based on a literal interpretation of the text combined with allegorical readings. He believed that the biblical stories contained hidden meanings and metaphorical lessons which could be discerned through careful study and interpretation.

Philo’s Biblical Antiquities is an important source for understanding Philo’s worldview and his understanding of the Jewish Scriptures. It provides a glimpse into ancient Jewish exegesis and offers insights into Philo’s religious beliefs and philosophical ideas.

The Legend of the Jews is a collection of Jewish legends about important moments in Jewish history. The book was compiled by Louis Ginzberg and first published in 1909.

The goal of the book is to preserve these ancient Jewish legends for future generations and to teach us about our rich and diverse heritage.
