In a previous post I explained how to write an effective learning objective, so it’s time now to put that into practise by writing the rest of your lesson plan. As with any form of planning, it is always helpful to have some guidance. If you are writing your first lesson plan, then we will show you what a complete lesson plan should include:

- Learning objectives
- Instructions for teacher
- Equipment
- Resources
- Procedure
- Assessment

As well as providing a template that can be used to write your own lesson plans. Once completed, a lesson plan can be used to create a timetable and inform pupils what they are going to learn in the coming weeks or months. It should also enable you to monitor their progress and adapt any lessons accordingly.

### Step 1: Learning objectives

The first stage of writing a lesson plan is to decide exactly what you want your students to achieve by completing the lesson. You could do this by asking yourself some questions:

- What are the aims of this lesson?
- What new skills am I trying to teach them?
- How will they be able to demonstrate these skills?

It is a good idea to break the learning down into small, achievable goals that you can check as the pupils work. These should be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-bound) objectives which can be used to monitor your students’ progress.

### Step 2: Instructions for teacher

The next stage is to decide on any specific instructions you need to give the teacher before they deliver the lesson. These could include:

- Equipment needed (e.g. paper, pens, calculators)
- Resources (e.g. textbooks, worksheets, flashcards)
- Timetable of activities and tasks
- Any potential risks or hazards that need to be considered before the lesson begins

It is also a good idea at this stage to think about any potential differentiation you might need to make for pupils who require additional support. For example, do you have any children in your class who need to work on their basic skills? Do you need to create some extra resources for them so they are not left behind?

### Step 3: Equipment and resources

Once you have decided what equipment and resources you need for the lesson, it is time to prepare them. This could include:

- Printing worksheets or handouts
- Preparing materials such as flashcards, props or puppets
- Gathering any necessary equipment such as pencils, scissors, rulers etc.

### Step 4: Procedure

The fourth stage of writing a lesson plan is to decide on the procedure for delivering the lesson. This should include a timetable of activities and tasks that you want your pupils to complete during the lesson. It is also a good idea to include any instructions you need to give the pupils, such as what they are expected to do during each task and how long they have to complete it.

I’ve had my Alexa Echo Plus for a few weeks now, but I’ve only just figured out how to get it to respond to some of the commands that I want.  I am still a beginner with this technology and so far, I am happy with how well it has worked for me in my home.  I do wish that it could be customized more, but for what I need from it right now it seems like it is working pretty well.

One thing that I love about the Echo Plus is its ability to play music from various sources including Spotify, Amazon Music Unlimited and YouTube.  It can also be connected to other compatible smart devices in my home, such as lights, thermostats, door locks and even security cameras.  This allows me to easily control these devices with just a few simple voice commands.  I have found that the setup process for most of these devices is quite simple and easy to follow.

The Echo Plus also has some cool features like its built-in smart hub which makes it easier for me to connect all my other compatible smart devices together.  It also has Alexa calling which lets you make free voice calls between two Echo devices or your mobile phone number when connected with WiFi or a data connection.

Overall, I think the Amazon Echo Plus is a great device for anyone who wants an easy way to control their home with just their voice.  It works very well and has a wide range of capabilities that can make life much easier for me.
