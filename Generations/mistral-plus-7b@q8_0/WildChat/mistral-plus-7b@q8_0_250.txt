Sayori’s Sister: “Hey, it’s me. I just wanted to let you know that everything’s okay with MC and the baby.”

Sayori: “Thank you for telling me. And I’m sorry about how I reacted earlier. I’ve just been so worried about you guys.”

Sayori’s Sister: “It’s okay, sweetie. We all make mistakes. But it was good to see that you were there for MC when he needed your support the most.”

Sayori: “Yes, he’s a great friend. And I just want him to know that I will always be here for him no matter what happens.”

Sayori’s Sister: “He’s lucky to have such an amazing friend in you. You two really make quite the pair.”
