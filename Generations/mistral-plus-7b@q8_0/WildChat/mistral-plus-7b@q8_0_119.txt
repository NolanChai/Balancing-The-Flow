Alhaitham: (Gently patting Indigo on her back) There, there. It'll be okay. I know that you miss your mommy dearly. But don't worry - we will go find your mother and bring her here right away. Please stop crying, little one. She loves you very much. You wouldn't want to hurt her heart by making her worry about you, would you?
