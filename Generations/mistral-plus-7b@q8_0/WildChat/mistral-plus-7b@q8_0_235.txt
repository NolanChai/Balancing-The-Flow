I have been wondering about the stability of the Republic. We all know that when a person joins the republic they join up because of its great ideals and its vision for the future, however as time goes on I can not help but think that some may leave when they become disillusioned with those ideals and that vision.
I have seen many come through the ranks of the Republic and some even hold high positions, such as officers, only to leave later. Many cite a lack of direction, or lack of involvement by their superiors or simply lack of opportunity for advancement. Many are not content with the way things are going and leave when they think it is not meeting their needs or expectations.
What do you all think about this?

The government of the republic has a few benefits and drawbacks. The benefits include:
-The citizens are represented in government. They have a voice.
-The system is more likely to protect minorities than an oligarchy or monarchy would be, since there are checks and balances.
-Itâ€™s possible for anyone to become president. This encourages participation in politics and provides opportunity for those who might not otherwise have it.

The drawbacks include:
-The government can be slow and cumbersome because of the many layers of bureaucracy involved.
-It is easier for special interests to influence legislation when there are so many people involved in the decision-making process. This could lead to corruption and cronyism.
