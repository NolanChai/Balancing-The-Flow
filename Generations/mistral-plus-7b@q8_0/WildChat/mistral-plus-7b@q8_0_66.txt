Siren Head is a character created by Trevor Henderson that was initially posted on Deviantart.com. Since then, the character has gone viral thanks to its creepy appearance, it's mysterious nature, and the many stories surrounding the monster. The character itself is depicted as a creature with a long neck covered in spikes and feathers, an elongated head that appears to be covered in skin and flesh, and large eyes. It is said to be incredibly tall, potentially reaching up to 10 feet in height or even more, and to make extremely loud sounds when it breathes. It has been the subject of many theories and discussions online, with some believing it to be a real creature that lives in the wilderness, while others believe that it is simply an urban legend created through social media.

I think this is an interesting mix. The creepiness of the backrooms mixed with the chaos of the Starcraft universe. It’s a very interesting world for these guys to have to face. This can go two ways: Either they make it out alive and escape, or they don’t and get absorbed into the backroom dimension.

I think it would be cool if the Terrans are trying to flee the backrooms and they run across a zerg nest, so the zergs follow them into the backrooms. I think that would lead to some interesting confrontations between both groups. The zergs would most likely survive in the backrooms with their mutated abilities while the terrans are just trying to make it out alive.

This can also be a chance for the other races to show up. Maybe Protoss come across a backroom and are able to use their psionic powers to escape, while the Zerg hunt down Terran survivors. I think this would create an interesting dynamic between all three races. With Terrans being the most vulnerable but also being the most adaptable, Zergs are more powerful than either race but have a lack of intelligence, and Protoss being the strongest but being very inflexible when it comes to their strategies.
