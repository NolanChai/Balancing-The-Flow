Hello.

I am new to Basemap. I have been using it for the past few weeks without problems. However, there was a time when I could not use Basemap normally (for example, I could not create a map), so I decided to reinstall the package. After reinstalling, the following error occurs when creating a map.

```
map = Basemap(projection='merc',llcrnrlon=lonmin,llcrnrlat=latmin,urcrnrlon=lonmax,urcrnrlat=latmax,resolution='i')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 58, in <module>
    map = Basemap(projection='merc',llcrnrlon=lonmin,llcrnrlat=latmin,urcrnrlon=lonmax,urcrnrlat=latmax,resolution='i')
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/basemap_pyproj.py", line 542, in __init__
    self.projection = proj()
  File "/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/proj/convention.py", line 836, in __init__
    if len(self._args) > 1: raise TypeError('invalid arguments for projection')
TypeError: invalid arguments for projection
```

It turns out that latitude and longitude are not working at all. I think the problem is with the Basemap itself because it worked before. However, I am having trouble figuring out where the error is coming from. What do you suggest?

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import xarray as xr
from rio_openmree import cloud_top_height as cth
from rio_openmree.riomree import RIOMREE
# from rio_openmree import cloud_top_height as cth

# create a data array of the cloud top heights
cth_arr = np.array([0, 25, 100])
# convert the data array to an xarray Dataset
cth_ds = xr.Dataset({'cloud_top_height': cth_arr})

# open the MRE file containing the satellite imagery and metadata
mree_file = r'/Users/jacobwolfe/Downloads/MRE-0436-130725-26-P92.mre'
with RIOMREE(mree_file) as mree:
    # access the metadata associated with the satellite imagery
    meta = mree.meta

# load the MRE file containing the satellite imagery and cloud top height data
with xr.open_dataset(mree_file, engine='cftime') as mree_ds:
    # plot the cloud top height data using matplotlib
    cth_ds['cloud_top_height'].plot()

I'd like to get some advice on how to put a base map under my geo-referenced images. I have two ways of doing this:
1) Using the 'base' plugin and manually adding georeference points.
2) Adding a raster layer as a background image.

The problem with the first way is that I only get one base layer, not multiple. The problem with the second way is that my base maps have been geo-referenced so if I add them as a raster layer, they will be skewed. For example, if I create a polygon on a georeferenced map and then export it, it will not line up correctly when added to an image.

Is there any way to solve this problem? I'd really like to use the base plugin but it doesn't seem practical for my needs since it only supports one layer at a time. I also want multiple georeferenced images on one page but I don't know how to accomplish this using a raster layer as a background image. Is there any way to add more than one raster layer?

Thanks in advance!
