The Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the densest planet in the Solar System. It is also the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago and, as far as is known, has continuously hosted life since then. Currently, it is inhabited by humans, who live over 7.6 billion people, which are divided into different societies that inhabit many countries.

The planet is also known for its vast oceans, mountain ranges and other geological formations. Its climate varies from region to region due to factors such as altitude, latitude, ocean currents and topography. It has a magnetic field that protects the Earth from cosmic radiation and solar winds, an atmosphere consisting mainly of nitrogen, oxygen and water vapor, and a global hydrological cycle with liquid water on its surface. The planet's biosphere provides resources for life through photosynthesis in plants which convert sunlight into chemical energy.

Over the years Earth has been affected by changes caused by humans, such as climate change, deforestation, pollution and population growth. These problems have become increasingly important to the scientific community in recent decades, leading to international efforts aimed at addressing them through mitigation measures like reducing carbon emissions or preserving natural resources.
