A token is a measure of how much time and effort a bot had to put into understanding your question. There are two types of tokens:

- Compute - Each request to the API, regardless of the outcome, costs one compute token.
- Prompt - Each prompt used in an inference costs one prompt token. You can control this using the max_tokens parameter when you call the API.
