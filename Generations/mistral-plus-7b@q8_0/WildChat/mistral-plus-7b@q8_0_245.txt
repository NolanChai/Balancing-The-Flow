What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that aims to create machines that can perform tasks that would require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and decision-making. AI technology has been increasingly used in various industries, from healthcare to finance, manufacturing, and even marketing.

## Summary

This is how to enable debug logs on Windows in the easiest way possible. It assumes you want a very complete log file with all your plugins, servers and client activity. If you want to be able to see the details of what's going on in Minecraft, this is a good starting point for figuring out where a bug may be coming from.

## Setting Up Logging

The first thing you need to do is create a folder for the log file. This can be anywhere that's easy to get to. I use my desktop but it doesn't matter, wherever you choose to put the file is fine. Create a new folder called "minecraft-logs". Then open Minecraft and start the server as normal.

Now you need to tell the server where your log files will go. To do this, edit the server properties file at minecraft/bin/minecraft_server.properties using any text editor (Notepad++ is good for Windows) and add the following lines:

```
logging-folder=C:\Users\username\Desktop\Minecraft-logs
server-logger-class=net.minecraft.server.logging.Log4jLogger
```

Replace "username" with your actual user name. Save the file and close it. Restart the server and you will now get a very detailed log of what's going on. You can open this file at any time to see what has happened in the last 2 minutes since the server was started. If you want to keep an eye on the logs, you can watch them with Notepad++ as they update live.

## Viewing Your Log Files

To view your log files, open up Notepad++ and select File -> Open from the main menu. Then browse to your Minecraft-logs folder that we created earlier and open any of the log files. You can also use this method to watch the live logging if you leave Notepad++ open and running while playing.

If you want to view a specific period of time in the log file, you can do so by selecting View -> Follow cursor from the main menu and then scrolling through the text. This will highlight any new entries that are added while you're watching them.
