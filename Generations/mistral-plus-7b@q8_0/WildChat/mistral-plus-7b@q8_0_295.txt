Yes, there are a number of devices available that will help you prevent British three pin plugs and adaptors from being used in your car. The device we recommend is called the Smartek. It fits inside the fuse box, so if anybody tries to use a 3-pin UK plug, it shuts down their power supply. This prevents the possibility of an electrical fire or potential electrocution.
