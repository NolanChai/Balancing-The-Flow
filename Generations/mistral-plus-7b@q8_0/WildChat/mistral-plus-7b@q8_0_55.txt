This is just a funny thing I thought about. What would happen if Lilac from Freedom Planet meets Ants? This video shows Lilac being terrified and very tiny in comparison to the ants. And this video was made by me so don’t say anything bad about it or you will get banned for life on my site. Also the audio was taken from a YouTube Video of the Dragon Ball Z opening where Goku transforms into a Super Saiyan. I wanted to use that in this video because if Lilac met ants, then she would be very terrified and run away.

I do not own any of this footage used in this video. All footage used is owned by their respective owners.
