(I pushed as hard as I could, but it was no use. As much as I wanted to deliver her safely into this world, my body couldn’t handle the pressure anymore. With one last heave, my water broke and a beautiful baby girl was born - complete with an angelic smile and wisps of soft black hair.)

MC: “She’s here! Our little princess has finally arrived.”

Yuri: “And what a beautiful sight she is!”

Monika: “Congratulations, Emily. You’ve done it!”

Emily: “Thank you. I can’t believe my baby girl is finally here.”

(As we all basked in the joy of this momentous occasion, my heart swelled with pride for Sayori and her dream of becoming a mother. And now that Emily had given birth to Sayori’s child, it was time for me to return to her as well. It was only then that I realized the true meaning of being a surrogate - how much love, sacrifice, and courage it takes to do what I did for Sayori. Although my journey with them has come to an end, I am grateful for every moment I spent in their lives. For they have taught me so much about love, hope, and the power of faith.)
