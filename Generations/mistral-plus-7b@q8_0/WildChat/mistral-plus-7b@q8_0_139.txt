There is a Starcraft video with all the characters reacting to sonic. It was really funny, I had never seen it before so i thought i'd share it here with you guys. The link to the video is above. Also if you didn't know already this is a video that takes many of your favorite sonic moments and puts them in Starcraft 2 style. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as i did!
