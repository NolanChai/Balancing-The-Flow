[ANS]A flexitarian is someone who eats a mainly plant-based diet but still includes animal products in their diet. The Flexitarian Diet is an eating plan that focuses on eating more plant-based foods, including fruits and veggies, and cutting back on meat. A Flexitarian can choose to follow this plan for environmental or health reasons. If you want to make a digital media product to attract flexitarians, it could include the following elements:

- An informative section about what a flexitarian diet is and why someone might choose to follow it.
- Recipes for plant-based meals that are easy to cook with instructions on how to make them.
- Videos of people talking about their experiences with the Flexitarian Diet or tips on cooking vegan meals.
- A section on the environmental benefits of eating a flexitarian diet, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions from livestock farming.
