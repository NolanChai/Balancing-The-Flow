- Subjective scales are more informal than objective scales, because they can be adjusted depending on the situation. Seismologists use objective scales to rate earthquakes based on their energy released, while individuals might use subjective scales to describe an earthquake based on its severity. Magnitude is measured by using an objective scale called the Richter Scale. The Richter Scale measures the amount of energy released by an earthquake, which can help seismologists determine how damaging it might be. Subjective scales are usually used for assessing the severity of an earthquake based on personal experience. For example, people might use a scale of 1-10 to rate an earthquakeâ€™s intensity or impact on them individually.

SEISMIC SCALE

(1) Richter Magnitude Scale
The first seismic scale to be devised was the Richter magnitude scale (after C. F. Richter). It is based on the amplitude of the largest seismic waves recorded from an earthquake, as compared with a standard reference amplitude for earthquakes of a similar type. The original scale used a base 10 logarithmic scale, so that an increase in 1 unit corresponds to an increase by a factor of 10 in wave amplitude. This scale is still in use today (e.g., the famous San Francisco earthquake of April 18, 1906, had a Richter magnitude of about 7.8). A more recent modification of the original scale uses base-2 logarithms; this scale is known as the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale.
