This is a riddle, and I will help you if you get stuck. It has to do with a common chemical element that has an atomic number of 7. That chemical element is Nitrogen. It consists of three running letters that are turned upside down when the symbol is reflected. If you turn it right side up, it would appear as follows:

N_2

There are two options you could consider:
1) Add an extra layer of padding between the glass and the frame (such as foam board or Styrofoam). If your window already has this, try adding more layers to increase the insulation value. You could also add caulk around the edges of the glass to prevent air from escaping.
2) Replace the glass in your window with double-pane glass. Double-pane windows provide better thermal protection than single-pane windows because they have two panes of glass separated by an air gap, which acts as insulation.

Here's a couple more ideas I had:

1. Make a quest to go back in time and prevent the player character from killing someone by accident or otherwise.
2. Make a quest where the party is being hunted by monsters, which are tracking their scent.
3. Make a quest that involves collecting specific items needed for a ritual, like potions of strength, intelligence, and so on.
4. Make a quest involving rescuing someone from captivity, such as a kidnapping victim or prisoner.

I'll try: You are always the one that has the power to change your life. If there is something you want to do, but aren't doing, ask yourself why. What are you afraid of? Are you scared of failing? Do you lack confidence? Are you afraid of what others might think? Whatever it is, get past those fears and go after what you want. You will never know until you try!
