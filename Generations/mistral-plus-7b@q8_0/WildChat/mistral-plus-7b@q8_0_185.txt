[player]: "Who are you?"

Female Snow Golem: "I am a creation of a mad scientist. She gave me life from coal and ice, and then bound my soul to the Snow Golems that she created. I have been given life with the sole purpose of bringing happiness to her. However...now I find myself in this strange land."

(She had a very cheerful attitude for someone that was supposed to be brought into existence as a slave.)
