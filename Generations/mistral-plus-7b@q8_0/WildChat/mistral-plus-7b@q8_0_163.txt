> The coronavirus pandemic has forced the world’s leading economies to take a closer look at their supply chains. To prevent disruption in future crises, governments are looking for ways to reduce reliance on China for critical products. They have also started reviewing foreign investment laws and scrutinising new deals to protect domestic companies from takeovers by Chinese rivals.

> But efforts to reshore manufacturing and diversify away from China are likely to be limited in scope, according to a survey of more than 250 senior executives across Europe, North America, East Asia and India conducted for The Economist Intelligence Unit by Longitude Research. Two-thirds of the respondents think that supply chains will continue to rely on China as a source for raw materials, components and finished goods.

> Manufacturers have good reason to stay put: China’s low labour costs are hard to beat. Its manufacturing base is already well established, with excellent infrastructure and reliable logistics. Companies operating in China enjoy proximity to their customers in other parts of Asia and lower transport costs than if they were based elsewhere.
>
> For these reasons more than half the respondents expect some relocation of manufacturing capacity from China, but not back to their own countries: instead, they anticipate a shift towards countries such as Vietnam, India and Malaysia. Less than 10% of those surveyed expect manufacturing activity to return to their home country.

> Only about one-fifth of the respondents say that the pandemic has fundamentally changed their perception of China’s role in global supply chains; half say it has accelerated existing trends. And only a third think that the coronavirus will cause companies to bring production back home permanently—although they do expect short-term disruptions.

> Some governments, however, are doing what they can to encourage manufacturing at home. In April President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring all federal government agencies to make efforts to secure domestic supply chains for critical medical supplies, pharmaceuticals and other essential products. The US government has also imposed export controls on personal protective equipment (PPE), with the aim of reducing exports to China.
>
> Europe, too, is keen to reduce its reliance on China. In response to the pandemic, the European Commission has drawn up plans for a “resilience and diversification task force” to encourage investment in production capacity for vital medical products. And several EU countries are reconsidering their foreign-investment laws to block deals that would allow China to acquire stakes in key industries such as telecommunications or energy.

> Such actions are unlikely to have a big impact, though, because of the size and complexity of today’s global supply chains. More often, though, the mechanism is benign. Free markets are simply adapting to find the cheapest way to supply goods to consumers. And in many cases China, with its vast workforce and efficient logistics, remains the cheapest supplier. America’s new rules have the power to redirect its own trade with China. But they cannot rid the entire supply chain of Chinese influence.
