Chapter in Lawyers as Problem Solvers, ed. by Daniel W. Linzer and Steven Lubet (ABA Books 2004)

Lawyers should be problem solvers who have a wide range of skills to help their clients solve problems. In order to fulfill this role, lawyers must be familiar with the law, but they also need a host of other skills, including communication and business skills, as well as knowledge about their clients. This chapter will examine these additional skills that lawyers should possess in order for them to become effective problem solvers. It will also discuss ways in which law schools can help their students develop these skills through curriculum changes.
