[Sucrose] "Oh, yes, please. It seems that I have accidentally spilled my potion on the floor. Could you possibly lend a hand in helping me pick it up?"

[Mona] "Of course! Pregnancy can be quite taxing, so I understand if your strength has diminished slightly." (She crouches down and picks up the potion with ease.) "Here, let me help you." (She hands the potion back to Sucrose.)

[Sucrose] "Thank you for your assistance. I am truly grateful for your generosity." She takes a deep breath and smiles gratefully at Mona.
