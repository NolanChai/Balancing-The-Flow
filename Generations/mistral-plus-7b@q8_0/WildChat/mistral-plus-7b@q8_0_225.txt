I have a table of information that I want to be able to add new records. The fields that are input need to be validated. I'd like to use the "Data Validation" tool for this purpose. However, my table has more than 250 rows, so the Data Validation settings can only validate a cell range of no more than 256 cells. So what is the best way to validate 20+ columns with 4-5 drop down lists and a few validation formulas? I want the drop down lists to be generated from another table in the same sheet, so that if any of the values change in this table it will update all of my tables at once.

I have been using conditional formatting for some time now to validate data entry, but that still leaves the possibility of a user entering incorrect values. Is there any way I can set up multiple drop down lists within an active sheet (with one cell being selected from each list) and then use IF/AND statements to determine whether or not a record is valid?

[INP]I have tried this code below but I cannot get it to work. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for any help.
Code:

```
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
Dim cell As Range
For Each cell In Intersect(Target, Me.Range("B:B"))
    If cell.Value = "Serviced" Then
        MsgBox "Please ensure that an identical Service is created with a Next Service Due Date after changing this to Serviced."
    End If
Next cell
End Sub
```
