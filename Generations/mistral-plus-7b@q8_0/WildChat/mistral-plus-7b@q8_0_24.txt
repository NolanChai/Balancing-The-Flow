Bronny James, the son of NBA star LeBron James, suffered a serious ankle sprain during a basketball game in Los Angeles over the weekend. The 18-year-old high school senior was taken off the court in a wheelchair after suffering what appeared to be a significant ankle injury. He has since been diagnosed with an MCL sprain and is expected to miss up to six weeks of play.

Bronny’s ankle injury is not the first time he has suffered an injury during his basketball career. He previously injured his left foot during a game last year and had to wear a protective boot for several weeks. The injury forced him to miss several games, but he was able to return after rehabbing the injury.

Bronny James is one of the most highly touted high school basketball players in the country. He is expected to play college basketball next year, and is being recruited by some of the best college basketball programs in the country. While Bronny’s ankle injury is a setback, he seems determined to come back stronger than ever.

The best thing about LeBron James’s return to Cleveland is that he can finally stop thinking about it. His last few seasons with the Miami Heat were marked by a series of comments and interviews in which he rehashed his decision, as though he needed to defend his choice at every turn. In 2014, the NBA’s most dominant player was reduced to explaining why he left his hometown team for South Beach; the entire situation cast him as petulant and immature—a far cry from the King of Basketball that we all expected him to become.

Now that James is back in Cleveland, though, it looks like he’s ready to move on. In an interview with Sports Illustrated this week, James said he wants people to stop talking about his decision and start focusing on what he plans to do now that he’s back: win a championship for his hometown fans.

“I think I’ve kind of put all that behind me,” said James when asked about his decision to leave Cleveland in 2010. “It was three years ago, four years ago; it doesn’t make any sense. Now we have the chance to do something special here again, so that’s what I want people to start focusing on.”

James knows that people will continue to bring up his decision to leave Cleveland, but he seems determined not to let it distract him from what matters now: winning championships for the Cavs and bringing a title back home to Ohio. It’s an admirable attitude from someone who has had to endure so much criticism over the past few years.

With James leading the way, Cleveland is once again a force to be reckoned with in the NBA. The team’s young talent—including Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love—should provide plenty of excitement for fans this season as they look ahead towards another run at an NBA title. And hopefully, by focusing on their present instead of their past, everyone involved can finally put that painful memory behind them for good.

Bronny James is the son of NBA legend, LeBron James. He currently attends Sierra Canyon High School in California and plays for their basketball team. Bronny has been playing basketball since he was a kid and has shown great potential on the court. He stands at 6’2” and plays shooting guard with incredible skill and athleticism. With his father’s guidance, Bronny is sure to become an NBA star one day soon.
