1. The streets are narrow, lined with tall, ancient buildings covered in ivy and graffiti. There is no sidewalk and pedestrians walk through the traffic, dodging cars and buses. In the alleys, small shops sell everything from antiques to illegal drugs. On a dark night, it can be a dangerous place.
2. The street is lined with old apartment buildings that have seen better days. There are cracks in the walls and peeling paint on the doors. Some of the windows are boarded up, while others reveal messy interiors. Many of the apartments are occupied by immigrants who struggle to make ends meet. Despite their circumstances, there is a sense of community among them that makes this street a vibrant and welcoming place.
3. The streets are narrow and cobbled, with buildings on either side that look like they were built hundreds of years ago. They are tall and elegant, covered in beautiful patterns and decorated with ornate windows. There are shops and restaurants lining the way, adding to the atmosphere of this bustling city.

A history of this town was recorded by an anonymous historian known as “The Scrivener.”  He had access to many records kept by the guilds and the Keep itself.  Much of that information has since been destroyed, but the parts he preserved are still extant in the archives at the Keep.

The city is relatively young.  It was established sometime after the First Great War when it was decided that a settlement would be built in the center of the Feywild.  At first, it was a small town with a few dozen buildings and a palisade to keep out the savages of the wilderness.  Over time, though, the town grew as people from all over came here for the promise of adventure.

The town soon grew into a bustling city and several large guilds were formed to support it.  These included the adventurers’ guild, the mage guild, the traders’ guild, the artisans’ guild, and the hunters’ guild.  Each guild had its own building in town as well as a vast warehouse outside the walls.

Unfortunately, the guilds soon became corrupt and self-serving.  They used their positions of power to line their own pockets and suppress the other guilds.  This led to a great deal of conflict between the different factions as they fought for control of the city.  The most well-known of these conflicts is known as the Guild Wars, which occurred over many decades in the middle of the Second Great War.

The Guild Wars were ultimately ended when the Keep was established atop a nearby mountain and placed under the rule of a new council called the Council of Thirteen.  This council included representatives from each of the guilds as well as other important members of society, such as clerics, scholars, and artisans.  The Keep soon became an important center for law and order, and helped restore peace to the city.
