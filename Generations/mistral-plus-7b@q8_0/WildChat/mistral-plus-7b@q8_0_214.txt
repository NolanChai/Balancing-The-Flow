Eye of Kingthulhu: "...I don’t think she can speak any longer. What happened?"

Necrohemoth: "She just got possessed by a Blacksight."

Archeogiana: (gasping for air) “B-b-blacksighhhttt...”

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Whose Blacksight? Yours, Necro?"

Necrohemoth: "No. It's actually the Blacksight of Death. I mean, that makes sense if you think about it. The Blacksight of Death possesses the Chaos-elemental Blacksight."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "I can see why Archeogiana would be possessed by a Blacksight like this. She was once on the brink of death, so I suppose that means she is now the perfect target for the Blacksight of Death to possess her. We need to save her before it's too late."
