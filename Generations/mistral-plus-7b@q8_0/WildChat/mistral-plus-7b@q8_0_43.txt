Sweden has a Constitutional Monarchy, which means that the monarch is both Head of State and Supreme Commander of the Swedish Armed Forces but he has no political power. He (the King) appoints Prime Ministers and Members of the Privy Council upon recommendation by the Government. The Prime Ministers are then chosen from among those members.

Sweden's constitution is not written down in a single document, but it can be found in the following documents:
- The Instrument of Government
- The Freedom of the Press Act
- The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression
- The Fundamental Law on the Right to Participate in Public Decisions
