Here it is:
Respectful Men
Driving down the street, I see someone beating on a guy in front of a bar. I pull over and get out of my car to stop this fight, when the other guy turns around and sees me. He is wearing an orange and black jacket with gang colors. He looks at me like I am a threat to him.
I slowly walk up to them and stop next to one of the guys in the fight. The guy that was getting beat on sees me and thanks me for stopping the fight. He says he would have been dead if I had not stopped it when I did. I look at the other guy who is still staring at me, ready to fight.
I know that the guy who was getting beaten on has a little bit of money in his pocket, so I tell him to give it to me so he can live and walk away safely. He does as I say and runs off. The gang member starts walking towards me slowly, ready for a fight. I pull out my gun and point at his face, telling him that if he makes one move, I will shoot him right there. He stops moving and looks at the ground, scared of what I could do to him. He is ready to back down and leave.
As he starts walking away, I decide to tell the bartender to call the police so they can get this guy out of my city. The cops arrive just as we are about to leave. They arrest the gang member and take him in for assault and robbery.
