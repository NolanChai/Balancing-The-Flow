time. His head was heavy as his thoughts were endless. He couldn’t think for more than 30 seconds without getting distracted by the constant influx of information that he had to process. He felt like a computer in an office building, always waiting for the next task to be sent down. The next assignment. The next project. Always on call, but never truly working. It was maddening at times. But there were moments when he felt like everything was going to work out. That all his hard work would pay off. Those moments were rare though. Like diamonds in the rough that he had to go out of his way to find. He knew that he wasn’t destined for a life of mediocrity. He was meant for more than this. More than what society told him was acceptable and normal. He wanted greatness. And he would do whatever it took to get there. He wasn’t afraid of the challenges that lay ahead. They were merely speed bumps in his journey. Obstacles that he knew he could overcome with determination and perseverance. He had a clear vision for his future, one that involved him being wildly successful, respected by many, and admired by those who knew him best. With each passing day, he was one step closer to achieving that dream.
