eless tundra of snow and ice. The west coast was even worse. It had become a desert, with no water for miles. Fires raged there, as the forests dried out and caught on fire. California was little more than a pile of ash now- not even a shadow of its former self.
 
 The southern states suffered from floods as storm after storm brought torrents of rain down upon them, submerging most cities. What had once been beautiful cities became drowning pits of mud and filth. In the north, flooding was less common but it still occurred; parts of Canada were underwater now.
 
 The north-east was hit hard by storms that brought snow, rain, and ice. There would be blizzards for weeks on end, as winter raged on into spring. Power lines froze and snapped in half. Trees became covered in a thick layer of ice and shattered into pieces when their weight became too much to bear.
 
 The Midwest was the hardest hit area in America. It was ravaged by storms that brought hail, rain, snow, wind, and lightning. Floods ravaged the region as rivers overflowed their banks and submerged homes. Storms created a lake where once there had been only fields of wheat or corn. Tornadoes wreaked havoc across the region; one especially powerful tornado ripped through Kansas City and leveled almost half of it in moments.
 
 The Great Lakes were completely frozen over due to extreme cold temperatures caused by climate change which meant they could not be used for shipping any longer. This caused an economic downturn throughout the entire region as many businesses relied on shipping goods across these waters but now had no means of doing so anymore.
 
 It has been almost a decade since those disasters hit America and still people are struggling to recover from them today due mostly because of how quickly they came upon us without warning or preparation time available for most people living in affected areas at that time
