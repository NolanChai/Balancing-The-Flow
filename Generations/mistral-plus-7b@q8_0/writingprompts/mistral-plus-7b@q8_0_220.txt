. We were blind to being forced to live as animals and to be treated like slaves. They did this so that we could serve them for centuries on end without knowing what they were doing to us, or why they were doing it to us. They would beat us when we were in school, and when we got out of school they would force us to work for them without any payment. They didn’t want us to be educated so that we could see the truth about what was happening to us.
They made sure that the law was on their side. We were not allowed to speak our minds, or even to fight back against those who were hurting us and oppressing us. They had all of the power, while we had none. They controlled everything, from our laws to our lives, and there was nothing we could do about it. We were powerless and hopeless, just pawns in their game of control.
It took centuries before we were finally able to stand up for ourselves and fight back against the oppression that had been placed upon us for so long. It wasn’t easy, but with strength and determination we were finally able to gain our freedom and live as equals under the law.
