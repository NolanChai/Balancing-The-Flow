The clanging of my metal boots as I walked down the long corridor echoed in the empty halls, sending a chill up my spine. This ship was getting to me. The days were endless, we worked non-stop, with very little time for ourselves. We had been sent out here to recover some data from the asteroid field next to us. A research team had sent us information that there was something of great value in those rocks. After months of searching, it seemed they had found nothing but trouble. The other day two crew members had gone missing during one of our expeditions into the asteroids and i’m afraid the worse for them both. We were all quite scared after that.

I continued my way along the corridor until i came to the airlock door, it was time for me to go out and do a maintenance check on some equipment outside. It didn’t take long before I reached my destination. My helmet was in place and all systems were ready. I opened the hatch to the vacuum of space. The stars were bright above me as I worked on the machinery, everything seemed so peaceful out here. I took a moment to appreciate this small slice of beauty that I had found among the chaos of my life aboard *Stars Bounty*. I didn’t want it to end soon but I knew I needed to get back inside before something went wrong.

As I closed the hatch behind me, I looked out at the stars one last time before returning inside.
