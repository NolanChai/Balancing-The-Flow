waters to cinders, their arrows shot in anger. They knew no fear in battle, they were a people united by war and blood. Their only purpose was to destroy. But even the greatest of warriors can fall.  They would not leave without one last fight. They would prove to the gods that they would not be conquered.
    “You are nothing but a coward.” said the Trojan Prince, Hector. He stood before Apollo himself, shield raised as if ready to charge into battle. The god’s face was pale and shrouded in an eerie mist as he stepped forth. The two warriors looked at each other for what felt like an eternity. Apollo held his bow with such grace it seemed the arrow would not fly when released.  Hector was ready to meet his end, but his eyes burned with a fire that could melt stone.
   “You cannot defeat me, you weakling.” He sneered as he drew his sword. The Trojan prince moved so quickly the god had no time to react before the blade pierced him in the chest. Apollo fell back, blood gushing from the wound. Hector rushed over and drew out his spear with all of his strength.  The god’s body collapsed to the ground as the sun shone down upon them.
    As Apollo lay dying he whispered one last thing to him. “You will pay for your treachery.” He said before breathing his last breath. Hector stared in horror at the body of the once mighty god, knowing what was about to happen. The Trojan prince had heard the stories and knew what would become of those who slayed a god. They say that those who kill one are cursed forever with pain and suffering. And so he knew his fate had been sealed, but he would not go down without a fight. He raised his sword to the sky and shouted at the gods in defiance.
“I am Hector of Troy!”  He roared as he charged forward with his spear in hand. But he did not make it far before a bolt of lightning struck him down, taking his life with it. His body was left on the battlefield, his soul trapped within it until the day came for them both to be reunited in death.
