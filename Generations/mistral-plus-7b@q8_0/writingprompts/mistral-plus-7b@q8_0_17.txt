istfully in the breeze coming through my window, and saw that the sunlight had just begun to stream through my apartment window.

As if on cue, my clock started beeping at me. It was 11:30 a.m., and I was still in bed! In college, I prided myself for being one of those students who could get out of bed early and make it to class on time. But now that I graduated, the mornings were not so easy anymore. The alarm had to be set three times before I would finally stumble into the kitchen to make breakfast, and by then, it was usually close to noon.

I'm sure you can relate to this struggle of mine. As an adult, there are a lot of different factors that keep us from wanting to get up in the morning: job stress, personal commitments, family responsibilities, the weather and much more. But no matter how tired we may feel, there are some simple things we can do every morning to help our mornings start on the right foot.
