that much already. As a middle aged businessman and self proclaimed mob boss, his reputation for getting things done had reached all corners of the city. When things needed to be done properly. Carson was your man. The warehouse he now stood in front of was owned by one of the city's most influential families - the Garcias. He'd been called here by Mr Garcia himself after his son had gotten out of line and caused some trouble for his father's business dealings. Not only did this boy need a good talking to, but he also needed to be taught a lesson in how things worked around here. Carson lit another cigarette and took a long drag. It was going to be fun.
