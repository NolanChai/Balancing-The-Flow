a series of air-driven pipes is just astounding. It's not surprising that some people equate pipe organs with churches - the two are pretty inextricable from one another. So, when I heard about a Pipe Organ for sale in Michigan, I had to check it out!

This particular organ was once a part of First Baptist Church in Eagle Harbor. It's been moved and now resides in Lansing at the old First Congregational Church sanctuary. According to church members, it is estimated that this pipe organ was built somewhere between 1872 and 1905 by a company in Boston.

The organ itself has recently been completely dismantled, cleaned, and restored by J&A Organ Builders from South Bend, Indiana. Now, the organ is available for sale through an auction that will be held on November 4th at First Congregational Church in Lansing.

This organ is very unique and one of a kind! It features a variety of beautiful pipes and is sure to add elegance and class to any space it is installed in. The asking price for this pipe organ is $60,000 - but the value is truly priceless! If you're interested in purchasing this pipe organ or simply want to learn more about it, please contact J&A Organ Builders at (269) 464-8470.
