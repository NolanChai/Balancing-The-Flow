iht casts a glow across the lake. It is beautiful. I stare at the water and listen to the gentle lapping of the waves on the shore. I take a deep breath. The crispness of morning air fills my lungs, and I smile as the sun breaks through the clouds.
 
 I have come to this place to see you. I am tired of being alone. I am ready to try again. We will not talk about our pasts. We will move on. We will start fresh. You are here for me, just as I am here for you. I am taking the risk and reaching out to you, but there is a part of me that doesn’t want to take that chance. There is a part of me that fears that maybe you won’t love me back. But I don’t have much left to lose.
 
 So here I am, standing at the edge of the water, looking into your eyes. The sun seems to be shining for us alone.
