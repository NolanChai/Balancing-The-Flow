I ran as fast as I could, trying to get past people that were panicking and running in all different directions. Just as I passed by Mr. Davis’s classroom, the fire alarm went off again, this time sounding much louder and more desperate than before. The smoke was getting thicker and thicker with each passing second.

I saw someone come out of the classroom holding their hands over their face to protect them from the smoke. I took a deep breath in an attempt to keep my lungs clear as I helped him away from the burning building. It was then that I realized how dangerous this situation could become if we didn’t get everyone out quickly and safely.
