in orbit over the planet in question and can see it for the first time.

That is how it must have been when they came down to Earth.

I’d like to believe that first landing was a peaceful one. There were no warships or battle cruisers dropping from orbit. No massive, powerful shields. Just a small craft that touched down near what we now call Area 51. The craft wasn’t big enough to house the aliens within. They simply exited their ship and walked along the surface of our world for the first time.

They must have been in awe of our planet. It is quite beautiful, after all. I can only imagine what it would be like to see Earth for the first time from that far away. It must have been breathtaking. I can’t help but wonder how they felt when they landed and walked around. Did they feel the same sense of awe that we do? Were they afraid?

We’ve done such a good job at covering up their existence, it seems unlikely we will ever know the truth. We have created so many conspiracy theories surrounding UFOs that it is now impossible to separate fact from fiction. But I like to think about what might have happened on that fateful day when they first came here and made contact with us. It’s one of my favorite Sci-fi scenarios!
