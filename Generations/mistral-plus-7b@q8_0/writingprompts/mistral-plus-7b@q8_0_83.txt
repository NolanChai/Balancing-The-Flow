in the back seat with me, John's gonna be driving shotgun, we need him to keep his eyes peeled for cops.
 
 Next up is a little more complicated, but I'm sure you've got it covered. 
 
 We're going to take the train. 
 
 The thing about this plan is that it needs to be quick and quiet. 
 
 So Paul, we need you to go ahead and distract those guards with your fake bomb, keep them occupied while John hops on board the train with me. We need to get into the conductor's cabin and shut down the main breakers so that the train can come to a stop. Once the train is stopped and safe, we're gonna need to cut the power completely for those guards to stop following us. 
 
 This one needs to be done with precision, but I know you guys can get it done!
