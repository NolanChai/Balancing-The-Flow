in that they couldn't continue their work of suffering. Now the question is why would they do this?
I think because they believe that the more pain a human can take the greater its strength. So they made them suffer and in the end it was useless. The people who were tortured were not strong, but weakened by the torture. Then came the enlightenment when some idiots realized that with mental strength you could be stronger then any human. And so they began their experiments on mental pain. They used different methods like hypnosis and brainwashing to cause mental pain, and it worked.
The people who were subjected to these forms of torture became strong. But in order for them to remain strong they had to be constantly tortured with mental pain. And so the cycle continued.
