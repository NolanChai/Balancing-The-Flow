reading lightly is key in this case.

``I don't know,'' he says hesitantly, ``Are you really into girls? I mean, do you actually like them or are you just curious?''

His voice has a soft, almost soothing tone, and his pale blue eyes have an innocent quality that makes my heart pound. I swallow nervously, but keep my composure. It takes everything in me to look at him without drooling.

``I like girls, very much,'' I assure him, ``but I am curious about guys.'' He smiles and nods.

``You're pretty attractive, so I can see why you'd want to experiment,'' he tells me with a flirtatious grin, ``If you want to give it a try, I won't judge.'' I take a deep breath and reach out my hand, holding it in front of his face. He takes it and slowly brings it to his lips, planting a kiss on the back of my hand. The soft touch is a lot more sensual than I expected it would be.

``What about your friend?'' he asks me as his fingers lace through mine, ``Does she know about your fantasies?'' I nod, pulling him closer to me until our bodies are touching. He smiles and continues, ``I think she could be a perfect fit for this little adventure of yours.''

I close my eyes and breathe deeply, savoring the feeling of his hand in mine. ``Do you think so? She is gorgeous; she would definitely make a perfect pair with you.''

He laughs and runs his fingers through my hair. ``Yes, I can see that,'' he agrees, ``She has such an innocence about her that would be perfect for something like this. And you're right, we would make the perfect threesome.''
