she had a boyfriend and she was way out of my league anyway. It's not fair that I should be in love with someone who will never love me back.

She caught me staring again. She turned towards me and smiled. Her teeth were bright white and her lips pink. She winked and then walked away. My heart stopped for a moment. I couldn't believe it, she was actually flirting with me! What was she thinking? We barely even knew each other. But as she walked away I felt my heart pounding in my chest. I wanted to call out to her, to ask her why she was so kind to someone like me. But I couldn't find the courage to do it. So instead I just stood there and watched her go, knowing that our love would never be more than a one-sided crush.
