were, a group of five year olds lined up by our age in the classroom, and they handed out the animals to us in order. I got the donkey.

I brought the toy home that evening. My mother noticed it and asked me how I liked it. I said I loved it. She then explained that donkeys were not a good choice for pets because they smell terrible, they kick when you go near them, and they are stubborn and difficult to train. I put down the toy and never asked for another one like it again.

As an adult, I’ve had to deal with donkey-like behavior in my co-workers. Some people just have a natural tendency to be stubborn and difficult. They resist change and are resistant to anything new. You might call them “old school,” or “traditional.” Or you can just call them a pain in the ass. I’ve worked with more than one person who is so stubborn that they refuse to accept any new information or opinions.

These people tend to be very set in their ways. They’re not interested in learning anything new, and they’re not open to changing their minds about anything. They’re also very opinionated and never hesitate to share their thoughts, even if they’re unpopular or controversial. In my experience, it can be difficult to work with someone who is so stubborn and set in their ways.

They can be resistant to change, difficult to convince of new ideas, and challenging to manage. But they can also be incredibly determined and hardworking once you get them on board. The key is to find a way to work together that allows you both to be respectful and understanding of each other’s opinions and perspectives.
