ale Rider, his dark features seeming to suck in the light from above while the moon shimmering like a silver crown upon his head reflected off of his steely armor and his steed. Together they stood against the fading twilight, waiting for the ancient forces of darkness to arise once more from their slumber.

The land around them was not as it had been at the time of the great battle which saw the mighty hero and the knights of Avalon defeat the dark hordes of evil which swept through this land like a flood of hellfire. The trees, which had stood tall and proud throughout the centuries were now scorched black, the green leaves burned away leaving only charred skeletons to mark the presence of those who had once lived and died there. The ground itself was scarred and pockmarked with great rents in its surface that stretched down into the depths below like the open mouths of a great beast waiting to swallow anything foolish enough to fall within their embrace.

The mighty warrior stood atop one such rent, gazing out over the blasted landscape before him. In his hand was an ancient weapon of power, a sword forged from the stars themselves by the hands of the Gods. Its blade shone like a beacon in the darkness as it reflected what little light remained in the sky. The warrior felt an uneasy sense of dread creep up within him as he realized that this land had been changed forever due to the great battle which had occurred here so long ago.

He could almost feel the echoes of death still lingering in this place, almost as if they were reaching out from beyond the veil of time itself and trying to pull him back with them into their realm of darkness. But despite that ominous feeling, he knew that it was his duty to stand here in this desolate place and defend what little remains of hope and light against any who would dare try to plunge this world back into the depths of shadow once again. For only through facing down evil with courage and determination can we ensure that the future will always be brighter than our past.
