ies and storms brutal. Yet for all that the land around him lay devastated and barren of life there were still men standing across from him. Some had even made it back onto their feet. They looked at him now with a mixture of fear and hope in their eyes, unsure what would become of them. The man who stood before them was an enigma to say the least. He didn’t look like the kind of man that anyone should fear but his reputation preceded him as much as any man or beast alive.

The ground shook slightly as he stepped forward to meet them, a gust of wind accompanying every step. They all knew him by name and most of them knew why they had been brought here. He was the God-King, leader of all gods and men alike and they were here because he had sent for them. The silence was palpable as they waited to see what he would do with them now that it was over. Some of them looked at one another in fear, others in awe, some even still hoping to survive this ordeal somehow. A few of them knew better than hope and began praying for mercy as soon as they realized their fate. The God-King had not always been known for his mercy, but these were his own followers after all. They had once followed him without question before betraying him in the end. It was a mistake he would forgive them for this time but he knew they would pay for it later on.

He stood before them now, tall and powerful with an unwavering gaze that seemed to cut right through them all at once. The wind still whipped around his cloak as if trying to push him back but even with its strength could not move him one bit from his spot before them. His eyes were piercing green and looked out over the crowd with a hint of compassion in them despite the fierce expression on his face. He spoke softly at first then let loose an angry roar that echoed off into the distance as he announced their fate: “You will all pay for your betrayal! For your weakness and cowardice!” His eyes flashed with anger once more before he turned away from them to begin walking back towards his camp. It was done, his revenge was complete. He had taken what was rightfully his and now it would be up to his followers to keep it safe for him. The rest of them could go back home if they wanted to or continue to serve their new master as they saw fit. Either way, he knew that this day would not soon be forgotten by any of them.
