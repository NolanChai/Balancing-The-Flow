ulling in my life without the best weaponry I could get my hands on.

The Outsiders came to our land for blood. They took everything we had from us and left us with nothing. What they didnâ€™t realize was that we were strong, and we would survive their conquest. We would rise up again and take back what was ours. For it is not in my nature to lie down when I am beaten, to give up when all seems lost. It is in my nature to fight for every last inch of land that rightfully belongs to me. And if they tried to take even the smallest piece of it, then I would do battle with them until I took everything back.
