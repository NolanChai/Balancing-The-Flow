ky from lack of use and his eyes strained as he took in his surroundings.

He was in a small metal room, just large enough for the bed where he lay and a small table to one side that contained a single glass of water. The door opened and two men entered dressed in white lab coats with matching masks covering their faces. Christopher had seen them before when they were preparing to place him in cryogenic stasis. One of the men held a tablet out, which he touched to wake up his own personal assistant.

"Good morning," said the voice of the AI as a hologram formed above the tablet. "It has been eight months since you departed from Earth and I would like to take this time to give you an update on your journey." The holographic image paused as it activated the large screen on the wall, which showed a map of space.

"The Voyager probe left our solar system in 1977," said the AI, "and we have just surpassed its distance from Earth. Our ship, Magellanus, is traveling at an incredibly high velocity and has already reached half the speed of light. It is expected that you will reach your destination within the next ten years."

Christopher nodded as he listened to the update. He was eagerly anticipating his arrival in Alpha Centauri system, where he would be the first human explorer to set foot on a planet outside of our solar system. It was an exciting time for space exploration and Christopher felt incredibly fortunate to be a part of it.

"What is the current status of the ship?" asked Christopher as he sat up in his bed.

"The Magellanus is traveling smoothly," said the AI. "All systems are functioning properly and there have been no major problems during our journey so far. We have also had no encounters with any other alien life forms."

Christopher smiled at this news, feeling reassured that all was well aboard their spacecraft. He couldn't wait to land on an exoplanet and begin his exploration of a new world.
