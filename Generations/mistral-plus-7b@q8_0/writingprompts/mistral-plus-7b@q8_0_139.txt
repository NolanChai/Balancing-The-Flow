leaving her eyes glowing like cat’s eyes in the dark.

The beam sweeps over the floor and walls of the small room. The walls are rough concrete with rusty metal studs that were once used as shelves. They ’ve been piled on top of each other so that they form a barrier, making the bunker seem more like a closet than anything else. The walls have holes where the shelves used to be and there is some damage near the top. A small amount of dust coats the floor and there are a few spider webs hanging from the ceiling. Nothing out of the ordinary so far.

Jen moves further into the bunker, shining her flashlight in every direction. The beam cuts through the darkness as she moves deeper into the space. There is no furniture or equipment on the floor, just dust and a few dead bugs. The walls are the same, but there are cracks running along the bottom of them.

Jen continues her inspection, moving slowly from one corner to another. She notices a few more spider webs hanging down from the ceiling and shivers when she sees a rat run across the floor. She turns her attention back to the walls, noticing that there are some areas where they look like they ’re crumbling.

She takes a step closer, shining her flashlight on the wall. It appears as if the concrete is cracking and falling off in places. The dust seems thicker here, and she can smell something musty. Jen pulls out her cell phone, turning on the camera to document what she ’s seeing. She takes several pictures of the wall before making her way back towards the door.

As she gets closer, she sees a pile of papers lying on the floor near the entrance. Curious, she picks them up and looks at the top sheet of paper. It turns out to be an old map of the bunker. Jen studies it carefully, noticing that the area where she is standing is labeled as “ Equipment Storage ” with some arrow symbols pointing towards different sections. She follows one of the arrows on the map and walks through the door into a storage room.

The shelves in this room are still intact and covered in dust. There are various pieces of equipment stored here, from tools to rations. Jen inspects each shelf carefully, reading labels and trying to get an idea of what everything is. She spots some water jugs, canned goods, medical supplies, and even some firearms. After exploring the storage room, she turns back towards the door and decides it ’s time for her to leave.
