ing. But today, while traveling across the desert, I was transported into a huge nest of vipers. When I emerged from the teleportation chamber I saw that I had been teleported in front of 250 snakes, all with their mouths open and ready to strike. Needless to say this scared me, but not nearly as much as the fact that I was completely helpless. There is no way that I can fight off that many vipers, they would eat me alive before I even got through half of them. So now I am here, surrounded by deadly poisonous snakes that are slowly killing me. My hope is that someone will find these words and come rescue me from this horrible fate.
