wards when he got home and could take his time enjoying it.

He went downstairs, found the break room with a group of coworkers already there chatting and eating, but instead of joining them, Jack picked up his plate of food, said a quick hello, and headed back upstairs to his desk.

The other workers gave him curious looks, but he just ignored them, got into the groove of chewing his meal while typing out some code on his laptop screen. He made it through almost half of the dinner before he heard someone call his name. Jack turned around to see one of the coworkers that was still in the break room.

"Jack!" said the woman, coming towards him. "I just wanted to say how impressed I am with your dedication! So many people eat here, and you're the only one I've seen bring food up with them. You must really love what you do!"

Jack smiled at her. "Yes, programming is something that I have a real passion for," he said. "It keeps me going every day, knowing that my work helps to make life just a little bit easier for people. There's nothing like that feeling of accomplishment when a project comes together."
