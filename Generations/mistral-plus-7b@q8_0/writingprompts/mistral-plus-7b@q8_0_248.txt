had been a sleepy little village for as long as anyone could remember. The kind of place where people went to retire and live out the rest of their lives in peace and quiet. The only industry to be found here was the local sawmill and its workers were about as industrious as a bunch of drunks. The town had not seen much action for at least twenty years, and most likely would never again.

 So when Greg decided to move there and open his own repair shop, he knew it wasn't going to be easy. It was hard enough just getting people to notice the place existed. Not that there was a great deal of competition. The other two local shops were small, run down and not likely to last much longer than another year or so. They certainly weren't going to be any threat to his new business.
 No, it was more the people of Carrelhold who were causing him problems. Most of them had never seen an electronics store before. They knew nothing about computers or television or DVD players. When they needed something repaired or even just bought they usually went down to one of the local mom and pop hardware stores in town. These shops were run by people that had been doing it for years. They didn't like outsiders coming in and trying to take their business away from them.
Greg knew this but he was determined to make his shop work. He was a good mechanic, with years of experience behind him. He was friendly and helpful and always tried to do the best job possible. But no matter how hard he worked, it seemed like there just weren't enough people in Carrelhold that wanted or needed what he had to offer.
It wasn't until one day, a few months after opening his shop, that things finally started to pick up. A couple of the local kids came in with their broken Gameboys. They were so happy when they saw them working again and they told all their friends about Greg's amazing repair skills. Word spread quickly and soon people from all over town began bringing their electronics to be fixed. Business was finally starting to boom!
