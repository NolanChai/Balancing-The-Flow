 Animals no longer knew fear. They hunted and killed with a fury that could only be described as madness.  But this madness had purpose and intent, for the first time in their lives.
 
 They were unified. They had found the one thing they lacked and needed above all others to survive: community. They knew what was good, and what was bad. They had a common goal and a desire to see it through to the very end.
 
 There was nothing left to do but live or die, and those who lived did so with purpose. Those who died were not mourned but honored for their sacrifice, because in that moment they had finally found peace in their deaths as well.
