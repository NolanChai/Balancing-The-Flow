uuuut it was depressing and time consuming -- so I ended up doing what a lot of us do: I gave up. I still want that special someone in my life. I'm just tired of trying. And I know I am not alone.

So the next thing to try is something called The League. It is an elite dating app, but what does that even mean? Well, it means that you have to apply for entrance into the exclusive club of people on this app (though it's open to everyone). You have to connect your LinkedIn profile and Facebook account for verification, and then the application process begins. Basically, The League wants to make sure you are who you say you are and that you have a stable job and an actual life outside of being a Tinder addict. It will also cross reference your education and what industry you work in so you can meet like-minded people. Once accepted into the club, you'll then need to wait until they match you up with someone.

It's all very fancy and exclusive, but is it worth it? Is this a dating app that you should try? Or is it just another way to waste your time and money? Here are some pros and cons:

PROS
1. It is actually pretty legit. The League has a strict vetting process and has the potential for serious daters only, unlike Tinder, which attracts everyone from single moms to dudes who think catfish is a fish that can be cooked in olive oil. So if you are looking for more than a hookup, The League may be for you.
2. It doesn't just match you with anyone. In fact, the app actually asks you specific questions about what kind of person you want to meet (ex. How tall? What education level? What industry?) and then matches you based on those answers. It also will let you know if the person you are looking at is interested in you as well.
3. It's fun, but not distracting. The app only shows you five potential mates each day, which means there isn't the pressure to constantly swipe like with Tinder. This allows you to take your time and really get to know someone before you meet them. You can even connect through the app if you want to chat or text first before you decide to actually meet up IRL.
4. There is no pressure. With The League, there are no rules or restrictions. It's a dating app that allows for a relaxed approach -- it doesn't pressure you into going on a date right away like some other apps do. So if you want to take things slow or just enjoy the conversation without feeling obligated to meet in person right away, The League is perfect for you!
5. You can use it anywhere. Unlike Tinder, which only works in certain countries and cities around the world, The League works wherever you are -- even if that means traveling internationally! So no matter where you go, chances are someone from The League will be nearby too. This makes dating abroad much easier because instead of trying to meet people randomly at bars or clubs while traveling alone, now there is an app specifically designed for meeting locals and travelers alike anywhere in the world.
6. It's simple but effective! The user interface on The League is incredibly simple but also effective -- all interactions happen within one single page which makes it easy for users to navigate through without getting overwhelmed or lost along the way like many other dating apps tend to do. Plus, since there are only five potential matches available at any given time on The League (unlike Tinder's endless stream of potential dates), it helps keep things manageable while still allowing plenty of opportunities for finding someone special!
