ain, no Imaginary Drowning or Disappointment, only a simple question: Could we live here?

We had been driving north on Highway 101 from San Luis Obispo County, through the central coast of California , when I finally asked him to pull over at a lookout. We stepped out to take in a stunning view of the rugged and rocky California Coastline and to stretch our legs after hours of driving . The wind had picked up and tossed my hair about, but I was mesmerized by what lay before me. I could smell the salt in the air and hear the waves crash against the rocks below. There is something so beautiful about the ocean; it seems to pull at my soul like a magnet. We stood there together for a while in silence and I remember thinking: This is exactly where I want to be.

Soon, we were on our way again, driving along the coast with the windows down and the stereo up. My heart was full of joy and my mind was filled with possibilities. For the first time in years I felt truly alive – like there was something more out there for me to explore, something that would make my life feel complete. As we drove through the rolling hills and dense forests, I couldn’t help but think about what it would be like to live here. The thought of living so close to nature, being able to wake up each morning with a breathtaking view of the ocean, it seemed almost too good to be true. It was an exciting prospect; one that gave me a feeling of hope and promise for the future.
