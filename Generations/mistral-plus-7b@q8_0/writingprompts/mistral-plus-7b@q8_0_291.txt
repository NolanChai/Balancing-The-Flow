turned out to be a young girl with a lantern in her hand. She had on a white dress that looked old but not tattered or worn. Her hair was long and silky brown, tied back with a blue ribbon. Her eyes were blue and clear, like they could see right through me. `` Who are you? What are you doing out here? It is very late. You should be in bed.`` `I am the Fairy of the Moonlight Woods. I am a protector of these woods and the creatures who live there.` Her eyes glittered as she spoke. `Why have you come to this part of the forest at such an ungodly hour? Are you lost? Are you in trouble?` `` I just got here. I was traveling from one town to another, but I am lost now. My horse ran off.`` The fairy frowned. She took my hand and led me into the woods. `` Follow me. We will find your horse. He is very smart and strong, he cannot have gotten far.` `I don't know how I can thank you for helping me.`` `You do not need to thank me, young traveler. It is what I am here for, to help those in need. It is my job to protect the woods and its inhabitants, including yourself.` She smiled at me then. Her face was beautiful, with high cheekbones and a delicate nose. `` Now, let us find your horse. He will be glad to see you again!`` With that we began walking deeper into the woods. The Fairy of Moonlight Woods led the way, her lantern lighting our path through the dark trees. I followed her closely, feeling safe with her there by my side. We walked for what seemed like hours, but eventually we heard a loud neighing from up ahead. The fairy smiled and said, `` There he is! Your horse has not gotten far at all. Come, let us go to him.`` We hurried over to the spot where the horse was standing. He had been startled by our approach, but when he saw the fairy and me he calmed down quickly. The Fairy of Moonlight Woods patted his nose and whispered in his ear. `` It is okay, young one, they are your friends.`` The horse nickered softly and put his head down to let us pet him. We stayed with him for a few moments before leading him back out of the woods. As we made our way through the dark trees I felt a sense of peace and calmness that I had never felt before. It was as if the Fairy of Moonlight Woods had cast a spell over me, making everything around me seem perfect and beautiful. Even after we left the forest, I still felt her presence with me. She had truly helped me in my time of need and for that I will always be grateful to her.
