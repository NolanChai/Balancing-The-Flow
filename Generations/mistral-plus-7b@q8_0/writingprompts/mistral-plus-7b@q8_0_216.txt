fact that angered him tremendously. Not only were the chains strong enough to hold a man like himself, but they also held his legendary fist captive. It was a feat he couldn’t even imagine pulling off.

 The room in which he stood was cold and dark. He could see his breath steaming as it came out of his mouth. His face was pale and covered with sweat. He had been chained for an entire night.
  The figure before him wore a black leather suit, and a skull-like helmet that concealed most of their face. It was a terrifying sight. The Iron Fist struggled against the chains but only managed to irritate them even more. He didn’t want to give his captors any satisfaction at all.
  “ No words ” he spat. His voice was hoarse from screaming throughout the night. The figure before him remained silent. They knew they had him and there was no use in trying to escape. They had too much power over him now.
