matter how many times she went to the doctor, they couldn’t figure out what was wrong with her. And that’s when it hit her, it wasn’t the doctors that would help her this time; it was her faith. Eve always believed in God but this was a real test of her faith. She was scared and confused as she knew there had to be an answer for why all this was happening to her.

Eve always went to church with her husband, they were very active in the community and loved being together on Sunday mornings. One Sunday Eve didn’t feel up to going, but her husband encouraged her to go anyway. She knew that even if she wasn’t up for it, he would want her there with him. As soon as they walked into the church doors, everything changed for Eve. The music was beautiful and the words being spoken were so powerful. It was at that moment she felt God’s love pouring out of every inch of her body. She knew then that all this suffering wasn’t in vain. Even though she would eventually be taken from this Earth, she would know that she was never alone.

Eve continued to go to church even when her illnesses became worse. It provided her with comfort and hope during some very difficult times. She also found strength in the community around her, they were all so supportive of her through everything. Eve knew that God was working through them and guiding her every step of the way.

As Eve’s time on Earth came to an end, she felt peace knowing that she would be reunited with God soon. She had lived a good life filled with love and joy. Although leaving this world was hard for her family and friends, they all found comfort in knowing that their beloved Eve would finally be at rest.
