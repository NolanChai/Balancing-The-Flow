unk back down to a kneeling position, hands resting atop her knees, head bowed low.  She had been kneeling here for hours, standing only when one of the men in black suits came into the room to address her or reprimand her.
 
 ``Why do I have to stand out here?'' She asked him, her voice shaking with exhaustion and anger as she forced herself back up onto shaky legs.
 
 ``I want you to see how important your decisions are.'' He said simply, walking over to where she stood.  
``Your first mistake was thinking that your choice would make a difference.  The truth is it doesn't matter what you choose because every path you take will lead you back here.  Your mistakes and regrets will be the only constant in your life.'' He said, smiling as he spoke.  
``You see, every decision that you made was based on what you thought would be best for the people you loved.  You sacrificed yourself for them over and over again.  But it didn't matter because everything came back to this.  It always comes back to this.'' He said as he gestured around at the large room, filled with people in black suits, standing or sitting and staring at her with a mixture of emotions on their faces.
``No matter what you choose, no matter how hard you try, it will never be enough.  You can't fix this because there is nothing to be fixed.  The truth is that we all make mistakes, but some of us are just better at hiding them than others.'' He said as he turned and walked out the room, leaving Mary standing in the middle of the large room, alone once more.
