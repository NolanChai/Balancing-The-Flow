and his mam both were christian, as far as they were concerned I would be to. But I didn't want to believe in something without proof. When the world went under, they all had their different ways of dealing with it. Some turned to religion, but it wasn't enough for me. I wanted proof. I was n't going to follow someone just because a book said so. After a few years I had given up on finding any sort of meaning, and became one with nature. It took many more years before I discovered something else that could be my belief; the afterlife. Now I believe in both, religion and an afterlife. There is no right or wrong way to find out who you are and what you believe in.
