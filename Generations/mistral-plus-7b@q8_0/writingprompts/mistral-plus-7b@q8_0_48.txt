 She pulls away and smiles at me and I smile back, unable to tear myself away from those loving blue eyes of hers.
 
 `` I've been waiting for this moment all my life, a honeymoon with my lovely bride,'' I say, and give her a long hug.
 
 She hugs me right back and whispers in my ear `` Just wait till you feel me all over your body, you won't know what hit you.''
 
 We both giggle at this, and get into the car.
