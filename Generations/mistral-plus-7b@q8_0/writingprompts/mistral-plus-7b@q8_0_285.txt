10 years ago today. My eyes caught a glimpse of what was once a small and helpless baby that grew into one of the strongest people I had ever met. The one who taught me what it meant to be alive. I inhaled deeply; the smoke tasted bitter to my throat. It reminded me of all of the times we spent together, smoking on our porch while enjoying the summer sun.

“Anastasia…” I whispered her name. “I miss you so much.” My eyes stung with tears that I held back for as long as I could. I didn’t want to cry today. Not on such a beautiful day, not when she deserved better than a simple birthday gift. She deserved the world and more, and all I could give her was these stupid words. It wasn’t fair. But I couldn’t do anything about it now.

I lit up another cigarette, letting its smoke swirl around me like a veil. The taste of its bitterness spread across my tongue and down the back of my throat, reminding me of the one person who would always be with me.
