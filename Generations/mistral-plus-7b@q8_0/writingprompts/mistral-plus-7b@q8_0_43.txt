He waited until everyone had calmed down, then continued. `` You have all been chosen by me, Father Ricardo, because I believe you can help make the world a better place. Each of you brings something unique and valuable to the table. Together, I know we can achieve great things.''

We will work together towards a common purpose: to improve the quality of life for everyone within it. To do this we must each give our all and work tirelessly towards this end.''
 
 He ended his speech with a call to action. `` Now is the time for us to come together in unity and commitment, to make the world a better place for those who live in it.'' With that, he invited them to join him in making their vision a reality.
