inquished its grip on Orville's arm. ``What was that, Harold?''
 
 Harold clenched his teeth. He pointed to Orville's ear hair. ``I said your ear hair is like a bramble bush.''
 
 Orville patted Harold's head and pulled out a small handful of his ear hair. Harold recoiled from Orville's hands as he attempted to pick the tiny hairs off of his skin. Orville rubbed the hairs between his fingers and released them into the wind. ``I know my ear hair is brambly,'' Orville said, ``but I can't help it. I blame my mother for this.''
 
 ``Oh?'' Harold looked up at Orville with curious eyes.
 
 ``She had bramble-like ear hair, too.'' Orville shook his head and ran a hand through his ear hair. ``My father would always tell her that she had a case of the thistles.''
 
 Harold giggled at the idea of anyone having a case of the thistles.
 
 ``Yes,'' said Orville, ``you see it was genetic. She passed her thistly ear hair onto me and my brother.'' He rubbed his chin with his other hand. ``It's in our genes. It's just the way we are built.''
