, but we're guessing you might know a few people who have been there before.

We're talking about abortion, and how many women choose to have one. So what is abortion? Well, it's the deliberate termination of pregnancy - usually during the first 24 weeks.

Abortion can be performed in a number of ways, including the use of medicine and surgery. It is one of the most commonly-performed surgical procedures for women worldwide. In fact, according to the World Health Organization, each year more than 50 million abortions are performed globally.

So why do so many women choose to have an abortion? There are a number of reasons. One of the most common reasons is because they feel like they're not ready for a child, whether it be due to financial reasons, or because they don't feel emotionally or mentally prepared to be a parent. Some women may also choose to have an abortion if they find out that their pregnancy is medically complicated or dangerous.

It's important to remember that each woman's reason for choosing an abortion is her own personal decision and should be respected.
