A few nice people out there like me. Then all of a sudden I just lost it all. All that time spent, just poof!

What happened? Somehow a bot found one of my posts and marked them as spam. How could a bot have done this to me? I feel violated and angry. This is so unfair. You know what? Screw you Reddit! Iâ€™m outta here. I will never return to this awful place again, full of bots and trolls. No more comments from my friends or interesting articles. Goodbye and good riddance.
