He walks over to her and pulls out his phone from his pocket. He quickly types something in and places it on top of hers. A message pops up on her screen. It reads, "Why do you walk like this? Like you're ashamed of yourself."

She looks at him with confusion, unsure of what to say.

"I can tell when someone is sad or depressed. It's like a sixth sense I have. Your eyes are always glued to the ground. You avoid eye contact with everyone and act like you're afraid of something." He takes her hand in his and begins walking next to her as he continues. "But I want you to know that no matter how bad things get, you will pull through. You can do this. You have so much potential. Just keep your head up and don't be afraid to take risks. Life is too short to live in fear." He smiles at her as if his words were the answer she had been looking for all along.
