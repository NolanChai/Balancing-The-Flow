It was Mrs. Dunbar’s first presidential debate since she took over the office following the death of her husband, the 33rd president. It had been a long campaign season filled with speculation about whether she could be trusted to run the country. Many people feared that she would be too emotional and couldn’t make tough decisions like her predecessor.

But Mrs. Dunbar was determined to prove them wrong. She had spent hours studying the issues and preparing for every possible question that might be asked during the debate. Her opponent, a male candidate with a lot of political experience, would no doubt try to take advantage of any weaknesses he could find in her knowledge or experience.

Mrs. Dunbar took a deep breath and stepped up to the podium. She knew this was an important opportunity for her to show that she was ready for the job.
