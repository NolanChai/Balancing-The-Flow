It was a cold night, and all that kept them warm was their own body heat and the warmth of the flames. They'd had a long day of hard labor, clearing debris from the old station to make way for construction of the new subway station that would eventually replace it. The debris cleared out of the platform was piled in front of the fire and burned into embers and ash.
 
 One of the members of the shelter stood up, stretched her aching back, and picked up her axe from the ground near the fire. She wiped off some of the dirt and soot that had collected on it while she worked, then placed the weapon over one shoulder and turned toward the rest of them. "I'm going to make a run for more supplies," she said. "Anyone need anything?"
 
 Some of the others in the shelter shook their heads or replied that they were fine. Others requested certain items such as food, clothing, weapons, ammunition, and even medical supplies. One man requested some cloth so he could make a sling for his injured arm. The woman nodded to him and made note of everything on her list. She then picked up her axe again and started into the darkness.
 
 The station was dark and quiet. Most of the lights had gone out, either from damage or from lack of power. The only light came from a few emergency lanterns that were scattered throughout the station, providing just enough illumination to see what you're doing. She made her way through the darkness carefully, keeping close to the walls in case there was any danger lurking in the shadows. After a few minutes she emerged into an area that still had some functioning lights. This was the subway itself. The old wooden benches and advertisements were gone now, replaced by piles of debris and rubble. It felt eerie and strange to her, like being in a ghost town or an abandoned ruin. She made her way through the darkness toward the ladder that led up from the platform. 
 
 Climbing up the ladder was hard work. The rungs were slippery with dirt and grime, making it difficult to grip them properly. She slowly climbed upward, taking care not to slip or lose her footing. She emerged at the top of the ladder, panting and exhausted from her climb. She took a moment to catch her breath and surveyed the area around her. It was dark but there were some lights in the distance. She could hear people talking and moving about. It looked like there was a small settlement nearby. She made her way toward it, hoping to find what she needed.
