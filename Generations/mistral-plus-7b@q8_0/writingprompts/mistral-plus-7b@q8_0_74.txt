across the room. I made for the shower.
 
I was half way through my ablutions when I noticed the small pile of clothing that had collected in one corner of the bathroom floor. Something wasn’t right about it… there were no undergarments amongst the discarded clothes, nor any shirts or shoes. This set me to thinking for a few moments. What was it they always say about shoes? One shoe and you are looking for love… two shoes and you are in deep shit.  The pile of clothes meant that someone had been in the shower before I arrived. A quick examination of the bathroom revealed no other signs of habitation, such as toiletries or a toothbrush, nor any indication that anyone had slept here overnight. There were no suitcases or overnight bags either… but then why would there be? The only clue I found was a tiny pair of gold earrings, set with small blue stones, lying in the middle of the pile. They looked very expensive and had been obviously carefully placed there.
 
A cold shiver of dread ran through me as I realised who it could possibly have belonged to… my target! Whoever she was. Whoever they were. It appeared that someone had been following me again, had snuck into my room while I was out and showered in the bathroom before leaving. It also looked like they had stolen something from my bag.
 
I quickly put on a pair of jeans, a t-shirt and a pair of boots. Reaching under the bed I pulled out an automatic pistol and placed it into a holster on my belt.  I was now dressed for trouble. The last thing I wanted to happen was to be caught off guard again. I needed to get back out there as fast as possible, so that if anyone else had their eye on me I would be ready to deal with them quickly.
 
It was time to go and find some answers… or at least make someone answer for what they had done.
