## Introduction[]

Terran Transport is a space sim game in which the player controls a Terran ship and transports cargo from planet to planet across the solar system. Each planet has its own unique characteristics that affect how quickly the ship can dock, how much fuel it consumes, and what cargo can be transported there. The goal of the game is to earn as much money as possible by delivering cargo to each planet in as fast a time as possible.

## Gameplay[]

The game begins with the player choosing a starting location. They are then given a set amount of time to reach that location and dock their ship before the timer runs out. The closer they can get to the planet, the more money they will earn for that delivery. As the player completes deliveries, they are rewarded with money which can be used to upgrade their ship or purchase new upgrades.

The game features a variety of challenges ranging from simple tasks such as delivering cargo between two planets, to more complex missions requiring the player to complete multiple tasks in order to successfully complete the mission. In addition, Terran Transport also includes various power-ups that can be used during missions to increase their chances of success.
