more seriously than her father. She was determined to use it for as long as she could.

As soon as she found a coin or even a small piece of scrap metal, she would race home and drop the object in the bucket which she had placed by the front door. Each time she returned from a hunt, her mother would sigh with exasperation at the thought of cleaning up yet another collection of rusty coins, but Lilly was insistent that the coins were precious.

Lilly's parents could not understand their daughter's fascination with the old metal pieces, and after months of dealing with the bucket of coins and her persistent questions about their origin, they eventually told her that she had to stop hunting for coins if she wanted to stay at home. So Lilly gave up her treasure hunt in exchange for being allowed to keep her favourite coin collection on display on a shelf in her bedroom.
