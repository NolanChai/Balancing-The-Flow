20-21, 34-46 were more in depth about relationships than any of the others so far. It would be nice to see something like that again but for the main characters. Maybe they could show all three couples together and show some kind of interaction between the two men with the women. I don't know. But at least let it be sweet rather than a bunch of people just popping up and saying hello.
