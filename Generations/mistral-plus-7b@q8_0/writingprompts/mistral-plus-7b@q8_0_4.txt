the chaos of traffic on this crowded street in Beijing, he felt an immediate dislike for the city.

It wasn ’ t as if it was a beautiful city that could be appreciated by the eye. The buildings were old and rundown, the roads were filthy and cluttered with garbage and people. This was not James ’ idea of paradise. He had never been to China before and was eager to see what life in this ancient country would bring.

He wanted to know if it was worth staying there for any length of time, but as he stepped out into the crowded streets, he knew that he did not want to live here for long. It seemed like an interesting place but not one where he could be happy with his life. He thought about returning home soon after arriving in Beijing and never coming back again.
