- ing behind the desk. `` If it was possible for us to get them a week earlier, we would.''

The woman shook her head. `` This is not the first time you've told me that. We are being charged for every day of delay.''

Caillou nodded. He had known this moment was coming. `` It won't happen again,'' he said, trying to keep his voice steady and pleasant. `` I will personally guarantee that our shipment is on time from now on.''

The woman did not look convinced. `` You are making promises you cannot keep. The delay last week caused us to miss the opening of the new season of shows, which cost us a lot of money. We have to get a handle on this problem, or your company will be out.'' She paused for effect. `` I am going to give you one more chance. If your shipments are late again, we will terminate our contract with you immediately and find someone else who can deliver on time.''

Caillou gulped. This woman was tougher than he had thought. He knew he had to do something drastic if he wanted to avoid getting fired. His mind raced through the options. Maybe I could bring in another supplier who would be more reliable, he thought. But that meant losing his profit margin. It was a risky move, but perhaps it was worth taking.

Then a sudden inspiration struck him. There must be some way to improve our efficiency and get the shipments out on time without having to resort to outside help. Caillou resolved to do whatever he could to make sure that his company delivered on time and met their customers' expectations. He would take any steps necessary, no matter how drastic, in order to save his job.
