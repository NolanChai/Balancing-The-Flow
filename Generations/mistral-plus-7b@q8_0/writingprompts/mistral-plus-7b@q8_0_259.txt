, but you have to understand that you need an education. College isn't for everybody, but a high school diploma is essential. It can get you out of some bad situations. You need to stay in school.
 
 Stay away from drugs. Seriously. Drugs are not cool. They will fuck you up if you aren't careful. I know they seem like the answer to all your problems, but they never are. Marijuana will give you a false sense of invincibility that you just won't be able to live with. Stay away.
 
 Please don't be afraid to try new things. You have so much life left to live. Go out and explore the world. Travel while you can. See everything, as much of it as you possibly can. Don't settle into a rut. Life is too short for that.
 
 I know there are so many people telling you what to do. Parents, teachers, friends, strangers, and even yourself. Please, please ignore them all. You need to be true to yourself, and not worry about what everyone else thinks of you. Listen to your gut. It will never steer you wrong.
 
 Live every day as if it's your last. Don't spend time worrying or fretting over things that aren't in your control. Enjoy the present because before you know it, you won't have one.
