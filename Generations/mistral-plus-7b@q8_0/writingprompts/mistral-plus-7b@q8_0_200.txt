be. Then, with a sigh of relief, they had handed him over to his nanny.

Colin and Felicity both worked at the hospital. Colin worked as an orderly, while Felicity was a junior nurse. They were pleased when they were chosen for their first child through the genetic selection programme. It was an exciting time for them, though there were strict rules about their behaviour during Rupert’s gestation period.

Colin and Felicity had been very good parents, doing everything that the genetic engineers had told them to do. They had been careful about what they ate and drank, avoiding anything that might cause defects in their child. They had not even smoked or drunk alcohol. The doctors at the hospital were impressed by how well Colin and Felicity had coped with the strict rules of the programme, and Rupert was born a perfect baby, in every way.

Rupert was an only child. As a result, his parents spoiled him rotten. He was the apple of their eye and they could do no wrong for him. They even bought him a personal android to play with. The little robot would follow Rupert around and do whatever he wanted it to do. It made Rupert very happy and he loved playing with it.

Unfortunately, there was one problem with their perfect lives. The genetic selection programme had not considered the possibility of mutations in Rupert’s DNA. These mutations caused Rupert’s body to grow at an accelerated rate, resulting in him becoming very tall very quickly. By the time he was six years old, he was already almost a metre taller than most adults. This led to problems for both him and his parents, as they were forced to find ways to cope with his rapid growth.

The mutations also caused Rupert’s body to develop at a much faster rate than normal. By the age of ten he was already very well developed physically. However this was causing him to mature much earlier than other children. He began exhibiting behaviours that were more typical of an older teenager, such as being argumentative and rebellious. Colin and Felicity had never experienced anything like it before and found themselves at a loss as to how to deal with Rupert’s behaviour.

Despite their struggles, Colin and Felicity loved Rupert unconditionally and tried their best to help him through this difficult time. With patience and understanding they were able to help Rupert navigate the challenges of his early years with ease and pride themselves on raising such a wonderful child.
