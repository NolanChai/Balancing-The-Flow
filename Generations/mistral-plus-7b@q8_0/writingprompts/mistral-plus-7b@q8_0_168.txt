- sorry about this, Mr. Stone. It really was the best lead that we had. And after all, it's not like you were ever gonna go on record with us. But as you said, we're in a bit of an awkward situation here.''
 
 I nodded in agreement. `` Yeah, I understand. After all, if this girl never comes forward, then your whole investigation is in trouble, right? You need someone to identify this woman so that you can question her more about what happened the night that your client was murdered.''
 
 Detective Rand let out a deep breath and rubbed his eyes with both hands. `` Yes, I suppose so. But we have no leads at all on who she is now, and it's starting to look like whoever killed him got away scot-free.''
 
 My mind raced as I thought about what this meant for the case. If there was no way to identify the woman in the video or anyone else involved in my client's murder, then it seemed likely that they would remain unpunished forever. It felt like such an injustice - that someone could commit such a heinous act without any consequences whatsoever. But I knew that sometimes justice takes its time. I just hoped that one day this case might finally be solved so that my client's family could find some closure and peace.
