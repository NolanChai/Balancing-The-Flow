young American girl standing beside me as the lift doors opened, but as a man who had seen enough death on the battlefield to last him several lifetimes, it did not concern me that she was alone and looking somewhat lost. Perhaps her husband had just left for work; perhaps she was late for class at college; or maybe she was just visiting relatives in the area. Either way, it was of no consequence to me as we both entered the elevator together.

As I stood there, trying to keep my gaze averted from her, the young American girl started talking about her recent trip to New York. Her words were soft and her voice high-pitched, like that of a child still learning to speak properly. She explained how she had travelled by train with some friends and stayed in a hotel that overlooked Times Square. She spoke with excitement and awe at the lights and the hustle and bustle of New York City.

I couldnâ€™t help but be captivated by her enthusiasm. I had never been to America before, so her tales of its grandeur were fascinating for me. Her words flowed like a river as she described the sights and sounds of Manhattan; how brightly lit the streets were at night, how crowded the sidewalks became when the sun went down, and how everyone seemed so eager to help each other out.

She told me about the Broadway shows she had seen and the incredible restaurants they ate at during their stay. It was clear that this young American girl was passionate about travel and experiencing new places. As we got off on our respective floors, I thanked her for sharing her story with me. She smiled brightly and said no problem.

That elevator ride has stayed with me to this day, reminding me of the joy and wonder of seeing new places with fresh eyes. It taught me that even amidst the chaos and uncertainty of life, there is still beauty and excitement out there waiting for us if we open our hearts up enough to see it.
