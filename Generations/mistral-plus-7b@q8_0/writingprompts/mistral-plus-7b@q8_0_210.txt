it had become had been torn away from it. It tried to move its legs, but there wasn’t much left of them. They had been gnawed upon by the hungry beasts in the water, and then taken out with me.

It was still alive. Or, rather, undead. I had used my magic to pull its life force from it. It was a pathetic thing now. An empty shell. Nothing more than a husk of what it once had been. I had done this with all five of the men who had attacked me on the ship. Five dead guys who were still alive in one form or another.

It didn’t bother me that I had done this to them. I knew that if they had lived, they would have made my life a living hell. And now, they couldn’t. They were stuck in these empty husks of what they once were. Not truly dead, but not truly alive either.

The worst part was the fact that there was nothing I could do to help them. The only thing I had to give them was their lives, and I took that away from them without a second thought. If that makes me an evil person, then so be it. I would rather live knowing that I am evil than die thinking that I am good.

I turned and walked away from the bloody mess that was once Joseph Walker. I knew that eventually these things would die. Their lives would end even without the aid of my magic. But until then, they were nothing more than empty husks of what they had been before. And I had done this to them.
