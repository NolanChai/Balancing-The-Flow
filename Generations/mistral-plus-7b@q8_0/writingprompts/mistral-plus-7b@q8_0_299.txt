resser for years, never really using them. The weight was nice; the way they slid across each other a pleasant distraction.

One day, while on the phone with my wife, I fiddled with them as we talked. A few minutes later she suggested that I give them to her to help relieve stress. They had become part of our daily routine for a little while there. She'd sit on the couch and play with them while I sat at my desk and played games or watched videos. It was nice having those moments again.

In time, she stopped bringing it up anymore and eventually forgot about them altogether. It wasn't long before they became just another thing that gathered dust on the dresser. They were something that no longer had a place in our lives together.

Things have been different lately. I've seen her stressed out again; maybe not as often, but it happens. She has her moments of worry and anxiety like any other person. One night, she was really having a rough time and couldn't seem to get herself calmed down. That's when I remembered those tungsten baoding balls on the dresser and decided to go and grab them for her.

As she took them into her hands, the worry lines in her face melted away as she started fiddling with them. The little metallic orbs rolled from one hand to another; the soft clicks of their impact bringing her back to herself again. It was a simple thing that brought me so much joy.

I could see the stress leaving her body as she played with the balls. She became more relaxed and at ease, losing herself in the repetition of motion for a moment. Watching her do this brought back memories of those times when we were still in love; before our fights and disagreements had gotten so bad. It reminded me of simpler times when everything seemed possible again.

Seeing her calm down like that was truly amazing. Those tungsten baoding balls may have been forgotten for a long time, but they were still capable of bringing us back together in those moments when we needed it most. They're something so small, yet they had such an impact on both our lives during those difficult times.

Those moments of playing with them reminded me that even though things may not always go the way we want them to, there are still things that can bring us joy and help us get through the tough times. Those tungsten baoding balls became a reminder for me that no matter what happens in life, there are always ways to find happiness again if you just take some time out of your day to appreciate them
