heart pounding in my chest as I heard my name being announced for heat two of the hurdle race. The crowd roared with excitement as I took off at a sprint across the track.  The stinging wind against my face, the sweat dripping from my brow, and the sound of my feet hitting the pavement. It was like time had stood still. I was in the zone, and nothing could stop me.
   As I approached the first hurdle, I carefully planted my foot on the top of it and pushed off, propelling myself over with ease. The next few hurdles were a blur as I ran with all my might towards the finish line. With everything I had inside of me, I gave it my all as I crossed the line first. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause as I raised my arms victoriously in the air.  It was one of those moments where everything just clicked for me on a competitive level, and I was able to use my skills and abilities to achieve something great.
