t quite sure if it was the fire, or just the comforting warmth of family. A few moments passed and a soft giggle from behind me brought me out of my reverie, “ How do you do that ?” a voice asked as I turned to look at my mother who sat on my left .

I was still getting used to being able to hear her, she had been mostly deaf for the last few years and I hadn ’ t realised how much I missed her. “ Do what, mum?” I asked, puzzled by her question. She laughed again as she looked at me.

“ The way you can sit down and eat a meal without looking like you are about to fall asleep afterwards… that is one of the things I miss most about you ” . She had always been so slender, with a figure to die for. My own weight had become a bit of an issue as I got older, but my mother had somehow managed to maintain her size and shape right until she was over 75 years old.

“ Oh that ” , I replied “ It ’ s just part of being a boy… we have to eat more calories than you girls do so it is easy for us to pile on the pounds. There are some tricks though. Like making sure you eat enough protein, and eating slowly. If I am really hungry I will drink water before my meal and then I start chewing my food properly instead of just shovelling it in like a greedy pig. Another trick is not to be distracted while eating… sometimes we don ’ t even notice that we are doing it but we often eat more quickly if there is something else going on at the same time ” .

I shrugged, “ I am afraid that you are just going to have to try some of these things for yourself, mum. You need to start making an effort to get your weight under control again. It will be worth it, honest, once you have lost the extra pounds you will feel so much better and more energetic ” .
