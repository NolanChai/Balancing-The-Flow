epidly at his passing, but most just turned away as if he were invisible, though even this was an acknowledgement of some sort of power in the man.

The plaza of Caesarea Maritima stretched out before him, the sun glinting off the sea to the west and the great white limestone columns that rose up from it. A scattering of people moved about on its paved surface as if in a dream; some were going somewhere with purpose and intent while others were merely wandering in idle curiosity. To Pontius, this was all an act of pretence, for in reality there was no one here but him, and this was his plaza, his city. It was here he felt most at home, here his mind could relax and his spirit soar.

`` The crowds,'' he murmured to himself. ``The people.'' He looked down at them from his perch and smiled with a mixture of disdain and amusement. They were all so insignificant, yet they held so much power over him. It was their voices that echoed throughout the plaza, their footsteps that drummed against the cobblestones; it was their very presence that made this place what it was. And yet, at the same time, they were nothing but ants in the vastness of his life. He could crush them underfoot without a thought, and all would be as if they had never existed.

The thought brought a smile to Pontius' lips. For all their pretence of power, these people were so fragile. They could not hope to stand against him, for he was the one with the real power here in this place. He was the lord and master of Caesarea Maritima, and they were nothing but pawns in his game. It was a game that he had played for centuries now, and he knew all its rules inside out. The people were only pawns to him; they existed merely as tools with which to further his own ends. They were the means by which he achieved his goals, not the other way around.

Pontius allowed himself a small chuckle. Yes, it was true that he held all the power here in this place, but even that paled in comparison to the greater game of life itself. He was just another player on a huge playing field, with countless others vying for control and dominance. But one thing he had learned over time: no matter what happened or who won or lost, the game would continue on regardless. There was always another day, another challenge, another opportunity for him to prove his worth once again. And that thought gave Pontius a sense of comfort and purpose. He knew he had nothing but the game itself, but as long as he continued playing it with all his might, then everything else would fall into place accordingly.
