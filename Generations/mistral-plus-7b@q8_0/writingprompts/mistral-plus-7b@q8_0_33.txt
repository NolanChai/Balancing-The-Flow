100 feet and then turned around. There was nobody behind me. It took a few minutes for the panic to subside from my system. After the nightmares I had been having about people chasing me down the street I figured this was just another of them. But it wasn't, there really was somebody following me. As the paranoia once again subsided I began to get angry at whoever was following me. Why couldn't they just leave me alone? What do they want from me? This is why I hate this place so much. Every time you think you're safe someone comes along and messes it all up. But there was nothing I could do about the situation, there was nobody around to help me. The only thing I could do is keep walking and hope that whoever was following me would just go away on their own accord. After a while of keeping this pace I noticed that the person following me was not too far behind me. This caused my anger to flare up once again, but I quickly contained it as I did n't want to draw any more attention to myself than necessary. Once I reached home I locked every door and window and waited until whoever it was stopped outside the house. I waited a good fifteen minutes before peaking out the window to make sure they were gone before going back into my room and locking the door behind me.
