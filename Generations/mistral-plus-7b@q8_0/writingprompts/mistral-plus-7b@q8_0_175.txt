 `` You may have been wrong about the superstring.  I am getting some very interesting data from the latest run. The readings are too fast for me to keep up, but it looks like the superstrings have a certain amount of internal structure. We could call them tubular strings.'' 
 
 `` Aha! I knew that the standard string theory was incomplete. It has been proven that there is only one way of forming a stable loop from a single string. However, we know that it takes more than one string to form a closed loop, so clearly there must be an intermediate structure. In this case, tubes would make sense. We have seen evidence for subatomic strings for some time now and I think we are ready to begin experimenting with larger and larger strings.''
 
 `` Well, it is possible that you are right about the string theory,'' agreed Johannes.  `` The data I am getting suggests that there could be tubular structures of varying diameter within the superstrings. We can probably identify a few different types by their size and composition.''
