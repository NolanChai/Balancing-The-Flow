ess.'' 
 
 `` I didn't say that. What are you guys doing here anyway?'' 
 
 `` We've always been here. Your people have just forgotten about us over the years.'' 
 
 `` You're talking to ghosts James.'' 
 
 `` Well, then who the hell are you?'' 
 
 `` We are your ancestors, James. We were once humans like you. Long ago we decided that it was time for the world to move on without us so we just slipped away. Now you've found us again.'' 
 
 `` Why do you want to tell me this now? What is the point?'' 
 
 `` We want you to know that you are never truly alone, James. No matter what happens in life, there will always be a part of you that remains with those who came before you and will continue on after you. Just as we were once here with your ancestors and now live on through you.'' 
 
 `` So I'm not alone in this world after all? There's always been someone watching over me?'' 
 
 `` Yes, James. You are never truly alone. No matter where you go or what happens to you, there will be those who love and care for you and will remain with you even when they're gone. It is this connection that makes us all one big family. So no, James, you're not really alone at all.''
