The baby’s cries echoed through the woodland, startling deer and birds. The mother cradled him in her arms as she traced a trail to a clearing with a meandering stream. She took off the baby ’ s clothes. Then, in the water, she washed away the dirt and sweat from the day’s hike. She smiled at his bright eyes and pudgy fingers, his small toes that kicked up bubbles. The baby was oblivious to the world as he slept peacefully on her lap.
