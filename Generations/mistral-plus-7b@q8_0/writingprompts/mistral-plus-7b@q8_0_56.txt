ke. ``You have your own problems. You should take care of them instead of worrying about others.''

 ``What are you going to do?'' he asked, a slimy hand reaching over and poking at me. ``Are you going to fight the monster? Are you going to confront him yourself? No, you're just going to stand there and whimper like a baby. Get over it!'' 
 
 I looked up into his evil green face. He was right. I had no intention of fighting this guy myself. In fact, the idea scared me to death. It was my nature to sit back and let someone else take care of things for me. Why couldn't I be more like him? Why couldn't I have that confidence he displayed so well? I just didn't know what to do anymore. 
 
 ``You need to do something,'' he said, his voice full of contempt. ``Just standing around and worrying won't do you any good. You have to face your problems head on or they will come back to haunt you.'' 
 
 I was beginning to see that my way of dealing with life wasn't working for me. If I wanted things in my life to change, I would need to make some changes myself. It was time for me to stand up and take charge of my life. I needed to face my fears head on and not let them control me anymore. Only then would I be able to live the life that I truly deserved.
