ulking build and a mess of black hair.  He's wearing a leather jacket, which only adds to the effect that he is dangerous and strong.  I drive slower than usual, terrified that something might happen at any moment.  All I could think was, "What did I do? What could have happened if I had just driven away?"
 
 Finally, after what felt like hours of driving through dark, empty roads, I saw a sign for a gas station up ahead.  We were both silent as we drove towards it, but when we pulled into the lot, he spoke up.
 
 "I guess that's where you drop me off," he said, his voice cold and harsh.
 
 I nodded silently, relieved to be rid of him.  As soon as he opened the car door, I sped away as fast as I could go.  It was a close call, but I managed to escape unscathed.  After that experience, I vowed to never pick up hitchhikers again.  It's just not worth the risk.
