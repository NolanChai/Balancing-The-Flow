oyed up with victory to notice the reproach in the other's tone. He went on boasting of his victory over the human body: `` I can walk! And talk! And run! All because of this marvelous technology.'' 
 
 `` You don't understand,'' Ook said, turning suddenly serious. `` This is the way to survive in this world. We slimes were never meant to be free beings. We are meant to be parasites upon other beings. We have to latch onto them and use their bodies as our own. The only way for us to live in this world is to do that.'' 
 
 The other slime nodded. `` Yes, you are right. I can't deny it. Our survival instincts demand it of us. We must find a host or we will die.'' 
 
 Captain Ook beamed proudly. `` See! We know the way to live and survive in this world. We slimes may be ugly, but our intelligence is undeniable. We have evolved into something quite superior to humans. They are simply an inferior species that we can control with ease. Just look at how easily I was able to take over their bodies. It's so simple.'' 
 
 The other slime nodded. `` Yes, we must use our intelligence to find a host and take over their bodies. Only then will we be able to survive in this world.''
