and there will soon be some sort of armistice. They say that when they win the elections in November, they will start pulling troops out and letting us come home! I've heard a lot of rumors though and who knows what is true. Anyway, it sounds like we'll get to come back this fall if everything goes according to plan. I am so excited to be going home! I have missed you guys so much that it feels like forever since I was there. The other day I was thinking about all of the time we spent together and all of those happy memories, it makes me so thankful for my family. I hope you know how much I love and appreciate you, Father. I can't wait to get home and spend some time with you guys!
