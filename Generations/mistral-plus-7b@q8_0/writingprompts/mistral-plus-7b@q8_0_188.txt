eds to do burnouts, speed and generally behave like idiots. For the most part they were just a nuisance (with the exception of one little shit that decided to ram his car into my neighbours fence). They would regularly come around when we got home from work, pull over and blast their music at us. As far as I could tell they didn't really do it to annoy anyone in particular, just because. 

 We lived on the end of a cul-de-sac so there was only one way in or out (at least for cars). One night some of them came along and decided that they were going to do a burnout right outside our front door. They didn't even try and hide it, they just sat their laughing and cheering as the smoke rolled up into my window.

 The next morning I went down to talk to them about it. Turns out they'd all grown up on that road and their parents had been doing the same thing for years. They weren't even trying to be malicious, they just figured it was their road and they were entitled to do what they wanted. When I pointed out the fact that we didn't actually live on the road (it was a cul-de-sac so they could literally turn around at the end of the road and do a burnout outside their own house), but they chose to pull over in front of our house, it finally clicked. They realised how stupid and inconsiderate they were being and they apologised for being assholes. It was honestly pretty sweet, they had been so wrapped up in their teenage hotheadness that they just hadn't stopped to think about other people.
