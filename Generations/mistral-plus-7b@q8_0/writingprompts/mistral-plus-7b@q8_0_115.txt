be perfect, and I couldnâ€™t wait for the episode to start! I took out an apple and sat down on the rug in front of the fireplace, eating the apple slowly while watching TV. It was like a scene from an old-fashioned movie, but it felt so cozy and warm. The flames danced in the darkness as I nibbled away at my apple. The aroma of the apples blended perfectly with the wood smoke rising up through the chimney. My breath caught in my throat as I watched the fire crackle and pop. I felt so grateful to be enjoying this moment, feeling content and at peace.
