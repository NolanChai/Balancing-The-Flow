as old girl is raped by her step father. He has been doing this to her since she turned 12 and now that she has been impregnated from the rape she goes into a depression and commits suicide. Her death was not one of the ten deaths. The doctor who had performed the autopsy on her reported that the pregnancy was about three months old, which would mean that she was impregnated in mid-may. Because this girl had died it meant that another life was saved. Another babyâ€™s life was added to the pile. It started off normal, for every 10 births there were 10 deaths, but now the amount of births are starting to increase exponentially. Soon it is not only one life per death, but two and then four, soon eight, and so on and so forth. There are so many people now that there are no more trees, and not enough food to feed everyone. The death toll has increased. No longer do we have 10 deaths for every 10 births; it is now 400 for every 100. Everyone is starving and there is not enough room on the planet to accommodate all of these people.
  
 It started off normal, but soon things escalated, they changed, they evolved. Now they are worse than they ever were before.
