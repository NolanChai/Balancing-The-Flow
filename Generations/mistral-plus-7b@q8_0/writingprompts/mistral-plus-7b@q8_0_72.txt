the room where I keep my books, art supplies and other creative materials that are for my personal use only. I unlocked the door and opened it to find a man standing on the threshold of that door. He looked rather startled when I walked in.

He said, “Excuse me. Are you Amy?”

I replied, “Yes.”

He then said, “I have a message for you from your father.”

I asked, “What does he say?”

The man replied, “He says that you should know that there is still so much left of him inside of you. That what you are doing is good. He is proud of you and the way in which you are helping others. He is glad to see you using your gifts for others and not just yourself.”

Then he turned to leave, saying, “Tell him I said hello and that I am going to miss him.”

I nodded my head in understanding, and then closed the door. I stood there for a moment, tears streaming down my face, thankful for the message from my father. It was such a comfort to know that even though he is gone now, his spirit lives on within me. And it was reassuring to know that he was proud of me and the work I do to help others. I know that my father always had a big heart for helping others, so it makes sense that I inherited those same qualities from him.

My father was always very kind and giving with his time and resources whenever someone needed assistance or help. He truly was an amazing person who cared deeply about others and wanted to make their lives easier in any way possible. This message from him was just another reminder of how much love and support he still gives me even though he is no longer here physically with us anymore. I will forever cherish these moments where I can feel his presence and know that he is always there for me, even in spirit form.
