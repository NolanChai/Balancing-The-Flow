udn't wake up from. I mean, my boyfriend just left me for someone he'd just met (no I didn't find out til after), so the loneliness of it all made me think that I was gonna start going crazy... or at least it was something that I was worried about. But then I realized that God is with me always, He doesn't leave me alone, He promised that He would never leave me. So no matter how bad things get I just gotta remember that.
