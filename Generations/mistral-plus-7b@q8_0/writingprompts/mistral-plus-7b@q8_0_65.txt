ff? I never trash talk, because it's just plain stupid. It has no effect whatsoever on my game play. The only thing that effects my gameplay, is my concentration and focus. When I get into a match, whether it be in an online tournament or in a real life match at my gym, the last thing I want to worry about is some idiot yammering at me. I want to be focusing on what I need to do, and not pay attention to anything else. It's all about discipline and focus. And if someone starts talking trash? That means that they are distracted by you. This means that they aren't paying attention to what they should be doing: fighting. 
 
 I've been playing video games for over half my life now. So when I go online, I just try and concentrate on winning the match. I don't want to focus on whatever random person is trying to psych me out with trash talk. All this does is distracts me from what I should be concentrating on: kicking ass. 
 
 I can remember one particular time that a guy was talking a bunch of shit, and it really bothered me. But then when we got into the match? He just got his ass handed to him. I didn't even break a sweat. So the moral of this story is: Don't trash talk someone, because you think that will help you win. It won't. Just keep playing your game and don't pay attention to whatever they are saying to you.
