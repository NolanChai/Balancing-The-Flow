20 years old. He knows he has never seen her before, and yet when she was born, he was there. When she takes her first step, when she says her first word, when she goes to school for the first time, he is there too, always beside her. But they ’ re not together. They are not a couple. They are not husband and wife. She walks on her own, but he has been there since the beginning.
 
 
 The second woman is in her twenties, she doesn’t know where she comes from either. Maybe it was a dream? Or a memory of another life that never happened? Maybe she is one of those who lives between realities, never fully belonging to any one place or time. She has no idea how much time passes, but every day she walks farther and farther along the same road as the first woman. And even though they are strangers, there is something inexplicably familiar about them that draws them together, like magnets. Maybe it’s their shared sense of loneliness or their unwavering determination to keep walking despite the uncertainty of what lies ahead. They seem to understand each other without ever saying a word, and despite their differences in age and backgrounds, there is an undeniable connection between them that grows stronger with every step they take together.
