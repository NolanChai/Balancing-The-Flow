ama was taking care of everything. The next thing I remember was waking up in my hospital bed with all kinds of tubes running into me. Then, I saw mama sitting next to my bed. She gave me a hug and said that the fire wasn't too bad, but it had been very dangerous for me because the smoke was so thick and toxic. Mama also said that my skin had become badly burnt, and that I would need lots of time to heal before I could go home again. After hearing what mama had to say about the situation, all I could do was thank God for keeping me safe through it all. It took a long time for me to recover, but with love and support from my family, I eventually got back on my feet again. I am still healing today, but at least now I can be thankful that I have survived such an ordeal.
