elift technology. The new Starfleet spacecraft was designed and built by our scientists, making it safe for the average civilian like me to take a tour through outer space. My father had already been aboard one of the crafts for a few days on a work assignment. He said that it was amazing; it was almost like being on vacation in an Earth resort.

My parents and I were allowed on board the ship to enjoy dinner at the restaurant. It was just like any other restaurant, but instead of having regular chairs, they had seats that attached to the floor so you could remain seated during your flight through space. The food was delicious and made with locally grown ingredients harvested from Erosâ€™s farms. After dinner we were treated to a beautiful view of the city lights from our table window seat. It truly was an unforgettable experience.

After dinner, we took a tour of the ship. We got to see all kinds of different rooms and areas aboard the vessel. My favorite part of the tour was being able to go outside on the deck and take in the vastness of space. I could see stars twinkling in the distance as well as other planets in our solar system. The view was truly breathtaking and something that I will never forget!
