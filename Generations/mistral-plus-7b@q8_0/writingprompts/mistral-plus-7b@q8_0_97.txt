rescent moon and sang the next verse of the song, which goes like this:

> How I wonder what you are!
> Up above the world so high,
> Like a diamond in the sky.
> Twinkle, twinkle, little star;
> How I wonder what you are!

I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. The smell of rain filled my nose, along with some of the flowers that were growing around me. I could hear the sound of crickets chirping in the distance. And then, there was a soft tapping against my window. I opened my eyes and looked down. Standing outside my window was a small fairy. She had gorgeous bright blue wings and wore an even more beautiful green dress.

“Hello!” she said. “I am a fairy who lives here in the woods. I was admiring your voice and wondered if you’d like to sing some songs with me.”

I looked around at my room, which was filled with toys that needed cleaning up. My bookshelf was overflowing with picture books, and there were clothes scattered all over my floor. The last thing I wanted to do right now was clean up my room or study for my math test on Friday. Singing seemed like a much better option!

“Yes!” I replied excitedly. “I’d love to sing some songs with you.”

The fairy grinned and flew over to the window. She gently opened it so that she could get inside, then flew over to me. She was really tiny! She fit in the palm of my hand. Her wings were like fluttering jewels, sparkling in the moonlight.

She reached out her tiny hand and took mine. Then she led me outside into the woods. We walked through a path that was lined with flowers and trees. The night air was cool against our skin, but it felt refreshing after being cooped up inside all day long. As we walked along the path, I could hear birds singing in the distance. They were chirping happily as they flew from tree to tree. It made me feel happy just listening to them.

We eventually came upon a clearing surrounded by tall trees. The fairy stopped and turned toward me with her hands on her hips. She had a mischievous twinkle in her eye that reminded me of when my grandma used to play tricks on me when I was younger.

“Let’s sing together now,” she said excitedly as she clapped her hands together. “We will sing Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star first.”

I smiled brightly at the fairy and then began to sing the song with her:

> Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
> How I wonder what you are!
> Up above the world so high,
> Like a diamond in the sky.
