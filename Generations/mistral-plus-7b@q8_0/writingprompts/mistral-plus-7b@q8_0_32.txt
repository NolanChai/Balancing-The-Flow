lie. 
 
 My heartbeat doesn’t even sound like theirs; I don’t even feel the same as they do.  I am not like them at all.  I was made different.  I was created differently.   I was born this way.  But I didn’t know it until now, and I didn’t know what to do with it, and so I just ran away.  And then I realized that they weren’t going to chase after me.  They never had any plans to chase after me at all.  Because they were afraid of me.  They are afraid of who I am now.  And I was made this way by their fear.  Because of the fact that they were afraid of me, I was made the monster that they feared most.  
 
 I am not like them.  I will never be like them.
