It's just a bit of discolored skin with the shape of a dragon on it. Please don't worry about it!''

A birthmark is a mark found on babies when they are born. They may be various shapes and sizes, though most are quite small. Birthmarks tend not to change with time or cause any harm; some can fade over the years. There are two types of birthmarks, vascular (or red) marks and pigmented marks. Vascular marks consist of blood vessels that appear close to the surface of the skin. Pigmented marks have darker than normal patches of skin on them.

Many people consider a birthmark to be some kind of magical sign. It is not. Birthmarks are perfectly natural and are nothing more than marks on your body when you were born. Some believe that they are connected to a person's destiny, or that they are a symbol for good luck or bad luck. Many witches and wizards do not think this way because birthmarks do not have any supernatural ability.
