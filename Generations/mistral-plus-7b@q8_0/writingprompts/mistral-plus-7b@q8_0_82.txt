290 miles above Earth. As a test pilot, she was one of several people sent to Mars under the supervision of the world's leading space agency. They were tasked with discovering if the red planet could be habitable by humans in the future. The team worked for almost two years, and their findings showed that indeed there was potential to make Mars liveable. It was this research that led NASA to declare its intentions of sending an astronaut to colonize the planet within 20 years. 
 
 But then came the scandal. It started when Ania's team leader suddenly resigned from his position in the middle of a press conference, alleging that he had been forced to sign off on unethical experiments that put the lives of his crew members at risk. The controversy only grew from there, with Ania herself being accused of covering up these dangerous experiments and concealing their results. The resulting backlash caused NASA to cancel its plans for a Mars mission and shut down all future space exploration projects until the matter could be properly investigated. 
 
 Two years later, after an extensive investigation into the situation by both NASA and outside organizations, no conclusive evidence was found linking Ania with any wrongdoing. The agency eventually decided to reinstate her position as a test pilot and allowed her to continue working on their next mission: a manned mission to Mars. But now, as she sat in front of the screen receiving that message, she knew it would be the last time she would ever return to Earth. 
 
 The words flashed again across her monitor: Are you sure? 
 Yes, she was sure. She had been working towards this moment her entire life. It was time for her to leave Earth and embark on the journey of a lifetime - a voyage to another planet that would change her forever. She knew there were risks involved, but she was ready to take them anyway. She hit the confirm button and the words `` Mission Control, please confirm landing coordinates'' appeared on the screen. 
 
 Ania took a deep breath and stared at the stars beyond the window of the spacecraft. Her mind raced with anticipation and fear, but she knew this was her chance to finally achieve her dream of exploring a new world. She had come too far to turn back now. The countdown began and as they approached their destination, Ania felt both excitement and trepidation at what lay ahead. 
 
 With one last look out the window at Earth, she closed her eyes and prepared for landing.
