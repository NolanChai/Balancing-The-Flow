, the state would have a lottery. The odds of winning were more than 100,000,000 to one! But it happened. And it couldn't have come at a better time.
`` You're just as rich as Donald Trump,'' said my friend. ``And you didn't have to give any money away to get there.'' 
 
 I guess he was right. And yet, it doesn't quite seem real. I mean, here I am living in a trailer with no hot water or air conditioning and suddenlyâ€¦all of this. But at least I can afford to put my son through college now. He wanted to be an architect but we didn't have enough money for tuition. 
`` You know,'' he said when he heard about the lottery, ``if you win, I'll go to a good school and then I'll give you half of whatever I earn as payment.'' 
 
 So that made everything worthwhile. But I still have one more thing on my mind before we celebrate this windfall. Whoever won the other half?
