ops, it looks like there might be ants in the milk carton. This is probably a good time to point out that I haven’t touched this milk carton in at least two weeks, if not more. So, yes, this milk carton is most likely infested with ants, which means I need to throw it away and buy new milk. * 
 
 *Oh my god! It looks like this plate has a layer of mold growing on top of it. Again, I didn’t wash off that ketchup last week, so no surprise there. But still, if we don’t want to contract some weird disease from the mold spores, we need to throw this damn plate away and buy a new one. * 
 
 *And then there are these stinky plates. They smell like rotting food, and they have a lot of dried-up food on them. These need to be washed right now or else we’ll end up with mold growing on the plates as well. We definitely don’t want that, so let’s take some soap and water and scrub those suckers clean ASAP! * 
 
 *Oh boy, we’ve got a problem here. One of our plates looks like it might be cracked in half. That means there is probably an open crack somewhere on the plate that could cause bacteria to grow inside. To avoid getting sick from eating off this cracked plate, we need to replace it with a new one ASAP! * 
 
 *Last but not least, I forgot about these dirty dishes! We definitely need to wash them immediately because they’re covered in food bits and gunk that can attract bacteria if left untreated for too long. Let’s get some hot water and soap and scrub those bad boys clean before putting them back on the countertop so we don’t have any problems with germs or disease later down the line!
