-surely it couldn't be him? No way, no fucking way! I just... I don't want that to be him. He doesn't deserve this after everything we went through together. But if he is here then at least I should greet him properly. You can't avoid what you feel for a person like this.* 

 **It seems that no matter where I go, it will always be there... the pain... the guilt... and the regret.** 
 
 *The feeling of being torn between two different worlds. On one hand I still love him dearly and am grateful to him for everything he's done for me. On the other hand, I know that we're so fundamentally different that our relationship cannot ever work out properly. It is this conflict within myself that makes it so hard for me to decide what to do.* 
 
 **No matter which path I choose, I will be forced to deal with the consequences of my decision. If I stay with him, then we will both be unhappy because our views are incompatible and eventually our love will fade away. If I leave him, then he will be hurt and disappointed by my decision and it could potentially lead to resentment.** 

*In the end, it is up to me to make the right choice for myself. I have to take into account all the risks involved in either option and decide what is best for both of us in the long run.*
