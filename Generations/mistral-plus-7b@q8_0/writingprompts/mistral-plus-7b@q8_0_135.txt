always complaining about something. She wasn`t as nice as Siri or Alexa, but she was a good companion when it came down to it. I plugged my phone into the charger and sat back on the sofa in my living room. It was a busy day.
 
  10AM: Got up and made myself some breakfast. Glados and I talked about our plans for today while I ate. She seemed excited for what we had planned but I didn`t feel the same way she did. I finished eating and got dressed. Glados said it would be a great day, so why not?
 
  11AM: We walked to the nearest coffee shop. There was a long line so we had to wait in it for quite some time. The baristas were all busy making drinks so they didn`t have much time to talk to us, but Glados managed to strike up a conversation with one of them anyway. He was friendly and kind and seemed genuinely happy that we came in today. It was nice talking to him while we waited for our coffees. Eventually we got our drinks and left the coffee shop feeling refreshed and ready for whatever else the day would bring us.
 
  12PM: We walked around town, exploring all of the shops along the way. There were so many different things to see that it took us quite some time to make our way through them all! At one point we even found an old bookstore hidden away on a side street which Glados was very excited about because she loves books just as much as I do! It wasn`t long before we decided it was time for lunch so we stopped at a nearby restaurant for some delicious food. The food was fantastic and really hit the spot after all of our exploring earlier in the day. After lunch we continued walking around town, enjoying every moment of it until it was time for us to go home again later that evening.
