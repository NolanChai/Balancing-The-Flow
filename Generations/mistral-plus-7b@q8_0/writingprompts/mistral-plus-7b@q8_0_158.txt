overty stricken city.

The streets were clean and smooth. The buildings were tall, majestic and perfectly maintained. He couldn't remember a time he'd seen such a lack of dirt and filth in one place. Everything was so pristine, as if the people here had some sort of strange power to keep their city like this. There weren't any holes in the concrete pavement and not a single piece of trash on the side walk. The roads were smooth and well-maintained, unlike the pot hole ridden dirt pathways he'd become so used to in his old town.

"It looks beautiful doesn't it?" His father asked with an expression of pure joy, almost as if he'd found a new lease on life. Mike nodded slowly, taking in every detail of their surroundings. He had to admit, the city was spectacular. It was a sight he'd never seen before. It was something out of a fairy tale.

"This place is so nice." He muttered, looking down at his feet in amazement. He couldn't remember ever having anything so nice. They didn't even have sidewalks where he lived, much less streets as smooth as this. The buildings were so tall, Mike had to crane his neck just to see the top of them all. Not only that, but they weren't falling apart like the ones in the town he was used to either. Everything looked new and well-cared for. It was unlike anything he had ever seen before.

"It really is something isn't it?" His dad agreed with a small smile. "But, there are some things you need to know about this city." He said as they continued down the street. Mike nodded, eagerly waiting for whatever news his father might have for him. It was unlike anything he had ever seen or heard of before in his life and he wanted to soak it all in.

"First of all..." His dad paused, turning around to look at Mike. "This place is very wealthy. In fact, it's the richest city in the country. Most people here have money to spare, not only that but they know how to use it." He explained with a smile, gesturing around them as he spoke. It was hard for Mike to believe such a place could exist. His entire life had been spent living in poverty and he'd never even dreamed of something like this.

"Second..." His dad continued, "The people here are very friendly and welcoming. They want you to feel at home here." He said with a smile as they walked through the busy streets. The people all around them waved and smiled, giving Mike an uneasy feeling. It was unlike anything he'd ever seen before in his life. People were actually happy here? They didn't look scared or afraid like everyone back in his hometown. Everyone had such a warm expression on their face, as if they truly cared about what was going on around them. It was almost too much for Mike to take in at once.

"Third..." His dad said as they continued down the street. "The rules here are very strict. If you break any laws or don't follow the rules, you will be punished." He explained, looking serious for a moment before returning to his cheerful expression. Mike nodded, taking in every word his father was saying. This place seemed so different from anything he had ever experienced before and he was eager to learn as much as he could about it.

"Fourth..." His dad continued, "The people here are very wealthy and they expect everyone else to be the same way." He explained with a smile. Mike nodded again, understanding what his father was saying. Everyone in this city seemed so rich and well-off that it was difficult for him to even comprehend it. The idea of having so much money was something he had never even dreamed of before.

"Finally..." His dad said with a grin, "This place is amazing! It's beautiful, friendly and full of opportunity. It truly is an incredible place." He said with a smile. Mike couldn't help but agree with his father. This place was unlike anything he had ever seen before in his life. The people were so kind and welcoming, the streets were clean and well-maintained, and there were endless opportunities for everyone who lived here. It truly was an incredible place to live.
