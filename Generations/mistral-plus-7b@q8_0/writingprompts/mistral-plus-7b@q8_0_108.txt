The world is turning around and around with each passing day. Some people are having their minds twisted into knots by all this. They don't even know what's going on anymore or why things happened the way they did. All they see in their mind's eye is some politician lying to them, another one deceiving them. Some are saying that nothing will change until we fix our political system, others say that nothing will change no matter what we do. Both sides can be right sometimes, it all depends on the person and their outlook on life.
 
 The truth is that most people are sick of this circus. They don't want to hear about another scandal or see yet another politician get caught with their hand in the cookie jar. They just want someone who will represent them fairly and honestly, someone who truly cares for all citizens equally. Unfortunately, we live in an era where it seems like that kind of leader is hard to find. Many people are choosing to stay away from politics altogether because they feel discouraged by the whole mess. But we need more than ever now for everyone to get involved and make their voices heard if we want real change to happen. We must not give up hope, despite how bad things might seem at times. Change always takes time, but it can only come with the collective action of those who want it most.
