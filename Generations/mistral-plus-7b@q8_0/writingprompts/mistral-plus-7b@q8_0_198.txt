ank, there were no fans, and we all had to watch the game from home, while in isolation with our families. 
 
 
 That’s right it was March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic hit us, and we all went into lockdown.  It was the start of a very stressful time for us all, and I wasn’t too sure how we would cope with this new way of life.  
 
 
 There were lots of changes, but one thing that never changed for me, was my love of football.  Despite the fact we couldn’t go to the games, I still made sure I tuned in each week and supported the boys as best as I could from home.  

It wasn’t easy, but with the help of some amazing friends and family, we managed to get through it all.  We had our ups and downs, but in the end, I think it was for the best.  The world needed a break from the craziness that was going on, and we all learned something new about ourselves during this difficult time.  

When it finally came to an end, I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.  The football season started again, and for me, there was nothing better than cheering our team on from the stands once again.  The atmosphere at the games was electric, and it really helped to bring us all back together after such a tough time.  

While we may have gone through some difficult times during this pandemic, I know that it has made us all stronger as a club and as a community.  I am so proud of how far we’ve come, and I know that we will continue to overcome any challenges that come our way.
