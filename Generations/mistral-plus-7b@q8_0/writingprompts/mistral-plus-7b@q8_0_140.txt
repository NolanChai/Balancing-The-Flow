It looked like he might have been a king or prince at one point, but now he was just a tiny, pathetic figure hunched over in the corner. I considered trying to talk to him and see if he needed any assistance, but then I realized that it would be difficult to communicate with someone who was so small. Instead, I just made sure that he had a comfortable place to sit and that there was enough space for him. The elevator ride was quiet for the most part, except for the occasional grunt or groan from the tiny man in the corner. When we finally reached our destination, I opened the doors and let him out first. He seemed grateful for the help and stumbled off into the hallway. I felt a little bit of sadness for him as he disappeared around the corner. It made me realize that even though life can be tough and challenging sometimes, there are still kind people out there who are willing to lend a helping hand when we need it most.
