'* this morning... 
 
 God, I hate the smell of wet plaster. And my roommate is such a fucking prick. This is so fucking unfair, man. The only reason he's even living here for free in the first place was because I've been sick and couldn't afford to pay the rent on our apartment myself. 
 
 I mean, yeah... I'm probably gonna have to sue him for damages. It's just that... we don't really have the cash to go through a lawsuit right now. And my roommate is such an ass-wipe, he probably wouldn't even pay if we won. 
 
 Plus... I might be in the hospital for months, and if my health gets worse then I might die. And... and that would mean... I'd have to take him with me to the afterlife! That's just not fair. Why do such horrible things always seem to happen to people like me? 
 
 Damnit. It hurts so fucking much. I don't know how long it will be before the doctors can fix my face, or even if they ever can... My mouth is totally wired shut at the moment and all I'm able to do is moan and cry in pain. 
 
 I need a drink. Some painkillers. Anything to ease this terrible suffering. 
 
 The doctors said that I was very lucky, considering what I went through... but goddamn does it feel like I've been cursed instead of blessed. It's not supposed to be like this. I can barely move or talk. I can't even eat food without having to spit it back out again. And every time I try to breathe, it feels like my throat is on fire... 
 
 Why does everything suck so much for me? If only the universe would just cut me some slack.
