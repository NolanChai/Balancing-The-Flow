? He’s been playing guitar since his 8th birthday, so he knows what he’s talking about. However, it is not my style. I can play the bass. In fact, I am pretty good at it, but I have never felt a need to do more than mess around with it. Ethan has a band that plays several times a month, and he always asks if I want to play bass on some songs with them. I turn him down every time. Why? Because the bass is not my instrument.
 
 The other day I decided to take up guitar for real this time. I am very serious about it. My first thought when I made that decision was, “I have a bass sitting in the corner.” I have been playing for quite a while, and my skill level is pretty good. If I decide to play an instrument, it only makes sense to do so with one that I know. So why am I doing this? Why would I waste time on a hobby that I already have? Because I love the guitar.
 
 It was the same with drums. When I first decided that I wanted to play drums, it didn’t even cross my mind that I had been playing bass for several years at that point. Bass is the most versatile instrument out there. You can do so much on a four-stringed bass. However, after playing drums for almost two years now, I have become convinced that the drums are what I need to focus on.
 
 It’s not easy to make a decision like this. You have to consider your strengths and weaknesses, but you also need to understand where your heart is leading you. If you feel that you could be better at something else than what you do now, don’t hesitate to give it a try. The worst thing that can happen is that you will fail miserably or discover that it wasn’t worth the effort after all. Either way, it won’t hurt to take the risk.
