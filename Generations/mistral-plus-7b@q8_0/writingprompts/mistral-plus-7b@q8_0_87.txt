g h to save me. Not this time. I had only minutes left to live. To reflect on the mistakes that led me here. The things I should have done differently. To forgive myself for not being perfect enough to escape such a fate. And then, after those precious few minutes of reflection, to simply let go.
 
 So it goes. 
 
I had been running from the law for days. Hiding in abandoned buildings and alleyways like a rat. Scrounging for food in trash bins and begging for coins on street corners to buy a cup of coffee, anything to keep me awake through the night. Sleep was a luxury I could no longer afford.
 
 The chase had been intense. Detectives everywhere, following every lead, searching every nook and cranny with ruthless efficiency. But they didn't know it was me, they thought I was someone else. Someone more dangerous than I was. It was just bad luck that led them to my doorstep.
 
 As the seconds ticked down and the red numbers glared at me, I could feel my heart racing. My mind raced with thoughts of desperation and fear. What would happen if they caught me? Would they shoot me dead on the street like a common criminal? Or would they lock me up in some jail cell for the rest of my life? The thought of being trapped behind bars filled me with an overwhelming sense of dread.
 
 But even as the countdown continued and the red lights seemed to be closing in on me, I knew that I had no choice but to keep running. Because even if they did catch me, I would never stop fighting. I would fight for my freedom, for justice and for the right to live life on my own terms.
 
 So, with a deep breath and an iron resolve, I kept running. Faster and faster until the countdown reached zero and I heard the loud bang of gunfire in the distance. I knew then that they had gotten me, but I also knew that I had put up one hell of a fight. And when they came for me, I would be ready to keep fighting. Because no matter what, I would never give up on myself.
