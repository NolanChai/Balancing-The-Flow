usted gore and dripping a crimson mess onto the stone floor. A battle axe whose haft had been broken and hastily repaired with rivets stood next to it, its teeth dulled by time and lack of use. A mace that was too long for him hung from his shoulder and made a constant rattling noise whenever he moved. The sword in his hand was a gift from the gods and his prized weapon, but he also carried a dagger strapped to his waist just in case things got hairy. His shield had been fashioned from the remains of a fallen foe, its metal blackened with soot and scorched by countless fires.
 
 The armor that protected his body was made from iron and leather, all polished until it gleamed in the light. He wore no helmet or hat as he did not like anything on his head. His long hair flowed down past his shoulders and would've reached to his waist if it weren't for the occasional braid.
 
 All in all, he looked a frightening sight; battle-ready and determined. But he wasn't ready to face what was waiting for him on the other side of that door just yet. He stood at attention, not wanting to move any further towards it than he had to. His eyes scanned over every detail of his surroundings until they came back to rest upon a small scroll with some writing that made no sense to anyone but him.
 
 "What does this mean?" He murmured under his breath as he slowly read each word aloud: "The chosen one will come when the time is right, bringing balance and justice to all those who live in darkness."
