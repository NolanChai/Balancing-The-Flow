ed and there were no beds to be found anywhere within a 3 hour radius of Denver. I stayed with my brother who is a wonderful host. We spent a day together going on hikes, eating great food and exploring the city. He was able to show me some hidden treasures in his neighborhood that made for great photos.

He lives near Boulder which is just northwest of Denver. Itâ€™s an incredible city surrounded by nature, hiking trails and mountains. The landscape is stunningly beautiful and I am so happy I had the opportunity to spend time there with him. I hope to get back there in the future so that I can explore more of the area.
