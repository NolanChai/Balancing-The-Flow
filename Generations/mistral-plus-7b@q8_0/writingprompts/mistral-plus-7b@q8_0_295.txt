guishing over the decisions that led me here and pondering my next move. I have a desire for peace, freedom and the ability to make choices. It’s not much to ask but it is so far from my reality at this moment in time. I’ve learned that life is about compromise and sometimes you have to choose your battles wisely. But when you find yourself on the precipice of a decision that will alter the course of your existence, it becomes difficult to decide what choice to make.  I feel as if I am stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. On one hand, there is comfort in remaining where I am. It’s safe and predictable; on the other hand, I don’t want to wake up years from now still trying to figure out who I am, wondering how things could have been so different if only I had made a different choice. So, what do I choose? What is it that my heart truly wants? The truth is, I can’t answer that for myself because I don’t know. I can tell you what I think I want and what I fear but deep down inside there are still so many unanswered questions.
