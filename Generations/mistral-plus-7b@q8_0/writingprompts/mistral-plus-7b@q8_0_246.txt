è. The doctor who sat across from me had been talking for nearly 40 minutes about what he would do to help me with this disease called depression. He spoke of pills, vitamins and a few other things that I could not understand. As he finished his sentence I interrupted him by saying “I don’t want any of these treatments” in a rather stern voice. The doctor looked at me for a moment then said something that would stick with me forever. He simply asked “Why?”

It was then I knew what I wanted to do, or more accurately what I needed to do. It is now 2016 and I am writing about my experience as a person of color with depression and how I overcame it by making the decision to heal myself naturally. The problem that most people face when they suffer from depression is the fear of taking pills for their illness. These fears are justified because many times antidepressants can cause more harm than good. They often lead to suicidal thoughts or in some cases even worse side effects. I have seen this happen and it scared me off pills almost instantly.

## What are Antidepressants?

Antidepressants are a form of medication that is prescribed for people who suffer from depression or other mental health disorders. These drugs work by altering the brain chemistry in order to increase serotonin levels, which helps improve mood and reduce symptoms of depression. There are several different types of antidepressant medications available, including SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), SNRIs (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) and tricyclics. Each type has its own unique side effects but all can provide relief for those suffering from depression. However, despite their potential benefits, it is important to be aware of the risks associated with these drugs before taking them. It is always a good idea to discuss any concerns or questions you may have about taking an antidepressant with your doctor first in order to make sure it’s safe for you to do so.
