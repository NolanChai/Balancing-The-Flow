Maybe I would also get a better view of this island, but first I need to make it to the top. I take another breath and pull myself up higher. My hands feel slick with sweat and I slip back down.

I grab a large rock and use it as leverage to help me get my footing on a foothold. Once I am standing again, I keep climbing upward. As I reach the top of the cliff, I catch my breath and look around. My plane had landed in a clearing within the dense forest that surrounded this island. It wasnâ€™t a very large clearing, but it was enough to land and get off of the plane.

The plane sits in the center of the clearing looking more like a big metal box than an airplane. The trees are so close around us that they almost seem to be leaning in towards the plane. As I look closer at my surroundings, I see that we are surrounded by trees on all sides except for where I had just climbed up the cliff side from. The rest of the island is covered with trees. There is a small river running through the center of the clearing and down into the forest.

The plane itself looks to be in good condition, which is surprising given the amount of damage it took when we crash landed. I am not sure how long it would take for us to get off this island if we wanted to leave, but at least I now know that my plane had made it safely down here with me and everyone else inside.
