if I put in the effort to get things done instead of just thinking about getting things done?

I decided that the only way for me to change this unhealthy pattern was to write down a plan to accomplish what I needed to do. Writing a plan for accomplishment is not difficult but it does require some thought. It requires that you ask yourself certain questions: What are your priorities? How will you prioritize these tasks? What are the steps necessary to complete each task? How much time should you allot to each step?

Once I sat down with my journal and wrote down a plan for what I needed to do, I felt a sense of peace and calmness. For once, I had a clear path ahead of me instead of just a vague idea of where I wanted to go.
