esta before turning back towards our planet.  The rocket was an old one, launched in a rush by desperate scientists who knew that they wouldn't have another chance.
It had been on its way for several months before we picked it up, heading for the edge of Saturn where we could capture it with our own gravity. We couldn't pull it all the way in but there would be time to pick through what was left when it came crashing into our atmosphere.
 
 It took a couple more months for the rocket to come close enough that we could begin picking out what was inside. We had to wait even longer for the pieces of the ship to make their way down through the atmosphere. A few weeks after that, we started sending teams up in atmospheric balloons to go pick up whatever they could.
 
 The first thing anyone found was a small plastic box. It didn't appear to be damaged but when it was opened we discovered that it contained a piece of paper and a pen. Someone thoughtfully labeled the container "Messages from Earth". Inside, someone had written a note about their favorite football team and another about the latest album by some new band. There were also a few notes with drawings on them of flowers, cats and other simple things. One of the messages read simply: "I love you Mom."
 
 We opened up as many containers as we could find. Some of them were empty. Others contained tools, batteries and pieces of computer equipment that didn't work anymore. There was also a lot of food and drink left behind, all of it long past its expiration date.  For the most part though, it looked like these people had been in quite a hurry when they had left.
 
 We never found out what happened to them but we have their messages and we know that they were not alone. There are dozens of other ships heading our way right now, each one carrying the hopes and dreams of those who sent them. And as far away as it is, each one will eventually end up here.
