One is dressed like a priest. He has on robes and carries a cross. Lucia tries to remember everything that she knows about these people. She remembers being told that they are the ones who stole her people ’ s land. The ancestors warned us not to trust them because they would take what we had.

She sees the fear in her eyes and knows that she feels the same. They both know that their life has changed forever.
