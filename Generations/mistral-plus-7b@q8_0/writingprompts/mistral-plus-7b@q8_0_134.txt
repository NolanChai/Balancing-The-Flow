5 large rat carcasses were placed in front of me. The bounty hunter was always full of promises and yet he never kept his word. I made sure to pay him before any killing took place but for some reason he would always leave one rat alive. It was probably his favourite one, the one he wanted to keep as a pet. As I walked through the large town square in which the market had taken place I could see that the sun was starting to set. It was getting darker and my grip on the bag of rats grew tighter. If there was one thing I hate it is rats, especially ones with rabies.

``'Why did you pay for rats?'' I asked the bounty hunter, as we sat together in a small booth in an even smaller inn. ``'Rabid ones' he said, waving his hands around as if to explain something. The bounty hunters voice was always calm, always happy and yet I couldn't help but feel that he was hiding something from me. Something important. ``'I paid you to kill them not keep them as pets' I snapped back at him. His face turned white as a sheet before going red in anger. He had never been angry with me before, even after I found out about the rabid rats.

``'You are right' he said, his voice trembling slightly. ``'I should have known that you would not want any of them back alive. So please accept my apologies and let this be a lesson to you, always check what your bounty hunters do before you pay for their services'' The bounty hunter looked at me with a sad face but I did not care, he deserved every bit of abuse that I threw his way. He stood up and left the inn without so much as a backward glance. As soon as he was gone I grabbed my bag of rats and ran out of the inn as fast as I could, determined to get rid of those nasty little creatures once and for all.
