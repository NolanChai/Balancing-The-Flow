striches can fly and mermaids are real. These little fairy tales keep things stable in the world because people don ’ t think too much about what really happens in the night, and most importantly they don ’ t go looking for it.

Cerys is a scholar at the Hall of Legends, cataloging these stories and making sure the legends stay where they belong: in the imagination. But when her sister loses control of her powers and causes a scene, Cerys must find a way to repair the damage. This brings her face-to-face with magic, myths and monsters she had only dreamt of, and as the world becomes increasingly more dangerous, she finds herself at the center of it all.

Sometimes when you’re reading books about fantastical worlds and creatures, they seem to get stale after a while. Sometimes they seem unimaginative or just plain boring. That was not the case with The Legends of Madeleine LaRoux by Melissa de la Cruz. I found this book absolutely captivating from the beginning!

I enjoyed the mystery surrounding this story, and how it unfolds over time. Cerys is an incredibly brave character, who fights against everything that is thrown at her. She has a great personality and isn’t afraid to stand up for what she believes in even if she knows there might be consequences. I also loved the characters of Balthazar and Archie. They were so charming and witty! Their banter was hilarious at times as well as sweet moments between them too which made them even more lovable than before. Overall, The Legends of Madeleine LaRoux was such an enjoyable read that I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fast-paced magical adventure with relatable characters!
