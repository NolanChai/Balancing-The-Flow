out from behind the door, barely moving my lips to even produce sound, I have a sore throat after all, so much talking has taken its toll on my vocal chords. I was actually wondering who it would be, the doorbell doesn't ring unless it's important or at least semi-important. A man in a grey suit with black rimmed glasses is standing on my doorstep, looking around nervously. He seems to have some sort of agenda.
>  "Hello sir," he greets me with a nervous smile, "My name is John Smith, I work for the Postal Service."
>  "Ah yes, the postman," I reply, nodding and gesturing for him to come in, "I was wondering when you would show up. What do you need?"
>  "We recently discovered a problem with your address here, it has been misspelled on our computers and we have not been able to send any letters or packages to this house because of that."
>  I rub the back of my neck and nod. "I understand completely, I'm very sorry about that. I will make sure to take care of the situation immediately."
>  The postman smiles again, revealing a row of crooked teeth. "No problem! We are very happy to help in any way we can. Just let us know if you have any further questions or concerns and we would be more than happy to assist you however possible." He hands me a pamphlet on the importance of having a properly maintained address and then turns to leave.
>  I thank him for his time and apologize once again for the inconvenience caused by my own mistake. He shrugs it off with another nervous smile and heads back down my front steps, getting into a waiting delivery truck and driving away. As he leaves, I turn to look at the pamphlet in my hand. It seems like such a simple thing to take care of something as trivial as an address but somehow it completely slipped my mind until now. I know it's not worth worrying about anymore though; I can fix this problem easily and quickly before any further issues arise.
