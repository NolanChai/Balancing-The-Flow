couple of metres wide, a single chair in its centre, a small table with a cup of water and some bread beside it, the walls covered with the ancient script, symbols which meant nothing to him and yet contained more information than he could comprehend in a lifetime. A door at one end, and beyond the door, nothing but blackness. He had waited years for this moment; now was the time.
He had come here for answers, for proof of what he had studied his entire life, for evidence that what he believed to be true really was. Now was the time to face whatever lay beyond the door and to find out if what he had spent his life preparing for would actually happen or if it would all end in nothingness. He stood up, took a deep breath, and opened the door.
What he saw next sent a shiver down his spine that left him trembling. It was a cavern, a vast space filled with towering pillars of rock and a ceiling so high he couldn’t see the top even when standing on tiptoe. The floor was smooth stone, polished to a high gloss by eons of water flowing from the roof and washing over it. The only light came from a shaft in one corner which allowed dim moonlight to filter down into the cavern, but there were no signs of life, nothing stirring at all in this huge expanse of stone and rock. He called out a few times but there was no response, so he slowly made his way through the space, hoping against hope that something would answer him.
After what seemed like an eternity of walking without any sign of life or movement, he collapsed to his knees in exhaustion. He was certain now that this journey had been a waste of time, that there really were no answers here after all, and that he had come for nothing. His heart sank into the pit of his stomach as he realised that perhaps he had wasted years of his life, chasing after something that didn’t exist. Just as he was about to give up hope completely, a voice echoed through the cavern. “Who comes here?” it asked in a deep and commanding tone. He looked around but saw no one; there wasn’t even an echo of any sound. The voice seemed to come from all around him at once yet nowhere specific at all. “I am here in search of answers,” he replied, his voice trembling with fear and uncertainty.
The voice responded: “You have found them, my child. The answers lie within you. You must learn to listen to your heart and trust your instincts if you hope to uncover the truth of what lies before you.” With those words spoken, the voice disappeared into silence once again. He sat for a moment, trying to take in what he had just heard; it was as if someone had unlocked some deep part of his soul that he never knew existed before now. He knew now that the answers were within him all along – he had simply been too blinded by fear and uncertainty to see them clearly.
Now he understood: all those years of studying had not been a waste after all; they were merely preparation for this moment, when he would finally discover what his life’s purpose truly was. He stood up with renewed confidence, ready now to face whatever challenges lay ahead because he knew deep down inside himself that he could do it – he just had to have faith in himself and trust his intuition above all else.
