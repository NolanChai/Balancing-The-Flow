set, there was always a lot of people at the pubs. It â€™ s not every day when we have an alarm system to warn us of possible danger, so it is natural that people get excited and want to know what happens. There were a few minutes of panic, but after a while everyone calmed down and started talking about what they would do in case of attack. Some suggested that we should stay calm and be ready for anything. Others thought that we should evacuate the area immediately. But no one knew exactly how much time was left before the attack. All that was left to do was wait and hope for the best.
