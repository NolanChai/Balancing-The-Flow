into what a search engine knows about me from tracking every single move of mine online for the past year! Now I am getting ads in my web browser that are tailored to my interests. This is creepy. And now there's a new problem: What do I do when I go to an app and I see an ad for something I have already bought?

It turns out this is not an uncommon experience. Apparently, if you buy something online it can be used against you in advertising later on. As The Wall Street Journal reports, ``The data collected by advertisers and ad tech companies about your purchases from one site often end up being shared with other sites to help create a detailed profile of what you're buying.''

So if you buy something online or at a retail store you become vulnerable to ads for the same product, even if you already own it. It's all part of the business model of advertising and tracking consumers. As Wired explains: ``Advertisers need to know as much about us as possible. So they track our every move on the Internetâ€”and then they use that data to show us ads. This has made advertising more efficient, but also a lot creepier.''

So, what can you do about this? There are two main things you can do. The first thing is to be aware of how much personal information you are giving out and try to limit it as much as possible. For example, don't use location services on your phone unless absolutely necessary and avoid using any apps that track your browsing history or behavior. The second thing you can do is install ad blockers and privacy protection software on your computer, phone, and other devices. This will help prevent third parties from tracking your online activity.
