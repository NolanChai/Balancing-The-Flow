icced her on the spot, pushing her away from my baby boy, ``Go and put some ice on it.'' She slunk back down the hallway, and then came back with an ice pack wrapped in a tea towel.  Wealthy was still crying, but not so much now, just a bit of whimpering.
 
 `` It's okay,'' I said, ``let me see that leg.'' I unwrapped the tea towel from the ice pack and examined his knee. No obvious damage; it didn't seem to be bleeding either.
 
`` What happened?'' I asked Wealthy.  He was still crying a little bit, but he seemed okay, ``What happened, bud?'' He looked up at me with tears in his eyes, and told me he fell down the stairs.
 
`` Why did you fall down the stairs?'' I asked him.
 
`` I was running,'' he said, still crying a little bit. ``I was playing hide-and-seek with Bites People, and she tagged me, so I started to run back into the house and then I tripped over something.'' He pointed at his leg, which had a very faint mark from where it hit the corner of one of the steps, but no obvious damage.  ``I didn't see what I fell over, but I think it was your old exercise ball that was sitting near the stairs.''
 
`` Yes,'' I said, ``I noticed that this morning when I was putting some dishes away. It must have rolled down from up on the landing. I'll need to move it somewhere safer.''

Bites People came back in then, holding the ice pack and looking worried about the whole situation.  She handed the ice pack over to me, ``Sorry,'' she said, ``I didn't even think he could get hurt falling down those stairs.''
