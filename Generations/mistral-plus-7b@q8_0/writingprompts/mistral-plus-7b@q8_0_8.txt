Oh yes, sorry. I didn't know it was your dad, I've been calling you 'Phil','' said Phil. 
 
 ``  It is okay, I understand. You are still getting used to us,'' said Greg. 
 
 ``  Yeah, you have a weird name.'' 
 
 ``  Yes, my name is Gregory, but most people call me Greg. Now that we are more comfortable with each other I guess it is okay if you just call me Phil too, since my name really is Philip. Just don't do it in front of anyone else. My friends still think I am just plain old Phil.'' 
 
 ``  Okay, Phil it is then,'' said Greg. He laughed and looked over at his son. They were both tired after a long night out the evening before, but they had still managed to get up early enough to shovel the driveway. Their wives had left for work an hour earlier, but they wanted to get the snow cleared before they went inside to eat breakfast. 
 
 `` So how do you like living in this little sub-urban town so far?'' asked Greg. 
 
 `` Well, it is not as exciting as I thought it would be when we moved here.'' said Phil with a chuckle. 
 
 `` What did you expect?'' asked Greg. 
 
 ``  I don't know exactly. I guess I expected more excitement than this. My parents are always traveling around and going to fancy places for vacation, so I figured our new life would be like that too.'' 
 
 ``  Don't get me wrong, Phil. This is a great place to live. It has good schools and friendly people. But if you want excitement and adventure then you need to go out into the world. You are just starting college now so you have lots of time to see new places.'' 

 ``  I guess you are right,'' said Phil with a smile. `` And maybe I was expecting too much. We will make this place our home for now, and when we feel like it is time to move on then we can go somewhere else. I am sure there are lots of places in the world that would be just as exciting or even more so.'' 
 
 Greg smiled at his son with pride. Phil was growing up into such a bright young man. They had only lived here for a few months but he already seemed to have found his place in this new community. He made friends easily and was always eager to try something new. Greg couldn't wait to see what kind of adventures they would go on together as father and son in the years ahead.
