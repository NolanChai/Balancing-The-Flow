criminal career. So why not do one last thing? That was when I had finally decided that my next crime would be arson.

I had spent years trying to find the perfect place to set fire too. This was the perfect day and the perfect time for it. I found the perfect building in an abandoned suburb on the outskirts of the city. It was an old, dilapidated, condemned factory that I knew would burn nicely if lit properly. So I went to work gathering the materials needed to start the fire. I had two cans of gasoline, two matches, a lighter, and a torch. Everything I needed.

I walked inside the building, making sure no one was there. It was completely empty save for some old rusted machinery. I placed the gasoline around the entire building, filling every nook and cranny with it. Once that was done I took out my matches and lit them up. Then, without a second thought, I threw them onto the puddles of gasoline. The fire instantly ignited.

The flames started to spread quickly throughout the factory. Soon the entire building was engulfed in flames. Satisfied with my work, I walked out of the building and watched it burn from afar. It took about 30 minutes for the fire department to arrive and extinguish the blaze.

I stood there proudly, knowing that I had finally accomplished all that I wanted to do. I was an arsonist, a criminal, and a badass. That was something that I would never forget.
