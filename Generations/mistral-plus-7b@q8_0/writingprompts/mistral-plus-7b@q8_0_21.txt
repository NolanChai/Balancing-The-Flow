ing'' children by starvation, it had happened before. In fact, my boss thought this was going to be an easy case because the hospital denied all charges, they told him he was crazy.
 
 `` No she needs to learn that her body isn't her own, and if I can teach her to deny food then she will understand.'' He replied, a smug smile on his face. The look in his eyes scared me more than any demon ever could, the thought of this man actually doing anything like that to a child was unimaginable to me, yet he believed it so strongly and so passionately that it made my skin crawl.
 
 `` What will she learn from being starved? She'll be afraid of food, she'll become anorexic!'' I yelled. ``She needs to learn self control and respect for others.'' He said with a smirk. ``You can't force her to do anything by starving her! You're torturing her! It's not right, it's against the law!'' I shouted. ``It's for her own good.'' He said again, the same phrase he had been using over and over again. He seemed to believe in himself so strongly that nothing could make him change his mind, no matter how many times I told him what he was doing was wrong.
 
 In the end we had to take the girl from him, she was just a baby really, only two years old and already showing signs of malnutrition. She didn't seem afraid of us when we took her away, but she was so thin that you could see every bone in her body. The doctors told us that if he hadn't been stopped then she would have died within a few more months. I couldn't believe that someone could be so cruel to an innocent child like that, it broke my heart knowing that there were people like him out there who didn't care about anyone but themselves. I just hope and pray that something can be done so that no other child has to go through what she did.
