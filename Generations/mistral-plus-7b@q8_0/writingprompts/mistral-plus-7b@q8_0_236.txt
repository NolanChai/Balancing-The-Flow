and Twitter were a-buzz with status updates like "I love you!", "OMG It's so beautiful out there!", "It feels so nice not to be in my cubicle" and more than a few exclamations of "This is the best day EVER!"

Sadly, not everyone felt this way. For some it was just another Tuesday. And for those folks, the following will apply:

You were in a meeting when you realized that the sun was out and it was n't raining. The first few days of spring are usually filled with bright colors and warm breezes that cause humans to smile, but this wasn't the case for you. You were in a stuffy office with some of your coworkers, listening to a presentation that was neither informative nor entertaining. Somewhere in between the speaker talking about her vacation plans and the person sitting next to you asking if it's okay to take off his shoes because he has "smelly feet", you realized the sun was out.

You looked at your coworkers to see if anyone else seemed to notice. Everyone around you sat still, taking notes or looking intently into their laptops as if nothing were different. You felt a sense of dread come over you and wondered how much longer you had to sit through this nonsense. The presenter finished up her slides and took some questions from the audience. After about 20 minutes, she wrapped up and everyone began packing up to leave for the day.

As soon as you were able to get out of that room, you ran outside in hopes of feeling that fresh spring air on your face and maybe taking in a few sun rays. Instead, all you could see were gray clouds blocking out any chance at having some vitamin D or seeing blue skies. Your heart sunk into your chest as you realized yet another day had gone by without enjoying anything about it.

You made your way back to your desk with an empty feeling inside; like something was missing from the day that could have made it so much better if only the sun would have been shining down on everyone's faces instead of hiding behind those pesky clouds.
