ay, another thing to add to my list of things I didn't have to pay for. The water is cold, but not as cold as he expected from a lake so far north. He finds the beach and starts towards it at an easy jog. It's going to be a long trip back home, he knows, but if he stops now it will only get worse later.
 
 Once he gets on dry land, he runs into the woods, letting instinct take over as he picks up his pace, ditching his wet clothes and getting ready for the run of his life.
