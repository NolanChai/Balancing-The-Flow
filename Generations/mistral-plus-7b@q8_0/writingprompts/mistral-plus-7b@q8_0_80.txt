aize why your father and I had to leave.
     The government of our country is in the hands of men who have no interest in keeping us free. They are afraid of a group called the People's Alliance, and they think they can stop them by taking away all our rights. They have already taken away most of our freedom of speech, and they want to take away the right to gather in peaceable assembly. Soon they will come for our guns. It is only a matter of time before they try to take away everything we hold dear.
     That is why your father and I had to leave. We don't want you growing up in a world where people like us are treated as criminals just because we believe in freedom. We know that one day we will be able to return home, but for now it is not safe for us or for you.
     Please remember how much your father and I love you. No matter what happens, we will always do what we think is best for you. We want you to grow up in a free country where everyone has the same rights. We will fight for that until the end, even if it means leaving home for a while.
