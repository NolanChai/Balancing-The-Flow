. My name is Eleanor, I am 8 years old and my father has just passed away. We were moving out here, hoping for a fresh start in a new place. I can’t really remember much about the first day we moved in, but I remember when he started working on the renovations. He always seemed so proud of his work as a contractor. He had plans to reopen an old hotel that was near us. It was going to be a great success! However, after he died suddenly, things changed drastically. No one wanted to buy it, so we were stuck with this old, creepy mansion in the middle of nowhere. I never got over my father’s death, and I have grown up here ever since. Some people say that this place is haunted by spirits of those who once lived there or died here. I don’t know what to believe anymore but every night when I hear footsteps going down the hallways or see lights flickering on their own, I get scared out of my mind!
