### The Good Guys and Bad Guys of the FCC

The FCC has been making news lately with its net neutrality plan, which would allow companies to charge fees to sites like Netflix in order for their content to get delivered at high speeds. As I wrote about last week, this is a bad move that would favor the big guys and harm the small ones. In particular, it would harm the small ISPs that have been trying to compete with the cable giants by offering Internet-only service.

The FCC has been considering this plan since the end of March, but it just came out in mid-July. It was not a surprise that they were considering such a move. However, it is still shocking that they would choose to go in such an anti-competitive direction. Fortunately, we can all take comfort that this is not a done deal. The FCC has until September 7th for public comment on the plan, so there is time for people to voice their opinions before any final decisions are made.

The FCC also recently announced that it was taking the side of consumers in the case against AT&T over their decision to block FaceTime on the iPhone. This is a good thing! It shows that the FCC is listening to what we have been saying and is trying to do something about it. They realize that net neutrality is important to the future of the Internet, and they are willing to take action in order to protect it.

It's not clear yet what will happen with this issue. The FCC could very well decide to drop its investigation against AT&T. After all, they have a history of being reluctant to take on big companies. However, the fact that they are taking public input into account is encouraging. It shows that they understand that net neutrality is an important issue and that we need to do everything possible to protect it. So far, the FCC has been doing a good job of listening to us and fighting for our rights. Let's hope they keep up the good work!

### Why Net Neutrality Matters To Me And You

Net neutrality is a concept that is important to everyone who uses the internet. It ensures that all internet traffic is treated equally, regardless of source or content. This means that no one company can control what you can and cannot access online. Without net neutrality, big companies would be able to block or slow down your access to certain websites in order to favor their own products. Net neutrality ensures that everyone has equal access to the internet, which is a fundamental right for all Americans. It also helps foster competition among ISPs and prevents them from trying to control what you can see online. In short, net neutrality is vital for ensuring an open and free internet.

### Why Net Neutrality Matters To Small Businesses And Startups

Net neutrality is a concept that is important to small businesses and startups. It ensures that all Internet traffic is treated equally, regardless of the size or type of company. Without net neutrality, big companies could pay for faster internet speeds and better access than smaller players. This would put them at an unfair advantage over their competitors. Net neutrality also helps protect small businesses from ISP interference and ensure that they have the same opportunity to reach potential customers as bigger companies do. Overall, net neutrality is essential for fairness in the online marketplace and helping level the playing field for all businesses.
