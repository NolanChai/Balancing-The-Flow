roll through my things and make an offering for each thing to pay for it. Then I sell it back at market price. Sometimes I go into town, sometimes they come here. It is easier that way. I live in a small room in the back of the shop with my dog Toby. Toby has been my companion since before he was born and I would not have any other. He does all of the hunting for me as I am far to frail to go out into the woods for any length of time.
