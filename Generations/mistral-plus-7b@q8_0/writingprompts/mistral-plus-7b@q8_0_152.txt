is, and as he had done for the last year, he was running for reelection. Unfortunately, he had just suffered a major loss in the polls. With only two weeks left until the election, he desperately needed some good news. So he decided to meet with his campaign manager.
 
  The meeting started well enough, but soon Ardin found himself on the defensive again. His opponent was a popular and charismatic individual who had been endorsed by many high-profile people. It seemed like no matter what Ardin did, he couldn’t seem to get ahead of his opponent.
 
  As the meeting wore on, Ardin grew more and more frustrated with his situation. He knew that he was a capable candidate and had done much for the state over the past year. However, it seemed like no matter what he did, he just couldn’t catch up to his opponent. Even though it wasn’t fair, he knew that he needed to do something if he wanted to win.
 
  As Ardin continued to ponder his situation, a new thought occurred to him: maybe he could get some dirt on his opponent. If he had something negative on him, then the voters might turn their attention away from him and towards Ardin instead. With a newfound sense of purpose, Ardin decided that it was time to dig up some dirt on his opponent. He just hoped that whatever he found would be enough to help him win reelection.
