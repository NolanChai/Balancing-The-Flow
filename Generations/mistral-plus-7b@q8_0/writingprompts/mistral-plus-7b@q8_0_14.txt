atchmo, he would have known who I was talking about…

“Louis, there’s this guy at work named Derek. He’s like you know, kind of an asshole. He’ll be doing something cool and then you find out that the credit goes to someone else. It’s really fucking annoying. Anyway he’s been here a couple years now and he thinks that just because he’s done it for a while he deserves a promotion, even though he hasn’t shown any leadership abilities at all. I feel like I have more potential than him so I was hoping maybe you could use your trumpet powers to help me get the job.”

Louis laughs. He knows exactly what I mean.

“Derek sounds like a real tool, kid. You know what they say, the squeaky wheel gets the oil. Derek’s probably just sucking up to his manager, hoping that they’ll do what he wants just because he’s been here a while. But you deserve it more. Why don’t you start by showing your manager how much of an asset you are? Put in the extra hours and get some of Derek’s work done for him. Don’t complain, just keep doing good work. And then when you have the opportunity to speak up about why you deserve a promotion, make sure that you’re well-prepared. Show your manager how much value you bring to the team.”

Louis is right. I need to put in the extra effort and be prepared when it comes time for me to get my just due. It won’t happen overnight but with hard work and determination I know that one day I will be rewarded for my efforts.
