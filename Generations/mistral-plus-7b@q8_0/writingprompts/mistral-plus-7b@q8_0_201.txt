eres no one out there that would want to hurt anyone like he had been hurt. He was the only one. It was a long journey through the woods, it took several nights and even more days of travel. The trees were getting thinner now, he could see where they opened up into a meadow not far from him. They were so bright and inviting, almost like calling out to him. He broke out in a run and ran until his body couldn't take it anymore. He collapsed onto the ground with a painful wheeze. The ground was cold but he didn't mind. It was peaceful there, no one could hurt you if you laid down on the ground. No one could hurt him, ever again...

He knew that they would be looking for him by now. They had probably sent out dogs to find him, as well as scouts. He wanted nothing more than to just give up and let them take him back. But he couldn't do that, not yet anyway. They would want to keep him around for a long time so they could have someone else to experiment on. That's the last thing he needed right now. So he wouldn't be caught he had to hide, which meant staying in one place and being completely silent. He crawled into some bushes next to a tree that was close to the meadow. It would provide cover for him if they were to come searching for him. His breathing became ragged as his eyes darted back and forth.

He hated that he had to be hiding like this, but it was better then being captured again. He could just stay here forever. No one could find him if he stayed there, and no one would hurt him ever again if he stayed there.
