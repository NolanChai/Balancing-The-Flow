, and he carefully checks his surroundings for any signs of life. It would be so easy to make a mistake, and slip up.

It takes him twenty-two minutes to reach his objective. The sun is setting fast, but that’s okay; the shadows will help cover his approach, and keep him hidden from anyone who might happen to look his way. He carefully studies the building in front of him – it seems so ordinary, with its red brick construction and windows with heavy drapes drawn against the evening.

But he knows better than that. He has seen through the walls before, using his eyes like a knife. He knows that inside there are two levels of offices and cubicles, and on the top floor a small conference room. And, more importantly, he knows what is hidden in those rooms.

He waits for several minutes to make sure there’s no one around, and then climbs the fire escape to the roof. There isn’t anyone out here either – his prey are all inside, busy with their own lives. The last rays of sun disappear behind the buildings across the way, leaving behind a deep blue twilight. It would be easy to get lost in this darkness.

He creeps toward the edge of the roof. There is an air conditioner just above the window he needs, and he uses it as a foothold to pull himself up onto the ledge. Then he slides through the open window without a sound. His shadow blends into the shadows of the room around him. The room is dark; no one has left on any lights in here. He takes a minute to let his eyes adjust, but soon everything becomes clearer.

The room is cramped and full of desks. They are all empty now, but he can see that they once belonged to people like himself – hardworking men and women who spend their days staring at computer screens and trying not to go mad from the boredom of it all. He sees files scattered everywhere, piles of paperwork stacked high on top of each other. Somewhere in this room are the documents he needs to find.

He moves carefully through the office, stopping every few feet to check for movement or noise. It’s a long and slow process – it takes him over an hour to search every inch of this place – but finally he finds what he is looking for: a file marked “Confidential” that is stuffed into a drawer beneath someone’s desk. He pulls it out and inspects it closely before placing it into his pocket.

With that done, he heads back through the window and down the fire escape to the street below. It will take him several hours to make it across town back home, but at least now he knows that he has what he came for. As long as he’s careful, no one should ever know about his little midnight adventure.
