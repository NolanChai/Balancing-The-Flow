k, you take care of the first floor, and keep your eyes on that door there. Sam, you stay here with me and we'll make sure no one comes down the stairs or through these double doors. If anyone tries to break through, we shoot first, ask questions later. Remember this is just a robbery, nothing more, no one gets hurt unless they give us trouble. Now let's get cracking before anyone else arrives.''
`The next night in his room, Sam decided to give the crystal ball another try. He placed it on the desk in front of him and closed his eyes. As soon as he did so, he felt a sudden rush of energy surge through his body. He opened his eyes just in time to see an image begin to form in the crystal ball. It was a vision of a dark and stormy night. In the distance, he could see a large mansion, its windows aglow with flickering light. A figure clad in black emerged from the shadows. As he drew closer, Sam saw that it was none other than the stranger he had met in the woods. The man's eyes glowed with an unearthly light, and he carried a staff in one hand. He was followed by two other figures, equally sinister-looking. They seemed to be moving towards the mansion. As they drew closer, Sam could see that the building was alive with activity. Lights were on in every room, and servants scurried about, running errands and tending to their duties. The man and his two companions slipped through a gap in the bushes, making their way towards the front door of the mansion. Just as they reached it, the doors swung open, revealing a stately, well-dressed figure standing inside. He greeted them with a bow, and ushered them inside. Sam watched in horror as the three men entered the mansion, their evil intent plain for all to see. The vision faded almost immediately after this, leaving Sam shaken and disoriented. He sat there for several moments, trying to process what he had just seen. It was a glimpse into the future, of a terrible fate that awaited him if he continued on this dark path. Sam knew that he had to make changes in his life, or risk becoming consumed by evil himself. With determination, he resolved to turn away from darkness and embrace the light.''
