Walled Lake and South of Milford, 
 Where the highway is always jammed.  
 
 This place is known as Wolverine, 
 A town that will take you down, 
 It's a hell of a ride if you want it, 
 And I promise you'll pay. 
 
 There are many reasons why people move there, 
 They come for the schools and the small town feel, 
 But they stay because it's cheap and affordable, 
 Because that's just the kind of place that Wolverine is.  
 
 If you ever happen to find yourself there, 
 I suggest that you turn around as soon as you can, 
 Get back on the highway and head East, 
 And keep driving till you don't see any more of this shit.
