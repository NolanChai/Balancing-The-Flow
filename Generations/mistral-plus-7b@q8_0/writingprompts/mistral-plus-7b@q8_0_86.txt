the locks at the farm. 
 
 A few minutes later after I had put the proper key into the lock and turned it, I pushed open the door to the barn. The air was thick with dust, but in the dim light, I could make out a large form sitting near the wall. It looked like a big black horse standing up on its hind legs with an elongated neck and head. 
 
 `` What's that doing here?'' I said.
 
 It didn't respond. Maybe it was the dust, but I could barely make out its eyes glowing. Suddenly, it jumped up and ran toward me.
 
 `` Whoa!'' I cried. `` That horse is really fast.''
