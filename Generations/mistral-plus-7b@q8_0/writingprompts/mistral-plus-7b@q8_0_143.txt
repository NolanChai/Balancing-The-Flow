tthe only visible item of clothing inside. The walls were painted white and decorated with handwritten messages and drawings that appeared to have been made at random by a child. In one corner of the room stood an old wooden desk, complete with a cracked glass top, rusty metal legs and a pencil tray filled with pens and pencils.
The door to the room was shut but there were no locks or chains on it. When I opened it, I saw that it led out into another small room. This second room was even smaller than the first and consisted of nothing more than a wooden table, three chairs and a single electric lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. The floor was covered in dirt and dust, as if no one had been inside for a long time. On the walls were more propaganda posters, showing pictures of soldiers marching, people rallying around their leaders or slogans encouraging citizens to be loyal and obedient.
