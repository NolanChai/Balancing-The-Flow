sunshine, they can't imagine what it must feel like to have people stare at you in shops and gasp when you go swimming in the summer. But now that everyone knows I'm a vampire... I know it could happen to them too.

In the second novel of the series about a teenage vampire who lives in sunny Australia, we see her struggle with fitting into society. She hates being different and doesn't want people to feel sorry for her. It is interesting how she copes with becoming the odd one out - does she become angry or just try to fit in? The author has done a great job at portraying this internal struggle and making it relatable to teens everywhere.
