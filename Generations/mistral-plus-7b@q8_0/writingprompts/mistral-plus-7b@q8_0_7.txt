Christopher turned the corner and could see her door through the small window in the door. Her light was on which meant that she probably wasnâ€™t asleep yet. He smiled, thinking about how beautiful she looked tonight as he rang the doorbell.

The door opened and there she stood with a huge grin on her face. She took the bag from his hands, saying thank you. Then she leaned up on her toes to press a kiss against his cheek before turning back inside. Christopher let out a soft sigh as he watched her go back into her room. He wondered if it was too early in their relationship to admit that he was already falling for her.
