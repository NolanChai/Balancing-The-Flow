Mrs. Petrie’s navy suit. The girls in her class were all dressed in their uniforms, which included a navy blazer with the school crest embroidered over the heart. A group of boys from another classroom had just finished passing through and Mrs. Petrie had made sure that their blazers were buttoned up properly.

“When you are wearing your uniform,” she told them, “you are representing not only yourself but this school and your parents as well. It is very important that your clothes show how proud you are to be a part of our school.” She gave the boys a quick nod of approval for their neat appearance. Mrs. Petrie smiled at each of the girls in turn. “You ladies look lovely,” she said with a smile.

“Thank you, Mrs. Petrie,” Sarah responded. “I’m glad that we are all looking so good today.” She nodded her head towards her classmates, who had taken pride in making sure their hair was brushed and their uniforms were neat. They also made sure they were wearing the proper shoes; Mary’s black leather shoes clicked on the linoleum floor as she walked to her desk.

Mrs. Petrie gave the girls a warm smile. “Yes, I know that you all take great pride in your appearance. It is one of the things that makes me so proud to be your teacher.” She took a deep breath and began writing on the whiteboard: The Five Kingdoms – Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic Cells. Sarah felt herself tense up at the sight of those words. She knew this was going to be a long class.

As Mrs. Petrie started her lecture, Sarah found herself daydreaming about summer break. She loved summer because it meant she could spend time outside playing with her friends and exploring. It also meant that there was no school for three whole months! Just the thought of all those long days without any homework made her feel so happy and free. She couldn’t wait for summer vacation to arrive.
