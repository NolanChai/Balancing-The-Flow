ares at her empty bowl. There are two or three of the little fish left in the aquarium, but they seem to be avoiding the food. `` It sounds like an interesting read though. I think I remember seeing something similar to it in my Dad's library when I was a child.'' 
 
 Her companion smiles. `` Yes, that would probably be the same story. The whole thing about this book is that it was written by a man who lived back in time. He wrote the story down and hid it so that future people could read it. It was found hundreds of years later, when they were going through his house to clean it out. And it's very strange. Very strange indeed.'' 
 
 She leans forward, her eyes widening as she listens to her friend. `` Really? What was in the book?'' 
 
 The other person takes a deep breath and begins to speak. `` The story is called 'The Time Machine'. It tells of a man who invents a machine that can take him back and forth through time. He uses this machine to travel into the future, where he discovers a world filled with strange creatures and unfamiliar landscapes. He also meets different versions of himself from throughout history, each one unique in its own way.'' 
 
 `` That sounds incredible! It must have been amazing for that man to experience such an adventure.'' 
 
 Her friend nods. `` Yes, it truly was a wonderful story. The author does a great job at bringing the future world alive and making us feel like we're right there with him as he travels through time. It's a powerful reminder of just how vast and mysterious our universe really is.''
