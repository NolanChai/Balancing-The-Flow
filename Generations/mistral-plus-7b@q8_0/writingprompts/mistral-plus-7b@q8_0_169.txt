20 minutes!''

He grabs a sponge, dunks it into soapy water and starts scrubbing at the countertops. His mother said to scrub for twenty minutes without stopping. She wants him to see that he needs to focus on what's in front of him rather than letting his mind wander to dark places.
  Clay turns up the water and lets the soap run over his hands. He doesn't feel like he's doing much. He tries to scrub a little harder but the thought is too much. The pain, the voices, the guilt. All of it overwhelms him and makes it hard for him to stay focused on the task at hand.
  He shuts off the faucet and leans back against the counter. His mother warned him that if he let his mind wander, he would start to feel bad again. She said that his brain is like a muscle and that he needs to train it to focus on the present instead of the past or the future. He wants to try but it's so hard. The thoughts keep coming back no matter how hard he tries to stop them.
  Clay takes a deep breath and turns the water back on. He reaches for a rag and starts wiping down the countertops again. This time, he tries to stay in the present moment. He notices the feel of the warm water on his hands, the smell of the soapy suds, and the sound of the water running into the sink. He focuses all of his attention on these things for a few minutes. It helps for a little while but then the thoughts come back. They're stronger than ever.
  Clay stands up straight and closes his eyes. He takes another deep breath and tries to stay in the moment. He focuses on what he can see, hear, taste, smell, and feel. After a few minutes, the thoughts start to fade. He feels more in control and less afraid of them.
  `` I can do this,'' he says aloud. `` I'm strong enough to overcome this.''
