remember that day with vivid clarity and the feelings are just as strong now as they were then. We stood in a line outside of the church, waiting to file in for his funeral. I didn't understand much of what was going on at the time. I had been through other funerals before; my grandparents lived in a small community where death came often. But this time felt different somehow. There were more people there than any other funeral that I can recall, and I was noticing that for the first time most everyone seemed to know me and my family. I don't remember much about his service inside the church, but I do remember it being very long. After the service ended we all filed outside into a line of cars that had been waiting for us. We caravaned across town to the cemetery where he would be laid to rest. It was at this moment when everything became so real. I could not see my grandfather's body in the coffin, but I could hear his casket being carried out by a small group of men. My father and uncle had a look of grief on their faces that I had never seen before. I felt tears beginning to well up in my own eyes as we approached his grave site. The minister led us all in a short prayer over the coffin before the final dirt was shoveled onto it. This day changed me forever, I can still remember every detail like it was yesterday. It was then that I realized life is short and precious; there will never be enough time to make sure those you love know how much they mean to you.
