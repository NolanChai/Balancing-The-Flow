little more. Then it would close its mouth again, open its eyes, stare.

I’d been trying to ignore it for the last two weeks or so, but that only seemed to make things worse. Now when I walked past, its black eyes followed me with an intensity that was almost hypnotic. Its body rippled slightly in the water. It stared, its fins flared a little more. It’s mouth opened and closed with a sound like a whisper. I shivered, then quickly turned away from it.

I knew what it wanted. It always did. My head was beginning to throb again. Damn that fish!

It had been at least two weeks since I’d fed it. The last time had been three times in one day — breakfast, lunch and dinner. And yet, that hadn’t seemed enough. That night I had woken with a terrible headache, my stomach churning.

I knew what caused the pain: an imbalance in the energy field that surrounded me. Some people called them chakras, others spoke of energy fields. All they did was explain what it meant when the scales on your body began to slip out of alignment with the cosmos. When you felt sick. When a headache developed behind your eyes and you felt like you were going to throw up at any moment.

It had taken me years of practice, but I knew how to bring my energy field back into balance. The first step was always to eat fish. I liked the fish I kept in the tank at my home, especially the one with the black eyes and golden fins. They were beautiful, but they were also very demanding. They would follow me around the tank with their eyes, seeming to watch every move I made. Sometimes they would swim close enough that I could reach out and touch them. Then they would nudge up against my hand, asking for food. If I didn’t feed them quickly enough, or if I fed them something other than what they wanted, they would turn their black eyes upon me with anger. It was almost as though I had failed to live up to some unspoken agreement between us. The headache and nausea began as soon as my energy field fell out of balance. I knew the only way to fix it was to feed them.

The problem was, they ate a lot — especially the one with the black eyes. He would swim close to me, staring up at me with those huge black eyes. And then his mouth would open and he’d dart forward, sucking in as much of my energy field as possible. I would feel the scales on my body slip slightly out of alignment, as though they were trying to reach for him. If I didn’t feed him soon enough, the headache and nausea would return with a vengeance.

So now, here I was again, standing next to the tank, staring at that one fish with those black eyes. He was staring back at me, his mouth opening and closing as if he were calling out to me. I knew what it meant — it wanted food. Again. And so I reached into the tank, scooped up some of the small fish that lived there and held them out to it. The fish opened its mouth and began to eat, the scales on my body shifting back into alignment as it did so.

It was always like this with the fish that had black eyes. They were demanding and greedy, but I couldn’t deny their power when they sucked my energy into their bodies. It was a strange relationship we had, one that I understood better than most people could. They needed me to survive just as much as I needed them. And so, no matter how much it cost me, I would always feed them what they wanted — even if it meant having those black eyes stare at me for the rest of my life.
