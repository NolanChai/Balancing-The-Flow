world, but no one seems to be able to find an answer. When the silence began, it started with a gradual loss of sound in one ear only. Soon after that, my other ear became affected too. Today I am almost totally deaf, living in a world of silence and trying to adjust.

My parents and friends have been incredibly supportive throughout this whole ordeal, but my teachers were not so sympathetic. They treated me as if I was deliberately choosing not to listen, constantly scolding me for not paying attention. They didn't seem to understand that it was something beyond my control. Some of them were really nasty to me about it, too.

The worst part is the fact that I have always wanted to be a musician. But now that dream seems out of reach. Even with hearing aids and other devices, I don't think I could ever learn to play an instrument. I was once so talented at playing the piano and saxophone. It just breaks my heart that those dreams are probably over for me now.

I try to remain as positive as possible despite the challenges I face every day with my hearing loss. I know there are worse things out there than being deaf, and I am grateful that I am still able to live a relatively normal life. But sometimes it can be difficult to stay optimistic when I feel like other people don't understand what I'm going through.
