rup on your waffle?” I ask my daughter as she sits at our kitchen table with her eyes glued to the TV. “Yea,” she replies, without taking her eyes off of the screen.
 
 “Would you like some sausage or bacon, honey?” I say to my son who is just waking up. He opens one eye and says “bacon”. I open a box of Kellogg’s Eggo frozen waffles for my daughter. I put them in the toaster oven, as they start toasting she comes running into the kitchen. She grabs her plate and puts two waffles on it. I pull out two slices of bacon, put them on a paper towel, and give them to my son. He takes his plate and sits down next to his sister at the table. They both dig in with excitement and eat their breakfast like they haven’t eaten in weeks.
