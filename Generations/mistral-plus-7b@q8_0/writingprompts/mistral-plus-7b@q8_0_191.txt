ification of medicine to help his patients who needed encouragement to get the flu shot. The system worked so well that Dr. Gahmstahp started a clinic for chronic disease management to help diabetics and hypertension patients with their medication adherence. He then took it one step further by implementing the system in the health insurance world where he was able to lower his patient's premiums based on their activity. The gamification of medicine was here to stay, but Dr. Gahmstahp didn't have time for his own patients anymore. Too many people were using his clinic and it wasn't sustainable. He then decided to franchise the idea and make it into a mobile app that could be used in any office that wanted to gamify their practice. Now, anyone who needed some extra motivation to take better care of themselves had Dr. Gahmstahp at their fingertips.
