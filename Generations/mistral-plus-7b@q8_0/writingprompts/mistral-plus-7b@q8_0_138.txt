, and she’d been pretty hurt by it. After that experience, Thulgaria swore never to let any male creature put her through that kind of emotional turmoil again.

Of course, this is easier said than done when you live in a place where every male dragon is as large and intimidating as a small mountain range. Despite her vow to stay away from males, Thulgaria still found herself constantly surrounded by them: they’d follow her with their eyes no matter which way she turned, they would try to engage her in conversation about things like the weather or the current state of the local politics. They were always around, and it was enough to make even a tough old dragoness feel overwhelmed and alone.

One day, as Thulgaria walked through the village market, she felt herself being watched by one of the male dragons. She tried to ignore him, but his presence was so unbearable that she finally snapped at him. “What do you want?” she demanded, glaring at him fiercely.

The dragon stared back at her with a look of complete and utter surprise. He had never been spoken to in such a way before! Thulgaria could see the gears turning in his head as he realized that no one else would ever dare treat him with such disrespect again, not after what she’d just said.

“I… I wanted to talk to you,” he stuttered nervously. “You seem like an interesting dragoness, and I just wanted to get to know you better.”

Thulgaria shook her head. She knew that she should be angry at the dragon for being so bold as to approach her, but instead of anger she felt only pity for him. He was young and naive, and had no idea what it meant to truly understand a woman’s heart. Thulgaria sighed sadly and decided to try and help him by explaining things in plain terms.

“Let me tell you something,” she said firmly but kindly. “Men like you are everywhere in this world, and they all think that they can do whatever they want to us female dragons because they’re so much bigger and stronger than we are. They think that they can take advantage of our vulnerabilities just because they can. But I want you to know that we aren’t weak or easily manipulated. We may seem small and insignificant compared to you, but we have a strength within us that you will never understand.”

Thulgaria continued, “We are capable of amazing things despite our size—things like love and courage and determination. And if any male tries to take advantage of that or hurt us in any way, then he should be prepared for the consequences. Because we female dragons are fiercely protective of ourselves and those that we love.”

The dragon stood there listening intently to every word she spoke. When she finished her speech, he stared at Thulgaria with an entirely new level of respect in his eyes. He finally understood what it meant for a female dragon like her to be so strong despite everything life had thrown at her. He realized that no one should ever take advantage or hurt such an incredible creature ever again—not just because they were bigger and stronger than she was, but because of how much courage and strength she possessed within her own small frame.
