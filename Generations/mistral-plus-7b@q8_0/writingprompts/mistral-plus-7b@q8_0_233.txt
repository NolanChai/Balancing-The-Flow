couple of feet away from a wall and the door to the adjacent room (not a bedroom), I quickly open the access port cover on my side of the wall and pull out the sensor array. I flip it on, and watch as the LEDs light up. The device is clearly functioning, now all that's left is to do the final installation, which doesn't take very long at all.
 
 While waiting for the alarm software to load onto the main system, I quickly set about reinstalling the sensor array in the wall, making sure it was securely fastened and out of the way. Once the alarm software was finished loading, I started walking around the perimeter of the room. The sensor array is very effective, clearly detecting anyone who walks by. As I passed through the entrance portal, I noticed a faint beeping sound from the main system. "Not bad," I thought to myself.
 
 The alarm sounded as intended and alerted me to the presence of intruders. I could have been woken up and quickly responded to the threat, even if they had gotten into my room. Now it was time for a test run with the actual cameras.
