rive in these moments of chaos. There is nothing more beautiful than the unhinged look of a girl who knows she is about to be devoured. And when the last glimmer of hope exits her eyes, when your pupils finally lose their shine? That’s when I know I have won.

I watch your chest rise and fall in panic as I press my face against yours. You are not breathing deeply enough. You must breathe deeper. As you do, you will begin to calm down, which is what I want. If you calm down too quickly, though, I will need to make you more uncomfortable.

I take my time, forcing your eyes to meet mine. The longer we lock gazes, the harder it becomes for you to move. And now? It’s time to bite. Not a quick nip on the arm or a playful pinch of the cheek — I sink my teeth into your flesh with every ounce of strength and ferocity I possess. I pull back slowly and smile at your pain as you scream in agony. My goal is not to cause physical harm, but rather to break you down psychologically. To remind you that your body is not your own, that it belongs to me now.

My hand clamps down on your mouth so you can’t make a sound — not that it would do any good, as I have already done enough damage to your throat. Your arms try to push against my chest, but they are weak. You cannot break free of this hold. I want you to feel completely trapped and helpless. It is only then that you will surrender to me. And when you finally give in? That’s when the real fun begins.
