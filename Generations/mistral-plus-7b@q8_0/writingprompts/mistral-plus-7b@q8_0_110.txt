ken a cage than anything else. These rooms were soundproof. They had to be, considering what we did in there. And they also happened to be made out of bulletproof glass. We couldn't escape from the room without a good bit of effort. We never tried. They never let us out. The door would only open for one reason: our daily food delivery.
 
 Food was the only thing keeping us alive, and it wasn't much. Three meals every day, but it wasn't very filling. It kept us healthy, though. And that was enough for them. They had us under constant surveillance, watching every move we made in our rooms. We didn't even have any toys to keep ourselves occupied. The only thing keeping us sane were the other test subjects. I would go crazy without my friends here.
 
 But it wasn't all bad. I got to meet people that I wouldn't normally interact with. Some were great and others were annoying, but we all became close. We had to do that to get through this experience together. And while being stuck in a cage with these people was terrible at times, it was still better than being alone.
 
 So maybe the experiments weren't so bad after all. They gave us some new experiences and helped us grow as individuals. Yes, they were dangerous and uncomfortable, but they taught me lessons that I will never forget. The more I learned about the experiments, the less scared of them I became. And as my fear subsided, the better I understood why those people were doing them in the first place. They wanted to help us, even if it meant hurting us along the way. They cared about our well-being and wanted nothing but happiness for all of us. The truth is that these scientists weren't evil at all; they just had a different approach than most people do when it comes to helping others. So although I hated being tested on, I understand why those scientists did what they did now. And for that reason alone, I can forgive them for everything that happened here in this research lab.
