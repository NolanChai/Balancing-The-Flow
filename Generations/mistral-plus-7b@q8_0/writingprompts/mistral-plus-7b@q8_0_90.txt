aze. And there he was, worrying about how unnatural it all seemed.  The bastard probably had his own execution scheduled by then and was just waiting for it. So what if it wasn't natural? Life is never natural. That doesn't mean you can just sit back and say ``Well, it goes against the natural order of things'' when faced with an unpleasant situation. I wasn't about to go without a fight.
 
 As I was led away for my execution, I thought about the last three years of my life. When I had been sentenced to death by a jury of my peers for the crimes of murder and treason, I had sworn that I wouldn't go down like a lamb. And here I was, ready to prove myself right.
 
 I had been convicted for plotting against the government, conspiring with foreign powers, and committing various acts of terrorism. The trial had been a farce. The jury had only taken a few hours to reach their verdict. They were afraid of me. They didn't understand my motives or my beliefs. All they knew was that I posed a threat to them and their way of life, so they quickly condemned me.
 
 It was during those long months in jail that I made up my mind. I wasn't going to let the government get away with what they had done to me. I would fight until the very end. When my time finally came, I knew exactly how I wanted it to go down. I had already decided that I wouldn't be going quietly into the night. No, I was going to make a stand and show them all just who I truly was.
 
 As they led me into the execution chamber, I felt calm and ready. I knew that this was my chance to make a statement. To prove to everyone that I wasn't afraid. That no matter what happened, I would never give up. I had already made up my mind about how I wanted it to go down. I wasn't going out without a fight.
