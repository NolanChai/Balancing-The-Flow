that.

But I was also very hungry and thirsty. It had been days since I’d eaten anything. That was a mistake on my part. I knew better than to skip meals. But when you are stuck in a mental hospital, it ’ s hard to eat well. When I woke up in the morning after that long nightmare of a night, I realized that I hadn ’ t even bothered to pack a lunch for myself. My mom and dad had sent me off with just breakfast. And a snack. Which didn’t have any calories in it at all. So there was no wonder why my body felt like it was dying inside of me.

I looked around for something that would provide some relief from the burning sensation on my skin, but nothing was anywhere near me. The only thing I could find were some rocks lying next to where I had just sat down, so I picked one up and ran it over my hands in order to try and ease the pain of having burned them while trying to escape through the door when I woke up. It didn’t do much good though; the feeling was still there after doing this several times over with different sized stones. But at least now I knew why they hurt so badly: because they were cold instead of hot like usual due to being left outside for so long during our sleep cycle.

I went back inside through the door that had been closed behind me while I was sleeping and made my way down into the kitchen area where we were having breakfast when I woke up. The smell of pancakes cooking made me realize just how hungry I was. I rushed over to grab a plate and scoop some onto it before making my way back over to our table with my dad waiting for us there with a smile on his face as if nothing had happened during those few hours between when we first woke up this morning until now.

“How are you feeling?” He asked once I was seated beside him at the table, looking down at me with concern in his eyes because he could tell that something wasn’t right despite how well he had tried to hide it from me while we ate breakfast together.
