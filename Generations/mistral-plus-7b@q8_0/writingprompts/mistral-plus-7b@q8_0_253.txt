ke out a little, trying to keep my voice level. ``...Why don't we all just leave you alone? I think you need some time to be with your friends and just relax.''
 
 The crowd disperses, some of them looking at me like I am crazy. But the majority of them do as they are told and head back over to their tables. I let out a big breath once they all leave and take a few steps toward where Troy is still sitting. `` Are you alright?'' I ask him.
 
 He looks up at me, his eyes tired and forlorn, `` Yeah I am fine...'' he says, the corners of his mouth turning upward slightly. `` I just wish that things could have gone better with her.'' His words echo my own sentiments. We both look down at our feet, lost in our thoughts. It is not until a couple minutes later that we realize that someone else has been trying to get our attention for quite some time now.
 
 `` Oh hi guys!'' She says, walking over to us. She looks up and her eyes catch mine. `` You're Troy's friend?'' I nod my head in agreement. `` Yes, I am Samantha...his best friend.'' I extend my hand out to her. `` It is nice to meet you. Troy has told me so much about you.'' She shakes my hand and then turns her attention back to him. `` Are you okay? You look kind of sad?'' I sigh and shake my head, `` Yeah, he really wanted that girl but she just doesn't seem interested in him anymore.''
 
 Samantha puts her arm around Troy and squeezes it gently. `` It will be okay, I know that this is really tough for you right now...but I promise things will get better. Just keep your chin up and remember that there are always going to be other girls out there who will love you.''
