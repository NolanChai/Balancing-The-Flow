done in my life; I couldn't go back.  It was too late for regrets, but it wasn't too late to make a new beginning.  I wanted so much to be able to say I had been a good man and to leave something positive behind when I died.  If I was lucky enough to have my life restored to me, would it even matter?  What if I made the same mistakes all over again?  Could I find any hope in that?  The only thing I knew for sure, if this were a second chance, it wouldn't be one that I could afford to waste.  My daughter deserved better than that, and so did my parents.
 
 She was staring at me as if she understood what I was thinking.  I looked into her beautiful eyes again, and for the first time in my life, I felt a sense of peace.  Whatever happened now, I would face it head on.  There were no regrets.  Just love and hope.
