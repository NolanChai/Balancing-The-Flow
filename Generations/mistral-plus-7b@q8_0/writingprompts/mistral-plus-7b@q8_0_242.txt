again* Well... This is the first time this has ever happened to me before. Reddit really does a good job of distracting me.
I have been working a lot recently, but I know that even when I do, I just scroll through the same post for hours and nothing gets done. And then I feel bad about not being able to get any work done, so I end up doing less work because I'm still scrolling through reddit. It's a vicious cycle of procrastination.
