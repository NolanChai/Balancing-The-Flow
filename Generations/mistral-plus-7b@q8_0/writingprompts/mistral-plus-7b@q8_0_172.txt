180-degree field of vision. The blue-green wisps were mesmerising as they swirled past my windows, and I couldn’t help but think back on the millions of years it took for that star cluster to form.

I’d been in deep space for four days now. My original plan had been to collect some samples from a nearby asteroid, which would be used in developing a new rocket fuel. But I wasn’t just collecting any old rock – this was the remnants of the planet Venus. After the terraforming efforts went terribly wrong, most of what remained were chunks of dense carbon and sulphur that had been ejected into space. It would be incredibly valuable if it could be turned into fuel.

I hadn’t been worried about making the trip – after all, I was one of the best pilots around. The mission was routine, and everything went smoothly until the engine suddenly cut out. I tried restarting the engines again but to no avail. There would be no way for me to return safely now – so my only option was to hope that someone else could come rescue me before I ran out of air.

The situation was dire, yet surprisingly calm. Perhaps it was the fact that I had no control over what would happen next or maybe it was just a sense of acceptance; whatever the reason, I found myself taking stock and appreciating the beauty of my surroundings. Even in these dire circumstances, there’s still beauty in our universe – and I was fortunate to witness it up close for at least a few brief moments before my air ran out.
