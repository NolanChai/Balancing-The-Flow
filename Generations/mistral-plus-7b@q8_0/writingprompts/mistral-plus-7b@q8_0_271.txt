jected from his fingers.

I watch the energy dissipate into nothingness and the man standing before me turns to look at me with a smile on his face. I can feel his joy, hear his laughter echoing through my mind.

“Did you see that?” he asks with excitement in his voice. His hand moves up and down in a wide gesture, pointing out everything around him. “This world is so much more than it seems, isn’t it? Magic is everywhere, just waiting for us to uncover it. There are so many secrets hidden within the fabric of this reality, waiting for curious minds to explore them.”

I nod my head in agreement as I take in his words. He’s right – magic does exist all around us; we just need to learn how to look for it with an open mind and heart. It is there, just waiting to be discovered by those who are willing to search for it with passion and determination.
