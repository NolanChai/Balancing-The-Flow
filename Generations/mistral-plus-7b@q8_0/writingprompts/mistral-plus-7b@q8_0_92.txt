ow where I was. So, I opened it up and sent out some messages. After I sent one, an ad popped up in the middle of the page for *Arabian Amulets*. It looked like a simple platformer game that might be worth playing, so I took a look.

The first thing that struck me was its simplicity. The graphics are very simple, as are the sounds and music (although they were well-done). There aren't any cutscenes or long loading screens; the game gets right to it. Your goal is simple: collect gems and avoid getting hit by monsters. But I soon realized that there was much more going on behind the scenes than it first appeared.

The gem collection mechanic is what really sets *Arabian Amulets* apart from other games in the genre. Each level has a goal of collecting a certain number of gems and then making your way back to the starting point. You can collect as many as you'd like, but only the required number counts toward your total score. The game is designed to encourage exploration, so there are often multiple routes to take through each stage. And since gem collection doesn't affect your progress directly, it allows you to experiment with different strategies without penalty. This freedom really adds to the replay value of the game.

Another area where *Arabian Amulets* stands out is its control scheme. The controls are very intuitive and responsive, which makes them easy to pick up and play. You use the arrow keys to move your character around the screen and the space bar to jump. The ability to wall jump adds an extra level of complexity that keeps things interesting throughout.

Overall, *Arabian Amulets* is a great little platformer game that offers hours of challenging yet enjoyable gameplay. Its simple graphics and music make it suitable for all ages, while its gem collection mechanic provides plenty of replay value.
