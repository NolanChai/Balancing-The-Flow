age on the car pump way too high. But still I was a good kid.
I had been going to church since I was a baby so I knew most of the Bible and went through all the confirmations classes. When I was 10 years old, my family took in my sister who had been abused by her father. So at a young age I understood that the world wasn't always fair and people could do cruel things.
But now that I am 25 years old I realize how much more there is to being good. I used to think that just because I was nice and didn't do anything bad, I was a good person. Now I know it takes more than that. Being good means treating others with love even when they don't deserve it. It means being kind and patient even when someone hurts you. It means forgiving even when you are angry or hurt. And it means doing what's right, even if no one else is.
