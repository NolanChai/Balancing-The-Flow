on. The guy was really getting on his nerves lately, with all the preening and self-congratulation. He had to get him under control before this got out of hand. `` Sir,'' he said carefully, `` I am a member of the Church of the Lightbringer, so I already have a God. One who is quite justly worshiped and adored by all.''
 
 `` You speak blasphemy!'' Johnson shouted, throwing up his hands in outrage. `` I am your God now, and you must bow down before me!'' 
 
 Mark sighed again, exasperated with the man's refusal to accept reason. He took a deep breath and tried once more to explain. `` Sir,'' he said gently, `` I know that you believe yourself to be my God, but you are wrong. The Lightbringer is our God, and we worship her faithfully and devotedly. She is the source of all goodness in the world, the one who guides us with Her light, the one we seek to emulate in our own lives.'' 
 
 `` Nonsense!'', Johnson bellowed. `` You are deluding yourself. I am your God, and you must submit to my will!'' 
 
 Mark shook his head sadly. `` Sir,'' he said with patience, `` you do not understand what it means to be a follower of the Lightbringer. We believe in Her love and Her compassion, and we strive to live our lives according to Her teachings of tolerance and acceptance. We are guided by the light she brings into our world, and we seek always to spread that light throughout the world.'' 
 
 `` Heresy!'' Johnson exclaimed indignantly. `` I am your God, and you must worship me with all your heart, mind, and soul! You cannot follow some false god while pledging your allegiance to me!''
