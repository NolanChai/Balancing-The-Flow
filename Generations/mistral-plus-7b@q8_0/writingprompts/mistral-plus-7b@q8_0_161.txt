to my feet, I looked around at the room, still trying to regain full consciousness. I found myself in a strange, unfamiliar room. It was small, almost windowless, with only a single door and a single barred window high up near the ceiling. A cot with dirty sheets lay on one wall opposite the door, with a bucket sitting next to it. 
 
 My hands were still bound behind my back. I glanced down at myself. I was naked, except for the blindfold and ragged rope around my wrists. 
 
 ``Where am I?'' I asked no one in particular. 
 
 There was an answering snicker from behind me. I turned and saw that my captor had returned. He was standing at the door with a smug smile on his face. 
 
 ``You're in my dungeon, slave,'' he said. He strolled over to me, hands in his pockets. ``I decided you might appreciate the accommodations here.'' He gestured around the room. 
 
 I glanced back at the room, trying to make sense of it. It was a small but well-made space, clearly designed for imprisonment. The walls and floor were made of stone and cement, while the ceiling had wooden beams supporting it. There was an iron ring in the wall opposite the door, presumably for shackling prisoners. 
 
 My captor gestured to the bucket again. ``Your toilet.'' He paused before adding, ``You should make sure to use it after meals, otherwise you will end up wetting yourself.'' He smirked at me and continued. ``I also noticed that you had been trying to escape. For that disobedience, I will punish you by denying you food for a few days until you learn your place in this world.'' 
 
 With that, he turned and left the room, locking the door behind him. I stood there, alone in my small cell, wondering how I had gotten myself into this mess.
