agle my way out of the gym and back into my pajamas. It gets easier every time. What are these things called resolutions anyway? They're really nothing more than broken promises.

There was this guy who wanted to be rich and famous in Hollywood. He told people about his dreams all the time. He talked so much about it that he even convinced himself it would happen one day. But years went by and his dreams of becoming rich and famous in Hollywood still hadn't come true. What happened? Well, nothing really. He just kept talking about it instead of doing something about it. And in the meantime, the world kept turning. It didn't wait for him to catch up. The opportunity of a lifetime never came along because he wasn't ready when it did. All those years of wishing and hoping and dreaming only led to disappointment and bitterness. He finally realized that if you want something bad enough, you have to be willing to work for it. You can't just sit around and wait for things to happen. You need to be proactive in making your dreams a reality. So, what do you need to start doing today? Do not wait another day. The future will come sooner than you think.
