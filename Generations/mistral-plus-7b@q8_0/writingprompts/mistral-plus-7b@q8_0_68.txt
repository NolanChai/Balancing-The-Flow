Â­demons, a new breed of warrior. The Unleashed were born to fight against their creators, but now they have a higher calling; they will hunt down and kill any demon that walks this Earth.

The Unleashed are not like us. They are stronger and more powerful than any normal human being. Some have the ability to control fire or ice, some can run faster than bullets, others still can see things in the darkness that no one else can perceive. And they all have an unnatural affinity for killing demons.

The Unleashed were created by a scientist named Dr. Kaius Kenshin, who is one of the most brilliant minds in the world. He was working on a way to create super soldiers when he stumbled upon a group of demonic beasts that had been captured and experimented upon. Using his knowledge of genetics and biotechnology, Kenshin created a serum that would turn humans into something more than human. He injected this serum into the demonic beasts, transforming them into what we now call The Unleashed.

The Unleashed are not your average superheroes. They are not just people with extraordinary abilities, they are something else entirely. They are a new breed of warrior, and it is their destiny to rid the world of demons.
