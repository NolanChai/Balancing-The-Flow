. `` Yes, but the ultrasound? Is everything OK?'' 
 
 The doctor sighed and looked down at his clipboard. `` Well, we found an unusual mass in your right breast.'' 
 
 My mouth fell open and my eyes filled with tears. `` What does that mean? How bad is it?'' 
 
 The doctor took a deep breath and reached for my hand. `` I'm sorry to tell you this, but it appears that you have cancer. It looks like you caught it early.'' 
 
 My heart sank into the pit of my stomach. `` What do we need to do?'' 
 
 The doctor explained the next steps in the process: a biopsy to determine the exact type and stage of the cancer, followed by a course of treatment which may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. He also told me that he would refer me to an oncologist for further evaluation and treatment. 
 
 It was a lot to take in at once, but I was determined to stay strong and face this challenge head on.
