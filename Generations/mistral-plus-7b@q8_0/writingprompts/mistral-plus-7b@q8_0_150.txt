us had our eyes set on the prize: the perfect shot.
 
 The setting was picturesque. The leaves were falling off the trees, and it made for some good backdrops. There were some beautiful homes that we could use as props in the background. The lighting was just right to create shadows. And of course there was the lake. We chose to sit on the stone wall that went around the lake. We had a prime view of this beautiful scenery, and the ducks that frequented it. We were all just waiting for one perfect opportunity to strike.
 
 I couldn't believe how calm and still they could be. It was like they knew that we were there, watching them, but they didn't care. They carried on with their lives, just as if we weren't even there. I felt like the big bad predator, sneaking up on its prey. It made me feel proud of myself and my abilities. We all had our cameras ready, and we were prepared to get the perfect shot.
 
 Then it happened. One of the ducks spotted us, and it quickly dove into the water. Everyone moved in to capture that one perfect moment. We got some really great shots, but I was particularly proud of the picture I got. It captured the duck just as it plummeted into the water, with the perfect splash of water behind it. It was a truly incredible shot, and one that I am very proud of.
