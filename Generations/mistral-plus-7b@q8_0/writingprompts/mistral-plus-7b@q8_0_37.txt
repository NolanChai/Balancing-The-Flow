> > get kettle 
 
 You see a large kettle on the kitchen counter.  It is rusty and has been sitting here for quite some time.  The bottom of it is covered with sediment, and the inside needs to be scrubbed thoroughly before you could use it for boiling water.
 
 > > clean kettle 
 
 You scrub the kettle vigorously with a cloth until all the dirt, grime, and sediment are gone. It now looks like new again!
