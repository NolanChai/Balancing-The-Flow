A day is lost to the void, leaving only memories that are soon forgotten. Time passes by and the world remains unchanged, for you are nothing but a spectator. You watch it unfold with your eyes open and mouth closed. The only thing you do is take up space on a computer screen, and like everyone else you feel completely useless.
