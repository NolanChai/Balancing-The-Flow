umatic event possible. After the third battle with the Scorched King, Ol began to use her magic against the humans in earnest. Her tactics evolved from simple fire spells and ball lightning to summoning tornadoes and blizzards and causing earthquakes.
 
 The first large-scale battle was an attempt by the forces of Ol and the Scorched King to take the city of Arlen. After a week of fighting, they were forced back into the mountains. They decided to use the ruins of the old castle there as a base of operations. There was one problem. The castle was now haunted by the ghosts of those who had perished in it’s walls. This didn’t concern Ol and the Scorched King, however. They took control of the spirits and used them against their enemies. They also brought in reinforcements from other cities to aid their efforts.
 
 After weeks of fighting they succeeded in taking the city of Arlen. They slaughtered every man, woman, and child that was not already dead. The bodies were piled up into massive pyres, lit on fire, and then thrown into the river. Ol took control of the dead and used them to construct a new castle to serve as their base of operations. They continued to fight for control of the city of Arlen but they would soon find themselves in another battle for control of a different city.
