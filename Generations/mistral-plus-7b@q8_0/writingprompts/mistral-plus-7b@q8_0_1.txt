through the small space, followed by an electronic humming sound that signaled the lock was in place. The sound of my blood pounding in my ears was deafening.

I lay on the floor, breathing heavily and wondering how I had ended up here. Just moments before, I had been strolling around town with my two young daughters, enjoying the summer weather and window-shopping. Then we heard the sirens and saw the police cars coming down the road. My girls began running toward them in excitement, but a woman nearby grabbed their hands to keep them out of the way. She warned us that it wasn't a good idea to get too close to the police.

Suddenly she clutched my arm tightly and said, ``There are rioters everywhere! I think we should try to get into one of these stores.'' Just then a man came running down the street, yelling wildly about some terrible crime. The crowd scattered quickly, but we stayed with the woman. She led us into this small store. A few minutes later she bolted out the door and locked it behind her. We were trapped inside!
