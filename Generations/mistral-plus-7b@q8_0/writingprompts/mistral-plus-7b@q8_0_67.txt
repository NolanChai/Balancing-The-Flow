this time I'm all alone and it hurts.

 As you probably know by now, I am in Afghanistan. In a few hours they are going to attack my position with everything they have and I will be killed. It is very important for me to tell you how much I love you before I go. You must carry on without me.

 I am not scared of death because I know it will not be painful or long. My only regret is that I won't get to see our children grow up. But I know they will both be fine without their father. It has been an honor and a privilege to be your husband for the past 12 years.

 You are my best friend and soul mate. I love you so much. Please tell the kids how proud of them I am, even though I won't be here to see it. Tell them that their daddy loves them with all his heart and always will.

 My deepest regret is leaving you without any warning or preparation. But this is a sacrifice I have made in order to protect our country from terrorists who seek to do us harm. We live in a world of evil now, but we must stand firm against it if we want to preserve peace for future generations. You are strong and courageous just like me, so please try your best to get through this difficult time.

 I am proud to be an American soldier fighting for liberty and justice around the world. When people say that serving in the military is not worth it because soldiers die young, I always tell them how lucky we are compared with most other people on earth who live short lives plagued by war, poverty, and disease. It may seem like a cliche, but freedom isn't free - someone has to fight for it every day whether they want to or not.

 So please do what I have asked you to do: continue living life without me while raising our children with love and understanding so that one day they can grow up knowing how much their father loved them despite his sacrifice for our country.
