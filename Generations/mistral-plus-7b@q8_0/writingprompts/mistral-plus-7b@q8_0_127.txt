: the fact that we keep getting these calls!'' The woman continued to pace across the room, wringing her hands in agitation. `` Whoever keeps calling is leaving a message on our machine and then hanging up, but there's no name or number associated with it. They just call and then hang up. It's so annoying, I don't even know what to do!'' 
 
The man stood quietly in the corner, watching his wife with concern. He knew how frustrated she could get when faced with a problem like this. `` Don't worry, dear. We'll figure out who it is and get rid of them once and for all.'' His words seemed to calm her down slightly as he drew close to her and put his arm around her shoulder.
 
`` Yes, I know we will,'' she said with renewed determination. ``But in the meantime, what can I do to stop these calls? It seems like every time I turn on my phone there's another one!'' 
 
The man shook his head sympathetically. `` There are a few things you can try to do to stop these unwanted calls. First, make sure your phone number is listed on the National Do Not Call Registry. This registry makes it illegal for companies to call you without your consent. You can also use apps like RoboKiller or Nomorobo to help block robocalls and telemarketers. If that doesn't work, you can try using a call blocking service such as Truecaller or Hiya to identify and block unwanted calls.'' 
 
The woman took all of this in, feeling slightly better about the situation. `` I think I understand now,'' she said with a nod. `` I guess we just need to do our best to keep our number off those telemarketers' lists and use technology like RoboKiller and call blocking services when possible.'' 
 
The man smiled at her understanding. `` Yes, that's exactly right,'' he said. `` Let's take back control over our phones and put a stop to these unwanted calls once and for all.''
