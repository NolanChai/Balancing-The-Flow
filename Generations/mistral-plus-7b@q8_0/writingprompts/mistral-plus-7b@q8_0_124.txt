Rita from HR and the bitch that sat next to me, Michelle.  
 
 They were all so smug. They walked around like they owned the place; never acknowledging my existence.
 
I had it all planned out. As soon as I was fired I would stick my middle finger up at them and leave for good.
 
`` Nothing. You look stupid,'' Michelle laughed. She always seemed to be in a good mood, unlike James and Rita who were constantly stressed and irritable.  ``Why are you being so nasty?'' she asked.  
   
 I wanted to explain about the years of torment, all the things they had done to me over the years: ignoring my needs for help, making fun of my appearance behind my back, spreading rumours around the office and generally just treating me like a piece of crap. But why bother? They would never understand.  
 
 ``I'm just tired,'' I said with a shrug.  
   
`` Are you OK?'' Michelle asked concerned. She was always so nice. It was a quality I envied but couldn't seem to possess myself.  

I wanted to tell her how much I hated working there. How it seemed like an uphill battle every day, and that my co-workers were just as big of a problem as the work load. But again I didn't bother. What was the point? She would never understand. 

``I'm fine,'' I said, with a sigh. ``It's just been a long couple of weeks.''  

Michelle smiled and put her hand on my shoulder. ``You're doing a great job, you know?'' she said with a genuine look of concern on her face.  ``Don't let anyone tell you different.''  I wanted to cry. She was the only one who ever showed me any compassion or kindness.  

``Thanks,'' I whispered back with a sad smile. ``I really appreciate it.''  Michelle squeezed my shoulder tightly. ``You deserve so much more than this,'' she said.  ``Don't let them get you down.'' I wanted to tell her that it was already too late; that the damage had been done and there was nothing anyone could do to fix it. But again, I didn't bother. What was the point? She would never understand.  
   
Michelle gave me a hug as we walked back towards our desks. ``You got this,'' she said with a smile on her face.  And for just that moment, I felt like everything was going to be ok.
