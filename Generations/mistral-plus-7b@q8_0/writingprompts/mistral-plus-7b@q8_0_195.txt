, open a holographic link to Command. I have an idea. ” 
 
 *Yes, commander? * 
 
 “ We can use our cloak to hide us from this ship’s scanners. ” 
 
 *True. That would help tremendously. We are not even remotely fast enough for a direct escape. We are also much smaller than the Dark Flag. Their weapons are likely more powerful than ours and we have no way of hiding or defending ourselves with the shield down. * 
 
 “ I know, but this isn’t about outrunning them. It’s about buying us time to reach our target and escape before they catch up. We can cloak and stay hidden long enough for them to lose track of us while we make a break for it. Then use the speed boost from our thrusters to put some distance between us and get into a safe orbit. ” 
 
 *I see what you’re saying, commander. It’s worth a try. Opening up cloaking systems now. * 
 
 As soon as the cloak activated I brought up the scanners. The ship had not detected our presence yet. We were in the clear for now.
 
 “ Tec, put us on an intercept course with our target. ” 
 
 *Calculating route. Estimated time of arrival: twelve minutes. * 
 
 I looked over at White Falcon who was still out cold. She wouldn’t be much help with this plan but we had no choice. This was our best shot. We had to get close enough to the Dark Flag to take it down before they realized what was happening. Then we would need to get as far away from them as possible.
 
 “ Tec, prepare us for battle. Arm our weapon systems and launch the drones. ” 
 
 *Weapon systems armed and ready. Drone launch sequence initiated. * 
 
 The small swarm of drones launched from the bays on the sides of our ship. They flew towards their targets with remarkable speed. They were designed to overwhelm an enemy by sheer numbers, not by power or accuracy. The hope was that they would distract and confuse our enemies long enough for us to escape.
 
 “ Weapons active. Targeting Dark Flag. Initiate attack sequence. ” 
 
 My fingers flew across the control panel as I instructed the ship to launch a barrage of missiles at the Dark Flag. The missiles hit their mark, causing an explosion that shook our ship. But the damage was minimal compared to what we could do. Our drones continued to swarm the Dark Flag, trying to knock out their shields and disable their weapons systems.
 
 *Commander, it appears that they have detected us! The cloaking field is no longer effective against their sensors. We need to get out of here before they can bring their weapons to bear. * 
 
 “ Then let’s go! Increase speed to maximum and head towards our target. ” 
 
 We left the battle zone quickly, pushing our thrusters as hard as we could to escape. But the Dark Flag was still on our tail. I knew that it wasn’t a matter of if they would catch up but when. So I needed to make sure we were ready for them. I brought up the shields and prepared our weapons. We had no choice but to fight.
