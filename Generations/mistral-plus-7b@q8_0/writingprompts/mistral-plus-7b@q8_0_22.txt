le out today. My name was not even mentioned and I felt as if I could not take another day of this hell. Just when I thought my life had taken a turn for the better, it brought me down. The government's decision to distribute the remaining food was very unfair to say the least. They didn't care that we were starving and were only concerned with making sure they got their fair share of the food. They were completely indifferent about our needs and only cared about making themselves feel superior over us. I felt as if I had lost all hope when my name was not called to receive a ration of food. My stomach grumbled loudly in protest and I knew that this day would be no different from the last.

As I walked towards my home, I saw the line of people waiting for their turn at the local distribution center. They looked as if they were starving, just like me. Their skin was pale and gaunt, their clothes ragged and dirty. The desperation in their eyes was palpable, and it broke my heart to see them in this state. I knew that if we didn't get help soon, many of these people would die.

When I finally reached the front of the line, an elderly woman stepped forward and asked for assistance. Her skin was wrinkled and her eyes were sunken with hunger. She told me she hadn't eaten in days and was feeling weak and ill from lack of food. I felt terrible for her plight and did my best to comfort and encourage her. Then, when it came time for her to receive her ration of food, her name wasn't called. Just like me, she walked away empty-handed.

I felt so helpless and frustrated at the system that had been put in place. It was unfair and unjust, but there didn't seem to be any way out of it. All we could do was keep trying our best to make sure everyone got their fair share of food. Unfortunately, there were still too many people going without enough to eat each day. I knew we needed some kind of change if things were ever going to get better for us all.
