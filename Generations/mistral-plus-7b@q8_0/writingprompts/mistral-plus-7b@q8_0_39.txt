 Henry : Oh that song.  It’s so catchy!  What else do we know about these victims?
 
 Detective Smith : All the bodies were found floating face down in the lake.  Two of them were women and one was a man, all had drowned.  None of them showed any signs of struggle, no weapons were used against them.  They all seemed to have been drowned.  The only other thing is that the man’s name was Robert Watts and he worked as a private investigator.
 
 Henry : This seems to be more than just some sort of random crime.  Someone set out with purpose to kill these people.  It makes sense that someone like Bob would have enemies, but there’s something else about these murders that is more sinister.  I’ll keep on this case as long as it takes to solve it.  In the meantime, we need to be extra vigilant and make sure that whoever did this doesn’t strike again.
