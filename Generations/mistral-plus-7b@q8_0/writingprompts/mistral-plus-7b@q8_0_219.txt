from his head, and hopped out of bed. The room was dark with the exception of the light coming from under his bathroom door, where he could see his reflection in the mirror on the wall as he brushed his teeth. John's morning ritual went something like this: 

 
 * Brush his teeth (30 seconds)
 * Wash face (15 seconds)
 * Dry face (20 seconds)
 * Get dressed (4 minutes)
 * Leave for work (1 minute)

 
 After a quick breakfast of cereal and orange juice, he left the apartment with a backpack filled with a laptop, books, and papers. John took a short walk to catch the bus that would take him downtown. He looked at his watch as the bus pulled up to the stop. It was 7:18 - just enough time for him to catch the bus before it left. The bus came to a stop, and he quickly jumped on and found a seat in the back. John read a novel he had picked up at the library the day before while riding the bus. He arrived at his office building at 7:35.

 
 Walking into the lobby, John was greeted with the smell of coffee. There was a small shop set up in the corner where people could pick up a hot or cold drink, as well as some snacks and lunch items. John made a mental note to stop there on his way out later that afternoon and picked up a large coffee with creamer and sugar. After getting his cup of coffee, he walked up to the elevator and waited for it to arrive. As soon as the doors opened, he stepped in and punched his floor number into the panel next to him. The elevator stopped on every floor until John got off at his floor and stepped out.
