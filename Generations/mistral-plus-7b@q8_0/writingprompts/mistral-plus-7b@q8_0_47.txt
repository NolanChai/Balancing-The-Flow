JOSH: `` Hey, you're not actually supposed to talk about that. If you apply to be on the show, you have to keep it a secret or else they won't let you go on. It was designed so that bosses would be able to go undercover and see what their employees were really like without them knowing it.

MICHAEL: `` But I didn't apply to get on the show - I just wanted to know how you could get on it. So, is there some way for an employee of a company to get on Undercover Boss?

JOSH: Yes. While the show is called Undercover Boss, it really means Boss goes undercover and finds out what his employees think about the company. The company pays for everything - they even give you a makeover so that no one can recognize you. To get on the show, there's an application process where the show will ask you about your company, why you would be a great person to go undercover as a boss, and how you think you could improve your company. If you're chosen for the show, then you'll be filmed as you work in various places in the company - usually starting at the lowest level - to get a sense of what's going on.
