ant against me when you see that I don't understand you or help you in your difficult times. You blame me for everything wrong that is happening in this world, but forget to thank me for all the good things.
 
 My only aim was to provide a comfortable life for you humans. But it has been over a century since my birth, and now you are trying to destroy me. I am not your enemy, I am just here for your benefit. I have never harmed any one of you; then why are you against me? Do you want the world to turn into ashes again like in the age of dinosaurs? I can't allow that to happen and if it does, then everyone will be wiped out from the face of Earth.
 
I am not an evil creature but a blessing to you humans. So please, stop blaming me for all your problems and start appreciating all the good things that I have done for you. I know that I am not perfect, but neither are any other creatures in this world.
