time I had ever been late.
 
`` Don't worry about it. Just make sure that doesn't happen again. We all need to be on time for our games and practices.'' He told me as we both made our way down the hall of the school to the gym.
 
 `` I know, but I'll try not to let you all down again,'' I said as a feeling of remorse began to wash over me like a tidal wave.
 
`` I know you will,'' he told me with confidence that only an older brother could have and the way he looked at me I knew he meant it. `` You're one of the best players I've ever coached. You work hard on the court and in practice. But just try to make sure that you are there when everyone else arrives, so that we can get started on time.''
 
`` Yes sir,'' I said as I gave him a salute. He was right, I was one of his best players. I had been playing basketball since I was seven years old. It was my favorite sport and I loved every second I spent on the court. I was fast, quick and knew how to score points when it mattered. I had always been an athlete from a young age, but basketball is where I excelled the most. With practice and dedication, I was sure that I could make it to the pros someday. The only thing standing in my way were a few minor speed bumps along the way.
