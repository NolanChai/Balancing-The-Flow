Mr. Thomas is correct. Driving a car can be very stressful, especially in heavy traffic. It would have been much better for Mr. White to take the bus. The bus would not only be faster and more convenient than driving, but it would also reduce Mr. White's stress level. Taking the bus is certainly preferable to driving when possible.
