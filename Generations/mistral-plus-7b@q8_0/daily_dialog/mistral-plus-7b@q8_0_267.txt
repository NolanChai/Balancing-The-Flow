I came to Los Angeles in 2018. After a few years of living here, I fell in love with the city and decided to stay long term. The weather, culture, and opportunities here are amazing, and Iâ€™m happy to call LA my home now!

Yes, I went to high school and then college in LA. It was a big change moving from Canada to California but it was definitely an experience that helped shape who I am today.

Yes, I did get a job right after graduating from college. I was hired as a software developer at a large tech company and started working immediately after graduation.

I moved to Los Angeles in 2012. I came here for college and have been living here ever since. It took me a few years of working at different jobs before I got my dream job as a designer for a major tech company.

I worked as an au pair for a French family while living in Paris. It was such an incredible experience! I lived with the family and took care of their two children. They were so kind and welcoming, and it really gave me a chance to immerse myself in the culture. I loved exploring the city and trying all the delicious food.
