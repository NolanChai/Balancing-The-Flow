Yes, accidents can be very scary and stressful. I am so sorry that happened to you. You need to take care of yourself first by getting checked out by a medical professional. Once you are safe and taken care of, it is important to seek help for the emotional and psychological aftermath of an accident. Anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common after accidents, so don't be afraid to reach out for support from your friends, family, and mental health professionals.
