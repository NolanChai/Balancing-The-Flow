Permanents come in different styles, including straight, wavy, curly, and kinky. They can also be permanent color treatments, like highlights or all-over color. Pink curl perms are very popular right now, because they add a lot of fun and personality to your look. The process involves using chemicals to break down the bonds of your hair, then re-forming them in a way that creates soft curls. A form permanent is also known as a “body wave” and is another great way to get permanent waves in your hair. It’s a less extreme version than a perm, creating gentle curves throughout your strands for a natural look.
