You’re right. Cooked chicken bones can be a choking hazard and splinter, which can cause serious internal damage to dogs. They’re not digestible and can get stuck in the stomach or intestines, causing painful obstructions. It’s best to only feed raw chicken bones to dogs, as they are softer than cooked ones and are easier on their digestion.
