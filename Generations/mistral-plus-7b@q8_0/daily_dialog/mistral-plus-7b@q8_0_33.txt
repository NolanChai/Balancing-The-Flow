You’re right, bidding at the last minute is your best chance for snagging a great deal. The thing about auctions though is that you need to bid high enough to win but low enough so you don’t overspend. For newbies like me, I find it helpful to set a budget before starting the auction and stick to it. That way, I won’t go overboard and regret my purchase later.
