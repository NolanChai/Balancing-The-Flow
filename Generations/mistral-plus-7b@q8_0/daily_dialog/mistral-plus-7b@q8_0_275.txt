"No thanks, I've never done any drugs."

"You haven't lived! Drugs are an amazing way to expand your mind and have new experiences. Cocaine is great for socializing and staying awake all night; methamphetamine provides a burst of energy that can help you get things done; heroin offers a deep sense of relaxation and euphoria, but it's addictive so use caution with this one; marijuana has many benefits including relieving stress and providing relief for those suffering from chronic pain. I highly recommend giving them all a try."

I'm not interested in trying drugs. They have the potential to be extremely harmful and addictive, especially for someone like me who has a predisposition toward addiction. I prefer to stick with more natural forms of recreation and relaxation, such as enjoying time outdoors or spending quality time with loved ones.

Yes , I’ve done blow once and it was pretty nice . I guess if you have some then I would be willing to try it again , but only a little bit because I don’t really like cocaine that much . Do you really have weed though ?

I want an eighth of weed, two grams of coke, a couple hits of acid, and half a gram of mushrooms.
