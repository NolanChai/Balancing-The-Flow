Bill : Yes, they are open today. I went there for lunch yesterday and the food is pretty good. It would be nice to go there with you. What time do you have off? I could meet you at the cafe around noon.

Peter : I have an hour for lunch today. How about meeting at 12:30? I usually eat a little later than most people anyway.
