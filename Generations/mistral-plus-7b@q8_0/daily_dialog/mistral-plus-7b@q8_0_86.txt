Yes, after four months here I feel that my Chinese has definitely improved. At first it was so difficult to understand anything and I had no idea how to respond to simple questions. However now I can have full conversations with people in Chinese and even occasionally make some jokes too.

Yes, when you first arrive in China, it is easy to misunderstand the speed and tone of Chinese conversations. Chinese people tend to speak much faster than those from other cultures, and they use a lot of slang and colloquialisms that can be hard for foreigners to understand. This can lead to confusion or misunderstanding, especially when you are just starting to learn the language. It also helps to keep in mind that Chinese people tend to shout when they get excited or upset – this is normal behavior for them, but it may seem very loud and aggressive to someone who is not used to it. With practice, you’ll become more familiar with the way Chinese conversations work, and you’ll be able to understand them better.

Yes, bargaining is quite common in China. It’s part of the culture here. But for you as a foreigner, I can understand why you might feel like there was an argument or shouting match going on. The pace and tone of the conversation can be very different from what you’re used to back home. The key to getting used to it is just time and practice. With more exposure and experience, you’ll start to understand and appreciate this cultural phenomenon.
