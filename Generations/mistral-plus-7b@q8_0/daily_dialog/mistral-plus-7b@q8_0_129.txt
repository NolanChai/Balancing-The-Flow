Yes, I'm a vegetarian. There are plenty of restaurants that offer delicious vegetarian options such as pastas and salads, so don't worry about it. We should have no problem finding somewhere for both of us to eat.

A vegan is someone who does not eat any animal products, including meat, dairy and eggs. Vegetarians avoid eating any animal flesh but do eat dairy and eggs. Vegans tend to focus more on plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables and legumes.

Yes, being vegan can definitely be challenging at times. Eating out or traveling can become a lot of planning to make sure there are options available for me. I think the biggest challenge is having people understand what being vegan actually means and why I choose to live this lifestyle . But , it really just comes down to educating them and sharing with them all the reasons why I chose this path .
