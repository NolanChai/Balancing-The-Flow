Yes, I know.  I should have told you about my girlfriend and how much I love her.  It wasn't right for me to keep that secret from you.  I wish I had been more open with you, but at the time, it was something I felt very protective about.

I should have been more open and honest with you about my relationship with her.  I didn't want to hurt your feelings, so I avoided the topic altogether.  I know it wasn't fair for me not to tell you the truth.

I should have been more open with you about my relationship. I was afraid that you would judge me negatively if I told you about my girlfriend and the possibility of marriage. In hindsight, I realize how foolish it was to keep this from you. I want to apologize for not being transparent with you and promise to be more open in the future.
