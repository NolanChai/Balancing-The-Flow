It is true that skiing is quite dangerous, especially when there are avalanches. However, with proper training and safety gear, it can be very safe. Instructors usually take precautionary measures to ensure the safety of their students. They teach them how to avoid avalanche-prone areas, use appropriate equipment, and follow safe skiing practices. With these steps, skiing is relatively safe and an enjoyable sport.

The skiing clubs usually train in some remote areas with heavy snowfall, and artificial snow machines are also used to create more snow. The winter resorts often use these methods to ensure a consistent and sufficient amount of snow throughout the ski season.

Snowmaking can have a negative impact on the environment due to its use of energy and water. Additionally, the chemicals used in the process are hazardous for both humans and animals. However, when done properly with proper management practices, snowmaking can be an effective way of maintaining consistent levels of snow without harming the environment.
