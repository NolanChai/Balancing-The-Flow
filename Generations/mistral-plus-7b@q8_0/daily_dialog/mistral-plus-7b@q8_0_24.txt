I think you are right. Susan and Peter have been married for years now, they've had their share of problems but they're still in love with each other. They can always find a way to work through their differences and come out stronger on the other side. I believe that if she decides to go through with it, it will be more of an impulsive decision rather than something they both want for sure. With time and patience, I'm confident that Susan and Peter will reconcile and continue their journey together as a happily married couple.
