I did buy some khakis like yours, but mine are darker than yours. I've been wearing them around the house for a week or so to make sure they fit properly before trying them out in public. They look great on me and have a very stylish fit. The pockets are deep enough to keep my wallet, keys, and cell phone securely in place while still looking sharp with their slim cut legs. They're comfortable too - I haven't had any issues with chafing or riding up like some other pants I've tried in the past. I highly recommend them!
