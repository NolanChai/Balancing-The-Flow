"Yes, Jimmy is doing much better now," said the doctor with a smile."It appears that the medication I prescribed is working well. He should be back on his feet in no time at all. Until then, it's important for him to stay in bed and rest.I also recommend limiting his food intake during this period of healing, as eating rich foods could slow down his recovery."

Doctor: Jimmyâ€™s temperature is normal now. He should be getting better soon if you take care of him at home and follow the treatment I have prescribed for him. Keep a close eye on him, make sure he drinks plenty of water and takes his medicine as instructed. If his symptoms worsen or do not improve within a few days, please bring him back to see me again.

"Jimmy seems to be doing better, Mrs. Williams. I am glad to see he is improving. Keep a close eye on him over the next few days and ensure that he takes it easy and gets lots of rest. He should not be too active for another week or so. Make sure he drinks plenty of fluids as well.

Yes, Jimmy does have a fever. He has a slight temperature of 101 degrees Fahrenheit. His body is fighting off the infection, but it will take time to recover fully. We may need to give him some medication to reduce the fever and make him more comfortable. Please call me if you notice any other symptoms or have any concerns about Jimmy's condition."
