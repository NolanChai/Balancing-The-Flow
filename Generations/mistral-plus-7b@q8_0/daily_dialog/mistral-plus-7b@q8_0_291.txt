I understand your concerns. Downsizing is never easy, and it can be a very stressful time for everyone involved. It's natural for people to feel nervous or uncertain about their job security during periods of change like this. I know how you feel, having worked at many different companies throughout my career.

The good news is that most employers take great care of their employees when times are tough and they have to make difficult decisions about downsizing or layoffs. They usually provide a generous severance package and outplacement services to help ease the transition for those who have been affected by the changes. With proper planning and preparation, you can be confident that you'll land on your feet in no time!
