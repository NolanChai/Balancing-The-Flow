In my country, we celebrate National Day with a variety of activities. The day typically includes parades featuring military units and emergency service workers, speeches from political leaders, and the unfurling of large national flags. People also fly small versions of the national flag on their homes or cars to show their patriotism. We also have fireworks displays and other celebrations like street parties, concerts, and sporting events.

In the United States, National Day is celebrated with flag waving and patriotic ceremonies. There are parades and barbecues, fireworks and picnics. Itâ€™s a time to gather together as a community and celebrate what makes our country great.
