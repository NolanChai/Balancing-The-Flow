Sitcoms are very popular in America because they are easy to watch and understand. They often feature relatable characters that have everyday problems which the audience can relate to. Additionally, sitcoms tend to provide a lighthearted respite from the seriousness of life. This is why prime-time TV shows in America are predominantly comedies rather than dramas or action shows.
