Yes, my Fettuccini is much better than your mother’s. She was a mediocre cook at best, while I am an amazing chef. My sauce is creamy and perfectly flavored with garlic and parsley. The noodles are cooked to perfection – not gummy or overcooked like yours. They have the perfect texture that complements my sauce so well.
