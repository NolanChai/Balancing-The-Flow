"Excuse me, is this seat taken?" I asked the passenger in the seat next to mine. She had her head down and was reading a book.

"Yes, this seat is taken," she said without looking up from her book.

"Oh, I apologize for disturbing you," I replied, "I'll just sit over here." I moved a few seats away.

The passenger in the seat next to me smiled and gestured for me to take a seat.

"Actually, this seat is open if you would like it," she said.

"Thank you so much!" I replied gratefully. "I appreciate you letting me sit here."
