No, thanks. I'm busy tonight. Let's do something tomorrow instead.

I would like to see Dunkirk. It's getting great reviews and I know that it'll be a very moving film. We could go see it this Friday evening, if you want to meet after work.

I think we should go see The Secret Life of Bees. Itâ€™s a really heartwarming movie that is bound to bring us closer together as friends and will certainly inspire a conversation about life, love, and relationships after we leave the theater.
