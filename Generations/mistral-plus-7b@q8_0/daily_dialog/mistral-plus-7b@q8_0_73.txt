Yes, she has some serious anger issues. I know a great bar on the corner called The Lucky Lady. They have cheap drinks and a fun atmosphere. It’s sure to help you take your mind off Lisa and meet some new people.

Yes, she really is beautiful, Kenny. She has an amazing body and is just so stunning to look at. And her personality seems to match her looks as well, because she's also a lot of fun. I don't know how you broke up with such a woman.

" Well, let's just say that we had some disagreements about our relationship. I think she expected more from me than I was capable of giving at the time. It was a mutual decision to go our separate ways and I feel like it was for the best in the long run."

Kenny nodded eagerly. “Okay, let’s go.” He led the way to a nearby bar and introduced them both. The two women seemed very friendly, and they spent quite some time chatting together over drinks. After a while, one of the girls caught Kenny’s eye and winked at him.

Kenny grinned back and motioned for her to come closer. “Hi,” he said, “I’m Kenny. I was wondering if you might be interested in going out sometime?” The girl smiled and replied with a shy, “Yes, I’d love to go out with you.” They exchanged phone numbers and agreed on a date for the following weekend.

"Hey, babe!" Kenny called across the bar, hoping to make eye contact with his new crush. She smiled back at him and walked over, ordering a drink before sitting down next to him.

"So what brings you into this place tonight?" she asked. "I've never seen you here before."

Kenny shrugged. "Just looking for a little fun, I guess," he said with a shrug. "But I must say you look like you could provide some entertainment yourself!"

She blushed and laughed softly at his compliment. "Well, thank you! Maybe we can see about getting some fun going tonight."

Kenny: Sorry for the sudden exit, but I don't want to get caught in a confrontation with Lisa. She really blew up when we broke up and I know that if she spots me she'll give me a piece of her mind. So it's better if I just leave and let her cool off.

Barbara: It's okay. I understand why you had to go. It can be pretty stressful dealing with an ex who has unresolved emotions. I've been through something like that myself, so I know what you mean. Just try to stay calm and keep your distance until she's over it.
