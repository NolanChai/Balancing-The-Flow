If a company violates government regulations, it can face hefty fines and penalties. For example, in the United States, companies that exceed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pollution standards for hazardous air pollutants or water contaminants can be subject to civil penalties of up to $37,500 per day per violation. Additionally, some industries are required to obtain special permits from the EPA and other regulatory agencies that carry stiff penalties for violations.
