"Okay, let's talk more about this. What exactly would be involved in playing soccer? I really don't have any experience with the sport."

"Soccer is a team sport played on a rectangular field with two teams of 11 players each. The objective is to score goals by getting the ball into your opponent's goal. Soccer requires agility, endurance and teamwork. If you enjoy competitive sports and like being physically active, then playing soccer can be an exciting opportunity for you."

Soccer is quite different from American football. Soccer has 11 players per team playing on a rectangular field, while American football has 11 players per side as well. The object of soccer is to score goals by kicking the ball into the opposing teamâ€™s net. The object of American football is to advance down the field by either running with or passing the ball to gain yardage in order to eventually score points by crossing into the end zone.
