Art supplies can be found at many different stores, including big box stores like Walmart and Target. For higher-quality art materials, specialty art stores such as Dick Blick Art Materials or Michaels are excellent options. When purchasing for children, I would recommend a beginner's set of acrylic paints, oil pastels, and markers.
