A heat recovery system is a type of technology that captures and reuses the thermal energy that would otherwise be wasted. In this case, the factory has installed a heat recovery system to capture the exhaust gases from their printing presses and use them to provide heat to the dryers in the production process. By doing this, they have been able to significantly reduce their energy consumption, resulting in lower utility bills and a more sustainable production process overall.
