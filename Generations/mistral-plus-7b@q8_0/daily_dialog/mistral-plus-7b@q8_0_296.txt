Yes, we should invite Jason to play. It might make for a more exciting game, with another player adding some dynamics and humor to the mix. I know he loves watching movies on HBO and is always talking about them. If we don't invite him to join in, he might get angry or upset because he'll feel left out. So it would definitely be worth including Jason in our game.
