Yes, it's time to take down the Christmas tree.  They do begin to look a little worse for wear at this point in the season.  It might not be much longer until those needles start falling off.  There are a few loose branches that will probably break if they aren't trimmed back now.  The decorations can also get dusty and dingy after a while.  I think it's time to put the tree away and get ready for next Christmas.

Yes, I know. Maybe if you had helped me put it up in the first place things would have gone a lot better for us. You always just stand by and watch while I do all the work. But now it’s time to take down the Christmas tree. We need to make room for other things, like presents for birthdays or holidays that are coming up. Let’s put it in the basement until next year when we can enjoy putting it up again with some fresh decorations.

"I know you love your Christmas tree, but it is time for it to go. It has become a bit of an eyesore and is causing some potential safety hazards. Let’s take a few moments to disassemble it properly and then find a new home for it. I’m sure there are plenty of families in the neighborhood who would love to have it."

"Yes, I know you love your tree, but it is time for it to come down. It’s getting very dry and dropping needles all over the place. The branches are sagging and looking pretty bare at this point. I agree that Christmas was a great time with everyone here and we had so much fun, but it is time to take it down."
