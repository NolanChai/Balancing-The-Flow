Getting a ride to the hospital should cost around $10. Rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft often charge about that amount for a short drive. However, if you live in an area with high traffic or long distances to travel, it may cost more than that.

The time is 9:34. It's almost 10 o'clock!

I think it will cost about $75 for a visit to the hospital. That includes your copay and any medications or tests that might be required. If you need to stay overnight, the charges could increase substantially.
