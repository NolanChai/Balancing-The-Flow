"I love it!" she exclaimed, twirling around in the new dress. "It's so soft and flowy, yet still elegant. The color is perfect for my skin tone too."

She reached out to embrace the saleswoman with a huge hug of gratitude. "Thank you so much for helping me find this beautiful dress! It really makes me feel confident and radiant."

"I have some other options available in a small size. Let me show you."

"This one here would fit perfectly. It is made of soft cotton and has just enough stretch for comfort."

"And this style is so adorable! The delicate lace trim adds just the right amount of femininity. It has elastic in the back for a snug fit."

"These two colors are perfect for you, with their pretty pastel hues. Which do you prefer?"
