"But I don't want to read ! It's boring and I never understand what I'm reading anyway. And I have so much homework already, I can't fit in any more."

"I know you think that now, but it will be worth it. Reading helps improve your vocabulary and writing skills. Plus, the more you read, the better you will become at comprehending what you read. It might be tough at first, but once you get into a routine of reading regularly, you'll find that you actually enjoy it."

"Ok , I guess you're right. I'm just not a big fan of reading and would rather do something else with my time . But I will try to make an effort ."
