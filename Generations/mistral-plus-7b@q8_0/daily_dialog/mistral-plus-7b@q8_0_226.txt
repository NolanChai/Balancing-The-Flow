Tony’s behavior is normal for a young child. It is part of his learning and developmental stages. He has yet to grasp the concept of empathy and self-control. As a parent, it is your job to guide him through this phase. Here are some things you can do to help:

1. Set clear boundaries and expectations for Tony’s behavior.
2. Provide positive reinforcement when he behaves well.
3. Be consistent in your discipline approach.
4. Help him understand and manage his emotions.

Children are still learning how to behave, so sometimes they can say and do things that seem disrespectful. It’s important for parents to set boundaries and enforce consequences for inappropriate behavior. In this case, you can explain to your son that his words hurt your feelings, and encourage him to show more respect for you. You may also want to reward him for behaving positively.
