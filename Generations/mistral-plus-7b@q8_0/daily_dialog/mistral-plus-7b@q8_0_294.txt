I understand why you would want to send out the lucky forwards. They may seem silly and superstitious, but there is no harm in trying them, right? After all, what do you have to lose by sending a few good luck messages? Maybe they will bring some positive energy into your life, or maybe they won't, but it is worth a try. So, go ahead and send those lucky forwards- who knows, they may just work their magic after all!
