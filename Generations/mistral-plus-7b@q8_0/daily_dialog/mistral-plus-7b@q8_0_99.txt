I would love to attend the party! I've never been to a birthday party before, so this should be quite an experience. I think it will be lots of fun and I can't wait to meet new people. See you there around 6pm then?

I don’t need any help setting up. Thanks, though.  I know how to do this kind of thing. I just wanted you to know that you were welcome and that I would be happy to help in any way I could. It will be great seeing you there, and I can’t wait for the party!
