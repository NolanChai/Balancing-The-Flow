Yes, I would love to go to your party. It sounds like it'll be so much fun!

I was wondering what kind of theme it is and who all will be attending? What time does it start? I know a lot of other people who might be interested in coming as well.

I'm having dinner with some friends and then we might go out for drinks afterwards. It was just something that came up at the last minute so unfortunately I won't be able to make it to your party this Friday.

I regret that I will not be able to attend your party. But if I had known sooner, maybe I could have adjusted my schedule so that I could attend. It sounds like a great time, and I'm sorry I won't be there to share in the fun.

I am sorry that I won’t be able to make it to your party this Friday. It sounds like a great opportunity for us all to get together and have some fun. Please know how much I would’ve enjoyed spending time with everyone at the gathering. Hopefully we can all schedule some future plans for another social gathering in the near future.
