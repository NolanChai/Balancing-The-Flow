Joe said, “OK, I understand. Let’s do dinner and a movie on Friday instead.”

Mary said, “That would be great! It has been too long since we have gone out for dinner.”

I was thinking of catching an action flick, like Fast & Furious 10 or Transformers: Rise of the Beasts. They're both opening soon and I love big-budget movies with lots of explosions. What about you? Do you have any preferences for genre or type of movie?

Joe : I am great ! How about you , Mary ? How are you ?
Mary : I am doing great ! Thank you for asking, Joe.
Joe : I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight?
Mary : I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper.
Joe : OK. What about going to the movies on Friday night?
Mary : What were you planning on seeing?
Joe : I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer.
Mary : How about The Secret Life of Bees? It’s a lovely movie with great characters.
