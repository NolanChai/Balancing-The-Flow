Frank is getting married to a lovely Spanish girl that he fell in love with during his travels. They met and hit it off immediately, and it has been quite the whirlwind romance for them both. They have been together for almost two years now, and they are truly so happy together. It is so wonderful to see the happiness and love in their relationship, and we wish them all the best as they embark on this new journey of marriage together.
