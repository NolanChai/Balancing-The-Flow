I am sorry for the delay, ma'am. Your bags should have been sent up to your room shortly after you arrived. I will check with our porters and see what is taking so long. I apologize again for the inconvenience.

Yes, the name tags are clearly visible. It should be no problem getting your luggage to you right away. Let me make sure that all of your bags have been retrieved and delivered to the room. I will contact Housekeeping for assistance if necessary.
