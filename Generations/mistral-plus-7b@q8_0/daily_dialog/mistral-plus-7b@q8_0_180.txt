The boss announced a 3% pay raise for all employees, which is significantly less than last year’s increase. While some of us might have expected or even hoped for a larger raise, we shouldn’t be too disappointed because anything is better than nothing. We should take the new pay raise with a positive attitude and be grateful for whatever amount of increase we received.
