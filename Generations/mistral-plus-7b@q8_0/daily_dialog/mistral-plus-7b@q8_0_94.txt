Yes, I do have the latest statement. There were several unauthorized charges made on my card within the past week. Some of them are quite large. I need to get these charges reversed and secure my account immediately.

The charges you’re referring to include a $75 purchase at Target, an $80 charge for a taxi ride, and a $120 purchase at a clothing store. If these charges weren’t authorized by you, you may be the victim of fraud. The first step is to report any unauthorized transactions to your credit card issuer immediately. They will likely initiate an investigation into the charges and work with you to resolve the situation.

We will need to take a closer look at your debit card statement and determine if there has been any fraudulent activity.  If you did not authorize the charges, then it is possible that your card was stolen or compromised in some way.  To protect your account, we may cancel your debit card and issue you a new one with a different number.  We will also initiate an investigation into the charges on your statement to determine if they were legitimate or not.

An investigation into fraudulent credit card charges can take anywhere from a few days to several months. Our Fraud and Security department will work as quickly as possible, however some cases may take longer than others depending on the complexity of the situation. We will keep you updated along the way.
