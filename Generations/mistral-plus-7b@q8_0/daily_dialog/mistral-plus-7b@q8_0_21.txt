Lily’s number is 555-4321. She should get back with you shortly.

Tony, it’s Lily. I just got your message. I’m sorry I missed your call. I should be back in the office later today and can give you a call then if that works for you? Or would you prefer me to call you now? Let me know.

Hello Tony. No, Lily isn’t here at the moment. She’s probably running late from class or something. Could you ask her to call you back when she gets in? Her cellphone number is 305-472-9182. I’ll make sure she sees this message as soon as possible.
