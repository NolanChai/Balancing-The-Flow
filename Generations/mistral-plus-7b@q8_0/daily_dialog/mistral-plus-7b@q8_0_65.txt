"Yes, I thought we were meeting here as well. My bad, I completely overlooked the movie and our plans for this evening."

"It's okay, I just got off work late so it was easy to get confused about the time. Next time, let's make sure we're clear on where and when we're meeting."

Gary said, "I thought we were supposed to meet at the apartment before going to the theater. I wasn't aware that we were meeting at the theater."

Ann replied, "Yes, our plan was to meet at the theater. I suppose we did not communicate this clearly enough. Let's go and watch the movie now."
