Monica : OK, thanks for showing me the way. I'll go now.

Employee : You are quite welcome, Monica. The HR office is located on the third floor, room 3106. To get there, take the right elevator and go to the third floor. After you get off the elevator, go straight down the hall until you reach room 3106 on your left.
