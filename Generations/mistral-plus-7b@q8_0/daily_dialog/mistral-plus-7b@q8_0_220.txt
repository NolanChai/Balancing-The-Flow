Yes, I think going shopping on Sunday would be perfect . I need some time off from my work to just unwind and enjoy some time with you . It will give me a chance to recharge my batteries and come back refreshed for Monday . So let â€™ s go shopping the day after tomorrow , OK ?

We will go shopping on Sunday. We need to visit a clothing store and a butcher's shop. At the clothing store, I will pick out some new shirts and pants for you. At the butcher's shop, we will select some delicious chicken breasts that are perfect for grilling.
