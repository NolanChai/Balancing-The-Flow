I don't really like coffee either, it's just too bitter. But I guess you could at least try a little bit to see if you enjoy it. It does have some pretty good health benefits, so maybe give it a chance. Just remember that there are different types of coffees out there, so you might need to find one that suits your taste before deciding that you hate it completely.
