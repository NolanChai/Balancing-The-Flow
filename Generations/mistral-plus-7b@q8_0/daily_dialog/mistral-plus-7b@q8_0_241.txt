"Yes, Mike. It seems like a valid excuse for being late."

"I really didn't have much of a choice in the matter. My sister was sick and needed my help. I know I should have been more mindful of the time, but you must understand that sometimes unexpected circumstances arise. I promise it won't happen again."

"I understand your frustration, but let me explain. My sister really had been sick those two times. It's not my fault that she got sick again just after I left for work."
"Yes, I know it's a coincidence. But the fact is you have been late twice in the past week because of this excuse. I expect better from you, Mike. You need to be more reliable and punctual."

"I apologize for my tardiness. It won't happen again. I won't let you down."

"I know that you want to be on time, but please do your best to avoid being late in the future. Your punctuality is important and I appreciate your efforts to be on time."
