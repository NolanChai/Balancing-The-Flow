The Type A account is more suitable for customers who want flexibility in their banking. It allows you to use the money as soon as it is available, while also offering some protection from unexpected costs. The Type B account, on the other hand, is a fixed-term deposit that offers a higher interest rate but requires a longer commitment period. If you need quick access to your funds or want more flexibility in how you use them, then the Type A account is likely the better choice for you.
