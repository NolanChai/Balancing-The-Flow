Yes, the flea market is a great place to find second-hand and vintage treasures. It's true that sometimes people can haggle for a better deal at a flea market than they would get in a store. However, I prefer to pay the price tag and not have to worry about negotiating or bartering. To me, it's more important to support the business and the artist rather than trying to save money by bargaining for a lower price.
