Elvin has been working on the online auction for quite some time now, but it seems like he’s reached his breaking point. It may be time to consider hiring a new employee to help with this project. With someone else taking over a portion of Elvin’s responsibilities, he should be able to focus more on other tasks and feel less stressed out. A new hire could bring fresh ideas and an eagerness to learn, which can lead to better results for the company in the long run.
