The waiter arrived with the check. Gordon glanced at it, and then handed it to his wife.

"It looks like we spent a lot of money tonight," she said, taking a look at the total.

"Yes, but it was worth every penny," Gordon replied. "This was one of the best meals I've ever had."

They both agreed that they had enjoyed their evening immensely and were glad they decided to splurge on such a nice meal out together.

"No, really. It was a great meal and I had an amazing time. Let me pay for our dinner this time."

"No, really. Let me take care of this one. Please don't worry about it." Gordon replied firmly. He felt he couldn't let Sarah foot the entire bill after a wonderful meal they shared together. He was determined to do this one thing for her and show her how grateful he was for their friendship and her kindness over the years.

"Ok," Gordon said, "I guess if we're splitting the bill, then let's go over to the cashier and take care of that." He walked over to the register and paid his half of the bill.

After they had taken their payment receipts, they stepped outside and hailed a taxi. Gordon was tired from the long day at work and didn't feel like walking home in the cold. As the cab pulled away, he breathed a sigh of relief and thanked his friend for treating him to dinner.

Gordon smiled. "I'll make sure we go somewhere nice." He grabbed the bill and handed it to the server. As they left the restaurant, he said to his companion, "This is just a small token of my gratitude for all that you have done for me. You truly are a wonderful friend, and I am grateful for your support and kindness."
