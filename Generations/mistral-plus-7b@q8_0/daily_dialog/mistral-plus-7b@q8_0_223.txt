I would recommend Norton AntiVirus as one of the best anti-virus programs available.  Other good anti-virus programs include McAfee and Kaspersky.

The anti-virus program I use and recommend is called AVG. You can download it from their website, http://www.avg.com. It’s a great program that does an excellent job of protecting your computer against viruses and other malware.

I use my computer for work, internet browsing, and entertainment. I like that I can stream music, watch videos, play games, and do all sorts of other things on my computer. It’s really convenient because it gives me a lot of flexibility when it comes to the types of activities I want to pursue. I also use it for staying in touch with friends and family through social media and email.
