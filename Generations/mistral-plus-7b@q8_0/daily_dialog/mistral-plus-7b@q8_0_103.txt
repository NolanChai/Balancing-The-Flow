The banker is in charge of handling the currency and making sure that everyone follows the game rules. As you know, when you pass “Go”, you collect $200 from the banker. In this instance, you have cheated by taking the money without the banker’s permission. This behavior is dishonest and unethical, and goes against the spirit of the game. It is important to play Monopoly fairly, and follow all of the rules in order to ensure that everyone has a fair chance at winning.
