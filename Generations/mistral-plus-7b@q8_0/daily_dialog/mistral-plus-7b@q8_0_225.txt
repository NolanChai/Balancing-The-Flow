Experience is important, but capability is definitely worth more. I think a good way to evaluate whether you would be a great fit for this position is by having a trial period in which we could really see your capabilities and skillset. You would have the opportunity to show us what you can do and if it was successful, then perhaps a permanent position might follow.
