Yes, please. Here is my passbook with all the relevant information. As per our policy for purchasing traveler's checks, we require a valid passport and proof of address to complete the transaction.

I would like five one hundred dollar traveler's checks and two two hundred dollar traveler's checks.

Here is the next turn in the dialog:

Customer: How much does it cost for three thousand dollars worth of traveler’s checks?
Bank Employee: Traveler’s checks typically cost between $5 and $10 each, depending on their denomination. So three thousand dollars worth of traveler’s checks would cost anywhere from $30 to $60 in fees.
