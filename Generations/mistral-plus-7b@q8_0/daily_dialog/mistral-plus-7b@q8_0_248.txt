Good morning, Mrs. Jones! We'd be happy to bring you a delicious breakfast. Would you like some scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage and pancakes? Or perhaps just the pancakes and fruit. We are able to accommodate any request with our 24-hour room service.

Room service. Good morning, this is Room 113. I would like some breakfast, please.

Right. Excuse me, Mrs. Jones?

Thatâ€™s right.

What can I do for you?

I would like some grapefruit juice, marmalade, two scrambled eggs with two sausages, toast and a pot of black coffee, please. How long will it take?

Just a few minutes, ma'am.
