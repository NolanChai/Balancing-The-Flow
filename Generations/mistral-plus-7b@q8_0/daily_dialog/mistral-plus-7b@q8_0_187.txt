Your prices may be a bit higher than what we were expecting, but that is not a reason to turn down this opportunity. As mentioned earlier, prices of ornaments have been on the rise in recent years. The offer you presented includes a wide range of ornaments and accessories, all of which are well-crafted and of high quality. Considering the current market conditions, your prices actually compare favorably with other quotes we've received from different suppliers. We would like to encourage you to seriously consider this offer before making your final decision.

I can see your point. Your ornaments are indeed well-designed and of high quality. But when it comes to price, we must consider our budget. The prices you have offered are higher than what we expected, so unfortunately we cannot agree with them.

The seller responded, "I am sorry if our prices seem a little high. We can offer a 10% discount on your order to make it more attractive for you." The buyer replied, "That helps a lot. I think we could probably agree on the terms now. Thank you for working with us to make this deal happen."
