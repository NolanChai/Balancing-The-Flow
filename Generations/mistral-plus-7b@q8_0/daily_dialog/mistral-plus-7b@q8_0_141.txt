We do our best to process all applications in a timely manner, but it's important to be patient during this stage of the recruitment process.

If you don't pass the interview, we usually don't call candidates who didn't make it. We suggest you don't take it personally and just keep trying for future opportunities.

Keep working on your skills and experience and remember that every interview is a learning opportunity.

If you don't pass, we won't call you. You can wait for two weeks to see if you get any response from us. If there are no calls, it means you didn't make the cut. Don't worry though!
