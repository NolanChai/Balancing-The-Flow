I understand why you might feel disappointed and frustrated about my decision to go hunting with Mark instead of spending our vacation together. It was not my intention to hurt your feelings or make you feel left out. We have had many great vacations as a couple, but I also enjoy the chance to spend time with my friends on occasion. I know how important it is for us to take time for ourselves and for each other, so I promise that when the next vacation opportunity arises, we will prioritize our time together.

John : Sorry if I upset you. But just because we've been together for a year, that doesn't mean that we have to do everything together. I still want us to spend time together on our vacation, but I also feel the need to go hunting with my buddy Mark this fall. He and I have a very special bond and I don't want to miss out on that opportunity just because you don't like it. I promise that after our vacation, we will take some time to do something that would make both of us happy.
