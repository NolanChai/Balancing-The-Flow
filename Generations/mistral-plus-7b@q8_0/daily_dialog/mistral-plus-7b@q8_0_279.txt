Yes, I understand your frustration. Drivers who are inexperienced and drive recklessly are always frustrating to deal with. It can be a real headache when youâ€™re stuck in traffic behind one of them. The driver probably needs more practice on the road and needs to improve his driving skills. The sooner he gets off the road, the better it will be for everyone else around him.
