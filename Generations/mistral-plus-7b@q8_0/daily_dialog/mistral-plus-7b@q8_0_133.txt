I liked Aesthetics best. The course was quite enjoyable and taught me a lot about art, beauty, and human experience. It opened my eyes to the world of aesthetic appreciation and encouraged me to look at things from a different perspective. I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in aesthetics.
