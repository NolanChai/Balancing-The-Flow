It usually takes only a few minutes to get to the buffet. Most cafeterias are well-designed so that food stations are easy to navigate. With this in mind, you can probably get from your seat to the buffet in about 5 minutes or less, especially if youâ€™re near the front of the line.

The cafeteria lines are usually quite busy, so they move pretty quickly. The food options are quite varied and most of it is relatively inexpensive compared to eating out at a restaurant. To order your food, simply walk up to the cafeteria line, where a worker will ask what you would like. From there, they will hand you a tray for your meal. Then you can fill it with whatever food options you desire.

The line moves pretty quickly. The workers are trained to get people in and out as fast as possible, so they encourage everyone to move along efficiently. To order at a cafeteria, simply approach one of the serving stations, point to what you want, and then tell the server how much you would like. They will then put your food on your tray, and then you will go on your way.
