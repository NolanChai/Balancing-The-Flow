My brother is sponsoring my trip. He will help cover my expenses while Iâ€™m in Minneapolis.

I have strong ties to my home country of Canada. I am a permanent resident there and have lived there for over ten years. I am employed as a software engineer at a well-known Canadian company, where I work with a team of talented and dedicated colleagues. My parents , brother , and extended family still live in Canada, so it is important for me to stay connected with them. Additionally, I have invested in property in Canada and hold many of my assets there.

I am financially independent. To prove this , I have copies of my bank statements and pay stubs which show that I am able to support myself without needing financial assistance from others. Additionally , I have a valid passport and proof of travel insurance .
