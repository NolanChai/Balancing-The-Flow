No, unfortunately I will not be able to show you the apartment today. It is currently occupied by the previous tenant and we need to wait until they move out before we can schedule a viewing. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Please let us know when you are available to view the apartment so we can set up an appointment as soon as possible.

Yes, you need to schedule an appointment to view an apartment. The landlord usually requires potential tenants to schedule a viewing appointment before allowing them access to the unit. This is done so that the property can be shown on its best side and the landlord can ensure that only serious applicants are allowed to view it. To schedule an appointment to view the apartment, you would need to contact the landlord or management company for the rental unit and set up a time that works for both of you.

Yes, Friday would work well for me. Could you provide some more information about the apartment?

Yes, 6 p.m. on Friday is a great time to view the apartment. Please confirm your availability by calling (555) 123-4567 and let me know if this is still convenient for you. We will set up an appointment time for you to see the property.
