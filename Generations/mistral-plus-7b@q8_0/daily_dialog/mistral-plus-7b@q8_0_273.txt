I'm sorry for not being clearer. Yes, you are correct, we need to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus. It is one of the stops that you would take if you were getting off in Chinatown.

Yes, Canal Street is the correct place to meet. I’ve never been there before, but I think it’s a good spot for our meeting. We’ll be easy to find at that intersection.

Yes, Ann will be there as well. So let's meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue D bus at 10:45 AM.

Hello Ruth. No, you didn't wake me up. I was already awake when your call came in. Yesterday we agreed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the D bus. That's the Canal Street stop that serves the D bus line. We should meet there at 10:45 AM.
