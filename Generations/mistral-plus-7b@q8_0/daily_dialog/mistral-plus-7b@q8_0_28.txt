If the Phoenix beats the Rocket, they would go on to face the winner of the match between the Phoenix and the Rocket. This would put them in a great position to win their conference title and move on to the playoffs. However, if the Phoenix loses to the Rocket, they would most likely miss out on the playoffs altogether. Therefore, it is essential that the team has a strong replacement for 21 so that they can maximize their chances of success in the upcoming season.
