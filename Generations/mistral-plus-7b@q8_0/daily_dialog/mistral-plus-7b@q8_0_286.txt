I am not happy working for the trading company. Although it is a stable and well-paying job, I feel stagnant and unchallenged by my daily work . The environment is not friendly , either .  I need a change , an opportunity to explore something new and exciting . 

Your position at XYZ company is just that : a challenge that will allow me to grow and develop both professionally and personally . Your company has a dynamic and fast-paced work culture , which I am really attracted to . It is the perfect environment for me to learn and grow . Working with you also means working with the best in the industry , and learning from the best . The opportunity to do this is something I could not pass up .
