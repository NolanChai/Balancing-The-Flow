Yes, enrolling in a science course would be beneficial for your graduation. Science courses can provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to understand and apply scientific principles, which can be valuable for many different careers. Biology, chemistry, maps, and physics are all great science classes that cover different aspects of science. A good introductory course for non-science majors would be helpful to give you a basic understanding of each subject. In particular, a maps course could provide the foundation of knowledge needed for success in future science courses.
