There are several open houses this weekend in your area that you may want to see.  If Saturday and Sunday work best for you, there are plenty of opportunities to see what's available.  We should be able to find at least one or two places that meet your needs and expectations.

Yes, meeting at the first open house would be convenient. If you have some time available in the next few days, there are a number of opportunities this weekend to look at houses together. We can start our tour at the first house and then make our way to the others. Just let me know what works best for your schedule, and we will set up a time that is most convenient for you.

Let's schedule a time to go visit the open houses. The first one starts at 10am, and the next one is at noon. Would Saturday morning be best for you? If so, let's meet at 10am at the first house on the list.
