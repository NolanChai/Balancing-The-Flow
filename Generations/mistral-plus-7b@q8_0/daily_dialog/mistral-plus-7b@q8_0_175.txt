We have a good swim team , so hopefully they will perform well at the Olympics. Our gymnasts look good too . I â€™ m sure we can win some medals there . And our volleyball team has been doing well this year , so maybe we have a shot at taking home a medal in that event .

I think our chances are good for winning medals in swimming, cycling, athletics, and ball sports. Mike farmer is an excellent runner and should win a medal. In addition, our sailing team has practiced diligently and could bring home a gold.
