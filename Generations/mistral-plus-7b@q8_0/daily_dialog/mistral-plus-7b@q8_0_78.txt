Yes, my parents were quite disappointed that they couldn't be there for the ceremony. They both wanted to attend and share in the special day. But since my husband is from a different country, we had to have three weddings so that everyone could celebrate with us. It was an important time for our families to come together, even though it meant we didn't get to spend as much quality time with them on our big day.

Yes, our families got to meet each other. My husband's parents came to the party in my country, and my parents were able to come to the wedding in his country. It was a great way for them all to meet and to see where we live now.

Yes, we went on a two-week honeymoon to the Caribbean. It was amazing! We stayed in an all-inclusive resort and spent our time relaxing by the beach and exploring the area.

My wedding ceremony was not very traditional. We decided to have a small, intimate gathering with just close friends and family. Instead of a big white dress, I wore jeans and a simple blouse. Our venue was an outdoor space in the woods, and our ceremony was short and sweet. We wrote our own vows and said them to each other in front of everyone. It was very meaningful and personal.
