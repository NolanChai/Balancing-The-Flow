Doctor: Your throat is very red and swollen. It seems like you have a bad cold. Let's try some medicine for the pain and congestion. Take this antibiotic to help with the infection in your nose and throat, along with some decongestants to clear up your congestion. Take this antihistamine to help reduce inflammation and allergies. And get plenty of fluids to stay hydrated. I recommend you take at least eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day while you have a cold.

Doctor, I have been experiencing a terrible headache, sore throat, runny nose, and fever for the past few days. Could this be influenza?
Yes, your symptoms are consistent with influenza. Influenza is an infectious disease caused by a virus that affects the respiratory system. It is highly contagious, usually starting with a fever, sore throat, and coughing, followed by muscle pains, headaches, and chills. If you suspect you have the flu, it’s important to see your doctor for diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible.

The doctor replied, “You need to take some medicine and get plenty of rest. Influenza is a viral infection that can make you feel very ill and it’s important to follow the doctor’s instructions for treatment. Most people with influenza will recover within 1-2 weeks but if your symptoms persist or worsen, you should seek medical attention.”
