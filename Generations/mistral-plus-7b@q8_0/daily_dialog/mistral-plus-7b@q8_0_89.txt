I have studied Japanese for a few years now, and I recently took the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) to gauge my progress. I was pleased to receive a score of N2 on the test, which means that I can understand and use basic Japanese sentences in everyday situations. The JLPT is an international standardized exam that measures a person's ability to read, write and speak Japanese at a certain level. The levels are: N5 (beginner), N4, N3, N2 and N1 (advanced). It takes years of study and dedication to reach these higher levels, but it is certainly worth the effort!
