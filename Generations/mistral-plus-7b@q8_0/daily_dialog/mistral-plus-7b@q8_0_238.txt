Yes, there are many products on the market that can help control frizzy curls. One option is a lightweight serum or oil that will smooth and tame frizzy hair. Another option is a leave-in conditioner that contains anti-frizz ingredients.

I use a lightweight serum to add shine and control frizz. I would also suggest using a curl cream or gel to define your curls and lock them in place. The right products can make all the difference when dealing with naturally curly hair.
