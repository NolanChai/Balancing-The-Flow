I understand how frustrating this can be. The best option in a situation like this would be to call a tow truck, but if you don't have one on hand, it might also be worth calling a cab service. It sounds like your best bet at this point is to call for assistance so that you can get to where you need to go as quickly as possible without any further delay.
