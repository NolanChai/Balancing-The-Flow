I disagree.  I think D.H. Lawrence is an incredibly talented writer who is capable of producing some truly amazing prose, but Charles Dickens is still unmatched in terms of the scope and depth of his work.  His characters are so vibrant and well-developed that it's almost impossible to not become invested in their stories.
