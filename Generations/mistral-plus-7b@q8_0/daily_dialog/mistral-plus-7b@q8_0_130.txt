Sandra is feeling frustrated with the political maneuvering and petty rivalries that she has seen among her coworkers. She feels like the constant competition for status, resources, and attention is taking a toll on her mental health and causing her to lose focus and passion for her job. She wants to find a way out of this toxic work environment before it does any further damage to her well-being.

Yes, he talks trash about me behind my back. He tries to make sure no one praises me or gives me credit for anything. He even has other employees reporting back to him things I've said and then twists what I've said so it doesn't reflect well on me. It makes me feel like he's trying to undermine my credibility and make me look bad.

Sandra , I know how frustrating it can be to work with someone who is trying to sabotage your career. Tim's behavior isn't professional or acceptable. If you feel like you are constantly being undermined and talked about behind your back, you might want to consider speaking to HR or even finding a new job. You deserve better than this kind of treatment.
