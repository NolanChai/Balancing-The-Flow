Yes, looking online for apartments and sublets is a great idea. There are lots of websites like Craigslist, Zillow, Trulia, and ApartmentList that can help you find available listings. It's always worth checking out several different sites to make sure you're getting the best options for your needs.

A place that would cost around 1,000 yuan in China would be quite small, but it's doable. There are likely many sublets available on websites like 58.com and Ziroom. Sublet apartments tend to be more affordable than traditional rentals, so they might be a good option for you. You could also consider roommate shares, which can further reduce costs. Just keep in mind that the quality of these sublets and shared rooms may not be as high as that of traditional rentals.

Finding an affordable apartment that meets your needs and location requirements can be challenging. I would suggest checking popular rental websites such as Zillow, Trulia, and Apartments.com. You may also want to consider reaching out to real estate agents or property managers who specialize in your area of interest. Another helpful resource is asking friends or colleagues if they know of any available apartments that meet your criteria.

A room that meets your needs can usually be found for around 1,000 yuan per month. It may take some effort to find such an affordable place, but it is possible. The subway or a convenient bus route are both important. The bedroom should have full bathrooms, and sunlight is preferred.

University bulletin boards are often a great place to find sublets and roommates. Many times, students are looking for someone to take over their lease for the remainder of the semester or year. These postings can be very useful in finding an affordable place with minimal effort. In addition, university bulletin boards allow you to connect with other people who live nearby and share similar interests as well.

Look for an apartment in the suburbs that is on a convenient bus route or near the subway. You may need to find a roommate if possible, as this will help reduce your rent. The important things you should have in the place include a bedroom with a full bath, sunny side bedroom, and maybe some storage space for your belongings.
