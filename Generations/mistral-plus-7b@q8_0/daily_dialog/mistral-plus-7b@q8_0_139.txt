I bought a new dress, some shoes and a nice bag.

I bought my coat at a small boutique. They had a great selection of coats, including this one. The color and style is really cute and it's perfect for fall weather.

Yes, the coat is quite expensive. But I think it was worth the price because it looks so beautiful. The material feels soft and comfortable to wear. It cost around $200.

Yes, the coat is very reasonably priced. It was a great find. I love how lightweight and stylish it is.
