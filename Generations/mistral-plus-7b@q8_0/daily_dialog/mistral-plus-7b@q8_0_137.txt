Yes, I admit Ally McNeal is kind of girly.  But it’s still a pretty entertaining show.  On the other hand, Dark Angel isn’t all about the girl.  It also has some cool sci-fi elements that are pretty enjoyable.  So, you should probably just give both shows a chance.

Ally McBeal is a fun, quirky show that has become quite popular with female viewers. The characters are unique and the plots often involve some humor and heart-warming moments. Dark Angel is a gritty, action-packed drama starring Jessica Alba as Max, a genetically-engineered super soldier. Both shows offer something different for audiences to enjoy but Ally McBeal has more of a comedic tone while Dark Angel has a lot more intense and dramatic scenes.
