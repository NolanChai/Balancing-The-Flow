I am doing great, thank you for asking. Yes, I am still with Jenn. We have been together since graduation and it has been a wonderful journey so far. I know we will continue to grow together in the years to come.

Bob said, “I know what you mean. It’s been great reconnecting with everyone tonight, but it just goes to show how quickly life can change. One moment we are all fresh-faced graduates and the next thing you know it’s a decade later. It’s funny how time flies.”

“Yes, time really does go by so fast,” I replied. “It seems like yesterday that we were in school together. It makes me wonder where those years went. And now here we are, all grown up and trying to make our way in the world.”
