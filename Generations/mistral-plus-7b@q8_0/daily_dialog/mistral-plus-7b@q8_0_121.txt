I write mostly about travel , food and personal development . Travel posts are about my experiences in different cities or countries while food posts focus on restaurants that I visit as well as recipes . Personal development posts contain tips for improving one's life and mindset .

I usually write a blog at least once per week, though sometimes it can be twice or even three times in a week. The most important thing is to maintain a consistent schedule of posting, so that readers can expect to see new content on a regular basis.

Yes, I am still updating my blog. I try to write at least one post per week.
