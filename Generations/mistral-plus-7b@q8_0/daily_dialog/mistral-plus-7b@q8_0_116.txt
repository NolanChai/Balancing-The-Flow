Don't worry. You are going in the wrong direction. If you take a taxi, you can reach Beijing Hotel in about 15 minutes. Otherwise, take a bus from this stop and get off at the next one. Then walk across the street and go through the overpass to the bus stop on the other side of the road. There you will be able to catch another bus that goes directly to the hotel.
