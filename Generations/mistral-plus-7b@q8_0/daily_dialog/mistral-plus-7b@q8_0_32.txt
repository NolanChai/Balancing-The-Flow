Yes, the cafeteria is pretty huge. It offers a lot of choices, which makes it easy to find something that you like. The food tastes great too – I usually have my lunch here because of that. They make some tasty steaks! Today, I think I’ll have one with a side salad and some potatoes. For dessert, I want banana pie. It’s so sweet and creamy – perfect for satisfying that craving for something sugary after lunch.
