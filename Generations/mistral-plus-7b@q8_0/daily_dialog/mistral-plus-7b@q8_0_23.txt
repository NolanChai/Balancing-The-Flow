Cafe au lait is simply coffee with milk. It can be made in either hot or iced form. Cafe latte has more milk than cafe au lait, and also uses foamy milk. Cappuccino has the most milk of all, with a thick layer of foam on top. Cafe mocha is similar to cappuccino except that it has chocolate in it as well.
