The Dragon Boat Festival originates from a story about Qu Yuan, a great poet during the Warring States Period in China. Legend has it that Qu Yuan was deeply saddened by his country's fall and the people he loved leaving him. On the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, Qu Yuan threw himself into a river to end his life. The local townspeople frantically jumped into their boats and paddled furiously to find and rescue Qu Yuan. They rowed out into the middle of the river to throw sticks of rice into the water as an offering to ward off fish so that they would not eat Qu Yuan's body. This became a tradition for the Dragon Boat Festival, where teams compete in boat races while racing their oars in unison.
