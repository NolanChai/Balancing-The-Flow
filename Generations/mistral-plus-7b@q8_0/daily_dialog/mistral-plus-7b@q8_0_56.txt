The material is too difficult for me to understand, so I am struggling in the class. It feels like I am constantly playing catch-up and having trouble following along with what is being taught. If there was a way to simplify the course materials or provide more examples of how this abstract concept can be applied in the real world, it might help me better understand the concepts we are learning.
