There are several reasons why staying on your current lease would be difficult. For one thing, you’d have to pay rent for the remainder of the term, even if you move out early. Additionally, breaking a lease can result in penalties and fees. Another reason not to stay on your current lease is that it could limit your flexibility and options when searching for a new place. Ultimately, if moving out is necessary, it’s usually best to break the lease with as little notice as possible and be prepared to pay any associated costs.

I’m sorry, but you need to give proper notice to break your lease. If you move out before the end of your lease term, you will be breaking your contract and we will need to keep the security deposit for any damages or cleaning fees. You will only receive the portion of the deposit that is left over after these expenses have been deducted.

No, unfortunately I cannot return your deposit because you are breaking your lease. When you signed the lease you agreed to live in this apartment for a specific amount of time. By moving out early, you violated that agreement and we are entitled to keep the deposit as compensation for the remaining months on your lease.

I understand that you want to move out, but the fact of the matter is that your lease isn't up yet. As a result, I won't be returning your deposit to you. Leaving before your lease is over means that you're breaking your agreement with us and there will be consequences for that. You may have an option to find someone to take over your lease or we could use the deposit to pay any remaining fees and damage costs. Either way, it is important that you understand that you are in violation of our lease terms and will not be getting a refund of the deposit.
