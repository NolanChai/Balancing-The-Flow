Yes, our love story is very romantic. Tom and I met in college when he was studying engineering and I was studying nursing. He would always tell me about the latest engineering challenges he was working on, and I found it fascinating. We fell in love and got married shortly after graduation. The first few years of marriage were tough as we both had demanding careers, but we leaned on each other and supported one another through it all. Even today, our love continues to grow stronger with every passing day.
