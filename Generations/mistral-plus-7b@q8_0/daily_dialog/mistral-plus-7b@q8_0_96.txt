Yes, driving in Shanghai can be challenging. If you are used to the fast-paced streets of New York City, then I think it could be doable for you. However, there are a lot of traffic and pedestrians on the roads, so you need to stay alert and pay attention to the road rules at all times. It would definitely be wise to rent a car with a GPS system, as some of the streets can be tricky to navigate. In conclusion, driving in Shanghai can be challenging but is certainly possible for those who are used to city driving.
