Last week, the Mountaineering Club went on a camping trip in the mountains. We hiked for miles through the woods and then climbed up a tall mountain. The views at the top were spectacular! It was a great way to spend the weekend with friends.

The Mountaineering Club is going to climb a cliff on the Colorado River this weekend. The climb is difficult because there are not many places to put your hands and feet, so it requires a lot of strength and skill. Last week, they rappelled down the side of a 300 - foot cliff which was very exciting. Yes, climbing a cliff can be a lot of fun and challenging at the same time!

You should definitely join us!
