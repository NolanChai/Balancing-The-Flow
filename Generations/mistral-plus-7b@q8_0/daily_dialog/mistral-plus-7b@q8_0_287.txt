The acting of this film is marvelous in spite of the thin plot. It really shows the talent and dedication of the actors. They did an excellent job portraying their characters despite the lack of depth in the storyline. I'm sorry for hero. No one likes to see their favorite actor perform poorly, but it happens sometimes. Even great actors have moments where they fall short. Don't be too critical. We can't expect every movie to be perfect. The best we can do is appreciate what was done well and look forward to the next one.
