ame displays against Middlesbrough and Norwich City.

The Potters boss bemoaned a “lack of confidence” after the 0-0 draw at The Britannia Stadium yesterday but it is a lack of cutting edge that has been Stoke’s biggest problem in recent weeks. Hughes had to wait until this game for another start from new signing Peter Crouch but he couldn’t help them break down Middlesbrough.

Their previous two games, at home to West Bromwich Albion and away to Tottenham Hotspur, yielded only one goal – the winner scored by Marko Arnautovic in the latter game. In between they managed only three shots on target against Norwich, who had more players than Stoke on the pitch for a large part of their game last week.

Asked if his side lacked confidence Hughes said: “I think so. The team are not playing with the belief that we had earlier in the season when things were going well and I have to try and get them back to that. We are struggling for goals at the minute.”

Stoke’s home game against Norwich City is their last game before Christmas, which has led Hughes to suggest his side might be suffering from fatigue. He said: “I think it shows the pressure and demands we have had on the squad during this period of fixtures. It was tough for us in the first half but I am pleased with the way they stuck at it.”

Hughes admitted he is frustrated by Stoke’s lack of goals, saying: “We are not creating enough chances to hurt teams and we have been lacking the cutting edge. That is something we need to improve on as soon as possible because it will be very costly if we do not do that.”
