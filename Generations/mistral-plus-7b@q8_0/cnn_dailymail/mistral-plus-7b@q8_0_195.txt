Marjorie De Sousa took to Instagram on Tuesday with a message to her fans as well as those who were concerned about reports of her suicide attempt.

"Thank you for all the messages of affection, I really appreciate it," she said in a video posted to her Instagram Stories. "The truth is that I collapsed from low blood pressure, which caused me to lose consciousness and fall.

"My body couldn't handle the situation at that time, so they took me to the hospital for treatment."

She went on to assure fans she was fine and thanked them for their support, adding that she has been "very blessed with life".

The actress also shared a photo of herself in hospital with her dog, writing: "We all have our ups and downs. But it is important to have faith, to be surrounded by love, and always remember that tomorrow is another day."
