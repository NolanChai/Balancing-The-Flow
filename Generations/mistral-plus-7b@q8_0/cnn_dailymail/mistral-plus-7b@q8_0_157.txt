Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Cameron said: "The SNP have an agenda – to divide our United Kingdom, weaken our economy and threaten the very existence of NATO itself." He added that if the party continues its rise then Scotland would end up outside Europe, Nato and the rest of the UK.

"The SNP don't want the country to succeed," he said. "They want it to fail – so they can take us out of the UK. It's a dangerous power that we must stop in its tracks."

Mr Cameron also attacked Labour leader Ed Miliband, accusing him of putting 'self-interest and political point-scoring above national security'. He added: "Our country is strong enough to win this election – but only if you vote Conservative. In these last few days, it's the one simple message that we must shout from every rooftop."
