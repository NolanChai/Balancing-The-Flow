The Saints boss feels that the young players within his squad have developed sufficiently enough for him to call on their maturity and leadership qualities, and he believes that a victory at Arsenal would provide an important message to those watching from afar. He said: "I can see some leadership in the team, but it is not easy because we have so many young players and they still need some experience."
