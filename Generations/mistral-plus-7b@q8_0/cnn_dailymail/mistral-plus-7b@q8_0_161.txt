6 months old when their parents found out that their daughter had end-stage liver disease and needed a transplant.

During the 10-hour surgery, doctors removed a portion of her father’s healthy liver to give to Binh. Her sister’s transplant was successful, but she has suffered from kidney failure since then. Now, at age 4, she underwent a successful kidney transplant in Montreal, the CBC reports.

“We are thrilled for this family,” said Dr. Martin Jugnauth, the director of the Pediatric Liver Transplant Program at the Children’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, which is where Binh received her liver transplant. “These kids are so amazing and I am very proud of their parents as well.”

The twins’ parents, Binh Nguyen and his wife Lien Vo, are Vietnamese immigrants who moved to Canada in 2014. Their family now lives in Thunder Bay, Ontario.
