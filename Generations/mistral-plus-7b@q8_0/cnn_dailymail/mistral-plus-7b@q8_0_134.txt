ing it one of the quickest total lunar eclipses in living memory.

The total eclipse occurred for a few minutes before dawn on Saturday in Australia and New Zealand, at around 6am Sydney time (4pm GMT). It was visible from much of Europe, Africa, Asia and parts of South America. The partial eclipse lasted about two hours.

The moon appeared to turn blood red due to the refracted sunlight. Some people also called it a "blood moon" or a "super moon". NASA said that total lunar eclipses occur at least twice a year - and they last for between 15 minutes and more than an hour, depending on their duration and location.
