[Original story published at 10:48 p.m. ET]Protesters against President Donald Trump took to the streets of Denver Wednesday night following his inauguration earlier in the day.

The protests started peacefully, but as they grew throughout the night some demonstrators began to break away from the main group. Some windows were smashed, police said.  Authorities are reporting 10 arrests so far.

"It has been a peaceful and orderly demonstration for the most part," Denver Police spokesman Sonny Jackson told CNN. "But as we near midnight, there have been some people that have broken away from the group to try to break windows of businesses."

A few other cities in the West saw protests Wednesday evening, including Seattle, Portland and Olympia, Washington.
