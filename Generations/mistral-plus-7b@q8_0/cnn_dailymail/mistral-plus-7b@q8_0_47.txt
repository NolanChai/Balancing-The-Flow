over whether he is a regular starter for the Blues in the Premier League this season.

Italian champions Juventus are believed to have already made their move for Oscar, with reports claiming that the Serie A giants have sent scouts to watch him play recently. The club will need to sell first, though, as they are keen on strengthening their attack this month. They have also been linked with an audacious bid for Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema and Juventus’ move for Oscar could be made possible if a deal for Benzema goes through.

Premier League champions Liverpool are also reportedly considering a move for the Brazilian, who joined Chelsea from Internacional in 2012. Brendan Rodgers has made no secret of his desire to strengthen his attacking options and it seems as though Oscar could be one of those players that attracts the Reds boss’ attention. The 23-year-old is currently valued at around £25m, but Liverpool have the funds available should they decide to make a move for him in January.
