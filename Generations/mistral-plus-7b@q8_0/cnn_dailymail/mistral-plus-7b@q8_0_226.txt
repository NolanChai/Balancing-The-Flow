mind about the Supreme Court's upcoming case of same-sex marriage.

The court is set to hear the case in March 2015, and it will likely decide whether states have the constitutional right to ban gay and lesbian couples from getting married. In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Ginsburg stated that she is firmly behind legalizing same sex marriage. “I do think that DOMA is an un-American, nasty bit of work,” Ginsburg said in a 2013 interview, referring to the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). That act, signed into law by then President Bill Clinton, defines marriage as solely between one man and one woman. The Supreme Court struck down DOMA last June.
