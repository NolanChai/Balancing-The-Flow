he asked Siri "Who is the best gay?" and Siri responded by saying, "I wouldn't know. I only date straight people."

The same question posed in English yielded an answer that did not mention sexual orientation. Siri replied, "I can tell you some famous gay people. Neil Patrick Harris and Ellen DeGeneres are both well known for their activism and work as entertainers," and when the man asked if he was gay himself, Siri answered, "Yes, I think Neil Patrick Harris identifies as a gay man."

Apple told BBC News that the Russian translation of Siri's answer is "incorrect," adding that it has asked the translation service to fix it. The company said that Apple does not condone discrimination in any form and that Siri tries to be inclusive and respectful.
