few days ago after suffering an injury during Barcelona's 4-0 win at Rayo Vallecano on February 13th. Messi only returned to training yesterday, but Barça coach Luis Enrique believes the superstar is ready for action again this weekend.

"Messi has fully recovered from his injury and we expect him to be fit for Sunday's game," Enrique told a news conference ahead of Barça's match with Celta Vigo. "It seems that he was very motivated at training yesterday and I would not risk using him on Wednesday in the Copa del Rey quarter-final if he wasn't fully recovered."

Enrique also revealed that midfielder Ivan Rakitic will miss Sunday's game due to a knee injury, while defender Dani Alves remains sidelined with an Achilles tendon problem.
