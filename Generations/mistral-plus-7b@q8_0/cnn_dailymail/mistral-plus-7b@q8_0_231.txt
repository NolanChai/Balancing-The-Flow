Electronic cigarettes — battery-operated inhalers that deliver doses of nicotine without tar or other carcinogens — have become popular among adults who smoke and want to quit. But the devices are increasingly attracting teenagers, raising concern about possible health effects on younger users.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in January that 10 percent of high-school students used e-cigarettes in 2013, up from just 1.5 percent in 2011.

To learn more about how e-cigarette use takes root among adolescents, researchers surveyed about 500 students at two public middle schools in New York City and the surrounding suburbs. Students were asked whether they’d ever tried e-cigarettes or traditional cigarettes — including cigarette-like e-cigarettes and tank-style devices that can deliver bigger doses of nicotine than their slimmer counterparts.

Overall, about 16 percent of the students reported having used an e-cigarette at least once during the previous year. Fewer than 5 percent had tried one in the past month and just over 1 percent had vaped on a daily basis. In contrast, more than half of teens had ever smoked a traditional cigarette, including more than 20 percent who said they’d smoked in the past month. Only about 2 percent were daily cigarette users.

Although e-cigarettes have been shown to be effective at helping adults quit smoking, it remains unclear whether the devices are a gateway for young people to try tobacco or if they divert teens from smoking traditional cigarettes. This study suggests that e-cigarettes aren’t likely to serve as an entry point for many teens.

The survey results were published on Feb. 25 in Pediatrics.
