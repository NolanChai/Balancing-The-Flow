underland’s visit to Emirates Stadium on Wednesday and wants him to forget about the World Cup disappointment.

Walcott started all three of England’s group games at the tournament in Brazil but was substituted after 54 minutes of their 0-0 draw with Costa Rica. Roy Hodgson has since told the winger he will not be part of his squad for the World Cup qualifiers against Estonia and Lithuania next month, a decision which Wenger believes will impact on him when he returns to club duties.

The 24-year-old did not feature in Arsenal’s first pre-season friendly against Barnet but is expected to play some part against the Black Cats as he looks to rediscover his form. “He needs a bit of time to recover from what happened, and I have no doubt that his confidence has been affected,” said Wenger.

“But at the same time, I have total faith in him because we know he is a top-class player, and the most important thing for me is to make sure that he feels like it. We will have discussions about that when we come back.”

Arsenal have been handed their first pre-season injury blow after Lukas Podolski suffered an ankle problem. The forward played in both of Arsenal’s friendlies over the weekend and was due to travel with his team-mates for Wednesday night’s match. However, he was forced to pull out because of a recurrence of his ankle injury which kept him out of action from early December until the end of February.

“Lukas Podolski has not travelled,” said Wenger. “He had an ankle problem and we have been careful with him as he suffered a similar injury in January, so that’s why he has not travelled.”
