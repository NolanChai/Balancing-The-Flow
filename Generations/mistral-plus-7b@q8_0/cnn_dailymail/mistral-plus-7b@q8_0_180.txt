He captioned the video: "My first thought was that this is a really stupid idea but my second thought was... it doesn't look so bad." In the clip, Brian Limond, who goes by the name Limmy, lies on his back, his head tilted to one side as he talks to his followers.

As his mouth opens, a small spider crawls out onto his face. He can be heard saying: "I'm sorry, I know this is gross but... look at that, it actually did come out of my mouth!" He then moves the creepy-crawly back into his mouth and repeats the action.

The video has been viewed more than 160,000 times on Instagram and more than 350,000 times on Twitter. Unsurprisingly, many people were less than impressed with Limmy's prank. One user commented: "Oh dear God... I am genuinely sick." Another said: "My eyes have never been so wide with terror."
