those other renewables.

Tina Santoro, an assistant professor at Rutgers University School of Engineering in New Jersey, proposes using electricity produced by ocean waves and converting it into hydrogen. The process is known as “electrolysis.” The result of this is a type of fuel that has the potential to power vehicles, among other things.

Santoro’s research team have successfully tested out their concept with an electrolyzer prototype. The device uses an energy conversion efficiency rate of 65 percent.

“In my view, hydrogen fuel cells and batteries are not in competition; they can complement each other,” Santoro said in a statement. “Batteries have higher energy density and thus lower weight for the amount of stored energy, while fuel cells have high power densities compared to batteries.”

In order for Santoro’s vision to become a reality, a number of barriers will need to be overcome. One such challenge is finding a way to store large quantities of hydrogen. Another issue involves the electrolyzer, which still requires further development before it can become commercially viable.
