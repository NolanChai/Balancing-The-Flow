England in November 2013, after which he was diagnosed with stress-related illness and took an extended break from the game.

Trott's comeback came in place of Moeen Ali, who was dropped for this Test despite taking a five-for in the first innings at The Oval to help England secure an unlikely win against Pakistan. Trott went out lbw in his first innings back in the side to Pakistan's Mohammad Amir for three runs, leaving him with only 12 runs and one innings so far on this tour. He had not played any County Cricket in the meantime.

Speaking ahead of the third Test against New Zealand at Edgbaston, Trott said: "I think I'm ready to go now. It's been quite a long road back but it feels good. Hopefully I can keep going forwards from here on in." He added that he is feeling fit and confident, despite having lost form in recent years.

Trott has struggled with batting for some time, with the stress-related illness which kept him out of the game compounding his lack of runs. It was also revealed before the start of the season that Trott had been struggling with a back problem since last summer, but he believes it is behind him now and said he feels much better than he did a few months ago.

England's captain, Alastair Cook, expressed his support for Trott by saying: "He knows what to expect as a Test cricketer. He played in the first two Tests this summer so he knows the pressure that goes with playing in an England side. I just think we all have confidence in him. We've seen him at his best.

"We know what a good player he is and hopefully he can show us those performances again."
