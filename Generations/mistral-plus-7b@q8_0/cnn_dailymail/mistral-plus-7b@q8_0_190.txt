The 49-year-old, known as Nick, was in his van on his way to the cash and carry when he spotted a robbery.

He tried to confront the thieves, who had snatched an elderly woman’s handbag, but they escaped in their getaway car, crashing into him and his van.

Nick was taken by air ambulance to hospital where he later died of his injuries. The two teenagers responsible for Nick’s death were jailed this week.
