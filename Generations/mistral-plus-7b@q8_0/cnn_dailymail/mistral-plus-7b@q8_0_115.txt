nder Boss Jurgen Klopp wants to offload the player this summer.

The Reds have been linked with a number of attacking players in recent months but are expected to complete their first signing before the World Cup in Brazil by wrapping up a deal for 20-year-old Belgian forward Divock Origi. The Liverpool boss is still on the lookout for another striker and has now turned his attentions to Immobile who has had just one goal in 18 appearances this season.

The player himself is keen to leave Dortmund having failed to establish himself as a first choice. He scored nine goals in Serie A with Torino last year and would be a good addition for Brendan Rodgersâ€™ side who have struggled at times in front of goal this campaign.
