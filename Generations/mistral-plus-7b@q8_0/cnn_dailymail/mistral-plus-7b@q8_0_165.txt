The victory improved the American's record to an impressive 11-0 this year, extending her winning streak to 29 matches dating back to last season.

Williams won her seventh straight Fed Cup singles match, but had to fight for the first set against Giorgi. She eventually outlasted the Italian in a tiebreaker when Giorgi netted a forehand on Williams' third set point.

Giorgi never found her groove and was broken four times by Williams, who improved to 3-1 lifetime against the Italian.

Williams will play Sara Errani in Sunday's reverse singles matchup. If that result goes as expected, doubles is likely a formality on the final day of competition.
