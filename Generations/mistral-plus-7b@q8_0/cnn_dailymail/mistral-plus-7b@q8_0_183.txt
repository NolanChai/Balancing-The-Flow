uting new employees to work on next-generation power management solutions for future mobile devices.

Apple posted two job openings seeking candidates who can help improve battery life and performance for both iOS hardware and software, in addition to researching other possible energy saving techniques. The company is currently hiring a Power Management Design Engineer as well as a Hardware Power Manager:

Power Management Design Engineer - Apple’s power management team is looking for a talented design engineer who is passionate about developing high-quality and low-power solutions across our wide range of mobile devices. We are looking for an expert in power management architecture, including battery and charging system integration, circuit design and thermal/mechanical analysis. The ideal candidate has experience working in an ASIC or SoC team at a fabless semiconductor company or IC design consulting firm. In this position, you will have the opportunity to contribute to Apple’s world-class mobile power management solutions, from chip architecture to silicon implementation.

Hardware Power Manager - The Hardware Power Management Team is responsible for delivering innovative battery life extension and performance optimization solutions across all Apple devices.

Apple has struggled with poor battery life on some of its mobile devices in recent years. The iPhone 5 was criticized for its disappointing performance compared to predecessor models, while the iPad mini saw significant drops in battery life when running iOS 6. The company is rumored to be working on new iPhone and iPad prototypes that include a next-generation processor as well as more efficient power management technologies.
