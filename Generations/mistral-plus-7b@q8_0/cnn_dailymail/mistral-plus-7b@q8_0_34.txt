Unit and is a member of the NYPD’s Emergency Services Unit, found 93-year-old Albert Hugel and 75-year-old Gertrude Hugel deceased at their house at 194th Street in Bayside. In addition to them, he also discovered two other guests dead: 80-year-old John Rafferty, of Queens Village, and 75-year-old Mary Jane Reilly, from Middle Village, police sources told The Post on Saturday. The NYPD’s Major Case Squad is currently investigating the quadruple deaths, which are being treated as suspicious. Police sources said that Hugel found his parents lying dead in their bedrooms and called 911 around 6:30 p.m. Friday. At first, police believed the victims were poisoned and thought there was a possible carbon monoxide leak due to gas detectors sounding off in the house, but investigators later ruled out poison or carbon monoxide as possible causes of death. “We are still trying to figure out how this happened,” a law enforcement source said. An autopsy will be performed on Saturday to determine the cause of death. The Hugels had been married for more than 50 years, according to their son. They were “great people,” he said. Albert was an Army veteran and a member of the American Legion who loved riding his Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Gertrude liked bowling, playing cards, gardening and dancing with her husband.
