Titled ‘Online Body Shaming’, the clip features Ho reading some of the most damaging remarks she has ever received on the video sharing platform. From body-shaming insults about her weight, skin and appearance, to comments from viewers who have accused Ho of encouraging eating disorders by promoting a ‘skinny’ lifestyle, this YouTube star is not afraid to take a stand against the kind of bullying that so many people suffer at the hands of others on social media.
