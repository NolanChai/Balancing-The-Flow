umbs and fingers as if holding a wheel, but he was just trying to steady himself after the blast.
"I felt this big force," Woolfenden said Tuesday in an interview with CNN. "And it threw me and my wife and daughter right onto the ground."
Woolfenden said the explosion, which occurred on Boylston Street near the finish line of Monday's Boston Marathon, happened so quickly that he didn't really know what to think at first. He saw people running toward him and then away from him, and blood was everywhere.
"I tried to get up," he said. "But I couldn't walk."
He laid on his back for about 10 minutes, waiting for the ambulance that came for him and his family. At first, paramedics thought he might have a broken femur, but later at Massachusetts General Hospital they determined that wasn't the case. He did break ribs, however, as well as two vertebrae in his back. His wife and daughter were treated and released with minor injuries.
"I feel blessed," Woolfenden said. "I'm extremely thankful to be here."
