Prosecutors announced Thursday that they would not oppose Anthony Ray Hinton's request for a new trial, clearing the way for his immediate release. In a statement, state Attorney General Luther Strange said the decision was made because evidence in the case "has been called into serious question."

Hinton has always maintained he is innocent of killing two men at a Birmingham fast-food restaurant in 1985. He was sentenced to death despite the lack of forensic evidence linking him to the crimes.

"There are too many flaws for us to proceed," Strange said. "We have determined that justice will be best served if Mr. Hinton is released from prison now."
