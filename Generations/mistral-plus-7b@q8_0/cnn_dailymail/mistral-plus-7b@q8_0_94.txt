ensions rose on January 28 between Muslim villagers and members of the nearby Coptic Church of Mar Mina in Kafr Hakim after a dispute over a house purchase, according to Human Rights Watch. Villagers reportedly set fire to the church and attacked it with rocks during clashes that lasted for two days. The trial began last year, with 71 defendants standing trial for their alleged role in attacking the church. The majority of those convicted were sentenced to life in prison, state news reported. Sixteen people received five-year sentences. Eight others were given four-year sentences. The attack took place just months after security forces violently dispersed two pro-Mohammed Morsy sit-ins. In the wake of that violence, hundreds of Coptic churches were attacked across Egypt.
