Polo Club (RCP) in Ascot, Berks, had been ordered by the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to stop using its ‘royal’ branding on clothing, shoes and accessories after Gucci America Inc challenged the trademark application.

The IPO initially allowed RCP to continue to use its ‘royal’ branding in connection with its polo club but decided it could not be used on any other goods or services. RCP took the case to the High Court, claiming the decision was wrong. It argued that the Royal County o Polo Club has a strong link to the royal family through the patronage of Prince Charles since 1978 and has been associated with the royal family since its establishment in 1944.
