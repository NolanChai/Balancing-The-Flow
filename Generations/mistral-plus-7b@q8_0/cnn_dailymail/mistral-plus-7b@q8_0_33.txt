The Arizona Daily Star reports that Eli and Silas fell into the canal near East 14th Street on Thursday at around 2:30 p.m. While one boy was rescued by a man who lived nearby, the other reportedly went under the water and never resurfaced. It took firefighters about an hour to pull the second boy out of the water, but he was later pronounced dead.

According to ABC News, the two brothers were visiting family in Yuma over the holidays when they got into the canal. Their father reportedly said he stepped away from them for less than a minute when Eli and Silas fell into the water.
