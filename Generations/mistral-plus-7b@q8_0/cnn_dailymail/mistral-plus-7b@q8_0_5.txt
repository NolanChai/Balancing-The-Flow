Speaking to BET, Iyanna admitted that having Floyd as a dad is difficult because he is so focused on his training and fitness regime. "My dad is super strict," she said. "He never really lets us get away with anything."

"If he catches us doing something wrong, we are in serious trouble," she added. "I'll admit it is kind of annoying sometimes because we can't do anything without him getting on us. I guess that's what being a parent is all about!"

Iyanna also admitted that her father's gruelling workout regime has rubbed off on the family and they now try to be more conscious of their health as well. "He makes us go with him to the gym, but we do it willingly because he puts us through workouts too," she said. "My mom and sisters really love working out so it's not a problem for them."

Iyanna was also asked what she thinks of Floyd's upcoming bout against Manny Pacquiao, and although she admitted that her father is the better fighter, she still expects the fight to be a close one. "Manny has really good speed and I think he will give my dad some trouble," she said.

"But my dad is just on a different level. He knows every move he needs to make in order to win this fight."
