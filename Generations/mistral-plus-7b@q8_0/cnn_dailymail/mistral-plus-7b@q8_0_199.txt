154-foot (47 meter) tall Mount Sharp.

The picture, released today by Nasa, was taken when Curiosity was climbing its way up the mountain’s slope. In it you can see the rover’s shadow against a dusty Martian landscape, with a rock in the background that’s called Rocknest. You can also see Curiosity’s mast-mounted cameras.

The orbiter captured the image on December 11th using its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera system. HiRISE was first installed on the spacecraft in July of this year, and has taken photos of the Martian surface with a resolution of up to eight inches per pixel.

Curiosity is currently climbing Mount Sharp to learn more about the planet’s geological history. The rover first landed on Mars back in August 2012, and has been sending back stunning images from the red planet ever since.
