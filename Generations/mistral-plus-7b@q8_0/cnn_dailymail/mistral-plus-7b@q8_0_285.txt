## Insect beauty products are gaining popularity

Entomology – the study of insects – is taking the beauty world by storm with some leading brands using insects to create all-natural, organic and sustainable cosmetics. Beauty products from lipsticks to serums and even shampoos are being made using ingredients such as beeswax, silk worm and cricket powders, honey and even mosquito repellent.

While some might find the idea of using insects in their beauty regime a bit off-putting, it can also prove to be very beneficial. For instance, insects are high in protein which can help boost hair growth while cricket powder contains omega 3 fatty acids which promote soft and smooth skin. Honey is known for its antibacterial qualities which makes it an excellent choice for skin care products, especially those designed for acne-prone skin, as well as hair care products such as shampoos and conditioners.
