lets in fear after she was assaulted by Lennon at a Manchester club.

She said that she had been dancing with Lennon on Saturday and later got into an argument about her friend taking a photograph of him. Lennon then allegedly slapped her, grabbed her by the neck and tore off her top, the Sun reported. The waitress, who wants to remain anonymous, told the Sun: "I felt like I was in fear for my life - I didn't know if he was going to push me over." She said she feared that Lennon would have taken advantage of her had there not been so many people around her at the time.

"He kept trying to pull me into his lap and kiss me when we were dancing. He tried to get me alone in a corner, but I felt like he was coming on too strong. Then someone asked me for a photo with him which upset him," she told the newspaper. Lennon had been at the club celebrating his 26th birthday.

However, the 25-year-old Everton player has denied the allegations made against him and called them "completely untrue". A spokesperson for the midfielder said: "Aaron was out last night celebrating his birthday with his friends. He denies any of these allegations." The spokesperson added that Lennon will be making a formal complaint to Greater Manchester Police, which confirmed it is investigating the matter.
