The desperate parents of a boy whose head hangs at a 180-degree angle have admitted they would rather he died than continue to suffer.

Mahendra Ahirwar, 12, from Madhya Pradesh in central India, suffers from arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC) – a rare condition that causes his muscles and joints to stiffen when he is born.

It means his head remains permanently twisted backwards and his spine has become severely bent. As a result he struggles to do everyday tasks like walking, eating or sitting up straight.

His parents are so worried for his future that they admitted they would prefer if he died – because he will be out of pain.

His mother Sarla said: “We want our son’s soul to depart from this world as we don’t want him to suffer. He is not living but merely surviving.”
