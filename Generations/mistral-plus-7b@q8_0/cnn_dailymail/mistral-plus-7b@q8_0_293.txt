their valuables in a matter of seconds.

The group often targets tourists and businessmen walking along Bond Street, Oxford Street or Regent Street with high-value items including designer watches, iPads and jewellery. The thieves will often use distraction techniques such as bumps to snatch their victims’ valuables, police said.

Detectives from the Metropolitan Police have been using undercover officers to target the gangs in recent months. They found that the pickpockets were mainly Chilean and some had criminal records for similar crimes back home. The suspects often operated in groups of six but some of those arrested by police were operating alone, according to Detective Chief Superintendent Steve Cobb.

“They are targeting tourists who are out shopping as well as businessmen in suits carrying expensive bags. They tend to follow their targets and use distraction techniques such as bumps or splashes before stealing their valuables,” Cobb said. “Many of the suspects we arrested were Chilean nationals and some had criminal records for similar offences back home. We have been targeting them using undercover teams and in the last three months more than 50 people have been charged with theft from person offences.”

Cobb urged tourists to remain vigilant when visiting the capital and warned of groups of men working together who are often used as a distraction by the pickpockets. “The West End is a very popular place for shoppers and it’s important that they don’t allow themselves to become distracted in any way,” he said.

“They should be aware of gangs of men standing around together or groups of beggars as these are often distraction techniques used by thieves.”
