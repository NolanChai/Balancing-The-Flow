able King's Road, trying on the latest designer wares and spending up large with their trusty American Express card.

The show might be on a break at the moment, but there has never been a better time for MIC fans to follow in the style footsteps of the Chelsea crew and go on a little shopping spree of their own. Just head over to Westfield London, where all the best luxury brands can be found under one roof.

And with 40 per cent off everything at Emporio Armani for a limited time only, what better excuse to update your wardrobe this autumn than with a little help from Mr Armani?

The Italian designer's store in Westfield London boasts a fabulous collection of men's and women's wear that is perfect for the colder months. We love this long sleeve top (£175) in luxurious silk crepe de chine that would work wonderfully with skinny jeans or trousers, while these cropped, straight leg pants (£290) will add a smart edge to any outfit.

But if you fancy something a little more daring then Emporio Armani is the place for you. Try this flared pencil skirt (£345) with a printed blouse (£175) and statement heels for an effortlessly sexy look, or go all-out glamorous with a sparkly dress (£380) paired with these eye-catching shoes (£290).

And to finish off your outfit, why not add this beautiful clutch bag (£195) which will make you look and feel a million dollars.

So now is the perfect time to get your credit cards out and treat yourself to some fabulous new pieces for autumn. To find out more about what's on offer at Emporio Armani, visit www.emporioarmani.com or Westfield London.
