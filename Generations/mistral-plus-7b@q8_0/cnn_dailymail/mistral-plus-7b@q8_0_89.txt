31-year-old self from the Philippines -- were led one by one to their hanging on April 29, she was nowhere to be found. That morning, the 30-year-old had been spared at the last moment by Indonesian authorities, who decided to send her home and put a new trial in place for her case. After four years on death row for allegedly trying to smuggle drugs into Indonesia, she was finally going home. "It's like a miracle," said Veloso's lawyer, Eduardo Serio. The Indonesian government said it decided to send Veloso back to the Philippines because it was unable to determine whether the drugs found in her luggage were hers or someone else's. In a statement from the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, officials said the decision came after "the possibility of legal uncertainty" that could affect Veloso's life. They also said they wanted to spare her family further suffering.

### 'A blessing'

Veloso's reprieve was met with joy by her loved ones back home in the Philippines. Her mother, Celia, wept tears of joy when she heard the news. "This is a blessing," said Veloso's sister, Marites. "She will live." It also offered hope to others facing execution for drug-related offenses. The executions come amid a growing crackdown on drugs in Indonesia, which has seen drug use skyrocket. Authorities say the country has become an international drug hub and has become increasingly concerned about illicit substances being brought into the country by foreigners. As many as 105 people -- including 64 foreigners -- are currently facing death sentences for drug-related crimes, Indonesian officials have said. Many of them hail from countries with large Filipino populations, including China and Hong Kong. Veloso was arrested in April 2010 at Yogyakarta International Airport after trying to smuggle heroin into the country. She claimed she had been deceived by a friend, who asked her to carry the drugs for him. That friend is believed to be one of the eight people executed Wednesday.
