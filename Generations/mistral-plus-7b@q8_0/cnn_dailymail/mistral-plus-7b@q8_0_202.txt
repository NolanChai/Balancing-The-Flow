underscores the dangers of collapsing structures during an earthquake.

The family was driving their Dodge Caravan westbound on Highway 2 near Gold Bar, Wash., around 10:45 a.m., when the barrier fell from the overpass, crushing and trapping their truck below. The father, Troy Anderson, had to be extricated by first responders, but he was pronounced dead at the scene. His wife, Angela, also died while trapped in the vehicle.

Their son, Elijah, was taken to a hospital in critical condition where he later succumbed to his injuries.

Authorities suspect that the barrier fell after being loosened by windy and rainy weather over the past few days. It had been raining heavily on Monday when the accident occurred.

The highway is near one of two dams on the South Fork of the Stillaguamish River, a tributary to Puget Sound. The dams were built in 1945 and are owned by Seattle City Light. A spokesman for the utility said that it was unaware of any issues with the concrete barrier.

“We are working closely with Washington State Department of Transportation and Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office to investigate the cause of this tragedy,” City Light said in a statement. “Our condolences go out to everyone impacted by this terrible accident.”
