key battle he believes could decide the outcome...

Aston Villa and Liverpool will renew acquaintances at Wembley for an FA Cup semi-final showdown. The Premier League clubs have met on three occasions already this term, with both teams claiming one victory apiece while drawing the other encounter.

There have been plenty of goals in their recent clashes, and it is worth noting that 19 were scored across those three matches last season - including a 6-0 drubbing for Villa at Anfield. The Reds' frontline will no doubt be the focus point before kick-off, but they are not the only threat Liverpool possess going into Sunday’s clash.

It is imperative that Villa shut out their threat in wide areas if they are to stand any chance of causing a surprise at Wembley. Andy Robertson has been one of the most consistent performers for Jurgen Klopp's side over the last four seasons, and is now the first choice left-back ahead of James Milner.

The Scotland international will look to use his pace and energy to cause trouble down that flank against Villa on Sunday afternoon, and will certainly pose a threat going forward. He has scored two goals in 36 matches this season for Liverpool, including the winner against Tottenham at Anfield last month, and also created five goals for his team-mates during that period - although only one came in their Premier League campaign.

The 25-year-old’s presence in attack has become crucial to Jurgen Klopp’s side over the past two seasons. His ability to get forward and provide width down the left-hand side is something that the Reds’ opponents will need to be aware of, and Villa's back line needs to pay special attention to him on Sunday if they are to cause an upset at Wembley.
