2017 champion Sergio Garcia and Tiger Woods, who won last year, are cases in point — the nod is to Spieth. The 24-year-old Texan has finished second at Augusta twice, including to Garcia by a single shot last year. He’ll be desperate for a win at the first Major of the year and can finally put his demons of 2016 behind him. Best European . Rory McIlroy is due another big one — he has won four Majors but none since the USPGA Championship in 2014, which means he must be suffering from a serious case of ‘the yips’. A victory at Augusta would end his current barren spell and cement his status as one of the all-time greats. Best each way bet . Dustin Johnson has been a model of consistency since returning to action after injuring his back last summer — he has finished in the top five of each of his six PGA Tour outings this year. The American also has finished runner-up at Augusta on two occasions and should be pushing for the winner’s green jacket come Sunday evening. Best British hope . Justin Rose will always give it a go but it is time for Englishman Tommy Fleetwood to step up to the plate. He was in contention when Spieth blew his chance last year and has started the season well — he won the Abu Dhabi Championship in January and finished tied fourth at last week’s Valspar Championship.
