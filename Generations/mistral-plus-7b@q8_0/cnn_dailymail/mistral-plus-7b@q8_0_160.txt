ctions said those who want a criminal prosecution should go through the proper channels by launching a judicial review.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that it had decided not to bring any charges against Lord Janner despite two police investigations and allegations of child sex abuse against him dating back almost 50 years. Saunders has since received more than 2,000 emails from members of the public urging her to reconsider the case.

Saunders told BBC Radio 4's The Today programme: "There are no circumstances in which we will make a prosecution decision through any other means than through the criminal justice system. If anyone has concerns about that they can use the judicial review route to challenge our decisions."

The CPS had said the decision not to prosecute was based on a lack of evidence and insufficient time for Janner to prepare a defence in light of his ill health. But some MPs, including David Cameron's father Stanley, have called the decision "a travesty of justice".

Saunders defended her decision as made within the rules laid down by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). She said: "Our decision has been based upon our analysis of all the evidence available to us and it is a DPP decision that I have taken."
