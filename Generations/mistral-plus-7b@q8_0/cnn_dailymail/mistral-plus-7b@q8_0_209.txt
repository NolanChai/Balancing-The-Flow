Scott had disappeared after leaving her home in Leeton to head for her classroom at a neighbouring school on 5 April. Her charred remains were discovered on 6 May by two bushwalkers. On Friday, police officially confirmed that the body was that of Scott's, according to Sky News.

She had been reported missing after failing to show up for work and also skipping her wedding rehearsal dinner with her fianc√©, Aaron Leeson-Welsh. The pair had planned to marry on 18 April.

"It is with great sadness that I inform you that the remains found on Wednesday in Cocoparra National Park have been formally identified as that of Stephanie Scott," said New South Wales Police Commander John Kerlatec, according to CNN. "Stephanie's family has been notified and they request their privacy be respected at this difficult time."

Earlier, police had arrested 24-year-old Vincent Stanford on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering Scott. The former school employee has since pleaded not guilty to the charges.
