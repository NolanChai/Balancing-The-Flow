2300 hours near Paddington on 5 May after officers saw him driving a white Vauxhall Astra without any number plates. The car sped off at more than 80mph and ignored the officer’s attempts to stop it. Ali eventually pulled over after he was boxed in by other police cars. He admitted dangerous driving, failing to stop when required by police and no insurance during a hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court today (4 June).
