ury as Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur all won on Sunday afternoon to put them six points behind the leaders with only seven games left.

They now face a difficult trip to Selhurst Park to take on Alan Pardew's Crystal Palace, who have taken 10 points from their last four home league fixtures and have been impressive in recent weeks. And Pellegrini knows that another slip against Palace could be the final nail in his side's title ambitions.

"We cannot lose many more games if we are going to continue fighting for the championship," he said. "It is not easy but we will do all that is possible to try and win every game."

Pellegrini has a full squad available after David Silva returned from a knee injury against Dynamo Kiev on Thursday. But goalkeeper Joe Hart, who was forced off during that game with a groin problem, is likely to miss out.
