former of their triumphant Champions League final win over Bayern Munich in May.

"He's probably the best defender I've played against," said Carragher, who made 508 appearances for Liverpool during his 17-year stint at Anfield. "I don't think there is any other centre half who has come close to him over the years. The consistency of him over all those years has been brilliant."

Carragher also admitted that he would be happy if Terry won the Premier League title this season, something his Liverpool team have failed to do for over two decades. The former England international was speaking at the launch of EA Sports' latest FIFA game, and in particular their new 'Pro Instincts' mode which allows gamers to mimic the playing style of a particular player by selecting them as their avatar. Carragher believes it is an excellent way to get closer to football's top stars.

"It gives you a real feel for how a player feels and thinks on the pitch," he said. "Everyone has a different mindset and way of playing and Pro Instincts brings that out in players. I'm a big fan of it and think it will help bring out more of the personality of players."

FIFA 15 is set for release on September 26, 2014, and is available for pre-order now.
