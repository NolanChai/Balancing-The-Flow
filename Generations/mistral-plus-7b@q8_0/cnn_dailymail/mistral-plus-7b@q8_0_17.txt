untless spirit and incredible strength are being lauded after she defied all odds by waking up from a coma in which doctors had given her no chance of surviving, let alone recovering from.

Moser was rushed to hospital back in January with a fever after suffering a miscarriage at 24 weeks. The young woman from Colorado quickly developed sepsis and suffered multiple organ failure due to a bacterial infection. She then slipped into a coma for four months, prompting doctors to tell her mother that there was no chance she would wake up.

However, Moser made an incredible recovery and woke up from her coma earlier this month after she suddenly started speaking about three weeks ago. The brave young woman is now making a remarkable progress and is currently in rehabilitation. She has recently moved from intensive care to a regular hospital room.
