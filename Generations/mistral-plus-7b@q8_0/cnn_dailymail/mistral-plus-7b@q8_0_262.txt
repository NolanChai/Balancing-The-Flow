izarre temperature pattern in the Pacific Ocean could also help to forecast weather patterns around the world for years to come, according to a study published on Thursday.

The warm water blob appears to have started growing sometime in 2014, and now extends from Alaska all the way south to California. It’s caused by unusually warm temperatures of the ocean surface, which are due to a combination of climate change and natural variability of weather patterns. This warm patch has been linked to severe weather across North America.

“The warm blob has definitely influenced the drought in California, but it also affected the West coast,” explained Professor Yi Ming of the University of Washington’s Joint Institute for the Study of Atmosphere and Ocean (JISAO), who led the study. “We also see changes in storm track and precipitation patterns in the Northwest and Southeast US, as well as snow cover and temperature changes across North America.”

The warm water blob has been causing problems since 2014, when it was first detected, but it’s expected to stick around until at least 2016. If predictions are correct, the area could even become colder than usual, which would further compound problems in California and other drought-stricken states.

“A cold blob is a very plausible scenario for next winter,” explained Professor Ming. “This can actually have an impact on the severity of the drought.”

The warm water blob could even help meteorologists predict weather patterns years in advance, since it seems to affect climate change across North America.

“It’s important for us to understand what will happen next winter because it may affect water and energy resources,” said Professor Ming. “We want to be able to predict where the blob will go.”
