Geronimi took exception to the LFP president failing to enter the pitch as is tradition after Bastia were beaten 4-1 by Lyon at the Stade de France.

"He did not come down to the pitch for the traditional handshake at the end of the match," Geronimi told French radio station Europe 1. "That was a lack of respect.

"I do not understand why he was so upset when Bastia won the Coupe de la Ligue two years ago. He did not come down to shake our hands either. Thiriez has to resign."

Thierry Laurey, coach of runners-up Bastia, said: "That is an attitude that is unacceptable from a League president."
