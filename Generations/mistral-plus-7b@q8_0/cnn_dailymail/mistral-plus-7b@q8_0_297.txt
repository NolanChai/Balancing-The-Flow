ook is in jail.

Andrew Hennells was jailed for four years after he pleaded guilty at Guildford Crown Court to attempted robbery.

He posted a message on Facebook admitting his plans to rob the Tesco Express in Farncombe 15 minutes before he held up staff at gun point. The 32-year-old, of Larchwood Close, Farncombe , entered the store in Station Road just after 6pm on Wednesday, February 8.

He demanded cash from the shopkeeper and pointed a handgun at him.

Officers later searched his home and found the weapon in his bedroom - along with ammunition and balaclavas.
