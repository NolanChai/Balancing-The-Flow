ar Pradesh, is known for her very long, luxuriant locks that have been carefully groomed by her mother for over 20 years. Smita has entered several hair contests and won several awards for the length of her locks, including winning a local competition for having the longest hair in Uttar Pradesh. Now, she has set her sights on becoming an official Guinness World Record holder.

Smita was just 14 years old when her mother, Neelima Srivastava, first noticed how long and lustrous her daughter’s hair was. It was then that the mother began to groom it, combing it daily with oil. Now, at age 35, Smita’s locks stretch down past her knees, a length she is proud of. “I have never cut my hair since I can remember,” she said. “In fact, whenever someone asks me if they should trim their hair, I tell them it is not necessary.” The woman has had to deal with comments from those who criticize her for letting her hair grow so long and have even called her a ‘hobo’. However, Smita remains resolute in her decision. “I don’t care what people say,” she said. “It is my own personal choice. I love my long hair.”

Smita has taken good care of her tresses over the years, using natural oils and shampoos to keep them healthy. She also washes it at least twice a week with coconut oil and takes extra steps to protect her locks from the elements. “I use a lot of serum on my hair, as well as some hair cream,” she said. “In addition, I use conditioner regularly and oil once every two weeks.” With her long flowing locks, Smita is aiming to break the current Guinness World Record for the longest female hair, which is currently held by Xie Qiuping of China at 18 feet 5 inches.
