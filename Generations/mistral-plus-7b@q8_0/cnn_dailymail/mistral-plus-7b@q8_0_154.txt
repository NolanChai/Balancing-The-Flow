The babies, named Kwembe and Nyota, are the first offspring of two new females named Dara and N’Dowayo to be introduced at the Bronx Zoo. The males, who were born just two days apart in January, have been exploring their new home after spending time with their moms behind the scenes.

“We are thrilled to welcome these two playful babies into our gorilla troop and give visitors an opportunity to watch them grow,” said Jim Breheny, Bronx Zoo Director. “Both moms have been doing a wonderful job caring for their infants.”
