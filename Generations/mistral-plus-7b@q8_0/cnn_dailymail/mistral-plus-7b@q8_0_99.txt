identify their nationality, but they are believed to be Russian speaking.

The 10-minute video, entitled “A Tribute To Our Sisters”, shows a group of women dressed in full black abayas with their faces covered by black niqabs. They fire automatic rifles and stand shoulder-to-shoulder during military training, including physical fitness drills and shooting exercises.

Their trainer is an older woman wearing the same attire as her students, who tells them that they must be ready to kill both men and women. The footage was posted online by the pro-ISIS news outlet Al-Minbar News Agency, which is known for posting ISIS propaganda videos.

The video ends with a group of women swearing allegiance to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
