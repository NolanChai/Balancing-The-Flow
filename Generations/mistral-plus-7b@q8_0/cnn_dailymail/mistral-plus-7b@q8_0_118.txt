a tight knot around the wheel of his Mercedes Formula One car.

He had just won the British Grand Prix for a third consecutive year but the mood seemed to be one of resigned acceptance rather than joyous celebration. The reasons why are obvious: this is a sport about winning, and Rosberg was denied the chance to win a fourth consecutive race in Barcelona two weeks ago after being ordered by his team to give way to Lewis Hamilton.

For those who doubt that it was as bad as all that, consider that the Mercedes drivers have been engaged in an intense battle for supremacy this season – one they are both determined to win. In the past four races, they have finished first and second on three occasions. A fourth-place finish from Rosberg at the Spanish Grand Prix might be seen by some as a consolation prize, but not to him.

“I lost the race there,” he told Sky Sports F1 afterwards. “It’s not what I wanted. It is not going to help our team and it is not going to help me either.” Rosberg was angry that he had been asked to cede his position on track by Hamilton, who was on a fresher set of tyres after his pit stop. “He was so far behind, but the team made their decision,” Rosberg complained.

Rosberg also felt that Hamilton should not have been given the chance to make up time for an error he had made early in the race, when he lost several seconds while driving slowly on one of the two racing lines around Silverstone.

“It is very disappointing for me,” Rosberg said. “I worked so hard to get back to him after his mistake and then I was given a direct order to let him pass. It’s not what you want in a championship like this.”
