Tuesday when someone grabbed a marker and scratched "FTP" on his leg.

The LAPD tweeted Wednesday that it had launched an investigation, but by Thursday afternoon there were rumors circulating about who the culprit may have been. As LAist reports, the graffiti is likely a reference to the hashtag #FuckThePolice, and the Twitter account behind Charly's tagging has been traced back to a 25-year-old man named Michael Mendoza.

In a series of tweets Thursday afternoon, Mendoza wrote that he was responsible for the graffiti, "because I feel like cops are overstepping their boundaries and getting away with murder." He added, "I hope it brings attention to how out of line cops really are. They should not be above the law. #FTP"

Mendoza also claimed that he is part of a group called Animal Liberation Brigade who "graffitied over 10 cop cars in Venice."
