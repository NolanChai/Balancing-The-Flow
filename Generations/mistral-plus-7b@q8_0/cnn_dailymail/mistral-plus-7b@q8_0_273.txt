her for taking up two parking spaces, she says it isn’t really her fault because of her disability.

She posted pictures and copies of the notes to Facebook, asking if anyone else had received similar notes. Her post quickly went viral with many people offering their support.

The woman lives in a condo building which shares a parking lot with an apartment complex, where she says some residents are displeased that they share the lot. She said she doesn’t like to park close to cars or other parked vehicles because of her disability.

“I have a prosthetic leg and it makes it hard for me to get into my car when there is someone close by,” she explained on Facebook. “I also don’t want people standing next to my car when I am getting into it.”

She said she has tried parking in different spots but has been reprimanded every time with a note left on her windshield, saying things like, “You are not permitted to take up two parking spaces,” or simply, “Two cars?!” She’s been receiving the notes for over two years.

“I was told that I should have an extra handicap sign added to my car so I don’t have to park in one spot,” she said. However, the handicapped parking spot is on a slope and doesn’t allow her to safely enter or exit her vehicle without assistance. She has already applied for another accessible spot closer to her home, but in the meantime she has no choice but to park in an open space.

She also says that some of the notes are quite nasty: “You really need to learn how to park… I know you’re a disabled person and all…” reads one note. The woman said she is a courteous driver and tries her best to be respectful when parking.

“I do not think it is fair that I am being singled out,” she told CBC News in an interview. “When people are confronted with the fact that I have a disability, they kind of back down.”
