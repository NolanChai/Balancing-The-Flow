­prosecute those who promote terrorism and strip British extremists of their citizenship.

But she warned that such measures are unlikely to be passed before the General Election on June 8 if Labour wins seats in Parliament, leaving her without an overall majority. She said that meant voters could not trust Ed Miliband because he is unable to guarantee strong anti-terror laws will be in place after the election.

In a sign of the growing concern over potential new terrorist threats, it emerged yesterday that Scotland Yard has stepped up armed patrols at high profile buildings across London, including Government buildings.

Miss May said: “The threat we face is changing. Terrorists are looking for new ways to harm us and radicalisation is taking place in a more complex way. The terrorism laws that we have on the statute book today were drawn up almost 20 years ago. They need urgent reform.” She said there was an “urgent” need for legislation which would “close the gap” between terrorists who plan attacks and those who promote them.

“It’s clear that the current system is not working,” she added. “We can’t allow dangerous extremists to use British streets as a propaganda platform.” Miss May said Labour leader Ed Miliband was unwilling or unable to accept that new legislation was needed to combat terrorism.

She also called for stronger powers to strip dual nationals of their citizenship if they pose a threat to the country’s national security. “We need urgent reform of our counter-terror laws,” she said. “This is an issue where we desperately want the new legislation in place before June 8.”
