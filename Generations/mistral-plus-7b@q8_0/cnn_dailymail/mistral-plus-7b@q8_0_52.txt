In a new paper published Monday in the journal Nature Geoscience, scientists at Harvard University report that the Deepwater Horizon oil spill may have also damaged ocean life near the site of the incident by disrupting phytoplankton, the foundation of the ocean food chain. Using data from satellites and undersea instruments that measured chlorophyll concentrations in the Gulf of Mexico, the researchers found that after the 2010 disaster, phytoplankton in the area were more likely to aggregate into dense blooms than they had been before the oil spill. When phytoplankton form such large aggregations, they stop photosynthesizing and eventually die. This leaves less oxygen for other aquatic species living in those areas of the ocean. The authors attribute this phenomenon to the presence of hydrocarbon contaminants, which could have either poisoned the phytoplankton or caused them to group together more than they normally would. According to Harvard biologist Daniel G. Schindler, who led the study, the loss of phytoplankton is a major threat to marine ecosystems because it creates dead zones where life cannot grow. "These dead zones are pretty ominous," he said. "They reduce biodiversity and they decrease the overall productivity of the ocean."
