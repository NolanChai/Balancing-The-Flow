of their social media accounts for several hours before being able to delete the explicit content from the site.

The shop's Facebook page was posted with sexually-explicit photos and videos between Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning.

"A few weeks ago one of our managers had received a phishing email," Scooter's Coffee said in a statement. "She clicked on it, not knowing that her email account had been hacked."

After the employee clicked on the malicious link, the hacker was able to access their Facebook page and begin posting pornography and other explicit content, according to KETV-TV in Omaha. The hacker also posted fake messages claiming that the coffee shop would be giving away free drinks.

Scooter's Coffee said it is working with social media experts to ensure that something like this doesn't happen again.
