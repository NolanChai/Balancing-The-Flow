zza Cole Show on BBC Radio 2 to tell her story and the host, Jeremy Vine, was in tears as he listened to her tale.

She explained: "I had seven miscarriages before we managed to have our little girl. And I set aside money for my babies' headstones because they were so precious to me."

But then Dawn said a friend of hers who was caring for her pets while she went on holiday stole Â£70 from the envelope meant for the grave stones and spent it on herself. The mother-of-one explained: "It upset me because I really couldn't afford to lose that money.

"I lost the money because she took it, it wasn't that we had an argument about it. She just took the money."

Dawn said her friend then went on a holiday and spent some of the stolen cash on drinks. The mum said her friend still hasn't admitted what she did but now keeps telling Dawn that she has paid the money back - which she insists is not the case.
