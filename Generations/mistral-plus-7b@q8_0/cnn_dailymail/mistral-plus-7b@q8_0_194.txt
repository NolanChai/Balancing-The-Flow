The $11 billion terminal can hold 90 million passengers per year, more than twice the number served by Hong Kong's largest terminal. It will be able to handle 600 planes arriving and departing each day -- a big leap from the current 240.
Aimed at "catering for the increasing demand of Chinese people wanting to travel overseas," the new terminal will "further improve the international transportation network, promote the opening up and the high-quality development of Beijing's aviation industry" said Li Jiaxiang, president of China's Civil Aviation Administration, at a recent ceremony.
The new facility is part of the airport's expansion, which also includes an additional runway. The project will cost $12 billion and should be completed by 2035.
