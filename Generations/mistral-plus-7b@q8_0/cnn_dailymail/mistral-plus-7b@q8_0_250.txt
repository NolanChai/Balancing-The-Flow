the forthcoming Formula E series.

The first season of the championship is due to kick off in September 2014 and will include 10 teams and 20 drivers. It has been organised by the FIA, motor racing's governing body.

Drive eO plans for its car to be powered by two electric motors on the rear axle. It'll also have a lithium-ion battery pack, which is expected to give a driving range of about 15 miles and acceleration of around zero to 62mph in less than three seconds.

The body will be constructed from carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) and the vehicle will weigh 750kg. To cope with the high-performance demands, it'll be fitted with Brembo brakes and a racing suspension system.
