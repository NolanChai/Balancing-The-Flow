isbane court following her appearance on charges of bestiality. She is accused of having sex with a Doberman called Dexter, owned by her then boyfriend. Ms Driscoll was arrested last October after a neighbour allegedly caught the incident on CCTV. On Saturday afternoon Ms Driscoll confronted a news crew as they filmed outside court, telling them to leave her alone and knocking over their equipment in the process. She also threatened to 'smash' one of the photographers after he followed her out of the court building. Police were called but did not take any action against Ms Driscoll. The 21-year-old is due back in Brisbane Magistrates Court on February 25. Australian Associated Press
