Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are billed as two great rivals of modern day football but if former Brazil striker Ronaldo has his way, they could one day be in the same team.
The 2002 World Cup winner said: “I think that if both players want to play in the same team then it will happen one day.”
Messi and Ronaldo are two of the greatest forwards the modern game has ever seen, but there’s no love lost between the pair. Messi’s Barcelona and Ronaldo’s Real Madrid are the arch-rivals of Spain and their players often clash when they face each other in El Clasico.
Messi’s current contract with Barca is set to expire in June 2018, and it seems he could be on his way out of the Camp Nou. Reports have claimed that Messi could join Italian giants Juventus next season but Ronaldo believes he would fit right into the La Liga champions.
Ronaldo added: “He’s an exceptional player who deserves to play with any team in the world, including Barcelona.”
