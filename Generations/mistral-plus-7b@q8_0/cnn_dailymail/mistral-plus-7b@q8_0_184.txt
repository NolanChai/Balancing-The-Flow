6:59 p.m. EDT Sunday when its main engine fired. It had just been launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan atop a Soyuz rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

As of Monday, Progress M-27M was reportedly tumbling and out of control in space. Roscosmos has called an emergency meeting to discuss ways to stabilize it, but so far no plan has been revealed. Russian officials had previously said that Progress M-27M was successfully launched into orbit before the malfunction. It was expected to dock with ISS on Wednesday.

This is not the first time a Progress spacecraft has suffered a problem in flight. In August 2011, Progress 44P was destroyed by an explosion just after launch from Kazakhstan. The Russian space agency attributed that failure to a technical malfunction and vowed to find out what went wrong and correct the problems before future launches.

Progress M-27M is carrying about three tons of supplies for the ISS crew, including food, fuel, water and clothing. Without it, the ISS would still have enough supplies until the next scheduled resupply mission in October. But officials are working to make sure there are contingency plans in place in case Progress M-27M cannot be recovered or repaired in orbit.

The Progress spacecraft is a regular supply ship for the ISS crew, delivering food and other essentials. The Soyuz rocket that carried Progress M-27M to orbit is also used to ferry humans into space. NASA astronaut Mike Hopkins, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kotov and Canadian astronaut Chris Hadfield were launched into space in a Soyuz capsule earlier this month and are now living on the ISS.
