The prosecution relies on testimony from a former lover who was paid off with over half-a-million dollars.

Menendezâ€™s defense is that the actions were not illegal and that his friendship with Melgen did not affect any legislation. They also claim that Menendez had no reason to believe Melgen would do anything inappropriate, considering how much he had already done for him.  Melgen has been charged with defrauding Medicare of upwards of $70 million dollars.
