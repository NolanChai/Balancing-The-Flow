oyer at home in front of the gas fire as she grew up in Edinburgh’s Gorgie area with mum Margaret and two brothers. But nowadays, the retired secretary enjoys nothing more than going out dancing with friends on weekends when she is not travelling to places such as the Caribbean, Dubai or New York. She said: “My grandparents were quite old-fashioned and they thought their daughter was a rebel because she went out for a few drinks.” But Pat has no regrets about her love of going out on a Saturday night with friends who are in their 70s. She added: “I am quite the life and soul of the party, I like to let my hair down and be socialable. We have lots of laughs when we go out for dinner.” Pat has just returned from a holiday in Dubai where she was soaking up the sun on the beach with her best friend from school and her husband who is 10 years older than her. She said: “He does not mind me going away without him because he knows I am enjoying myself.” The couple have been together for almost 40 years after meeting in Edinburgh’s Musselburgh when Pat was working as a secretary for British Steel. They live just a few streets away from where Pat grew up and now enjoy spending time with their grandchildren.
