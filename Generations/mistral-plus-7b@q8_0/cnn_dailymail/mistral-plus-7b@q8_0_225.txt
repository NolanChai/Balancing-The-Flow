’s blood stem cells the ability to fight off tumours has shown success in early trials. The treatment, called CRISPR, uses gene-editing techniques and a virus to introduce genetic material into the body that teaches white blood cells how to find cancerous cells and destroy them. Early tests carried out on cancer cells have shown survival rates in mice were boosted by more than 50 per cent. It’s hoped that CRISPR will one day be used against a wide range of cancers, including leukaemia, lymphoma and solid tumours such as breast and prostate cancer.
