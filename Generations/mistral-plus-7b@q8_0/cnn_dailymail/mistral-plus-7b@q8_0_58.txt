His distressed parents called mountain rescue teams who were joined by the boy's grandfather, also on a family ski trip, and spent 12 hours desperately trying to locate him in darkness. They found his body at 4am on Sunday morning.

Police said Carwyn had fallen from a cliff near Les Gets, in south-east France. It is understood he fell after becoming disorientated and wandering off the marked ski run.

Carwyn, who was described as a "lively and friendly boy", had been on a week's half term break with his father and mother and two younger sisters at La Clusaz in Haute-Savoie.

"This is an appalling tragedy. Our thoughts are with the family and friends of this young boy," said Paul Farnell, spokesman for the Foreign Office.
