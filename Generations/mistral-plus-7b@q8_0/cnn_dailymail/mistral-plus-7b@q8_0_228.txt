Khan, 29, and the children â€“ two girls aged 9 and 6, and two boys aged 4 and 2 - are understood to be on their way back to the UK after being held by Turkish authorities. The couple have been the subject of a police operation for several weeks as officers attempted to prevent them leaving the country. It is believed that they intended to travel from Istanbul to Syria via Gaziantep, close to the Syrian border. Both Mr Malik and Ms Khan were born in Britain, and it is understood that they were not on any kind of terror watch list prior to their disappearance. They have reportedly been held in Turkey for several days after their arrest. Mr Malik had previously travelled to Syria with his eldest daughter, but she is now believed to be back in the UK.
