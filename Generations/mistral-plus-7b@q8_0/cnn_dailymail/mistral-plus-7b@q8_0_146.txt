, 10, was bullied at St Paul’s Primary School in Southsea, Hampshire, which is run by Portsmouth City Council.

She claims the bullying began in September 2019 and escalated during the school holidays that followed. The alleged bullying continued until June 2020 when Tianni was removed from St Paul’s Primary School. Tracy is suing Portsmouth City Council for £50,000 on her daughter’s behalf over claims it ignored her concerns and failed in its duty of care.

A court document filed as part of the case stated: “Tianni was diagnosed with autism aged 3 years old. Due to being on the autistic spectrum, she was susceptible to anxiety, sensory processing difficulties, and an inability to regulate her emotions effectively.” Tracy is also suing the council for £25,000 of compensation after claiming that its actions resulted in Tianni suffering from depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.

She alleges the council failed to investigate her complaints properly. In a statement filed as part of the court claim, Tracy said: “The bullying of Tianni was extremely distressing and affected every aspect of our lives. She has become incredibly anxious about attending school due to the constant bullying and is now struggling to cope with day-to-day activities.”

Tracy’s solicitor, Matthew D’Alessandro, of specialist law firm, Irwin Mitchell said: “We are determined to fight for justice on behalf of Tianni and her family. As a result of the bullying at St Paul’s Primary School, our client suffered from depression and PTSD. We believe the council failed in its duty of care towards Tianni by failing to properly investigate the concerns raised regarding the alleged bullying.”

The council has not yet responded to the allegations.
