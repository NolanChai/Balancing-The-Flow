c life of prostitution.

The defendant, who pleaded not guilty, was found guilty last Thursday in federal court of running an organized criminal ring that smuggled about 100 Romanian and Hungarian men into New York City with the promise of good-paying jobs as construction workers and models. Instead, the victims were forced to live in squalid conditions in Brooklyn apartment buildings and were coerced or threatened into having sex with as many as a dozen clients a day for up to $250 per encounter.

The jury deliberated for more than two weeks before finding Andras Janos Vass guilty of racketeering conspiracy, visa fraud, alien smuggling and money laundering. The 25-year-old defendant faces life in prison at his sentencing in January. He also must pay restitution to the victims.
