ello Bianchi and Englishmen Scott Wootton and Charlie Taylor all reported illness or injury to manager Neil Redfearn ahead of the trip to The Valley.

It has not been a good week for the Elland Road side in general, who have suffered an FA Cup exit at the hands of League Two side Cambridge and seen their hopes of promotion via the play-offs ended by a 2-0 home defeat to Middlesbrough. With that result, Leeds' win against Millwall in September now appears to be something of a false dawn.

The loss of Bellusci and Wootton could have a huge impact on Saturday's game given both have played a major part in Leeds' defence this season. The Italians have started 19 games each, while the centre-back has featured in all but one of Leeds' games this term. Taylor also started 32 league matches for the club.

While there is no doubting the quality and quantity of the injured players, Redfearn should be able to field a strong side without them. With Wootton ruled out due to injury, Liam Cooper will come into the back four alongside the returning Gaetano Berardi. At left-back, Stuart Dallas should get his chance having only made a couple of starts since signing in January from Brentford.

In midfield, Lewis Cook will be eager to start and he will probably be joined by Alex Mowatt. With Luke Murphy out for the remainder of the season due to injury, the pair are Leeds' most creative force in that area of the pitch. Up front, it will be interesting to see if Redfearn puts his faith in youngster Souleymane Doukara or opts for an experienced head like Matt Smith and Luke Varney.
