FC Copenhagen on Sunday.

Agger was shown a straight red card by referee Lars Christoffersen after elbowing his compatriot and Brondy captain. The FA decided to make the punishment harsher and gave the central defender a two game ban, ruling him out of Saturday’s clash against Randers FC and next Wednesday’s Danish Cup quarter-final with Midtjylland.

The Denmark international apologised for his actions after the match on Sunday and will now be missing in action as he serves his suspension. The defender said that it was an accidental incident and insisted that he did not mean any harm to Jorgensen, but also admitted that he deserved the red card.
