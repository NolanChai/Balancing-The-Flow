ifer Moore was traveling from Cairo to the US on February 21 when she discovered her checked baggage had not arrived at her destination, Miami International Airport. Her missing bag contained a large part of her family heirlooms: clothes and jewelry belonging to her late grandmother, who passed away in November. Moore says that included a set of gold rings made by the artisan who designed her grandmother's engagement ring.

"My mom gave me that set of rings when I got engaged so they are very special," said Moore. She says she has contacted Delta Air Lines on several occasions but has not had any luck recovering her belongings. "I can't even begin to tell you the frustration and helplessness you feel when you have been trying for weeks to get a response from an airline about your lost luggage and there just is none," she said. Moore says she has received only automated responses from Delta, despite attempts to contact them via email, phone call and social media. She says the airline told her they had to wait 90 days before making any claims for missing bags. After nearly three months of no progress on recovering her grandmother's jewelry, Moore started a Twitter campaign #GetMoorestuffback to draw attention to her situation. "I thought the only way I am going to get any response from Delta is by having so much noise online," said Moore. In response to a CNN enquiry about the case, Delta issued the following statement: "We know our customers rely on their luggage while traveling and we are sorry for this inconvenience. We understand Ms. Moore's frustration with this situation, and our team continues to work diligently with her to resolve this issue."
