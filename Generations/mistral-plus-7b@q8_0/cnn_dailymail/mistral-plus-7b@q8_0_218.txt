since his sacking by the ECB in February, as he begins preparations with the county ahead of their opening Specsavers County Championship match against Hampshire at the Oval on Friday.

Surrey were given permission by the England and Wales Cricket Board last month to sign Pietersen for this season's championship and limited overs cricket.

The batsman, who has not played international cricket since England's Ashes defeat in Australia last year, had his contract terminated by the ECB after a bitter dispute over his conduct and future. He was subsequently charged with bringing the game into disrepute during the Indian Premier League - which he played for Rajasthan Royals - and has pleaded not guilty to those charges.

The news that Pietersen was joining Surrey sparked some controversy in the county, but it is expected that most supporters will welcome the return of one of their all-time greatest players. However, it seems unlikely the ECB would consider reinstating Pietersen into England's Test squad with an Ashes tour to Australia just around the corner.
