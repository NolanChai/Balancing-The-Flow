911 dispatchers an anonymous tip of "two little girls walking along the road," who had been left alone with no adult supervision, according to a WBFF report.

The call went as follows: "I just seen two little kids walking down Route 355 and they were probably about, like, 7- or 8-years old. They weren't with an adult." The dispatcher then asks for the caller's name. "I don't want to be known," the woman said. "I just thought this is something I need to report. It wasn't that they were in danger, but it was like, 'Hey somebody should probably pick them up.'"

The two girls in question are the daughters of Lenore and Dan Sternberg, who have come under fire for their decision not to oversee their children at all times. The couple has become well-known as "free range parents" who encourage their kids to be independent and explore their surroundings freely. The Maryland couple have three boys and two girls. They often let the older ones walk home from school alone, or wander around the neighborhood on their own.

Their youngest child, 7-year-old Samantha, was reportedly walking with her 9-year-old sister to a nearby convenience store. The incident has sparked debate about parental control and safety in Maryland and across the country. Dan Sternberg told reporters that he is not against laws requiring children under a certain age to be supervised by an adult at all times. But, he added, "It's important for parents to understand their children and know when they are ready to be left on their own."

According to the Baltimore Sun, child welfare officials told the family that if they feel it is safe for them to continue leaving their young children unsupervised, then there is no reason for authorities to intervene.
