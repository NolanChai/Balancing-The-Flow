for the most time pandas have ever spent making sweet love.

The new record was set at Pairi Daiza Wildlife Park in Belgium. It is believed to be a new Guinness World Record, although Lu Lu did not get any personal recognition for his marathon effort. The zoo says he has fathered two cubs during this time, while Zhen Zhen gave birth to three.

Lu Lu and Zhen Zhen were introduced in December 2014 and became a couple straight away. They have been living together at the Pairi Daiza Wildlife Park since April 2015. Their previous record was 6 minutes and 39 seconds.

Pandas are known for their mating habits, with males having relatively small testicles but enjoying an incredible sperm count of up to 100 million sperm cells per ejaculation. This means that they can have sex almost every other day.
