agert posed the following question:

"The start of this process means you’re likely experiencing things like mood swings and body odor."

"What is puberty?" he said. "You'd think so, but it's menopause," contestant Troy Davis replied.

After a brief pause, Tragert responded by saying: "That is a very good answer for the wrong question!"

Although many fans were offended by the blunder and took to Twitter to express their disgust, others simply laughed at the gaffe. One user wrote: "Someone needs a sex education class! How does one get puberty mixed up with menopause?"

Another said: "This is the best thing I’ve seen all day."

However, some people defended Davis and noted that he had been under pressure while trying to answer the question. One user wrote: "It was a difficult category! He got flustered!" Another commented: "If you can't laugh at yourself, then life is going to be really hard."
