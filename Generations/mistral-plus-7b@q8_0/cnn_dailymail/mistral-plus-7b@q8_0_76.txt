ovic's men beat Barnsley 1-0 at Vicarage Road to take their points tally for the season to 94, which is enough to see off Brighton's challenge in third place and clinch automatic promotion. They join Newcastle as the second club to secure a spot in next year's Premier League, with Huddersfield still capable of joining them via the play-offs. Watford boss Jokanovic was quick to praise his players after they wrapped up promotion with a game to spare. "I am very happy for my players and for everybody who is involved with this club," he told BBC Radio 5 live. "We deserved this - it has been an amazing season for us. I think we have shown great personality, character and consistency." Jokanovic believes Watford's squad can make the transition to life in the top flight relatively easily, with the likes of Troy Deeney, Odion Ighalo and Matej Vydra having already experienced Premier League football. "We have a lot of players who are used to playing at this level," he added. "They have the experience and mentality and the quality to do well in the Premier League." Watford's win on Saturday was secured by captain Deeney, who fired home his 20th goal of the season just before half-time. He said: "It means everything (to get promoted). "The last time we did this was four years ago and it is very special to be part of a group that has managed to do this. We've worked really hard all year long and we deserve this." Deeney added: "We have some fantastic players here and I feel we are equipped to handle the challenge in the Premier League."
