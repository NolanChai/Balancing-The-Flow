ng difficulties into buying parts to make a petrol bomb, a court heard.
Kazi Islam, 18, persuaded his 19-year-old pal Harry Thomas, who has learning difficulties , that he was a spy for MI5 and then used text messages to persuade him to buy the materials to build an incendiary device, jurors at the Old Bailey were told.

Islam later sent him photos of the bomb he had built and encouraged him to set it off in public places such as supermarkets , parks or petrol stations, said prosecutor Michael Mallon QC. The Crown say Islam, who was 17 at the time, was planning a terror attack inspired by Isis , but his plans were foiled when Thomas went to police and told them about Islamâ€™s alleged plot.
