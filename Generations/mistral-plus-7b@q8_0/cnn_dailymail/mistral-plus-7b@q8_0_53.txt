26 days after he was found unconscious near his home in Lethbridge.

The trial of his killer heard how a group of children found him lying face down in some bushes and raised the alarm. He had a deep gash on his head and bruising to his body. It was initially thought that Lee's death could have been caused by a fall or an assault but no injuries were visible.

His killer, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told police that he was walking along with Lee when the boy slipped and fell. He said Lee struck his head on some rocks but denied playing any part in his injuries.

Police found inconsistencies in the 10-year-old's story after interviewing others who were with him at the time, the trial heard. One child told police that he saw Lee and the accused together before the younger boy was found.

He said he watched them walking along the street when the accused pushed Lee into some bushes. The 10-year-old then turned around and ran off while Lee lay motionless on the ground. Another friend of the 10-year-old told police that he went to a park with him after school that day.

He said they were playing outside when the accused picked up a rock and threw it at Lee's head. The boy then began to walk away but turned back to hit Lee again. The child who saw this described him as having an 'angry look in his eyes'.

Police searched Lee's clothes after his death and found a blood stain that matched the accused's DNA, CBC reported. They also recovered rocks from the scene of the assault which were consistent with those at the park where Lee was found.
