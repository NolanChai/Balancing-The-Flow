360 degree views of their surroundings during six spacewalks in April and May this year. The high definition video captured by their camera-equipped helmets is now available for viewing on Nasa’s website, where it can be explored using a mouse or finger. It is the first time 360 degree footage has been made publicly available of astronauts in space.

The videos are accompanied with commentary and explanatory graphics which allow viewers to understand what they are seeing and appreciate how challenging the work that the two men were undertaking was. “Everything we do out here is a challenge,” Virts said. “It’s a little bit like climbing up a mountain or going out for a hike, except in this case you have to carry your own oxygen with you at all times and make sure that your spacesuit doesn’t leak.”

The video below shows the view from an astronaut’s helmet as they walk around outside the International Space Station.
