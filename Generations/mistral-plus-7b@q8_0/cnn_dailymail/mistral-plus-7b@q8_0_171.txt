le Thomas, 20, said her partner, Matt Jones, 19, from Egham, Surrey, had taken a flight at the last minute after his original flight was overbooked. The couple were among 224 people killed when the Germanwings jet crashed in France on Tuesday. It later emerged that the co-pilot intentionally flew the plane into the side of the mountain and locked the captain out of the cockpit. Ms Thomas told BBC Newsbeat: ‘We were supposed to fly together but he went on a flight at the last minute because his was overbooked.’ She added she had not been in touch with anyone about the co-pilot’s role in the crash, and did not want to comment. The couple were due to take their first holiday together since starting their relationship, Ms Thomas said. ‘I don’t really know what to think at the moment, it is still raw,’ she said.
