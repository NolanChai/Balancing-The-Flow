al has been secretly struggling with postnatal depression.

Just 18 months earlier, Hannah had feared she would never become a mother again, having been left infertile by an explosion in Basra in November 2005. It was while trying to help rescue trapped Iraqi civilians that Hannah suffered the blast that destroyed her uterus and forced her to have her right leg amputated below the knee.

But after undergoing pioneering womb transplant surgery – the first such operation for a British servicewoman – she became pregnant with Lexi-River. She now hopes to raise awareness of the condition, which affects around one in 10 new mothers.

Hannah, 28, who lives in Newcastle, says: ‘I was so excited about becoming a mum again and had such high expectations for it that when I became depressed I just felt guilty.

‘But my husband Matt told me I wasn’t to blame. Postnatal depression is something that can happen to anyone.

‘It really has helped me talking about how I feel, rather than bottling up everything inside. Now I want to urge other mums who have postnatal depression not to be afraid of admitting they need help.’
