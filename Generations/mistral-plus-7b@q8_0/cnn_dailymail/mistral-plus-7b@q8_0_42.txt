, centre-back, central midfielder and winger.

The north London club have been linked with several goalkeepers, including Pepe Reina of Napoli, as they look for an upgrade on current No 1 Wojciech Szczesny. They are also in need of a centre-back to replace Thomas Vermaelen, who has joined Barcelona and are reportedly interested in Queens Park Rangers defender Rio Ferdinand.

Arsenal have signed Yaya Sanogo as a replacement for Marouane Chamakh but are yet to bring in a central midfielder. They could be on the lookout for someone who can play in the holding role after losing Alex Song. The Gunners have been linked with Lucas Biglia of Lazio.

Arsene Wenger has also expressed an interest in bringing in an attacker, as his side lost Theo Walcott to a cruciate ligament injury earlier this season and is expected to lose Robin van Persie at the end of the campaign.

Henry, who retired at the end of last season, told Sky Sports: "I think they need four or five players. They need a goalkeeper. They have just lost Thomas Vermaelen in defence. So they need a centre-back and also another centre-midfielder. In attack, with Van Persie possibly leaving, they definitely need one striker."
