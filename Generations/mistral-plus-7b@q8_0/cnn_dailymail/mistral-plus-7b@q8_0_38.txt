­Glasgow to attack Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond and to promise a “New Deal for Scotland” if he wins the general election next May.

The pledge came as a new opinion poll found that support for the SNP was at its highest level since it first gained representation in Westminster, with 46 per cent of Scots backing Nicola Sturgeon’s party and only 37 per cent supporting Labour. The poll put the Conservatives on 10 per cent and the Liberal Democrats on 8 per cent, with the Greens on 4 per cent.

Mr Miliband told an audience at Glasgow Caledonian University: “In 2015 there is a chance to change our politics, to rebuild Britain together. And I want that change to be powered by Scotland.”

He said he wanted to give the Scots devolved powers over income tax, pensions and social security as well as further powers over jobs and skills and public services like education, health and transport.

But the Labour leader rejected Mr Salmond’s call for more powers for Holyrood, saying he would not support “anything that smacks of independence by stealth”. He said: “We will give you what you want, not what they want.”

In his speech, Mr Miliband also attacked Scotland’s First Minister over his handling of the independence campaign and said he had run an “unfair” referendum. He added: “The SNP didn’t play by the rules in their campaign for independence. They talked about ‘Project Fear’, but their plan was about project division.”

Mr Miliband said the “best way to protect Scotland against cuts and protect the Scottish NHS is to vote Labour”.

But his speech came amid growing speculation that Scottish Labour could suffer serious losses in next year’s election. Polls suggest the party, which currently holds 41 of Scotland’s 59 Westminster seats, could lose as many as 20 constituencies.
