50-over tournament, has been drafted into the Test side in place of injured batsman Henry Nicholls.

New Zealand will host England for two Tests starting June 1st at Edgbaston in Birmingham. Guptill was not in the initial Test squad announced by the selectors. The right-hander, who has scored five centuries and six half-centuries in his previous 28 Test matches, last played a Test match in December 2017 against Pakistan in Abu Dhabi.

The 32-year-old is likely to play a key role for the Black Caps at the top of the order with Nicholls expected to be ruled out until July due to an injury suffered during the World Cup. Guptill is currently playing for Worcestershire in the County Championship and has scored four fifties so far this season.
