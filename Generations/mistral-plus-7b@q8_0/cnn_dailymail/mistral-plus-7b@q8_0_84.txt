Pacman received a huge gold Rolex watch from the lawyer who famously represented OJ Simpson during his murder trial back in the 1990s.

The gift was inscribed with ‘Manny Pacquiao’, ‘the only eight division world champion’ and ‘4/25/2015’.

Mayweather and Pacquiao will clash at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada on May 2 in a bout that could see both boxers earn upwards of $100m.

And it would appear that Shapiro has sided with the Filipino superstar as he recently tweeted: “I’ve always said Pacquiao was a great fighter… I hope Floyd doesn’t do to him what happened in the first De La Hoya fight.”
