1-0 defeat of Barcelona at Camp Nou.

According to reports in Spain, Chelsea have agreed a fee in excess of €40m (£29.6m, $48.5m) with the La Liga champions for his services and are already working on a deal to bring him to Stamford Bridge.

The Blues boss has been impressed by the Spanish international's performances and sees him as a long-term replacement for the likes of John Obi Mikel, who is nearing the end of his career at the club. Koke has already racked up over 100 La Liga appearances for Diego Simeone's side since joining the club in 2009.

Atletico Madrid are said to be reluctant to sell their star player and are determined to hold on to him for as long as possible, despite his £65m release clause. The club's sporting director Jesus Garcia Pitarch has admitted that there are a number of clubs interested in Koke but Atletico Madrid have no plans to sell him this summer.

"There is interest from some clubs," Garcia Pitarch said, as quoted by Sky Sports News. "But Koke is an important player for us and we don't want to lose any of our best players."

Chelsea are also keeping a close eye on Atletico Madrid star Arda Turan but the club's failure to seal his signing last summer means they will need to pay in excess of €40m if they are to make him a permanent transfer.
