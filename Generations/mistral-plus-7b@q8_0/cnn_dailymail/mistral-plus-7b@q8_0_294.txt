ianchi was wearing a wire on Wednesday when she approached Weinstein at his New York office.

She claimed to be a fan of his movies. Bianchi confronted Weinstein about groping her breasts during a business meeting two months earlier in March, according to the New York Post. He did not deny that he touched her, but told her: “I’m used to that”. “I’m sorry,” he also said at one point.

Weinstein’s lawyer said his client had offered Bianchi a job as an actress, but she was angry and confronted him in the hope of getting more money from him. He added: “He didn’t do anything to harm her.” The police department is considering charges against Weinstein.

Italian model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez told the New York Post that Weinstein grabbed her breasts during a business meeting on 25 March at his Tribeca office. She said the two had met and exchanged numbers, but when they met for their lunch appointment, he asked to go up to his office instead.

She alleges he then touched her breast and put his hand up her skirt. The 44-year-old producer denies groping Gutierrez. In a statement issued by Weinstein’s lawyer, he said the meeting was consensual. “There was never any physical contact between Mr Weinstein and Ambra Battilana. At no time did she suffer through any unwanted aggression or any act of forced sexual contact.”
