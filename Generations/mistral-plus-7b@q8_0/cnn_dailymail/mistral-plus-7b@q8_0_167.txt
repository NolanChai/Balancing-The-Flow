The pair clashed after Ms Bartholomew tweeted that she had been told by one butcher she couldn't get her preferred cut of meat due to religious reasons.
"I was trying to order some chicken legs tonight to cook for a #GameOfThrones dinner party but the butcher said they don't do chicken legs on Sundays because it is against their religion," Ms Bartholomew wrote.
But the owner of Woolloomooloo Butchery, who has asked not to be named, says he was simply following halal rules and that he told her they would only sell whole chickens.
"She came in at about 5:30pm on Sunday night and she wanted chicken legs, and I said to her 'I'm sorry, we only sell whole chooks or if you want cut up, it's $19 for a half chook and $38 for a full chook'," he told A Current Affair.
The butcher said Ms Bartholomew became angry when he told her they could not supply individual legs.
He claims she started swearing and was "very rude".
She has denied any confrontation with the butcher.
"I just asked for chicken legs, and I got told that he didn't have them today," she said.
"I wasn't angry at all ... He was very rude and condescending."
