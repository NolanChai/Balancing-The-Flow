### An Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto was forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland last night after an 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board.

The passenger, whose name has not been released, reportedly became violent and began screaming profanities at the other passengers. When her son attempted to calm her down, she became even more agitated and started to slap him across the face. The altercation was so intense that two crew members were forced to restrain the woman until the plane landed in Shannon.

When police boarded the aircraft, they arrested the woman for assaulting her son and causing a disturbance on an airplane. She is due to appear in court today to face those charges.
