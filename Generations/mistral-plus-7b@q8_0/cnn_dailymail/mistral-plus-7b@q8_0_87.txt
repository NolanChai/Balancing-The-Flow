from your own home with virtual tours.

Holiday platform TUI has launched an online portal which allows you to take virtual tours of destinations around the world. Using interactive panoramic imagery and videos, you can explore the likes of Iceland, Germany, South Africa, Oman, Abu Dhabi, Italy, Egypt, Peru, the USA, Croatia and Turkey.

The company has said they have worked closely with destination partners to create content which allows them to "capture all angles of each place, from street views to aerial footage". The tours were shot using 360-degree cameras or drones.

TUI UK & Ireland CEO Andrew Flintham said: “We want to inspire our customers by showing the breadth and diversity of destinations across the globe. Using technology in this way gives us another tool to help holidaymakers who are thinking about their next trip to experience more than just the beach, or the hotel pool.

“We hope people will use these virtual tours to discover new places, find inspiration for their next break, and to share with friends and family.”

The launch of the portal follows the news that TUI has suspended all holidays until June 12 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
