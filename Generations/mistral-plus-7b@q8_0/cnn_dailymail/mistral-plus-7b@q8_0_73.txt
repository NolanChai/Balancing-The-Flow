Hayleigh McBain, 15, from Elgin in Morayshire, Scotland, claimed she had decided to end their three month relationship in a text message. She said: “I know we’ve been together for quite a while but I just think that we would be better off as friends.”

She added: “We need time apart to grow and mature on our own.” However, her prank soon backfired when her boyfriend David Clarke decided he had had enough of Hayleigh and ended the relationship himself. He said: “It was an April Fool’s joke but I’m not joking about it now.

“I just couldn’t take it anymore. We have been together for a long time, but the jokes she has pulled on me lately just went too far.”
