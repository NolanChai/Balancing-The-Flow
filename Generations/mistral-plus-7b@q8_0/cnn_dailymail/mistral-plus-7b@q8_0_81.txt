demeanor charge of solicitation and released on bail, police spokeswoman Sgt Kerry Lemieux said. He resigned later in the day as a senior staffer in Ayotte's New Hampshire office. "This matter is deeply disappointing and Mr Wihby has apologised to me for his actions," Ayotte, a Republican from New Hampshire, said in a statement. "While I am very disappointed that he failed to live up to the standards of conduct appropriate for someone serving on my staff, I accept his resignation." Ayotte's office did not immediately provide details of Wihby's resignation. The senator is running for re-election this November. Nashua police said they arrested Wihby after an undercover officer responded to a solicitation for prostitution on Backpage.com. Lemieux said the arrest was part of an ongoing investigation into human trafficking. No one answered at a telephone number listed for Wihby in Derry, New Hampshire, where he lives. He is due to appear in Nashua District Court on September 28.
