Scientists fed mice an experimental diet that included peanuts. The mice that consumed them were shown to have a more diverse range of bacteria in their guts than those that did not. They were also less likely to develop E. coli bacteria, which can cause severe food poisoning.

In particular, the rodents who ate the peanuts appeared to be better protected against pathogenic bacteria than mice fed on a diet without them. This was because they had higher levels of lactobacillus plantarum, a species of probiotic bacteria that is known to help prevent illness.

Previous studies have also shown that the bacteria can help treat stomach ulcers and reduce symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Probiotics are believed to improve digestion by improving gut health. They do this by promoting the growth of ‘good’ bacteria in your intestine. These probiotics can be consumed via foods like yogurt or supplements.

In the study, the researchers fed mice a diet that included 12 per cent peanuts for five weeks. Those that ate them were found to have higher levels of lactobacillus plantarum than those who didn’t. They also had reduced levels of Escherichia coli (E.coli) in their guts.

The research, published in the journal Frontiers In Microbiology, suggests that a diet including peanuts could help improve gut health and reduce risk of illness caused by E.coli bacteria.
