vin was pronounced dead Wednesday morning, two days after an unidentified SEAL died of a traumatic brain injury from the incident.

Marvin joined the Navy in December 2007 and served several deployments as a SEAL, Lloyd said. His awards include a Bronze Star for valor, which was awarded for actions in Afghanistan in September 2015.

The training accident is still under investigation, but officials have said both SEALs were at Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek on the Virginia coast.
