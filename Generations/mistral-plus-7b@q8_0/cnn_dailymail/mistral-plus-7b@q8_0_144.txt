ite called Jhiri Mela spend hours at a time sitting, standing or even lying down on top of burning charcoal embers, while some roll around in the fire to ensure their skin is covered by soot and ash. The participants, many of whom are from impoverished farming villages, believe that the practice will bring them good fortune for the coming year. It's just one of the strange rituals observed during Jhiri Mela in West Bengal, where revellers also burn old clothes or items they no longer need and take part in other strange rituals that are meant to symbolically wipe away their past sins and misfortunes.
