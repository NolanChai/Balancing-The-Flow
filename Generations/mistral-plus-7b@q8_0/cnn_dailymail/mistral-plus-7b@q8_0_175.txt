sh pair didn't have much time to enjoy the new-found fame as they were too busy raising money for a worthwhile cause.

On Wednesday night, the two friends took part in a fundraising event in Dublin's Whelan's venue for Irish children's cancer charity Barretstown. Niamh and Karen both wore matching outfits as part of a stunt that got people talking about their striking resemblance and helped raise funds for the deserving cause.

Karen shared this photo on Twitter after the event, writing: "We did it! Thanks so much to everyone who came along tonight and supported us in raising awareness for @Barretstown."

The girls had asked people to donate â‚¬10 by tweeting them a selfie with their #NiamhKaren. Karen also posted a photo of the two of them together, writing: "Thank you so much to everyone who has donated today and supported us in raising awareness for @Barretstown. We are very touched."

The charity is especially close to Niamh's heart as her daughter Lucy has been going there since she was diagnosed with neuroblastoma at the age of 21 months.
