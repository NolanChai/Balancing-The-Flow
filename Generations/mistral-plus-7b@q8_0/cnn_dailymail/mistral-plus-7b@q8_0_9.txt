The girl, who is a student at an all-girls school in New Delhi, was left heartbroken and scared after her family said she would have to marry an older man.

In a plea for help to her teacher, she wrote: “Dear Sir, I am writing this letter to you because I need your help. You are the only one who can save me from this evil fate which is awaiting me.”

She described how she had been locked in her room at night and that her parents had been ignoring her pleas for them to stop her wedding. “I feel so scared every time my family members talk about my marriage,” she wrote.

The girl said her teacher had given her advice in the past, such as teaching her English or how to play the guitar, and that she knew he would understand her situation.

She also expressed hope that by sharing her story, she could raise awareness of the issue of child marriage and inspire others facing similar situations to stand up for themselves.

The letter was shared on social media, where it quickly gained traction. Many people praised the girl for her bravery in speaking out about such a difficult situation, and called for greater action to be taken to prevent child marriage in India.

It is estimated that every year over 20 million children worldwide are married before their 18th birthday, with child marriage being particularly common in South Asia and Africa. In India, the practice is especially prevalent among girls from low-income families who may be married off as young as eight years old.

Child marriage has been linked to a range of negative outcomes for girls including poor health, increased risk of violence, lack of education opportunities, and lack of economic security later in life. It is therefore essential that we take action to end this practice by raising awareness about the issue and providing support services for those affected.
