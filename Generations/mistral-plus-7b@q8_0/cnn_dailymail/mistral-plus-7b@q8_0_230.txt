, they remain an impossible dream. But one man is trying to change that – by building a free theme park for underprivileged children.

Sajjad Ahmed, 40, is on a mission to make his home town of Karachi the "happiest city in the world," with his newly created free theme park, 'Joyland'. Joyland sits in an area that would usually be reserved for Pakistan's wealthy elite.

But Ahmed has created this park solely for underprivileged children – allowing them to enjoy the fun and excitement of a traditional amusement park without spending any money. The park is divided into four sections – Adventureland, Family Land, Waterland and Funland. There are rollercoasters, carousels, merry-go-rounds, bumper cars, pirate ships, water slides and other fun rides.

Ahmed created Joyland through a partnership with the local government and a private firm. He funded most of it himself, but he also received some donations from friends and supporters. He said he built the park to provide joy and happiness for children who would otherwise not have access to such facilities. "We want to bring happiness to our underprivileged children. The poor should be able to experience this kind of joy as much as any child," Ahmed told BBC News.

Ahmed is hoping that Joyland will become a place where all children can come together and enjoy themselves regardless of their background or economic situation. He is also keen for other businesses in Karachi to follow his lead and provide free access to entertainment for underprivileged children across the city.
