surfaced showing the officer firing several rounds at Walter Scott as he ran away, according to local law enforcement authorities.

The shooting comes on the heels of the fatal shooting of another unarmed black man in a traffic stop with a white police officer in McKinney, Texas. The police-involved killing of Michael Brown by a white officer last year ignited a national conversation about racial profiling and policing tactics.

Six months later, the issue remains raw in some communities across the United States. We asked for your thoughts on what can be done to prevent similar deaths in the future and this is what you said:

## Better training is needed

“Police are trained to act before they think. I think better training should help. Police officers need de-escalation skills. They need more time in the community getting to know people. There needs to be a better understanding of how to de-escalate situations with unarmed civilians.” — Marisol Cruz, 31, Seattle

“Police need better training, and they also need to have some empathy and respect for their fellow citizens. They are the ones in charge, but it doesn’t mean they should treat people as if they don’t matter.” — Lorena Salinas, 29, Dallas

## More accountability is needed

“There needs to be more accountability for these types of incidents. Police officers who use excessive force against citizens need to pay the consequences for their actions.” — Shawn Moss, 35, Fort Wayne, Indiana

“The police need better training and supervision. They also need more accountability when they abuse their power. Their actions should be investigated whenever a shooting happens, not just in a few of the high-profile cases that make national news.” — Kevin McCarthy, 29, Atlanta

## Communities need to come together

“We all need to work together as one community. If everyone works together and treats each other with respect then things like this wouldn’t happen. Police officers should be trained to de-escalate situations rather than just reacting. The entire situation could have been avoided if the police officer would have kept his cool.” — Dustin Hankins, 29, Dayton, Ohio
