The win was Phelpsâ€™ first since winning the same event at the Arena Grand Prix in Austin last August. The 28-year-old will be competing on home soil for the next two weeks as the US hosts the 15th FINA World Championships in Barcelona, Spain from July 29 to August 4. Phelps is expected to compete in six events, including a possible defence of his Olympic titles in the individual medley and butterfly races, although he has not yet confirmed his participation.
