asty decisions when it came to coaching staff and national selectors but there is no question he could have done with some more support.

There were times, most notably after the 5-0 Ashes defeat in Australia last winter, that you got a sense of how isolated he felt within cricket’s corridors of power. The criticism was so intense that it became too much for Downton to bear and a parting of ways seemed inevitable.

Downton’s biggest failing was that his approach lacked guile. He is not the kind of man to lie awake at night plotting against his opponents or his detractors and when push came to shove he appeared unwilling to take on those who were undermining him. In fact, it might have been more useful if he had taken a leaf out of former ICC chief executive Dave Richardson’s book and adopted a more ruthless approach towards those who threatened the integrity of his role.

That is not to say that Downton was not passionate about English cricket or did not work hard on its behalf but, unfortunately for him, he appeared too often to be out of his depth in such a high-pressure job. It’s difficult not to feel sorry for him when you consider how much he put into the role but he was never going to survive long enough to oversee the rebuilding process that lies ahead.

He might have made mistakes along the way and lacked the political nous to keep his enemies on side, but there is no question Downton gave it everything and deserves credit for trying. The ECB board would be wise to ensure that those who replace him are given sufficient backing and support in order to prevent another situation like this from arising again.
