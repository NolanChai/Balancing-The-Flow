wave of hyperbolic language’ in schools. The slogan ‘Reach for the Stars’ is used by many academies and charities working with disadvantaged children. However, Mr Hendrick said: “There are few things that could be more damaging than encouraging a student to reach for the stars. It is hyperbole at its worst, suggesting impossible dreams.” He went on to say that this type of slogan reinforces unrealistic expectations and can lead to low self-esteem in pupils who struggle to achieve their goals. Instead of focusing on reaching for the stars, Mr Hendrick suggests schools should encourage pupils to ‘learn from mistakes’, as well as celebrating small successes along the way.

Comment: Is this just a case of too many people in education trying to be cool? I don’t think anyone is saying that students should really ‘reach for the stars’ or that this is a sensible ambition for any child. As always, context is important. Slip into a discussion on university applications with Year 13 and you might well hear some mention of Oxford or Cambridge, but these are ambitious choices. The point is that if students are not encouraged to think big then they will never attempt anything. It’s part of our role as educators to help our students dream big dreams and help them achieve them. If we lower the bar for our young people then they’ll probably set their sights low, too.
