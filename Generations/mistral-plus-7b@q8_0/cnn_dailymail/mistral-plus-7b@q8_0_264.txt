Trevor and Tyler Eason are home-schooled by their parents in the US state of North Carolina. Their grandfather served in Korea and Vietnam and passed his passion for naval history onto them. The boys even had a ship named after them at their local Naval Museum in Wilmington, called TS Tyler & TS Trevor.

After reading about Harding, who was still living in a nursing home and serving as the oldest living Navy veteran in North Carolina, they knew they had to meet him. They wrote him letters explaining why they admired him so much and after receiving no reply they took matters into their own hands and visited him.

Harding was stunned by how polite and kind the boys were and has since become very close with them. Their first meeting resulted in the boys bringing Harding to a parade, and since then they've met up multiple times - sometimes twice a month. The boys even invited him to their birthday parties.

"We just wanted him to know we appreciate all he did for our country," Trevor said. "I didnâ€™t want any other veterans to be forgotten."
