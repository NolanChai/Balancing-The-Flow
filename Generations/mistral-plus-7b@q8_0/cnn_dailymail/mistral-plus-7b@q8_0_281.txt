unting Stuart Williams to leg for one.

It was only his fourth ton since becoming England skipper, though he had scored hundreds against every major Test-playing nation before taking over the captaincy in December last year.

The former Essex skipper has endured a lean run of form since leading his country to a 2-0 series win at home to India last summer. He made just 146 runs during a tour of Australia, which included two half centuries and five ducks, and managed just 53 runs in the home series against Sri Lanka, including two single figure scores.

However, he started this tour on a positive note by reaching three figures at Sabina Park after taking 127 balls to reach his fifty. Cook was eventually dismissed for 108 as England were bowled out for 243 with more than an hour remaining in the day.
