y walk 200m can now walk a mile after being caught trying to use his disabled parking bay.

Paul Gregory, 51, of Bedford, has been fined £795 for having a blue badge and claiming that he was severely disabled when in fact he enjoyed walking long distances. Mr Gregory, who lives on the third floor of an apartment building in Kempston Road, claimed his disability meant he could only walk 200 metres. However Bedfordshire Police discovered he was a keen walker and often walked for over a mile to visit his friends and family.

He appeared at Luton Magistrates Court on Wednesday (May 18) where he pleaded guilty of possessing a disabled parking badge without reasonable excuse, an offence under Section 4 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970. The court heard that Mr Gregory has been issued with blue badges for both his wife and himself over several years.

They had initially been granted to help him as he was unable to walk more than 200 metres. However Bedfordshire Police received information from a member of the public who believed Mr Gregory could walk further than this distance, and that he was often seen walking between his home and nearby shops. As a result officers conducted a number of test walks with him. They found on most occasions he walked more than 500 metres.

When challenged, Mr Gregory admitted his badges should have been surrendered to prevent fraud, and agreed to hand them back. He was ordered to pay £795 in fines and costs at the court hearing. Inspector Mike Clements, from the Bedfordshire Police Operational Support Team, said: “This conviction shows that we will continue to investigate suspected blue badge abuse whenever evidence is available, and I would like to thank the person who provided us with information about Mr Gregory’s walking habits.

“Blue badges are an important part of our infrastructure for those who genuinely need them. Those who obtain a disabled parking badge by deception will face prosecution.”
