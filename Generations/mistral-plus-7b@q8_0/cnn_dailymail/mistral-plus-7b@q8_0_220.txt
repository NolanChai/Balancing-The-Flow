coastguard officer Salah Mejri is being hunted by Italian police for allegedly abandoning hundreds of refugees on a sinking ship last month.

It comes after he was seen arriving back at his base in Zarzis, near Monastir in Tunisia, amid reports the migrant trafficking ring had paid him to sail their boat out to sea. According to Italian prosecutors, Mr Mejri is accused of abandoning 900 refugees on a sinking ship on October 3 before it capsized and sank off the coast of Lampedusa.
