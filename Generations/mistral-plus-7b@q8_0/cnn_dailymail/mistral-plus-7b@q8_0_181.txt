replace them.

First there was Fernando Torres, now David Villa. In both cases it’s a great replacement.

Villa is on loan for a season with the option of a permanent transfer after that. He can bring goals to Atletico and he will help make up for the loss of Torres.

“David Villa is a world star. I think he was one of the best players in the last World Cup,” said Atletico coach Diego Simeone. “He brings great experience, a great mentality and his personality fits perfectly with that of our group.”

Villa is 31-years old but his work rate will suit Simeone’s hard pressing style of play. He knows the Premier League having played for Barcelona so he won’t take long to adapt to Spanish football. The only question mark is his fitness, which has been a problem for him in recent seasons.

“I want to enjoy and give my best as I know how. I will give everything to succeed,” said Villa. “The most important thing is to be happy and I am very happy with Atletico Madrid.”
