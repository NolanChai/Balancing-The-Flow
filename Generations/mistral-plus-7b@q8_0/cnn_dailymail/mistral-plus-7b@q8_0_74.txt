The move was part of an ongoing campaign by both sets of fans who have complained about escalating prices for top-flight football. The Liverpool fans’ group Spirit of Shankly has been working closely with Arsenal supporters, who have had similar problems over rising ticket costs at the Emirates.

They have called on both clubs to cut ticket prices by 30 per cent – a move that they say would benefit all fans attending matches in England’s top flight.
