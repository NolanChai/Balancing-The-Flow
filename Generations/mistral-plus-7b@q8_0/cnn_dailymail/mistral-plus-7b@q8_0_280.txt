ian themed mansion is said to have been rented out for two years by a stripper training company called Pole Motion. Neighbors who live near the gated community of Windsor Estates in Jacksonville, Florida say they knew there was something suspicious going on next door, but had no idea what. They told local TV station WJXT that loud parties and music playing late into the night were constant occurrences over the past two years, however it wasn't until a neighbor noticed the word 'pole dancing' scrawled in chalk outside their home that they began to suspect that something untoward was happening.

The neighbor called the police to complain and when officers arrived they found women inside the mansion engaged in an array of exotic dance activities. They also discovered that the pole dancing lessons were being used as a cover for prostitution. 34-year-old stripper training company owner Heather Lara was arrested on suspicion of racketeering, promoting prostitution and running a house of prostitution. She is currently out on bail.
