corpse was wrapped in cloth and contained two other objects: a bottle and a wooden bowl. The mummified body, which was taken to the archaeological museum of Chiclayo for further investigation, is believed to have come from an Incan royal tomb. An archaeologist said that it showed “great preservation” and appeared to belong to a young woman with long black hair.
