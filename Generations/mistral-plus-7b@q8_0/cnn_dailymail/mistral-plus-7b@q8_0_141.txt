his unhealthy diet put under the microscope after admitting to having been so obsessed with junk food that he once ate three 20-piece boxes of chicken nuggets in one sitting.

The nine-time Olympic champion, who holds the world record for 100m and 200m events, said: “I have eaten some really unhealthy food, like Pringles crisps, KFC hot wings, lots of chicken nuggets. I once ate three boxes in one sitting.” He also admitted to eating a whole pint of Guinness during one race, which he described as a ‘bad idea’.

Bolt has not always been so open about his dietary choices, and recently told The Guardian that he does not like to talk about it because he doesn’t want to influence young athletes. However, the Jamaican sprinter has also made some positive changes to his eating habits in recent years. He has cut down on the junk food and increased his intake of protein, fruits and vegetables.

The 31-year-old has also been trying to eat more healthily by swapping out unhealthy snacks for fruits and vegetables. Bolt said: “I’ve definitely made changes to my diet over the last couple of years. I used to eat a lot of junk food, but now I try to focus on eating more protein and fruits and vegetables.”

Bolt has also started taking supplements and making sure that he drinks plenty of water throughout the day in order to ensure that his body is properly hydrated. The Jamaican sprinter hopes that by eating better and drinking more water, he will be able to continue to perform at his best for many years to come.
