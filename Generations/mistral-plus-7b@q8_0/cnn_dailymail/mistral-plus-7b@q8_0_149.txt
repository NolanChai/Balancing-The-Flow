uck into the Good Book and see what all the fuss is about.

I am not a biblical scholar, nor do I aspire to be one, but it seems to me that if you call yourself a Christian (as I do), you should probably read your Bible at least once in your lifetime.

So this week, I decided to start with Genesis. The first book of the Old Testament. It's only 50 chapters long and I thought I could get through it in five days. Here are some thoughts on my journey:

Genesis starts off well -- God creates a bunch of beautiful things like birds, animals, trees and oceans. But then he created humans... who aren't so great. Genesis 1:31 says that God looked at his creation and saw that it was good. Except for the people he just made.

"God saw all that he had made, and it was very good," the text reads, "but there was still something missing." So God makes Adam to be a companion for Eve, but things don't work out so well between them. First of all, she eats an apple (that was supposedly given to her by the devil) and then they both get kicked out of Eden. Not good at all.

The Bible goes on to tell us about Cain and Abel -- the first two people in the world who don't seem to get along very well. It ends with Cain murdering his brother for no apparent reason. What a way to start humanity!

It makes me wonder how we got from there to the Golden Rule: "Treat others as you would like to be treated." I guess it was through some pretty dark times -- wars, genocides, and all sorts of other horrors. But in spite of all that, people still have a tendency to try to do right by each other. Maybe God saw something good in us after all.
