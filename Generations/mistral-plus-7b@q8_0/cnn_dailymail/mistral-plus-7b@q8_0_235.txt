420 dispensary is booming.

Impey opened 420 dispensary in Culver City three years ago after seeing how cannabis helped his father, who had a debilitating motor neuron disease, to live longer and more comfortably than he would have otherwise. He also knew many others with chronic pain and anxiety who found relief through marijuana.

"I realized that people are in so much pain," says Impey. "They need help and cannabis is something that can really make a difference. I had to do something about it."
