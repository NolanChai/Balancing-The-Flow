10-point lead at the top of the table and put their Premier League title back in their own hands.

However, Rangers manager Ramsey believes QPR must concentrate on their own game and try to take something from the game against the leaders. The west London club have been hit with an injury crisis in recent weeks, but are desperate for three points as they battle to avoid relegation to the Championship. And Ramsey is keen for his side to grab the opportunity to cause an upset at Loftus Road.

"It is more important to us than it is them," he said. "They need to win the game, but if we get a result then it will make our lives much easier. It would be a massive boost for the club and the fans, so all of our focus and attention has gone into preparing for this game."

Rangers go into Sunday's match on the back of an impressive 2-1 win at Manchester City, where they took advantage of Yaya Toure's red card to beat Manuel Pellegrini's side. And Ramsey believes his players have to reproduce that kind of performance against Chelsea in order to secure a vital three points.

"We did not expect to get anything out of the game at Manchester City, but the lads performed brilliantly and produced one of their best performances in a long time," he said. "They will need that sort of display on Sunday if they are going to have any chance of getting something against Chelsea."
