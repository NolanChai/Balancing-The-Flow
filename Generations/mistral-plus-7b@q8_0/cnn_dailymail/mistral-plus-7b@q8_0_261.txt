icetag on the World Cup-winning keeper.

Louis van Gaal is keen to bolster his squad after watching David de Gea's future at Old Trafford go up in smoke, and he has identified Lloris as a potential replacement for the Spain international.

With De Gea's exit becoming increasingly likely, United have made Lloris their top target - but they fear Levy will use it to his advantage by demanding big money from any interested party.

Spurs are not willing to cash in on the France international and plan to offer him a bumper new deal to ward off interest. Lloris has three years left on his current contract at White Hart Lane and Levy wants him to commit his future to Tottenham by signing an extension that would increase his weekly wages to Â£140,000.

And even if Spurs were prepared to listen to offers for their star man - they will not want to see him move to United or Manchester City - Van Gaal may struggle to meet Tottenham's valuation of the keeper. Lloris has been linked with a number of Europe's biggest clubs in recent weeks, including Real Madrid, Chelsea and Arsenal, but his representatives have insisted he is happy at White Hart Lane.
