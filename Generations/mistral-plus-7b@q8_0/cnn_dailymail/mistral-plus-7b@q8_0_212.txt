, cola bottles and gummy bears - will be served at the halal-only stalls. The move comes after Morrisons received requests for a separate pick and mix counter following feedback from customers on social media.

The company says it has already rolled out 50 halal-only counters in its stores around the UK. Halal-certified sweets have been identified by the halal logo, which is on each packet of sweets at the new pick and mix counters. It is the latest move from Morrisons to provide more choice for its Muslim customers. In July last year the supermarket unveiled a separate meat section in some stores offering halal-certified products. The store also introduced Halal-only sections in 50 of its butcher's shops, as well as introducing Halal chicken and lamb to other sections.
