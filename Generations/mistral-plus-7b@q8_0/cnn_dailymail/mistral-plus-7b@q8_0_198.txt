The security agency, which monitors potential threats to national security, is worried that disillusioned or mentally ill staff could deliberately cause an accident at a British nuclear power plant, airport or on public transport. The concern was heightened by the Germanwings crash of Flight 9525 in the French Alps on Tuesday when co-pilot Andreas Lubitz purposely crashed the plane into a mountainside.

A senior security source said: “There has always been a risk that disgruntled or mentally ill staff could deliberately cause an accident at a nuclear power plant, airport or other high risk infrastructure site in order to kill themselves and others.” He added that the risks had not increased but the alert had been issued to make all security agencies aware of the threat.

The National Counter Terrorism Security Office (Nactso), which is responsible for protecting critical national infrastructure, has issued new advice to its members on the need to screen employees to ensure there are no potential security threats. This includes not just the possibility that a member of staff could have extremist beliefs or connections but also that they might suffer from mental illness and be a danger to themselves and others.

Nactso has written to chief executives at nuclear power stations, airports, oil refineries and other potential targets with advice on how to carry out vetting and screening procedures for employees.

The letter warns of the potential threat from “a disgruntled employee or contractor who deliberately causes an accident in order to kill themselves”.

A Nactso spokeswoman said: “Nactso is always working closely with critical national infrastructure organisations, and in light of recent events we have written to all organisations, offering advice on vetting and screening employees.” She declined to comment on whether there had been any previous incidents.
