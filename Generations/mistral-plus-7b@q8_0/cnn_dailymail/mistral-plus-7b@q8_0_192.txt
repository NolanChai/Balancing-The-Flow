An artist has carved out a unique genre for herself with her colourful portraits of celebrity bottoms.
Spanish artist Catalina Viejo, 31, who is based in New York, paints miniature pictures from candy and sprinkles on gum paste.
She has created some well-known celebrities in the flesh, including Britney Spears, Nicki Minaj, Lady Gaga, and Kim Kardashian. The artist has also worked on the butts of stars like Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce, and Khloe Kardashian.
Her pieces have been shown at art fairs all around the world, including Art Basel Miami.
The idea to make celebrity bottoms came after Viejo saw a portrait of Britney Spearsâ€™ buttocks, which she felt was too flat and lifeless. She wanted to create something that would be more fun, bright, and unique.
