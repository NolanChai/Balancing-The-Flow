is Jankus, 23, who had been sentenced to six years for his role in the murders, applied for asylum when he arrived at Gatwick airport on July 17, 2012.

But his bid was turned down and he was ordered to leave Britain last month under a European Arrest Warrant.

In an attempt to avoid returning home Jankus claimed he had depression and would not be able to cope with life in Lithuania after being locked up for six years. But despite his pleas for compassion, the Home Office yesterday ordered him on board a plane.

A spokesman said: “He was given the opportunity to leave voluntarily but refused. He was then escorted onto a flight and removed from the country.

“We do not routinely provide details of individual cases, however there are strict safeguards in place for anyone with a mental illness or disorder who is facing deportation.”
