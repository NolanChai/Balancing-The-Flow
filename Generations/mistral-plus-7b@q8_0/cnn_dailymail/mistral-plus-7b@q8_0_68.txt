battle.

But who are the most at risk of being involved in a fight against the drop? We have ranked them using their points tally and goal difference to produce an expected league position table based on current form, then compared that with their actual position.

19 – Sunderland (2)

Sunderland are the most likely team to go down according to this system, but it’s important to note that they have only one point fewer than Swansea in 17th. The Black Cats have an expected points tally of 26.3 points with a goal difference of -9, which would see them 15th on the table, so the fight against relegation is not over for them just yet.

18 – Swansea City (17)

Swansea’s expected league position is 16th and their actual position is one better than that. They are also in a decent run of form having taken seven points from their last four games, but with Norwich and Crystal Palace to come they need to keep that up if they are going to stay out of the bottom three.

17 – Southampton (20)

Southampton have struggled since the New Year with just one win in eight league games, but an upturn in form could see them survive. They are currently expected to finish 18th with a points tally of 30 and goal difference of -4. However their position on the table at present is four places better than that, meaning they are three points clear of danger.

16 – Newcastle (21)

Newcastle’s form has been patchy since the turn of the year with just one win in eight Premier League games. They currently sit two points above the relegation zone and are expected to finish 19th with an expected points total of 30.8 and a goal difference of -1.

15 – Crystal Palace (19)

Crystal Palace’s form in recent weeks has been impressive and they look like one of the teams most likely to stay up at this stage of the season. They are expected to finish 16th with an expected points tally of 34.2 and a goal difference of -5, which is three places higher than their current league position on the table.
