The employee told police that she thought she had been pranked at first and did not even realise what had happened until she returned to the staff room, where one of her colleagues had noticed a white substance floating on the surface of her coffee. Maahs reportedly called 911 after finding out what had happened to her drink as it was 'a violation of her body'.

After being taken to hospital for examination and treatment, the victim decided to press charges against Lind, who claimed he did not mean for his semen to end up in Maahs' coffee. Police later found Lind's DNA on a plastic container that had been placed over the lid of the coffee cup. A second test found that the white substance on the surface of Maahs' drink was indeed sperm.
