­egg on record – a mere 10mm in size.

It’s smaller than any other documented before, but it looks more like an odd-shaped piece of dirt. The egg, which is about half the diameter of a £1 coin, was produced by Shannon and her family’s hens at their home in Belfast. Her mum Lynn said: ‘Shannon brought one of them back into the house as a surprise for us. We were all so impressed when we saw it.’ The egg is thought to be only the 15th documented case of such a small egg being laid, with the smallest previously recorded being less than 20mm long.
