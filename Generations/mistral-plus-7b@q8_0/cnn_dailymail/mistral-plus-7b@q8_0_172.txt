29 years old. He’s currently being held on $1 million bond for the murder of Tammy Jo Blanton, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.

He was indicted Tuesday on two counts of rape and a count of criminal deviate conduct, according to court documents. Oberhansley is accused of entering into Blanton’s residence uninvited on September 11, then stabbing her multiple times before removing some of her organs, prosecutors say.

They allege that he sexually assaulted her after killing and dismembering her. The court documents don’t detail the allegations further than this. Blanton was found dead in her Jeffersonville home on September 12. She had been stabbed 59 times. Oberhansley, who used to live with his ex-girlfriend, was arrested after he was spotted near her home. He had fresh cuts on him. The suspect claimed that the couple had a fight and he accidentally killed Blanton, authorities said. Prosecutors claim otherwise.

“She was brutally murdered,” Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull said during a bond hearing last month. “He stabbed her 59 times with a knife. He cut out parts of her body.” Oberhansley’s next court date is September 23, according to court documents. He remains jailed on $1 million bond.
