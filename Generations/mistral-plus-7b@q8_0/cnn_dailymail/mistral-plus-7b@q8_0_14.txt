he unveils the Tories’ radical new plan to cut them.

The Prime Minister is set to insist that hard-working families deserve ‘a break’ from crippling red tape, taxes and regulation.

He will declare: ‘If you believe in low taxes, as I do, it's because you also believe in something bigger – that our taxes are paid for public services, that they pay for the things we love, they help people with their needs and most importantly, they give everybody a fair crack of the whip.

‘Because if there is one thing that is immoral, it is when hard-working families don't get a break.'
