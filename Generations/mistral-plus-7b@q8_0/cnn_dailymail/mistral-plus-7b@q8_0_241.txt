ers with a groin problem but, after working hard to return in time for the game at Old Trafford, is available to face the champions.

"Robin van Persie came through training yesterday and today," said Sir Alex Ferguson. "He will be involved on Sunday."

The manager's comments are a stark contrast from last weekend when he had declared Van Persie unlikely to be fit for the clash against City. The Dutchman has been struggling with a groin strain, which kept him out of United's Europa League win against Braga and also meant that he was unable to play a part in their 2-0 victory at Stoke on Saturday.

Van Persie has scored four goals since joining the club in August but has not been able to replicate his goalscoring feats for Arsenal last season, where he managed 30 in all competitions. Injury problems have affected his time at United so far and he only recently returned from a layoff of six weeks due to an ankle injury.
