are as wealthy and successful as Lauda is it is easy to forget that he cheated death twice during his illustrious career. First when he survived an appalling crash at the 1976 German Grand Prix at Nurburgring, then when a fire destroyed his car at the 1977 Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort.

The man is still as tough and as fearless as ever. He can also be funny too, a trait which he showed during the recent opening of the new F1 headquarters in central London. Lauda was asked what he thought about Lewis Hamilton’s move from McLaren to Mercedes. His reply was: “I hope they do not make any mistakes – or else I will have to kick some ass.”
