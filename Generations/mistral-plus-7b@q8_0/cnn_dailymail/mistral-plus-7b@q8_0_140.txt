2-1, but he will be most proud of the way his team rallied in front of 23,481 at Anfield after falling behind to Danny Graham’s 59th-minute opener.

Liverpool went into the game knowing a victory would be a fitting tribute to Steven Gerrard on the captain’s final home appearance before moving to LA Galaxy this summer, but it was Henderson who was the driving force in seeing off their Championship opponents.

The midfielder made 105 passes throughout the match and contributed two vital tackles – including an important clearance from a Graham effort at 2-1 – as Blackburn rallied in stoppage time.

Henderson also completed more sprints than any other player on the pitch, and even after the final whistle he could be found urging his team-mates on as they celebrated their victory in front of the Kop. He is a true leader who deserves to follow in Gerrard’s footsteps, but Coutinho was also superb on an evening where his talent shone through once again.

The Brazilian scored both of Liverpool’s goals and provided an assist for Adam Lallana. With his confidence growing by the game, he will be even more pivotal in Brendan Rodgers’ side next season as they look to kick on after securing a Champions League spot.
