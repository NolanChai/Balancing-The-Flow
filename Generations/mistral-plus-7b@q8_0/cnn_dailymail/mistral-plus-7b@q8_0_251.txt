idi after posting a surety bond for Rs 500,000 (Â£4,379).

According to The Express Tribune, Lakhvi was released from his detention on Tuesday evening. However, he has been ordered not to leave Pakistan without the permission of the court.

He is alleged to have played a key role in planning and organising the November 2008 attack which targeted tourist attractions across Mumbai. He also allegedly played a part in recruiting and training members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, the militant group accused of carrying out the assault.

In January this year, Pakistan's interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan revealed that Lakhvi would be released from prison on bail as he was entitled to do so under Pakistani law. The decision was met with fierce criticism, including by India, which called for his continued detention.
