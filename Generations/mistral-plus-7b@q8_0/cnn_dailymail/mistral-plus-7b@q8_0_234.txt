osed with chlorine.

The action by Waverley council, in an attempt to tackle the spread of Covid-19, comes just days after a Sydney woman contracted coronavirus despite being triple-vaccinated. The woman, who had been swimming at Bondi Icebergs and other local beaches in recent weeks, has since become NSW’s first reinfection of Covid-19.

While the closure of pools was not part of the lockdown announcement on Thursday morning, council bosses took it upon themselves to disinfect their own facilities.

“Due to concerns raised by NSW Health that Covid-19 can spread in chlorinated water, and after consultation with the operator Icebergs, Waverley Council is closing the Bondi Iceberg’s pool until further notice,” a statement from Waverley council said on Thursday afternoon. “The pool will be disinfected as part of this closure.”

“During this time, we encourage people to continue following Covid-19 safety measures including staying home if they are unwell and getting tested immediately. We also ask everyone to continue practicing good hand hygiene and physical distancing when exercising outdoors.”
