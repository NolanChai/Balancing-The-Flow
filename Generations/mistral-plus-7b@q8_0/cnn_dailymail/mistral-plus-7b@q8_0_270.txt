ean are still to pay the sum for income from their reunion tour in 2011 despite being given until August 2013 to cough up.

It has been revealed that they had only paid back £4 million by July 2013. Now according to reports their debt to the Treasury could be as much as £6million, with £14 million still outstanding. The band were ordered to pay a fine of more than £1 million and to settle a tax bill for unpaid VAT after HMRC launched an investigation into the pop group’s finances.

The taxman said the stars had not been paying their way by under-declaring their earnings between April 2006 and May 2008. At the time of the ruling, Mr Justice Eady said he was ‘concerned’ by the bands lack of cooperation with HMRC. He said: ‘Their response to HMRC’s request for information and documentation has been far from prompt, consistent and complete.’ The band are thought to have paid the £1million fine but are yet to pay back the rest.
