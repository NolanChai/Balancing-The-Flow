44 minutes from a possible nine points in La Liga, all of which were won by Los Blancos.

Bale was left on the bench for the first five games of the campaign under Zinedine Zidane's reign due to a minor calf injury that kept him out of action. The former Tottenham star also missed two group-stage matches against Legia Warsaw and Sporting Lisbon before suffering another injury in November.

The 26-year-old returned for Real's 1-0 victory over Espanyol, coming on as a substitute for Cristiano Ronaldo. However, he was left on the bench once again for the trip to Deportivo La Coruna last weekend and his absence had no effect on Zidane's men as they beat their opponents 4-2.

Zidane has made it clear in recent days that Bale is back in his plans despite reports linking him with a January move to Manchester United or Tottenham Hotspur. However, the Frenchman has also insisted that his team does not need him when he is left out of the starting XI.

The Madrid boss will make a decision over Bale's involvement against Sevilla this weekend after saying during his press conference on Friday morning: "He will have an important part in the club and with me. Gareth has a lot of quality but he also needs to be happy. He is doing very well and he is going to stay with us."

After Madrid beat Atletico 1-0 thanks to Karim Benzema's goal on Wednesday, Zidane admitted that Bale was back in his plans: "Gareth is fine and I think that he is happy. It's true that he has been out for a long time but today he trained with the rest of the team and that is great news."
