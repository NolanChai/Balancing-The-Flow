The 34-year-old Argentine has won the Champions League twice with Inter Milan and lifted the World Cup in Germany with La Albiceleste but is determined to help the Foxes avoid being dragged into a relegation battle.

Cambiasso's form has dipped since he made his Leicester debut at the start of September, but the veteran midfielder knows a solid performance against Newcastle United on Saturday would be a major step towards preserving the club's top flight status.

"This would be one of the best moments in my career," Cambiasso told Foxes Player.

"It would be amazing to do this, it would be wonderful for everyone at the club and it would give us the chance to compete again next year."
