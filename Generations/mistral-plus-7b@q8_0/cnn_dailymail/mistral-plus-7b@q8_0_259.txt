"Gareth won't play (on Saturday) because we have to rest him for a while," the Italian told reporters at a news conference at Real Madrid City, the club's training ground. "He has had some muscular problems recently and so we will give him this break."

Bale's absence is likely to mean an extended run in the side for 20-year-old Brazilian winger Vinicius Junior, who scored his first La Liga goal last weekend against Espanyol.

Ancelotti confirmed that Croatian defender Dani Carvajal would also sit out Saturday's game due to a knee injury although he was confident the right back would recover in time for Real Madrid's Champions League quarter-final second leg at home to Juventus on Tuesday.

"He is working hard and progressing well," said Ancelotti of Carvajal. "I think he will be fine for the Juve game."
