4-1 underdog for the 12 round bout at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, and knows he is in a do or die situation. “I have to fight like it is the last of my life,” Pacquiao told Fightnews.com. “Mayweather is known as one of the best defensive fighters ever, so I need to be very aggressive. But I won’t leave myself open because he punches hard.

“He has a lot of speed and is a great counterpuncher. So I have to be careful, but at the same time I have to go in for the attack. If I just sit there and wait, it will give Mayweather an opportunity to score points on me.” Pacquiao believes that he has had the better training camp than his opponent and is ready to spring a surprise when the pair meet. “I’ve had a great camp with Freddie Roach,” he said. “Everything went well in training, I am in great shape physically and mentally.

“Mayweather knows I’m going to come at him full force. I will put up a great fight. We have worked hard on this camp because we know we need to do our best.” Pacquiao has promised his fans that he will give 100 per cent effort, and is confident of coming away with the victory in Las Vegas. “I’m going out there to win,” he added. “My goal is to go in there and fight my heart out for the whole 12 rounds. I know Mayweather is a good fighter, but so am I.”
