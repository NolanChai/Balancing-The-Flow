ending to the victims, have been released by investigators as part of their bid to locate people whose recollection may be crucial in bringing justice for the 96 football fans who lost their lives that day.

Police have appealed for help in identifying any of the people captured in the photographs. A spokesman said: “Their recollections could prove vital in establishing exactly what happened on that horrific day. Anyone who recognises themselves or someone they know should contact us.”

One photograph shows a man tending to an injured fan while another shows two men and a woman administering first aid to a badly injured supporter. A third image shows four people attempting to help a wounded fan.
