you, n****r' to the 7-footer after he led the Badgers past the Wildcats in Sunday's NCAA national semifinal game, an incident caught on video and replayed all day Monday.

Kaminsky says that what Harrison said 'really doesn't matter.' He also told ESPN.com: 'The thing is, it doesn't really bother me because I know Andrew. I love him to death. I don't take anything personal from him. He's just a passionate guy.

'I can tell you right now I'm not going to say that to anybody. But the way he was raised and everything, I don't think it's really in his heart to do stuff like that. He didn't mean it.'
