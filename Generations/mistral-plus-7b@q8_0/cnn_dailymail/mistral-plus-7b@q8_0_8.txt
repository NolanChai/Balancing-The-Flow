years ago, through to our modern day lives, there are many influences that have helped shape Britain today.

British Identity in the Twenty First Century (the title of an important research project at Birkbeck) looks at how British identity is changing as a result of migration, multiculturalism and globalisation. We explore these ideas using photography to record what it means to be English in 2013.

The British Identity Photography Competition is now open for entries. It runs until midnight on St George’s Day – 23 April 2013 – so you have plenty of time to get snapping. Whether you want to capture a beautiful landscape, record a meaningful event or highlight an important issue, the choice is up to you!

The overall winner will receive £150 in photography vouchers and their photograph will be exhibited on the British Identity website. There are also two runner-up prizes of £50 each and the top ten photographs will be published on the site.
