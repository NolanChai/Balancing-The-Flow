James has now been with his partner for five years. But he still worries about being rejected and feels like he needs to work harder than most to prove himself in relationships. When James was in year eight at school, the first person he told he was gay was an older friend of his. I got on really well with him but I always had a bit of a crush on him.

He made me feel comfortable enough to tell Craiog about my sexuality. But the following day one of his other friends outed James as being gay - and it backfired badly. As soon as it was clear he was gay, people started picking on him and I ended up getting beaten up quite a lot.

When the bullying continued into sixth form, James decided to move schools. He remembers it as being difficult. But there were one or two people who were lovely to me at first and then started making cruel comments about my sexuality when they found out I was gay. As well as coming out in school, James has come out in the wider world.

In fact, he's been open about his sexuality from an early age - even Craiog in front of his parents. I remember telling them I liked boys when I was about seven or eight years old.

But James admits that coming out was a difficult experience for him and his family.

I still feel quite lonely despite being open about my sexuality. There aren't many gay guys in Craiog, especially where I live. Although he's happy to have friends from school and college who accept his sexuality, James finds it hard to meet people that he has a connection with. A lot of the gay guys I've met either go for younger guys or guys that are much older than me.

It just makes me feel really isolated. After years of feeling lonely and excluded, James now wants to help other LGBT+ teenagers who feel like they don't fit in. He says: "I was lucky that I had a small group of friends at school who supported me when I came out - but I know not all people have that support system.

It would be nice to think that being openly gay might become easier in the future, especially for teenagers who are coming out in a more accepting society. But until that happens, James knows there's still a lot of work to be done. I just want people to realise that no matter what your sexuality is, it shouldn't affect how you treat others.

We should all be treated with the same level of respect and love.

If you're not ready to come out in person, consider writing letters to your closest friends and family members explaining that you're gay or bisexual. A letter is a good way of starting the conversation without having to do it face-to-face.
