In the clip, which was posted on YouTube on Tuesday, Drew Scott used lip injections and contouring techniques to achieve a Jenner-inspired pout. The result? A very realistic resemblance. In fact, Scott could easily pass for one of Jenner’s twin sisters, Kim Kardashian or even her half sister Kendall.

“The first step in recreating the look is to define and enhance your natural lips by adding a lip liner,” Scott explains as he uses a pencil to draw on his lips. “I like using MAC Lip Pencil in Soar because it matches my natural lip color really well.” He then moves on to applying lipstick, using one shade at the center of his lips and another on the outer part of his lips to create dimension.

After finishing with the lip liner, Scott uses a contouring technique to shape his cheeks so that they more closely resemble Jenner’s face. After applying his makeup, he finishes off by using highlighter to add shine to his cheekbones.

The result? Pretty impressive. Watch the video below:
