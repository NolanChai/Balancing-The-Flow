igrini is now under increasing pressure despite winning the Capital One Cup this season.

The Chilean was brought to the Etihad Stadium in the summer of 2013, replacing the highly successful Roberto Mancini. His side started the campaign strongly and looked well placed to compete for both the Premier League and Champions League titles. However, a series of poor results have left them fighting for a top-four finish.

Pelligrini has faced criticism in recent weeks for his tactical choices but ex-City defender Pearce believes the pressure should be eased. He told BBC Sport that Pellegrini deserves time to prove himself and that he is still an excellent coach despite City’s form. Pearce said: “I think people need to give him a bit of time at this football club because I’m sure Manuel Pellegrini would have been a very successful manager in any other city, any other country and any other league.”

The former England defender also suggested that City’s squad is still capable of winning the Premier League title. He stated that they have the quality to take down Chelsea at this late stage of the season but have failed to live up to their potential on a regular basis. Pearce added: “They have got the quality in their team, no doubt about it. I think sometimes they lacked that desire and that bit of commitment, but I think they’ve got what it takes.”
