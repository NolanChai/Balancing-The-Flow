46 years in journalism has taught him about Bradford City Football Club…

The first thing I did after moving to Yorkshire was to join the football pools. Then, as a young student, my mate and I would cycle to Odsal to watch the Bulls on Saturday afternoons – for 12p! We never had much money at that time but we always found enough to go to a game or two every week.

It’s amazing how things have changed since then. I now live in Bradford, my career has progressed from sports journalist to newsreader on local and national radio stations, to commentator for the BBC – with Bradford City one of the clubs that I cover. That’s an enormous privilege, but it does come at a cost.

The fire at Valley Parade in 1985 was my first major assignment as a professional sports reporter. I covered that terrible disaster and have also been there for all the high points too – like the Wembley victory over Northampton Town in the League Two play-off final last month. It’s a great club with an incredible history, and I feel very privileged to be a part of it.

Over the years I have seen some outstanding managers, players, supporters, directors and staff who all contributed to the successes that City enjoyed during that period – from Bobby Campbell and Peter Jackson to Stuart McCall and Phil Parkinson. There was always an element of magic about Bradford City then, but it seems to be lacking now.

There are plenty of reasons for that. The club has been through some dark times and a lot of fans have understandably lost faith in those who run it – although the recent arrival of Edin Rahic and Stefan Rupp at the helm has given everyone fresh hope for the future. They’re ambitious owners, so I feel sure they will turn things around and rekindle the magic that once made Bradford City such a special place to be.
