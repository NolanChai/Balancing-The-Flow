severe than first thought. The footage shows the bus slamming into the right wing of the plane with the force of the impact causing the windscreen to smash and the front part of the bus to lift up onto two of its wheels. Amazingly no passengers were injured in the accident, which took place at Tashkent International Airport on July 4. The cause of the incident is still being investigated.
