The boxer's trainer, Freddie Roach, claims he eats 'like a rabbit'. But according to chef Angie Pechenik there are some foods the welterweight champion can't resist. Speaking in an interview with USA Today, Ms Pechenik said: 'He loves sweets like cookies and candy.' She also revealed Mayweather likes seafood, but is not a fan of fish such as tuna or salmon. The 38-year-old prepares five meals a day for the boxer - starting with breakfast at 7am followed by lunch at 10am, dinner at 2pm and snacks in the afternoon and evening. She explained that Mayweather's diet is based around protein, vegetables and complex carbohydrates. His last meal before every fight is always salmon.
