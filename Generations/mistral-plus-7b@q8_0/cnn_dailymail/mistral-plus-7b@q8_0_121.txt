spate of attacks on foreigners in the country, which have left at least seven dead and 12 injured.

The campaign #NotInMyName started with South Africans voicing their displeasure with the attacks via social media. It’s since been embraced by many who say they stand against xenophobia in any form. The hashtag has also been trending on Twitter since Friday, attracting more than 100,000 tweets.

“The campaign is to condemn xenophobic attacks and to send a message of solidarity and support to the foreign nationals who are living in our country,” said Trevor Noah, South Africa’s most famous comedian, whose Twitter feed has been abuzz with calls against the violence.

“There’s this narrative that is out there that if you want to be an anti-xenophobe then you must not hate white people — but we are also saying ‘Not in my name do I commit xenophobia.’ It cuts across race, class and religion,” he told CNN. “It’s a really powerful statement.”

The campaign has been embraced by all walks of life in South Africa: from the young to the old; black to white; celebrities to everyday citizens. A recent tweet from a group called Afrikaanse Persielike Instituut, an association for Afrikaans people, condemned attacks against foreign nationals.

A Twitter post by actress Charlize Theron reads: “Today is a day of standing up and speaking out! The violence in South Africa needs to stop!”
