As we move into summer, eating the wrong foods means you are more likely to gain weight! And who wants that?! So to help us all eat well over the summer, we have put together a list of top tips for eating healthier this seasonâ€¦

1. Eat breakfast! It is one of the most important meals of the day so be sure to include protein and fibre in your meal. These can keep you fuller for longer meaning you are less likely to snack. Our favourite protein packed breakfasts are:
- Porridge with fresh berries
- Wholemeal toast with eggs and bacon
- Fruit salad with natural yoghurt
- Oat pancakes with banana and blueberries
2. Choose whole grain carbs when you can, as they contain more vitamins and minerals than refined grains do. They are also digested more slowly meaning they keep you fuller for longer. So next time you go to make yourself a sandwich use brown bread instead of white or swap your rice for wholegrain!
3. Hydration is key. Drinking water before meals can actually help you eat less and drink fewer calories as it fills up your stomach and curbs appetite. It also prevents dehydration, helps to regulate body temperature and flushes out toxins from the body. So this summer try to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day!
4. Cut down on saturated fat! Saturated fat raises cholesterol levels and increases your risk of developing heart disease and stroke. Foods such as bacon, sausages and processed meats contain high amounts of saturated fat so try to limit the amount of these that you consume.
5. Eat more vegetables! Veggies are packed with nutrients, fibre and water which makes them super filling. They are also low in calories so add as many different coloured veggies as you can into your meals!
