, says she can't afford the ceremony and wants the government to help cover the cost. The 35-year-old, who has been out of work for six months, claims weddings are 'out of reach' for many people without state help.

She told MailOnline: "I want a beautiful wedding with hundreds of guests, a big dress and all that jazz - it's every girl's dream isn't it? But I can't afford the expense of getting married so why shouldn't the Government help out? It is my right to be a bride after all."

The Government does not currently fund weddings. Anna believes she should be granted £3,000 towards her wedding by the state and that every unemployed couple should receive £500 each per year for two years so they could afford their dream ceremony. She said: "I'm fed up with people who have money going to church and having lovely weddings. The Government should help those who can't afford it by paying some of the costs."

Anna, a single mother-of-two, said she would be happy to get married at the registry office for free. But if she could afford it, she wants her wedding day to be 'beautiful and memorable'.
