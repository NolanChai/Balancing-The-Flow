 along with a lot of other literature  face a serious threat: They might be replaced in school curriculums by the likes of "The Hunger Games," "Twilight" or "50 Shades of Grey."In 2011, the English department at the University of Georgia published a study that showed that the most popular books among children and teenagers are increasingly less literary. The study's authors analyzed the books most commonly read by sixth to ninth graders between 2006 and 2008, finding that students were more likely to read modern fiction than classic works of literature."This is a concern for us," said Amy Stamm, an English professor at UGA who led the study. "It's not just that kids aren't reading as much; they're also not reading books that are as good or that will help them become better writers and more sophisticated readers. There are very few classics on their lists."Stamm said a lack of literary reading can hinder student development, with students at a disadvantage when it comes to vocabulary, understanding complex sentence structure and being able to appreciate the power of metaphor and imagery.In the last 20 years, English teachers across the country have seen a drastic shift in what students are drawn to read. "If we ask them what they want to read, they'll say something like 'Twilight,' 'The Hunger Games' or 'Percy Jackson.' And then when you look at the assigned texts for classes, it's not that different," Stamm said. "There was a time when teachers would assign a classic along with another contemporary piece and they wouldn't have to argue much with their students. But now, especially for high schoolers, we're finding that the majority of books assigned are contemporary fiction."
