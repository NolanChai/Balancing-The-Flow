United are due to spend 18 days on US soil, where they will play matches against the LA Galaxy and Real Madrid at the Los Angeles Coliseum before hosting Barcelona at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor, which holds more than 105,000 fans.

The tour is designed to minimise jetlag for the players by reducing travelling time and Van Gaal believes it will help them make a strong start to next season after their 4-0 home defeat to MK Dons on Wednesday night. “We’re going to play Real Madrid and Barcelona. Those are two of the best clubs in the world,” he said.

“It gives you an indication of where you are at and that is what I want. The fans, they deserve it and the players also. That’s why we will do this tour.”

United have toured Asia in recent years but Van Gaal felt a trip to North America would be better for his players. “If you want to play against Real Madrid you have to go to Los Angeles,” he said.

“You have to take the jetlag and make sure that it’s not too bad, and that’s what we will do. In Asia you travel a lot on an airplane, so this is also what we did with the players at the beginning of the season in order to avoid the jetlag.”

United have been drawn against Club Brugge, PSV Eindhoven, Wolfsburg and CSKA Moscow in the Champions League group stage next season. Van Gaal will face his old side Ajax in the Europa League, a competition he is keen to win. “If you win that title, then you have qualified for the Champions League,” he said.

“That’s what I want to do, of course, and it’s one of my targets.”

United are also likely to make a signing after missing out on Angel Di Maria, who was expected to move to Old Trafford from Real Madrid but joined Paris St-Germain. “You can always improve,” said Van Gaal. “I’m not going to deny that. I have told the club and they know what players we need.”
