arget and will bid £40m plus add-ons in their opening offer.

The England international has been at the heart of much of City’s transfer plans this summer, with the club willing to pay up to £50m for his services. They have already made two approaches for the 19-year old and have been told by Liverpool that they will need to pay closer to £50m if they are going to make an offer for Sterling that is accepted.

City had hoped that they would be able to tempt the forward with a significantly increased wage packet, but his decision to sign a new contract at Anfield earlier this month appears to have killed off those plans. He has signed a new five-year deal worth £100,000 per week and is now in line for even more should he perform well this season.

The club’s stance on Sterling will not be affected by their decision to sign Wilfried Bony from Swansea City this week, with the club still very much interested in him as a player they feel can develop into a superstar at the Etihad Stadium.
