ool asked the president if he could “stop calling my mother an African American.”

“I am not an African American, I’m a Muslim,” he added. The president assured him that his mother was, in fact, “a wonderful African American woman” and that he considered himself blessed to call her his daughter. He explained that while he believes many people have used the phrase “African-American” to describe themselves with pride and a sense of solidarity, others have chosen not to use it.

“I understand,” Yaya said, smiling. The president acknowledged that Yaya’s perspective is different from his own. He explained that he was raised in Hawaii and has always thought of himself as black but “also as a person of color” and that when he refers to African-Americans he does so out of pride for their history of struggle and progress.

“So if you were born in Africa, I would call you an African-American,” the president explained. He acknowledged that it is up to each individual to decide how they wish to describe themselves but reiterated that many people consider it a “badge of honor.”
