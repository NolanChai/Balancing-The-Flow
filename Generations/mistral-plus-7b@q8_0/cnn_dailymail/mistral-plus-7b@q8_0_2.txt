ion has had enough of his education policies.

"The American Federation of Teachers-New Jersey is calling for the resignation of Gov. Chris Christie," Randi Weingarten, the unionâ€™s president, said in a statement Wednesday. "Gov. Christie's bullying and abuse of power have finally come to a head."

Weingarten cited Christie's behavior toward teacher Linda Darrah at a town hall meeting on Tuesday night when she asked him about his proposed $800 million education budget cuts. Christie, who has been a strong advocate for reducing public spending, was quick with his response.

"You should have been laying off teachers instead of raising your own pay," he said. "The thing you need to understand is that people in this state are hurting badly and they're getting laid off right and left and they're having a hard time keeping their jobs. And I understand the pain. What I don't understand is why we keep electing people who have spent more than the state can afford."

Though Christie was careful not to be too harsh in his remarks, he didn't exactly let Darrah off easy either: "You should have been one of those that was making sacrifices," he told her. "Instead you were getting raises and protecting your benefits."
