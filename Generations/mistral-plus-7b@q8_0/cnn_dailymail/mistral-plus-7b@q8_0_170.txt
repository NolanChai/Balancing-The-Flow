shared their experience on social media, and video footage released by the airline shows the pilots frantically working to level off as they try to get an idea of what went wrong with the plane's pressurization system.

SkyWest Flight 3809 departed from Dallas Love Field headed for Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport shortly after 2:15 p.m. Central time on Wednesday. Around 25 minutes later, passengers started to experience a loss of pressure in the cabin. After climbing to an altitude of nearly 38,000 feet, the pilots were forced to descend back down to 16,000 feet before they could safely continue their flight to Minneapolis.

A SkyWest spokesperson told ABC News that the plane was at its cruising altitude when a rapid decompression occurred in the cabin. The spokesperson said a "depressurization event" caused oxygen masks to automatically drop from the ceiling. Passengers reportedly began using the masks before landing.

The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed there were no reports of injuries on the flight and that the pilots followed standard operating procedures during the incident. Both pilots have since been removed from service while the FAA and National Transportation Safety Board investigate what happened.
