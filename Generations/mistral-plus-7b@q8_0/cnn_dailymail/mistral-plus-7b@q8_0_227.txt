50-page petition demanding the right to implant his sperm into Vergara's eggs despite the fact that she is now engaged to Joe Manganiello. The pair were engaged for almost two years but split in April and sources say they did so because of Loeb's jealousy over her huge paycheck and his desire to have more children.

Loeb filed an emergency petition to Los Angeles County Superior Court claiming that he wants to implant the couple's embryos as soon as possible "because their age alone renders them at high risk for chromosomal abnormalities," Radar reports. He claims that the Modern Family star is in denial over the fact that they had previously signed a contract allowing him to use the embryos without her consent.

The petition says: "While Vergara has publicly said that she will never bring their children into this world, the parties have an agreement that requires her to do so if Nick were to ask.

"Vergara is now engaged to be married and Nick believes that she does not want him to bring the couple's embryos to term. He wants to implant the couple's embryos as soon as possible because their age alone renders them at high risk for chromosomal abnormalities."

He also claims in court documents that he has attempted to convince her to implant the embryos into a surrogate but she refuses. Loeb says that if Vergara won't let him use the eggs then they should be destroyed, but he fears that she might try to keep them and "sell them for millions of dollars."
