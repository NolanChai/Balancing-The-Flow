hlers took her own life and that of her child after being devastated by the betrayal.

Donna Oehlers, 36, died on October 10 2017 at Waterloo station with her son Thomas following her. The couple had been living in an apartment in Waterloo for two years but it was recently discovered that Oehlers' husband was in a relationship with another woman, the Daily Mail reports.

The couple had moved to Britain from South Africa where they met and married. They also have a three-year-old daughter who survived the tragedy. Donna, an artist and illustrator, had been suffering from depression.

During the inquest at Wandsworth Coroner's Court, her husband Adam Oehlers said: "I was having an affair with my girlfriend. I am sorry to say that." The couple argued over the relationship, which led to Donna moving out for a few weeks. When she returned home they continued to argue and she threatened to end her life.

Donna went for help at the A&E department of St Thomas Hospital but Adam says he did not realise the severity of his wife's depression and failed to accompany her. He was shocked when he arrived home from work to discover Donna had ended their lives with a train.

The couple were waiting on an empty platform and then sat on the railway line at Waterloo station, both of them holding hands. Adam said: "She was distraught and very upset. She seemed like she was in some sort of trance." The train driver spotted the pair but couldn't stop in time.

The couple were pronounced dead at the scene. Donna was described as a "loving mother" while Thomas is remembered for his cheeky character.
