as his illegal activities on the derivatives market came under scrutiny from US regulators.

Sarao, who appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday morning to face fraud charges, told traders he could make such large sums of cash because he was not restricted by margin calls and risk management rules.

US regulators believe that Sarao artificially inflated volatility in the financial system by flooding the market with "spoofing orders" - fake buy and sell orders to trick other traders into thinking there is more demand for a particular asset.

The spoofing orders allowed him to pocket profits when other investors rushed to capitalise on price fluctuations. When other investors realised they had been duped, prices plummeted in a domino effect, causing the crash in May 2010.

In an online chat room Sarao told another trader: "Volatility is great. It's the perfect market for me. I can make $1m [Â£655,000] a week doing this if I am not restricted by margin calls and risk management."

"I don't get margin calls, because I never have a position," Sarao added. "I also have no risk management, as I know what I am doing and can judge how big a risk my strategy involves."

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) claims that between August 2011 and April 2014 Sarao used automated computer programmes to place orders for thousands of futures contracts, before immediately cancelling them.

In the first five months of 2010 alone, more than 327,000 of his trades were cancelled. The FCA alleges that Sarao "deceived" other traders by tricking them into buying or selling at inflated prices.

Sarao was arrested in April after the US Department of Justice unveiled a sweeping criminal investigation into the manipulation of the derivatives market, which resulted in charges against four more traders. He is being held under house arrest at his parents' home in Hounslow, west London.
