footage emerged showing dust clouds so thick they look like giant walls, in India’s Punjab state, while just last month similar dust storms were recorded in China. Dust storms are known as ‘haboobs’, and are incredibly common across the US, Middle East and northern Africa - but this year they have been far more widespread than normal. The phenomenon is caused by dry desert conditions that whip up vast clouds of sand, grit and dust that can be deadly for those in their path.
