The Alzheimer’s disease is an irreversible neurological disorder which causes memory loss, confusion and mood swings. It can affect a person’s behaviour as well as their thinking. Dementia is the term for problems with mental abilities such as memory, language, communication or understanding that are severe enough to interfere with daily life.

In dementia, parts of the brain which control speech and memory gradually break down. The condition is usually associated with old age but can also affect younger people, often following a head injury.
