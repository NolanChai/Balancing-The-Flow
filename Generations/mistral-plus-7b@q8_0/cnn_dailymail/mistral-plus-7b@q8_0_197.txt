when a drunk driver slammed into their vehicle. The impact killed the child and nearly killed both of them. After many surgeries and months of rehabilitation, Brynn is now working at the preschool that her son used to attend. One day while picking up another student for preschool, she sees Cassie there with a new baby girl. Brynn recognizes the child as her own daughter. She doesn't know what to do, and she has some serious emotional issues about having to deal with this situation. At the same time, Cassie is struggling with being able to give her infant the love and attention that she thinks she deserves. She knows that Brynn's son died in the crash that nearly took both of their lives, but she doesn't know who the boy was or how he's connected to them.

This is a beautiful story about second chances and the power of forgiveness. This author writes very well about women dealing with personal tragedies and trying to overcome their fears and emotional scars in order to move forward with their lives. Cassie has some real issues to deal with, but Brynn's story really captured my attention and held it until the end. The characters are well developed and very believable, making this a compelling read. If you like women's fiction, then I think you'll love this book!
