Akram Zaatari’s letter was read out at a press conference at the Sydney Opera House by curator of photography at the Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Christopher Chapman.

Mr Zaatari’s message urges Indonesian President Joko Widodo to reconsider executing Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran for drug smuggling, calling on him to consider that they have “paid a very high price” for their actions.

“They have been in prison since 2006 and have been punished through solitary confinement and denied basic human rights,” the message reads.

“The death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment, and Indonesia is one of just seven countries to retain this law in Asia.”

Mr Zaatari goes on to explain that he has become close friends with Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran since first meeting them in prison when they were 25 years old.

He notes that the two men are now 34, but have shown “amazing maturity” since their arrest, despite having been in jail for almost a decade.

“They have become educators and have given back so much to society,” Mr Zaatari writes.

“I hope you will grant clemency.”

Mr Chapman said the letter was written as part of the MCA’s ongoing campaign against capital punishment.

The two Australian men were found guilty of smuggling drugs into Indonesia in 2005 and sentenced to death by firing squad.
