arse comments about swearing on Twitter during the first live episode of The Grand Tour which was broadcast on Amazon Prime yesterday.

He tweeted: “It’s good to be able to swear again. I’ve missed it.” When another user commented that it was a “welcome relief”, Clarkson replied with a gif of a cartoon character giving the middle finger. The tweet sparked a frenzy of responses, with users praising the presenter for being able to “speak his mind”.

Clarkson’s contract as Top Gear host was terminated after he punched one of the show’s producers following a row over catering in March 2015. He later apologised and settled out-of-court with Oisin Tymon. In July of the same year, the BBC announced that Clarkson had been dropped from Top Gear, along with co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May. They later moved to Amazon Prime’s The Grand Tour, which began airing in November last year.

The show was made available on Amazon Instant Video for customers in more than 200 countries across the world, excluding China, North Korea, Syria and Crimea. It is believed to be the most expensive TV programme ever created at £160 million for its first series, which includes three one-hour episodes.
