2020. The planes will be used for maritime rescue operations by the Chinese coast guard.

The unusual design is not just to attract attention. The aircraft are meant to be able to take off and land on water with ease, like a boat. The ability of the CYG-11s to takeoff from and land on water means they can respond to emergencies in any body of water.

The planes were designed by the China Aviation Industry General Aircraft Corporation. They are powered by two 280 hp engines mounted on pontoons that allow them to lift off from water like a boat. The wings of the aircraft also have floats that allow them to land safely on the water, similar to a seaplane.

The CYG-11 has a maximum takeoff weight of 3,500 kg and a top speed of 280 km/h. It can fly for up to three hours on one tank of gasoline, making it suitable for maritime rescue operations. The aircraft is equipped with rescue equipment, including flotation devices, life rafts and medical supplies. It also has an onboard camera that allows operators to monitor the situation in real time.
