1987, King Goodwill Zwelithini was in the spotlight after it emerged that he had fathered a child out of wedlock. He was accused of being irresponsible and "causing immorality".

In an interview with South African newspaper The Times in November last year, King Goodwill Zwelithini denied claims made by some in his nation that he was a "drunkard" who often abused traditional leaders' wives. He said: "It is not true. I am never drunk."

He added that he had never "seen anything like what I am seeing now". But it has been reported that the 68-year-old, who has nine wives and more than 20 children, can be an angry man. It is claimed he has a fiery temper which often lands him in trouble with his people.

The king – whose full title is King Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu – was born on 12 July 1948 and took the throne in 1970 following the death of his father. He has lived a life of luxury, owning at least three properties in South Africa and three more abroad.

In 2006 he was forced to explain his lavish lifestyle after it emerged that he had bought an Aston Martin costing £400,000 as well as a Rolls Royce. The monarch argued that he would not have been able to purchase such vehicles if they did not belong to the Zulu nation.

In 1987 he faced scrutiny for fathering a child out of wedlock with a woman who was not one of his wives, and was widely condemned at the time as being "immoral". He responded by saying: "It is true that I have had an affair with this girl. We were in love and she is carrying my baby."

The king has been criticised for failing to use his position to improve the lives of the Zulu people, many of whom live in poverty. But he has repeatedly defended himself saying: "I have done everything I could do for them [my subjects]. If you come with me on my trips, you will see that I am not a king who stays behind his walls.

"I walk through the villages and visit people's homes. I talk to them about their problems and advise them in any way possible."
