ognosed with a rare genetic disorder called Wolf-Hirschhorn Syndrome, his parents say they are grateful every day that he is still here and fighting.

"He was born at 35 weeks via emergency C-section," said Malakai's mother, Kelli Johnson. "He had to be resuscitated at birth due to being so sick."

Johnson first learned of her baby's condition after he was born.

"Malakai has Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that only occurs in one out of every 50,000 live births," she explained. "It is caused by the deletion of genetic material from the short arm of chromosome four."

As a result, her son has microcephaly, which means he has an unusually small head and brain. He also suffers from seizures, feeding and growth delays, as well as breathing difficulties.

"He is in and out of the NICU at the children's hospital," said Johnson. "His main issue right now is that he can't eat enough by mouth to gain weight and grow properly."

Malakai was discharged from the hospital for a month, but had to go back for further treatment. He currently has a g-tube placed into his stomach through surgery in order to receive nutrition. He also requires oxygen 24 hours a day via an apnea monitor that alerts medical staff if he stops breathing.

His mother says she is hopeful he will overcome all of the obstacles in front of him.

"He has had so many set backs, but he keeps proving everyone wrong," said Johnson. "He's a fighter and we wouldn't be where we are without God's love for us."
