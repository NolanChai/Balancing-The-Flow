K and Brooklyn Anti-Gentrification Network to protest the killing of Eric Garner, 43, who died after being placed in a chokehold by Officer Daniel Pantaleo.

The protest started peacefully in Union Square before moving down 14th Street toward Washington Square Park, where dozens of police officers were already lined up to keep marchers away from the street. Once protesters reached the park, they took over Broadway and walked down to City Hall before circling back to Union Square, where they were met by dozens more police officers.

At least one arrest was made near Union Square after a protester jumped on top of a NYPD van. Another protester was arrested shortly thereafter for throwing paint on an officer's helmet. Dozens more were arrested as the night progressed and the protests became increasingly rowdy. One man was arrested for striking an officer with an umbrella, another was arrested after allegedly spray painting the word "murderer" on a police vehicle. At least two people were also seen throwing trash cans onto a NYPD van.

The New York City Police Department announced that a total of 34 arrests were made during Tuesday's protests, according to NBC News. Charges include disorderly conduct and obstruction of governmental administration.
