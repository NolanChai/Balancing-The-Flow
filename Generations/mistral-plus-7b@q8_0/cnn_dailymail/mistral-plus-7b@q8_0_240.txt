heartbroken at the end of last week as they lost out on a quarter-final place when they were beaten 14-8 by Leinster at The Rec.

However, England full-back Watson believes there is no time for reflection, with Bath now set to concentrate their efforts on making the top four in the Premiership and potentially securing qualification for next season's European Champions Cup. "It was obviously disappointing because we wanted to get to the quarter-finals of the Heineken Champions Cup and we just couldn't do it," Watson told Bath Rugby's official website.

"We can take a lot from last week, but we have to move on pretty quickly now." The Premiership will return this weekend, with Bath set to resume their season with an away game at Sale Sharks on Saturday (15 December). And Watson believes the disappointment of failing to secure qualification for the Champions Cup quarter-finals can prove a positive in that they have so much left to play for. "It's obviously disappointing when you don't achieve something and when you don't achieve it you need to use it as motivation going forward," he said.

"We want to qualify for the Heineken Champions Cup and we have another two league games before Christmas, so we need to put in two good performances and hopefully get a couple of wins to keep us in the top four."
