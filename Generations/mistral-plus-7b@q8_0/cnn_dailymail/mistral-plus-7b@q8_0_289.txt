The tweet — which has since been deleted — featured an image of Clinton alongside a quote: "I don't like how she drinks, her smoking habits, and that 'nasty woman' comment is just the cherry on top." It was posted by Dan Scavino, one of Trump's social media managers.

The tweet came shortly after Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway told CNN's Jake Tapper that "Hillary Clinton has some personal problems — she takes medicine for memory loss, she takes medicine to keep her awake." She continued: "She has some baggage that she carries around with her. And I think that would be a concern for the American people."

The tweet and Conway's remarks are just the latest examples of Trump and his surrogates attempting to chip away at Clinton's health. The strategy is a dangerous one, considering a history of false statements about presidential candidates' fitness for office that date back to the 1960s.

In addition, Clinton has released medical records in the past that show she has been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and double pneumonia.
