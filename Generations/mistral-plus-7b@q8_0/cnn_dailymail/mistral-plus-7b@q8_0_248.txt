r prehistoric burial ritual that dates back to the Neolithic period.

Researchers at the University of Lisbon’s Institute for Prehistory and Archaeological Sciences (IPAC) recently uncovered the woman, who had been buried in a fetal position with her hands resting on top of her belly. The body was covered in red ocher and surrounded by yellow flowers.

“It was very well preserved,” study co-author Pedro Marques told Gizmodo. “It was so surprising that we were all stunned.”

The grave, which is 19,000 years old, is the oldest evidence of a Neolithic burial ritual known to science. The researchers believe that this practice, which involved painting the dead in ocher and covering them with flowers, spread from northern Spain throughout Western Europe. They say it could have been part of an early death ritual practiced by Neanderthals.

“It shows that there was a strong symbolic system that probably existed for millennia,” Marques said.
