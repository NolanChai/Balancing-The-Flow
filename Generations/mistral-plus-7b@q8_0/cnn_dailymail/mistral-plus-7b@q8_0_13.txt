in his flat. Faris Al-Khori, 62, had enough components to make 1,000 bombs when he was arrested last month by armed officers who raided two addresses in Luton and London . He was sentenced to four years for possession of explosives after an eight hour trial at Luton Crown Court. The court heard that the retired doctor amassed a store of chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide, sulphuric acid and ammonium nitrate – ingredients used in improvised explosive devices (IEDs) by terrorist groups. Al-Khori also had an unregistered shotgun and ammunition at one address in Luton . At the time of his arrest on September 9 he told officers: “If it is for a good purpose then I have no problem. “But if they are going to use them to harm others, this is not what I stand for.” The trial heard that Al-Khori had amassed chemicals in his possession over an extended period of time and was aware they could be used to make explosives. The retired doctor also downloaded instructions on how to make improvised explosive devices onto his computer at home, including manuals on making pipe bombs, grenades and land mines. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Pritchard said after the hearing: “Faris Al-Khori’s hoarding of chemicals, combined with a wealth of knowledge about how to use them in homemade explosives, posed a serious risk to our communities. “We will continue to be vigilant against any potential threat of terrorism and will take robust action against anyone who seeks to cause harm.”
