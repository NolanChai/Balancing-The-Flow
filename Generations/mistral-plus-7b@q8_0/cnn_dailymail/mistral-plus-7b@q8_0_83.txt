more Premier League games than any other manager in history, says he will start with the same squad that beat Tottenham 2-1 last week. But he says he still needs to make up his mind on a few players. "I decide the team always at 8am on a game day," said Wenger. "This is my method for many years. I think itâ€™s very important to have a clear head when you play a football game. To make decisions like that, sometimes in the evening after the training session or late, it could be a mistake because you are still in the mood of the training session and everything.

"I think to be relaxed and calm and just to take a decision based on what I have seen all week and go for it." He added: "After the game against Tottenham I know we will play with basically the same players, but it's always down to one or two positions. But at the moment I am convinced that I will start with the same team because we played very well on Sunday. It is a bit like that every week. "I have one or two decisions to make until 8am in the morning of course."
