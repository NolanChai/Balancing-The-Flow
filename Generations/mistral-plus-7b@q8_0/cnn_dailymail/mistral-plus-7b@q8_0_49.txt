Alcaraz, 31, has one year remaining on his current deal while Distin, 35, is in the final six months of a two-year contract.

Martinez said he wants both players to stay at Goodison Park but admitted the duo are yet to prove they have enough left in their legs to help Everton challenge for silverware over the course of the next few years.

"They're key members of what we want to achieve. Both have played a lot of games and their experience has been very important," he told the Echo. "Both have fantastic qualities. Sylvain is still playing really well at the moment and Antolin as well.

"I don't think any player should be judged on one season but I want all my players to feel like they are part of this project, that they are part of our future and it's great to see two very good professionals who are playing a lot of games still feeling they have lots more to offer."

Martinez added: "I think there are certain areas where we need to improve and Sylvain and Antolin can be really important in those areas. They can be key players for us moving forward. It's just about their body language, commitment and quality, which at this moment is still really high."
