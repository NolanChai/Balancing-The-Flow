at the top of their screen. It sounds simple enough – don’t press the button, but as the thread gains steam, it becomes increasingly difficult for some people to ignore the lure of pressing it.

At the time of writing, over 100,000 people had pressed the button, and while this may seem like a lot of people who couldn’t resist the temptation, in reality only 2% of those who saw the thread chose to press the button. The button itself is designed to be simple – it just changes colour from red to blue, back again and so on – but its impact seems to be surprisingly strong.

So why does this button have such a powerful effect? One possible explanation is that it plays into our innate curiosity. We are naturally drawn towards new experiences and when we see something strange or unusual, it triggers an automatic response of wanting to explore further. In this case, the button represents an unknown quantity which many people are unable to resist pressing. It could also be related to a sense of challenge or competition – if you know that other people have pressed the button before you, then you may feel compelled to join in and prove that you can resist the temptation too.

The fact that so few people have succumbed to this temptation shows that most people are able to control their impulses when faced with a difficult decision. It is important for us all to learn how to control our desires and resist temptations, as this will help us make better decisions in the long run.
