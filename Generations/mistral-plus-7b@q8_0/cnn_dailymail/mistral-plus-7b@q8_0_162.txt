badger hasn't exactly been shy about her intentions to cheat on her husband with other men, she has now revealed that she does have feelings for him.

In an interview with Woman’s Day, Nasser Sultan said he was happy the way things turned out despite his bride-to-be, Gabrielle Bartlett, wanting nothing to do with him after the pair met for the first time in their wedding gowns. She told a camera that he wasn't her type and she wished she could leave right away.

Despite being hurt by her rejection, Nasser has since revealed he still harbours romantic feelings for his bride.

"I was very attracted to Gabrielle when I met her at the wedding,” Nasser said in an interview with Woman’s Day magazine. “She's a gorgeous woman who takes care of herself and it took me by surprise.”
