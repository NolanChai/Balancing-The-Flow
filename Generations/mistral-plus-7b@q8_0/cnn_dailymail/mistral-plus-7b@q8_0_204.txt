st comes from aging it in wooden casks was to visit your local wine bar or restaurant, or drink it out of expensive wine bottles.

Not any more though because as you can see this cool oak barrel shaped bottle will let you do the same at home! It’s called Oaky Oak and is a rather novel way of infusing your favourite tipples with that wonderful oak wood taste in just a few days. Simply pour in your favourite spirits or wines, insert the tap into the cork and leave it to sit for 3-5 days before tasting its smooth, delicious flavour. It’s also reusable so you can enjoy that wonderful aroma every time.

Oaky Oak comes as a set with 2 barrels (one filled with French oak chips and the other with American oak) so you can experiment with different tastes. The casks are made from durable acrylic, and are dishwasher safe to ensure easy cleaning. They also come with a removable tap and screw top for refills and are available online from Hammacher Schlemmer for $40.
