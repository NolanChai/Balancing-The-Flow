64.9F (18C) on Wednesday night.

"This is the first time we have ever seen such a high temperature recorded in Antarctica," meteorologist Dan Corbett of the U.S. National Weather Service told The Guardian. "We didn't expect it to be that high."

The previous record of 63.5F was set in March 2015 at Argentina's Esperanza Base as well.

The temperature was made possible by strong winds, which helped drive up the temperature near the coast of Antarctica. "It's just a product of a very strong westerly wind blowing over the warmer waters," Corbett said. "As the water evaporates it cools in the atmosphere and then as that air moves into land areas, like Esperanza Base, it warms back up."

The temperature on Thursday was even higher than Wednesday's record-breaking temperatures, but because the Argentine weather station is currently offline, the National Weather Service couldn't confirm that figure.
