inger glow has been thwarted, with a recent study suggesting that self-tanning is linked to a greater risk of skin cancer.

The study, published in the International Journal of Cancer and carried out by researchers from Harvard University and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, analysed data from 30 studies on skin cancer and found that those who used fake tan at least once every three months were 67% more likely to develop melanoma than those who didn’t.

The study concluded: ‘We found that regular use of sunless tanning products was associated with an increased risk of melanoma.’ It continued to explain this may be down to the chemicals used in self-tan products, such as dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which is responsible for darkening skin colour. DHA reacts with dead skin cells to temporarily stain the skin a brown colour.

The study did not find a link between melanoma and sunscreen use, suggesting that those who wear fake tan may be at greater risk as it encourages them to spend more time in the sun. ‘Individuals applying sunless tanners may receive false reassurance that they are protecting themselves from harmful ultraviolet radiation by not using sunscreens,’ explained the researchers.

Although the findings of this study suggest self-tan should be avoided, we think it’s important to remember fake tan does have some benefits for your skin. It can help reduce the appearance of cellulite and stretch marks, as well as adding a healthy glow to your complexion. However, it’s important that you use sun protection with any self-tanning product in order to avoid damaging your skin.
