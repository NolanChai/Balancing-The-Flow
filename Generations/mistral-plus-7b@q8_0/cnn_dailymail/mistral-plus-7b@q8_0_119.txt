boat when she ran away from their home base to play on a swing and did not return. The devastated parents were desperate for information about their little girl and made public appeals asking anyone who saw anything unusual in the area that night to come forward.

Fiona's body was found in the water of Clear Lake behind her family's boat rental business at around 3:20 p.m. on Sunday, Sept. 25, officials said. The little girl's autopsy showed no signs of trauma and foul play has been ruled out as a cause of death. Galveston County Medical Examiner, Dr Jeffrey Taub, confirmed that Kitty died due to drowning but her family are still waiting for the final results from a full autopsy.

Kitty's devastated father told reporters that he was heartbroken about his daughter's death but thanked everyone involved in the search for her. "I know all of us, we're just crushed right now," John Carroll said. "It's tough. I don't want to go through it again."
