udicrous, there is actually some evidence to suggest they do.

Rogue planets are those that don't orbit a star but instead roam interstellar space. They have been found using telescopes that pick up heat emanating from the planetary bodies.  But they could also be harbouring life, according to a study published in the journal Astrobiology.

Life on Earth thrives around liquid water, and scientists believe there could be oceans under the surface of these planets, as well as hydrogen oceans, lakes and rivers on their surface.  The researchers suggest that some of these rogue planets could have been born with a "chemical soup" ready for life to evolve in it.

The planets are believed to be made up of rock, ice, and water, just like Earth, although they are much larger than our own planet. They can have a diameter of between 20,000 miles (32,186 km) and 49,000 miles (79,000 km), with the average being roughly twice the size of Earth's diameter.

Lead author of the paper, Sara Ruiz-Rodriguez from the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo said: "We suggest that these rogue planets could have been born with a chemical soup ready to kickstart life."

The team also proposed that some of these planets were likely to have a large number of meteorites falling onto their surface, which would provide them with the necessary ingredients for life. Meteorites contain water, amino acids and other organic compounds, all essential for life as we know it.
