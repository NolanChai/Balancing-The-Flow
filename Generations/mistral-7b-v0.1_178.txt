This code will create a dictionary with the key-value pairs of the names of the two teams and their temperature in Fortaleza, Brazil during the World Cup. The code also creates a variable named "cool_break" that prints out a message if the temperature is greater than 39 degrees.
```
teams = {'Holland': '25', 'Mexico': '27'}
cool_break = False
if int(teams['Holland']) >= 39:
    cool_break = True
print('The temperature in Fortaleza was {} degrees and there was a cooling break.'.format(teams['Holland'])) if cool_break else print('There was no cooling break.')
```
