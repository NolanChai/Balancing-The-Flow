I'd like to say that it was the fault of the driver for not looking and pulling out slowly, but that wouldn't be true because I don't know if he saw anything or even looked before reversing away, but we do know that there were no children in the car, so what did the government agency do with its own toddler?

### Solution:
The government agency had a [**toddler**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=toddlers+in+cars&client=ubuntu&hs=532&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY-8a76vPTAhXDxGMKHWG0B4AQ_AUICigB&biw=1059&bih=602) in the car, and they [**killed it**](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=kill+a+toddler&client=ubuntu&hs=532&rls=en&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjY-8a76vPTAhXDxGMKHWG0B4AQ_AUICigB&biw=1059&bih=602), because that's what the government does.
