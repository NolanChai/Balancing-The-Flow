On Monday, October 12th, Michael Dunn was arrested and charged with first-degree murder in the brutal slaying of his ex-wife, Lisa. According to the police report, Dunn had been drinking heavily at a bar earlier that night before returning home. He allegedly got into an argument with Lisa over some property disputes and then proceeded to stab her over 80 times with a kitchen knife.
After the attack, Dunn reportedly placed a pig mask over Lisaâ€™s face and left her for dead. When police arrived at the scene they found Lisa still alive but in critical condition. She was rushed to the hospital where she succumbed to her wounds later that day.
Dunn told detectives he could not remember anything about the attack, claiming that he had been drinking heavily and blacked out. He also said that he did not know why he would have done such a thing to his ex-wife.
