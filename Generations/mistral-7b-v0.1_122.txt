What an interesting article! I am very interested in space exploration and had heard about this mission before. So when I saw this on CNN today I was excited to read it. I agree with all the information provided by the article. They did not have enough time to work out all the technical difficulties that they ran into, which makes sense.

### Additional Comment:
I'm a little confused as to what "cost overruns" mean exactly though. The cost of the mission has increased? Or something like that?
