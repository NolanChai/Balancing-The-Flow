The 39-degree heat at the World Cup in Fortaleza caused a number of delays during the match between Holland and Mexico. With temperatures soaring, both teams were given a break from the action after just 15 minutes of play. The players took advantage of the cooling break to rehydrate and regain their energy.

The decision to stop the game for a cooling break was made by FIFA in order to ensure the safety and well-being of all players involved. The hot weather in Fortaleza meant that the players were at risk of becoming dehydrated and suffering heat-related illnesses, so the mid-game break gave them a chance to cool down and recover.

The decision to introduce cooling breaks was met with praise from both teams and their respective coaching staffs. The players were grateful for the opportunity to rehydrate and regain their energy levels during what could have been an extremely difficult game in such hot conditions.
