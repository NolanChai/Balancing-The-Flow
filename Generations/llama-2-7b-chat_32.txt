Mandy Huggins, 35, from St Albans in Hertfordshire, UK, was inspired to embark on a drastic weight loss journey after feeling "disgusted" with her appearance during the holiday season. She had reached a staggering 20 stone (280 pounds) and was determined to slim down before Christmas. With the help of a personal trainer and a strict diet, Mandy has managed to lose an incredible 11 stone (140 pounds) in just seven months, leaving her feeling "fitter, healthier and happier than ever before."
