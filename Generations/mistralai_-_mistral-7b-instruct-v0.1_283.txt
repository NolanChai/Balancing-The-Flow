 The attack is being investigated by Afghan and NATO forces. According to a statement from NATO, "There have been isolated incidents in recent months where individuals wearing Afghan military uniforms have carried out attacks on NATO forces."

The three U.S. troops were part of an advisory team that was providing training to Afghan security forces. The attack took place in the Kandahar province, which has been the site of many recent insurgent attacks against NATO forces.

NATO officials say that they are taking steps to prevent such incidents from happening again, including increasing security measures around training facilities and conducting background checks on Afghan military recruits.

The attack is likely to increase tensions between Afghanistan and the international community, which has been providing military and financial assistance to the country since 2001. There have been growing concerns about the effectiveness of the Afghan government and its ability to control the country's security.
