 This article from CNN reports that over 200,000 children were spanked or paddled in US schools during the previous academic year. The human rights groups who conducted the study are advocating for an end to corporal punishment in schools. They believe that it is a form of abuse and can lead to negative behavior, including increased aggression and mental health issues. Some experts argue that alternative forms of discipline, such as verbal reprimands or time-outs, are more effective and less harmful to students.
