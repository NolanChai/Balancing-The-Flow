The mayor, John Smith, was caught speeding on the M4 motorway while driving to a meeting with transport officials. He was clocked doing 85mph in a 70mph zone and received a Â£100 fine. The incident has raised questions about his judgment and ability to enforce the 20mph limit he introduced last year, which has been controversial among residents.
