As a result of the region's shifting political landscape, women are finding new opportunities to challenge traditional gender roles and push for greater equality. From Jordan to Iran, women are taking on leadership positions in government, business, and civil society, and using their voices to demand greater rights and freedoms. In Istanbul, Turkey, for example, a group of women activists have formed a coalition called "Women Will Save the World," with the goal of mobilizing women across the country to take action on issues such as education, healthcare, and economic empowerment.

### Question:
What are some examples of the work that this group of women activists in Istanbul is doing?

### Response:
The "Women Will Save the World" coalition in Istanbul is working to improve access to education for girls, particularly in rural areas where many schools lack basic resources such as textbooks and qualified teachers. They are also advocating for greater investment in women's healthcare, including reproductive rights and mental health services. Additionally, the group is pushing for greater economic empowerment of women through initiatives such as microfinance programs and job training. In all of these areas, the coalition is working to challenge traditional gender roles and stereotypes that have long held women back in Turkish society.
