Lukasz Fabianski has been suspended for one match following his sending off in Swansea City’s 2-1 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. The Polish international goalkeeper was shown a straight red card midway through the second half of the game after bringing down Mohamed Salah inside the penalty area, and as a result will now miss Sunday’s clash with Tottenham Hotspur.

The 32-year-old was dismissed for his 10th Premier League red card since joining the Swans in July 2014. The FA confirmed Fabianski’s punishment on Monday morning, ruling he would miss the weekend’s encounter with Spurs at the Liberty Stadium.
