> What does it say about us that we're so obsessed with beauty? It's a very negative thing. You're always going to get people who are jealous and unhappy that they don't look like the girls on Instagram, or they aren't tall enough to be models. We need to teach kids what real beauty is. I would love for it not to be something we have to think about.

### Analysis:

* Modeling agencies are looking for new talent via social media.
