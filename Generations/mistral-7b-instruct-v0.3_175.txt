 That's correct! In 2012, Formula One made its long-awaited return to the United States with the construction of a new racing track in Austin, Texas. The circuit, known as the Circuit of The Americas, was designed to accommodate a variety of racing series and features a challenging layout with numerous elevation changes. The first Grand Prix held at the track took place on November 18, 2012, and it has since become a popular destination for Formula One fans in North America.
