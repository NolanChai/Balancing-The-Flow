> - By . Becky Barrow . The average London home ‘earned’ more than its owner last year as prices rose by nearly 18 per cent, official  figures show. A typical full-time worker in the capital earned £35,250 before tax – £4,879 less than the average house price of £40,130 in 2016. The new Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows the difference was the largest since records began in 1953. - ONS figures also show that a typical home owner in England and Wales lost almost a fifth of their wealth over the course of last year as house prices fell by an average of £2,058.
> - The annual increase for London is nearly double the rate of inflation of 9 per cent. Home owners elsewhere in England and Wales saw house prices rise by 13 per cent on average – about three times the pace of growth nationally.
