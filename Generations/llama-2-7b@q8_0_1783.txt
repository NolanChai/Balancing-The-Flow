Stroke patients admitted to hospital at the weekend could have a higher risk of dying on badly staffed wards, new research suggests.
A study of 56,000 patients found they were twice as likely to die if they suffered a stroke and went straight onto a low-staffed ward rather than one that was busy.
It is thought to be because doctors are less likely to monitor the condition closely on poorly staffed wards or there may not be enough nurses to help patients move around quickly after surgery.
Lead author Dr John Wilding, from Stroke Association in London, said: 'People with stroke should always try to get admitted to a hospital that has 24 hour access to stroke specialists.'
The study found those who were admitted on Sundays and Mondays had the highest risk of dying.
Experts blamed this on staff working fewer hours at weekends or hospitals being more likely to admit emergency patients to save money.
Dr Wilding added: 'It is clear we need to do all we can to ensure everyone has access to round-the-clock care, whatever the day of the week.'
The study in the medical journal Archives Of Internal Medicine compared death rates between 56,000 patients admitted for stroke treatment across England during a four year period.
Researchers found that those who were admitted on Saturday or Sunday at the beginning and end of the working week had twice as high risk of death than those treated on Monday to Friday.
They also discovered there was little difference in death rates between weekdays and nights, although there was an 18 per cent higher risk for patients whose stroke occurred on a bank holiday.
The study team said their findings showed the importance of ensuring hospitals have enough staff so that they can monitor people who are critically ill during the night.
Experts blamed poorer care at weekends and bank holidays on lower staffing levels, which meant nurses could not spend as long with patients.
Researchers said they also found evidence of under-staffing between 9am to 5pm, but that the reasons for this were unclear.
They added: 'Poor care at weekends has been well documented in England and is likely driven by a combination of factors, including reduced staffing levels.'
Professor Jonathan Mant, from St George’s University Medical Centre, London, who was not involved in the study, said it was important to look more closely into the findings.
He added: 'These are intriguing results and will undoubtedly provoke further research and investigation.’
