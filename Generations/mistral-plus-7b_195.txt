More than two dozen college players on three major Division I football teams staged an unauthorized protest of the NCAA during their games Saturday. The players took a knee or sat on the sidelines to protest what they saw as the unfairness of the system that allows the NCAA and its member schools to profit from their labor while denying them basic protections and compensation.

The protests began at the University of Missouri, where 30 players from the Tigers football team took a knee before their game against BYU. The protest was led by defensive end Michael Samuels, who said that the NCAA and its member schools are “exploiting college athletes.” He added that it was time for players to stand up for themselves and demand fair treatment and compensation.

The Missouri players were joined by 21 players from the University of North Carolina and seven players from the University of Oregon. The UNC players wore shirts bearing the words “Pay Us” during their game against Pittsburgh, while the Oregon players stayed in the locker room before their contest with California. Both teams cited concerns over student-athlete compensation as the reason for their actions.

The protests were met with mixed reactions from fans and university officials. Missouri head coach Barry Odom voiced his support for the players’ right to protest, saying that it was “a powerful statement of unity.” However, many fans and some athletic directors expressed disapproval of the demonstrations, arguing that they disrupted the game and detracted from the spirit of competition.
