1. It's a typical scene for the 46-year-old grandmother of four from Worthing, West Sussex, who has been helping to run an online business which sells kits of paints, brushes and paper so children can create artwork just like mum.
2. The company, Little Artist Kits, was set up by mother-of-two Sharon Sparling in 2017 after she discovered that her daughter Darcey had a passion for painting.
3. After Sharon's business took off, she asked Trish to join her and help manage the growing company which now has more than £645,000 worth of sales this year.
4. Now the pair hope Little Artist Kits will be in every school playground after securing a deal with Tesco stores for their products, including three different boxes containing art supplies and instruction booklets to encourage youngsters to paint like famous artists.
5. Trish said: 'I've never met Sharon before but we are good friends now. She is an inspiration for me because she took on a huge challenge and has built up such a successful business.'
6. Sharon, 49, from Rustington in West Sussex, launched Little Artist Kits with £2,500 after struggling to find artwork suitable for her daughter Darcey's fourth birthday party.
7. She said: 'It was my own idea but I didn't have the confidence to do it until a friend told me there were 13million mums in the UK and that 70 per cent of us don't do art at home so she encouraged me to go for it.'
8. Sharon began by making boxes containing paintbrushes, paints, pencils, watercolours and crayons as well as an instruction booklet which explained the meaning behind famous pieces of artwork such as Mona Lisa, The Scream and Girl with Pearl Earring.
9. She said: 'I wanted to create a kit for children to paint like the masters because I was finding it really hard to get something for Darcey's fourth birthday party.'
10. Sharon sent off 200 of her first boxes and got an order from a school in Birmingham as well as from another family, meaning she turned a £500 profit in the first week after she launched it online.
11. She added: 'I felt like I could do this and thought that if one parent ordered a kit then I had to think I would be able to sell 50 or 60.'
12. Since then, Sharon has sold more than £1million worth of boxes nationwide including through John Lewis, Amazon and on eBay.
