 That's correct! On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Mumia Abu-Jamal, a death-row inmate convicted of murdering a Philadelphia police officer in 1981, is entitled to a new sentencing hearing due to an error in the initial sentencing process. This decision does not necessarily mean that Abu-Jamal will be granted a new trial, but it does allow for a reconsideration of his sentence, which was initially handed down without a jury. The case has sparked controversy and debate over issues such as race, police brutality, and the fairness of the American criminal justice system.
