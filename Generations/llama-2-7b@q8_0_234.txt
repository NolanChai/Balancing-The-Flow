1. It's an interesting issue, and there is a lot that can be said about it.
2. However, I don't feel like responding to everything in this article.
3. In fact, I have just three points to make in response to it.
4. My first point concerns the title of the article: "Dingo attacks blamed on tourists as photos emerge".
5. The use of "blamed" seems a little overly-sensitive and accusatory.
6. Perhaps I'm being too sensitive here, but it is just such a loaded term.
7. I think the author could have found another way to word that sentence.
8. My second point concerns this excerpt: "The number of tourists visiting Fraser Island has risen sharply in the past decade from 234,000 in 2010 to almost one million visitors last year".
9. First of all, I would like to know what exactly "sharply" means here.
10. Second, this is a very misleading statement if you take into account that the population of Australia has been growing in recent decades.
   1. For example, we have had an increase from 20,597,500 people in 1971 to over 24 million today (in fact, that is an increase of almost 30% in only a few years).
   1. It's not hard to see how an island like Fraser Island could be seeing its number of visitors increase by more than one third just due to the overall population growth in Australia.
   1. So I think this excerpt is rather misleading when it states that tourists have increased "sharply" - especially when you consider other factors.
11. Last but not least, my final point concerns a paragraph in which the author talks about how photographs of tourists posing with dingoes on social media are causing backlash from locals:
   1. They say these photos are fuelling the attacks by increasing their visibility to dingoes who are starving after being forced away from their food sources due to large numbers of vehicles travelling through national parks.
    1. "We’ve seen a huge increase in social media posts showing people feeding and posing with wild dogs, which is not good for them," said Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) ranger Steve Dunn.
   1. "This means more people are seeing dingoes, who may start thinking that they can approach humans without any risk."
    1. Rangers say the increasing popularity of Fraser Island in recent years has contributed to a rise in attacks on tourists.
    1. Since 2014 there have been at least two fatal attacks – one on a 58-year-old Japanese woman, and another on an Indian student who was walking with his brother.
   1. "The increase in the number of visitors to Fraser Island has meant that dingoes are encountering more people," said Dunn.
    1. "They’ve always been here but it’s not often we have large numbers of vehicles on the island."
