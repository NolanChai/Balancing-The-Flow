As Wasps Rugby Club makes its eagerly anticipated return to Coventry, the city's residents are bracing themselves for an earful - literally. The Ricoh Arena is set to be filled with the sound of cheering fans and pulsating music as the team takes to the field for their first match in the city since relocating from London. But amidst the revelry, there are concerns that Wasps' new neighbors may not be too pleased about the noise levels emanating from the stadium. With the club having a reputation for being one of the loudest in the league, it seems that Wasps are on course to live up to their moniker as the "noisy neighbours" once again.
