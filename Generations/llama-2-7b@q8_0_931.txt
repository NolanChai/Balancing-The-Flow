California Governor Newsom's executive order mandating mask wearing in all indoor public places expired on Friday, leaving it up to local jurisdictions whether they want to keep their own stricter rules in place.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health confirmed to CNN that the county will continue requiring masks in many indoor spaces even as other counties allow them to be removed.

In a statement Friday, LA County officials said the statewide order had been an important tool but did not provide clarity on how they plan to proceed in the future.
