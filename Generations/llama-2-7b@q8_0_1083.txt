The mother and the grandmother of the teenage girl said that her daughter had been suffering from insomnia, headaches, night terrors, hallucinations and delusions after staying at the house owned by Bagans for a few weeks in 2018. 

They claimed she had to be exorcised of an evil demon. 

They also said that when they visited the home on a tour, their daughter suddenly started acting strangely and had to leave after just a few minutes.

'She was not herself at all,' the girl’s mother told News 13. 'We took her out of there as fast as we could.' 

The mother said that she and her granddaughter are still experiencing the same symptoms even today, four years after leaving the house. 

Bagans denied the allegations saying they were a hoax to gain attention from his show but later apologised for accusing them of lying.

A spokesperson for Bagan's Haunted Museum in Las Vegas, where the family lived after they visited his home, said he was 'shocked' by their claims. 

Bagans later apologised to the girl’s mother, saying that he had been wrong to accuse them of lying and has offered for her daughter to be tested medically.  

The teenager’s mother said she will be getting a neurologist to check on her mental health
