The Metropolitan Police said it had executed search warrants at an address in London and at two addresses in West Yorkshire on Wednesday morning. The force is continuing its investigation into allegations of sexual abuse involving political figures, which began in November 2014.

Police said the searches were part of Operation Midland and related to allegations of child sex abuse made by a man known only as “Nick”. They include claims that a former Labour cabinet minister abused children at Elm Guest House in Barnes, south-west London, which is now closed.

The peer who has been identified as the focus of the investigation is Lord Janner. He is 86 years old and is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.
