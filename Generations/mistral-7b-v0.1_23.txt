Their first date wasn't particularly promising - he took her to see The King Of Comedy, starring Robert De Niro and Jerry Lewis, which is about a deluded man who kidnaps a talk-show host.
However, the two hit it off and are still together 28 years later. They have four children aged between 14 and 23, and live in New York City. Allen, who now works as an executive at a financial firm, says: 'I love her to pieces. She is very special. I was fortunate to meet her when I did.'
Allen's wife is a computer specialist for the New York City school system. Before they married, she had a one-night stand with a man she met in a bar called The Tunnel, which was known as one of the most infamous nightclubs in Manhattan. She didn't know it at the time, but the man she slept with was the father of her future husband.
She became pregnant and gave birth to Allen - who did not find out his parents were once lovers until he was 37 years old. He says: 'We all have skeletons in our cupboard. It is what it is.'
