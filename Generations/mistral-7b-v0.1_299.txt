Aviation experts have said the most likely explanation for the disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines Boeing 777 is that it crashed into the sea somewhere between Malaysia and Vietnam. But some believe there may be another possible reason why the plane disappeared.

Experts at the UKâ€™s University of Leicester say there could have been a deliberate act by one or more members of the crew to hijack the plane for nefarious purposes.

It is understood that the crew of MH370 included 15 Malaysians and three people from other countries, including two pilots and five senior cabin crew.
