[**1.**](https://github.com/JeremyLS/leetcode-solution/tree/master/Python/204-range-of-values) **Range of values.**

I.e., a range of values is `[min,max]`, and the input `nums` can be represented by one or multiple ranges in an array `[arr]`, where each element is a range of numbers. If there are multiple ranges, they should be merged into one single range.

```Python
class Solution:
    def findRange(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int[]
        """
        # Time complexity: O(n)
        # Space complexity: O(1), constant space
        ans = []
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if (i == 0):
                ans.append((min(nums[i]), max(nums[i])))
                
            else:
                for j in nums:
                    # Merge ranges if necessary
                    if ans[-1][0] > j - 2 and ans[-1][1] < j + 1:
                        continue
                    
                    # Append a new range to the list, except when it overlaps with previous ones.
                    elif ans[-1][1] == j-1:
                         ans = [ans[-1]]
            
            ans.append((min(nums[i]), max(nums[i])))
        return ans
```
