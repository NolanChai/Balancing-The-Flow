A Liberian boy who danced his way through the horrifying ordeal of coming down with killer disease Ebola and cheered up his fellow patients has made a full recovery after 16 weeks in hospital.

Seven-year-old Prince Johnson was admitted to an isolation ward in Monrovia, Liberia’s capital city, on September 8, and was transferred to an Ebola treatment unit the following day.

He danced his way through his recovery – entertaining fellow patients with his moves as he recovered.

Now, more than three months after first being diagnosed with the virus which has killed thousands of people in West Africa this year, Prince is well enough to be discharged from hospital and is back at home with his family.
