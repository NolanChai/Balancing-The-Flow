The new circuit, which will be known as the Circuit of the Americas, is expected to host its first race in March 2012 and will feature 20 corners, including a 1,500ft long back straight. The track's designers have also incorporated elements of the Texas landscape into the circuit, including a section named the 'Texas Hill Country'. The news was announced at a press conference in Paris today by Bernie Ecclestone, CEO of Formula One Management, and Texas Governor Rick Perry.
