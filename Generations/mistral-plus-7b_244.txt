The four Georgia teens accused in the beating death of a fifth teen at a house party appeared in court on murder charges Monday morning, their attorneys said. They were charged with felony murder and aggravated assault in the February 28 attack on Antonio Ramon Torrez, 16. The defendants -- ages 15 to 17 -- allegedly punched, kicked and stomped on Torrez before he was fatally injured, according to police. All four pleaded not guilty at their arraignment.
