Cambridge student poster [/INST]

A Cambridge university student has been suspended after posting a controversial advert on Facebook which offered to pay others "easy money" in exchange for personal information. The 25-year-old computer science undergraduate, who has since deactivated his account, sparked anger and outrage among fellow students when he shared a post offering cash for details such as class schedules and names of lecturers and examiners.

The poster was widely condemned by students and academics at the prestigious university in Cambridge, with one describing it as "distasteful" while another criticised him for trying to capitalise on his fellow student's hard work . In a statement, the university said: "We were made aware of an advertisement which appeared on a Facebook page associated with students at the University of Cambridge.

The advert was clearly inappropriate and offensive. It has been removed and we have launched an investigation into the matter." A number of people responded to the original post, asking for information about lecturers and examiners. However, some were concerned about the ethics of sharing such personal details.

One person wrote: "This is not OK. How does he expect us to be able to trust our teachers when they know that we could potentially sell their information?" Another added: "It's disturbing to think that someone would try and profit from other students' work like this." The student, who has not been named, apologised for any offence caused but defended his actions.

He wrote on Facebook: "I didn't mean to cause any harm or upset to anyone. I just thought it was a way to make some extra cash and help out some people who are struggling financially." The university has not commented further, but the student's actions have sparked a wider debate about data privacy and how students should be protected when sharing information online.

The episode serves as a reminder of the need for greater vigilance when it comes to personal data protection, especially in the age of social media. It also highlights the importance of having clear guidelines on what constitutes acceptable behaviour and the consequences of breaching them. In this case, the student's actions were found to be unacceptable and he was rightly suspended by the university.

It is a stark reminder that personal data should not be shared without proper consent and safeguards in place. It also highlights the need for students and staff to be vigilant when it comes to sharing information online, especially if there is any potential financial gain involved.
