The United States Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that convicted cop killer Mumia Abu-Jamal has the right to a new sentencing hearing. The decision is a significant victory for Abu-Jamal and his supporters, who have long argued he did not receive a fair trial. In its opinion, the Supreme Court said that due to ineffective counsel during sentencing hearings, Abu-Jamal’s death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.

Abu-Jamal was convicted of killing Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner in 1982. He has been on death row since his conviction in 1984. The Supreme Court ruling comes after a federal appeals court previously overturned Abu-Jamal’s death sentence in November 2011.
