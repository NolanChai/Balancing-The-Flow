- Yes, the DH position has been a staple in Major League Baseball since it was introduced for the first time back in 1973 by Bowie Kuhn, the former commissioner of baseball. But even though it's been a fixture of the sport for more than half of its history, some think the DH position is now outdated and should be eliminated altogether.
- Major League Baseball has always been known as America's National Pastime. The game was first created in 1845 by Abner Doubleday who wanted to create a new sport that would be more entertaining than the traditional English "rounders". It wasn't until 1903 when Ty Cobb made his debut for the Detroit Tigers that Major League Baseball (MLB) became what we know today. Since then, there has been no end to baseball's popularity in America and around the world!
- The DH position has been a staple of Major League Baseball since its inception in 1973 when Bowie Kuhn was commissioner at that time (he is now deceased). It wasn’t until 1980 that both American League teams adopted this rule which allows players to hit during games where they don't normally play another position. This gives managers more flexibility when filling their rosters with different types of talent like pitchers or power hitters who may not necessarily have good glovework but still bring something special onto the field every day!
- A lot of people think that eliminating this rule would be a great thing for baseball because it would allow managers more flexibility when filling their rosters with different types of talent. But there are also those who don't like it and say they prefer the old way where everyone was forced to play multiple positions throughout each game regardless if they were good enough at any one single position or not!
- The DH rule has been a staple in Major League Baseball since its inception in 1973, but some think that it should be eliminated.
- Others argue that the DH is necessary because there are too many pitchers and not enough players to fill out every position on the field. Without the DH, teams would have to use more pitchers (which would increase their payroll) or play without any designated hitters at all - which could lead to injuries from overuse of certain positions!
- In addition, many fans like having a designated hitter so they don't feel like they are watching one side of baseball where players sit around while others do everything else for them. This means that even if you hate the DH rule itself (which some people do), it might not matter because most people love seeing how these guys go about their jobs when it comes down to crunch time!
- The DH rule is a staple of Major League Baseball. Some people think that the position should be eliminated and others argue for its continued use in professional sports leagues across America and Europe as well as Asia Pacific countries like Japan, South Korea & Taiwan where they have their own version called "designated hitter" (DH).
- In baseball there are two teams battling it out on a field with nine players each trying to score runs against one another by hitting home runs or getting on base through walks and errors among other things like bunts which don't count as at bat opportunities because they aren't worth points like scoring runs do!
