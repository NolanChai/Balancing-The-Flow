The energy produced would depend on the amount of light coming through the curtains and on the efficiency of the solar cell. If they are all blackout curtains, there'll be much less light coming in, so they wouldn't produce a lot of energy (unless the sun is really bright). You could put solar panels on top of your building if you live in an area with lots of sunny days.
