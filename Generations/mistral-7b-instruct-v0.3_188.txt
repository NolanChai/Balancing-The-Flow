 It's an interesting perspective to consider that future England supporters might view Wayne Rooney's accomplishments differently than we do today. However, it's important to remember that sports history is a subjective matter, influenced by various factors such as statistical analysis, cultural context, and personal preferences.

At the time of his retirement, Wayne Rooney was England's all-time leading goalscorer, having scored 53 goals in 120 appearances for the national team. He also holds several records with Manchester United, including being the club's all-time top scorer with 253 goals in all competitions. These achievements are significant and have earned him a place among England's footballing greats.

That being said, it's also true that perceptions can change over time, especially as new players emerge and redefine what is considered greatness in the sport. As you pointed out, future supporters might look back on Rooney's career with different eyes, influenced by their own experiences and the context of the game in the 21st century.

Ultimately, it's important to appreciate the accomplishments of players like Wayne Rooney while they are still active, but also to recognize that sports history is a living and evolving narrative.
