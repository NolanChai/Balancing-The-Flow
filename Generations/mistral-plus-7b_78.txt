As President Barack Obama channels his inner salesman to pitch military action in Syria, he shouldn’t be surprised when he finds a number of congressional doors already closed. The White House has yet to convince the American public that taking military action is necessary or even feasible. Public opinion polls show that nearly half of Americans oppose any kind of military intervention, and many lawmakers are hearing from their constituents that they don’t want to get involved in another Middle East war.

Obama will have a difficult time convincing Congress to approve military action in Syria. The majority of Republicans are opposed to military intervention, and even some Democrats have expressed reservations about getting involved in another foreign conflict. Many lawmakers believe that the United States should remain focused on our own domestic issues rather than taking on new foreign entanglements.

The President will need to make a compelling case for why the United States should take action in Syria if he wants Congress to support it. He will need to provide strong evidence that military intervention is necessary and that it would serve America’s interests. Without a convincing argument, lawmakers are unlikely to approve any kind of military action in Syria.
