I have a few ideas and am wondering if you might be able to help me with some of them?

Firstly, I wondered whether there was any way we could put this in the form of a blog post or some other article (which may or may not make it onto the homepage) – we can put as many pictures on our site as we like so do you think that is possible? I would also be interested to know what size image you have and whether there are any copyright issues?

I am wondering if we could use a picture of one of your holidaymakers, with the words ‘My Holiday is in Safe Hands’ on it somewhere (I was thinking along the lines of [this](http://www.travelmail.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Holiday-is-in-safe-hands_697x448.jpg) or something like that?

The second thing I am wondering is whether we can use the campaign as an opportunity to try and build some links – would you mind if we quoted your press release in its entirety, with a link back to it (and hopefully the rest of your site)? I have a couple of ideas but will get back to you on those.

And finally, do you have any other comments or feedback?
