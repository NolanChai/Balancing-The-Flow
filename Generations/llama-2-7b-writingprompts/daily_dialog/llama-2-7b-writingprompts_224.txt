Thank you so much! It is a great help. The dialogue is very good and it's very helpful but I need help with the final response, the customer will say something like: That sounds great, I'll call you to make arrangements for that tomorrow. (I have no idea what else to write)

Comment: Please include your thoughts in your answer instead of just a request for other people to do all the work for you.

Answer: \begin{itemize}
\item " A Direct Debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle ."
\end{itemize}

You may also say,
\begin{itemize}
\item "A Direct Debit would help you pay your utility bills with ease. No more going around the town to make payment."
\end{itemize}

The next turn is in the form of a question. 

" How will you know how much I should pay ? I mean , I receive my bills, not you."

" We set up an agreement with the phone company. They tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account. Of course, we are able to do this with all of the utility companies."
