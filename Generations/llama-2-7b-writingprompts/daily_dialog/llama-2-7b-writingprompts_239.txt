It's interesting how you said, "I love history but I â€™ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened." Because it seems to me that you like to learn and understand history. The reason why you liked studying history in school was because you enjoyed what you were learning. You enjoyed your teacher's classes, which makes sense since they were probably very interesting as well. Also, it does seem like you struggled remembering dates because of all the other information you had to take into consideration when studying events. If your teachers taught the reasons behind them and focused on more than just memorizing a bunch of dates then maybe you would have enjoyed history more? It also seems that this is where I agree with my partner, because even though she said she loves learning about the past we don't need to know what day it was. We can learn from things that happened in the past and try not to repeat them by remembering why they occurred in the first place. If your teacher had taught you all of these things then maybe you wouldn't have struggled as much with dates but instead learned how to understand events better than just knowing what happened on a certain day?

I'm not sure what you are looking for here, so I'll just give my thoughts. Let me know if you have any questions about my answer or suggestions about how to make it better :) 

Having trouble remembering dates is an issue a lot of students have. It can be tough to remember everything and not knowing the exact date makes it even harder to go back and figure out when exactly something happened in relation to another event. For example, if you only know that one thing took place on or about 1991-93 and you are trying to compare it to something else happening at the same time, how can you be sure if they are happening simultaneously?

Some people think learning reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened. In some ways, that is true because knowing what motivated an event can help you better understand why it happened in the first place and what sort of effect it may have had on others or society as a whole. However, having only one side's version of events leads to bias and sometimes misunderstandings since people are more likely to remember things from their perspective rather than someone else's point-of view which could lead them down an incorrect path when trying to figure out what really happened.

I wish I had been your history teacher! Your grades would have gone up for sure because I understand the importance of both remembering dates and reasons behind events so they can be properly understood.
