I often recalled the days when Tom and I were madly in love. It is a very romantic way to look back at your relationship, even if you didn't know that it would end like this.
Very romantic?
Yeah. He always tickled my finny bone with his college stories.
You married him for that reason?
Definitely not. The most important thing was we loved each other.
