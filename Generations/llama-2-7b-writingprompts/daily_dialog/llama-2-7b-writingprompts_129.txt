The dialog between my parents was very typical of them. My father wanted to go out for steak, which he always does because it is his favorite food and it has been like this since he was young. He grew up in a town where the main industry was farming and ranching so naturally most people were meat eaters. I on the other hand have never liked meat and I am not sure how my parents dealt with it at first. In my opinion, they just accepted it and moved on as it didn't really phase them too much. I personally do not like to think about where my food comes from so it is easier for me to go along with eating meat because of this. My father always has a steak whenever we go out or order in, which is fine by me since I don't mind having one once and while myself.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" Hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat? Sure! What do you feel like having? I really feel like having a big juicy steak! Oh, sure. I don't eat meat but that's fine. I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right?" "I didn't know you were a vegetarian!" "I'm not, I am a vegan." "A what?"

The rest of this dialog is not really my best work, please do not judge it based on that.

" You would be surprised how easy it actually is ! I have been doing it for over 20 years now . The only things I miss are the taste of eggs and dairy products , but I don't get them any more . "

" Well . Do you still eat honey ? That comes from an animal right ? "

" Yes, bees make honey out of nectar they collect. It does contain pollen though, which is a byproduct of flowers that are eaten by insects and small animals , so I can't really eat it . "

" OK then . You should try being a vegan for a day ! "

" I have ! It was hard at first , but you get used to it pretty quickly. The only thing that is different is that if you are traveling , it takes more planning and time to find restaurants with foods that will satisfy your needs . Otherwise , I just eat the same things everyone else eats . "

" Oh . That's cool ! Well we should probably start heading out then . There are some vegan friendly places in the area right ? "

### Response: 
This dialog is a bit rough, but it is not my strongest work. Please don't judge too harshly.

" Yes , there is a restaurant that makes all their food from scratch and serves a variety of vegan dishes . I have gone to this one before when I needed someplace quick for lunch during a break at work. "

" Oh , OK ! Let's go to that place then ! What do you feel like having ? "

" I was thinking about trying something new tonight , so I would love to try the pizza and salad combo . It looks pretty tasty on their menu . "

" Ok good choice . Do you want to order it or should I? ``

`` I think we will split one . That way we can each get our favorite dish if there is anything else we would like to try. ``

`` OK then , well see you in a while !``
