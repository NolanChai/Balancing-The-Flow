**What did you do last night?** - [I just stayed at home and watched TV.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_UEFA_Champions_League_Final) **Did you watch the Barcelona versus Madrid game?** - Yes it was a very evenly matched game. **What were the results of the game?** - It ended in a tie. **What was the actual score?** - It was 3 all. **Really? I thought Barcelona was going to win, they are a much better team than Madrid**.

I watched the game last night. It was a very evenly matched game and it ended in a tie with the score of three all. I thought Barcelona would win but unfortunately Madrid is better team than them. If Barcelona had played normally, they should have won.

Hey ! Thanks for your response ! You are correct ! There is one more round of games this season, and then they have the playoffs. I hope you like watching football as much as me! I've never had anyone come over to my house to watch a game before. It sounds fun ! Can we talk about it later ?
