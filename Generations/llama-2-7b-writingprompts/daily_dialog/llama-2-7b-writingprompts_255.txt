You write dialog, not instructions. 

You don’t want to have people tell each other how they are feeling or think they know what the other person is going through. 

When you put yourself in a character's head, it’s almost impossible to get out. 

If your goal with this piece is to get good at dialog writing, I can’t help but ask: Why? You already have the best practice for that. Just watch how people interact and talk around you. Write down some of those conversations in a journal and see what happens next. You may be surprised! 

Instead of writing dialog, write a story. 

When I say “write a story,” I do not mean you have to write an entire novel or novella. You could start by just writing a short paragraph about someone. But make sure they are fully formed characters with names and personality traits that fit the situation. Make them come alive on paper. 

Write what’s going on around them, what’s happening in their head, and how they react to it all. Put yourself into each of these characters’ shoes and let them tell the story for you.

I hope this helps!
