"Oh, Amelia! That's terrible. Do you have another job lined up?"

"Not exactly. I do plan to keep teaching yoga, though."

"Okay... well, if it helps any, I hope something better comes along. What are your plans in the meantime?"

"I'll probably do some freelancing, or volunteering, or maybe just travel for a while. Who knows what the future will bring, really? But I know that I need to try new things and find out who I am outside of this job."

"That's a big decision to make on your own. You do you!"

**Most of my coworkers have been laid off. 4 out of the 5 in our department left last week and today they told me they were closing down an entire division of the company. I've seen some other employees get laid off, but I still feel pretty confident in keeping my job so far**

**It's a little unnerving that we haven't had any raises or bonuses in two years though and they just let go of five people last week**

I think there is a comma missing. But you are on right track.

"Amelia, could you spare a few minutes?" "Sure," What do you need? "Well, I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice." 

Really? Why? "It's complicated. But basically it boils down to one thing. This company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go"

But surely they won't fire you! You're one of the most experienced managers here!" 

Well, to be honest there's another reason." "It's a better offer," Where will you be located?" The head office is in New York but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog, but keep everything as it is (same format/word choice etc.)

" sure . What do you need ? "

" but surely they won't fire you ! You're one of the most experienced managers here ! "

" well , to be honest, there's another reason. I've got a better offer."

" well that's great news! Congratulations!"

"Where will you be located?"

"the head office is in New York but I'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . "

"it'll be sad to see you go, but it sounds like you've found yourself a great opportunity."

"I have. I feel lucky. I look forward to dealing with overseas companies at the same time having a chance to use English more."

I have no idea what I'm doing here.

The above is the response for the second turn only.
