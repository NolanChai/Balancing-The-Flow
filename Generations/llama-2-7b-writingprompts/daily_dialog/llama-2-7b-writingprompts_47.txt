This one is tough. How about: `` Heard what?'' `` Deborah already had her baby.'' `` I didn't know that!'' `` I thought you knew.'' `` I honestly did n't know.'' `` The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces.'' `` That's good to hear.'' `` Will you go and visit them?''

Wow. That was actually pretty good. It's still missing some important details like whether or not Deborah had a boy or girl, how she and the baby are doing now, but you got the point across and I enjoyed reading it.
