"We are going to have a picnic tomorrow at the picnic center." **Sarcastically** "That's great". [Sigh] I wonder where we're going to get our food... I'm sure it won't be as good as what you make, though. "Now let's get things ready." I say this without thinking of how the sentence sounded. **The voice in my head is telling me that it was sarcastic and that the tone should've been different.** You see, I never really had a dad... Well, until about 10 years ago when he left for the second time... The first one lasted about three months, and then we were back to square one with no father figure in my life... My mother was so disappointed that she started drinking more... My sister's doing just as bad. She used to be a good cook but now she hates cooking, and it seems like everything I try to make tastes like crap (Well, except when I eat at the center). I think she got me into this to get my mom off her case... "Now let's get things ready." She says, and I almost want to tell her that I can't cook but then I see something shining in her eyes. It's probably just a reflection of the light from the kitchen, but it looks like hope. **Hope?** Hope that this time we actually get to eat at the picnic center. I'm glad my dad doesn't know about my mom's drinking problem... He would never want to see me again if he did... And neither does she... She always tells people how much of a disappointment I was and that all she wanted was an easy way out so they wouldn't have to take care of me. So now it's just her and me... And maybe we can make this picnic work out without any problems! [Sarcastically] "Don't worry," she says with a smile, "There are all kinds of things in the center." I nod my head in agreement and start walking towards the kitchen. As soon as I get there, she grabs me by my hand and pulls me over to where one of our cooking stations is located... It has all sorts of ingredients on it like meat or vegetables or whatever else you would need for a picnic! She starts putting together something that looks delicious but I can't figure out what she put in it because she hasn't told me yet. **Maybe she'll tell me later...** 
"That's much more convenient," I say with a smile, "We don't even have to bring the flavorings." **I just realized that I'm starting to sound sarcastic again! I hope no one hears it or else they might think I'm mean.** "That's great!" She replies while smiling at me and winking with her left eye. **Her left eye? Did she get hurt in the past? Or is she just trying to distract me from what's about to happen next...? ** [Sarcastically] "That's much more convenient," I say, "We don't even have to bring the flavorings." This time I mean it when I say that! There is no way I will let her ruin my food with some of those weird ingredients from that place.
