A small but loyal group of regulars sit in front of their computers, eyes glued to the screen as they enter their information. They are each here for a reason; maybe it is because they are researching their family tree, or it might be that they simply like to read and do not have a lot of money for books and libraries. Whatever the reason may be, all these people have one thing in common; they come to this library every day. The doors open at seven and close at six, so if you are late, there is no admittance, unless of course it was closed early due to some emergency or disaster, but that does not happen very often. For the most part, everyone who walks in is treated with respect and kindness. No matter your age, race, gender, or ethnicity, you are all welcome here. A library can be a place of refuge for people looking to escape their troubles for an afternoon; it could also just be a nice quiet place where you can come to relax and do some reading. Whatever the reason, this is one of those places that you just can't help but love. This small town library has been in existence since before the turn of the century (circa 1908); it was built with money donated by Mr. Thomas Edison who had recently moved here from his home state of Ohio. He had no children so he decided to invest some of his earnings into building a new school for all those living in this township. When asked what type of library he wanted, Mr. Edison stated that it should be able to hold up to 10,000 books at any given time and also have plenty of shelves available for additional storage as well. As you walk through these doors today, do not let anyone tell you otherwise - this is one special place!

" What's wrong Mr Edison ? " asked the librarian . `` Well , there are many things that could be done here but it does seem a little boring at times . `` replied Tom . `` I mean , if you were a real writer then maybe your next book would sell better than this one did ! `` said John , his friend and fellow library patron . `` That's what everyone keeps saying - so why don't you get out of here and write another novel ?!?`` asked John in frustration . `` I am trying ! But my writing is not very good right now . `` replied Tom , sadly . `` Maybe if I had more money then it would be easier to publish something . `` continued Mr Edison , dejectedly . `` Well then maybe you should work harder on getting some income from somewhere else ! `` said John angrily . `` You're right! That is probably true . `` agreed Tom quietly . `` Ok, let's get back to talking about writing novels - that sounds like fun ! `` exclaimed John excitedly . `` Ok , great idea ! `` replied Mr Edison enthusiastically .

" I can't believe we have been here so long without finding any sign of life ! " exclaimed Dr. Edison as he slumped against one of the walls that made up this vast maze they had stumbled into . `` It doesn't look like anyone ever came through these doors before , and if anyone did then it must've happened centuries ago! `` said John in disbelief . `` Let me get my flashlight out so you can see what I mean ! `` said Dr Edison as he reached down to grab something from his bag . `` Good idea - here , take this too please ? `` asked John as he handed over a small brown box which contained a few items . `` Sure thing , no problem ! `` replied Mr. Edison with a smile on his face . `` Ok then let's start exploring right away - there may be something useful in here somewhere ! `` said John excitedly as the two began walking through one of many hallways that made up this maze-like structure . They walked for about 15 minutes until they came across what appeared to be an old door which had been partially blocked by some debris on one side - but after removing this obstruction with their flashlights it became clear that there was no way out through here so instead they decided to try another pathway . After walking for about 30 minutes more without finding anything useful , Dr Edison suddenly stopped dead in his tracks . `` What's wrong ?!?`` asked John worriedly as he noticed Mr. Edison staring intently at something on the ground nearby - only to find out that it was nothing more than some old pieces of paper which had been left behind by whoever (or whatever) had last occupied this place ! `` I'm not sure yet , but if these were just thrown around here then perhaps they may be useful sometime down the line - especially if we can figure out what language/symbols were used on them . `` replied Dr. Edison excitedly as he began picking up each piece carefully before placing it back in his bag once again . `` Ok , let's continue on our way ! `` said John eagerly while pointing towards yet another hallway which was located directly opposite of where they stood at this moment - only to find out that there were no other paths left for them so instead they decided to start walking down one of many side corridors until finally reaching what appeared to be a room filled with old furniture ! `` I wonder if anyone ever lived here ?!?`` asked John in amazement while pointing towards one corner - only to find out that it was actually full of boxes containing various items such as books , clothing , tools etc . `` It looks like someone did once upon a time , but what happened next remains unclear at this point ! `` replied Mr Edison sadly before reaching down to pick up something which appeared to be an old book from one of these many boxes . `` I wonder if it would be possible for us to read this ?!?`` said John excitedly while opening up the pages - only to find out that they contained nothing more than some strange symbols and numbers ! `` What's going on here ?? `` exclaimed Dr. Edison in confusion as he tried to make sense of these strange scribblings . `` I don't know , but let me see if there might be anything useful inside this place before we leave ! `` said John angrily while pointing towards another box which had been left behind by whoever (or whatever) was responsible for occupying this room in the first place! After opening up yet another box he found what appeared to be some sort of map - only instead of showing any type of location on it , it showed nothing more than strange symbols along with numbers ! `` I'm not sure if we could ever use something like this but at least now we know where all these different rooms are located which makes things easier . `` said John excitedly before pointing towards another room - only to find out that there was yet another doorway leading into another hallway ! `` Ok then let me check back here later so you don't get lost again ! `` said Dr Edison while putting away his flashlight for now . `` Sure thing , thanks a lot ! `` replied John gratefully as he began walking through one of many corridors until reaching what appeared to be an old door which had been partially blocked by some debris on one side - only after removing this obstruction with their flashlights it became clear that there was no way out through here so instead they decided to try another pathway . After walking for about 20 minutes more without finding anything useful , Dr Edison suddenly stopped dead in his tracks ! `` What's wrong ?!?`` asked John worriedly as he noticed Mr. Edison staring intently at something on the ground nearby - only to find out that it was nothing more than some old pieces of paper which had been left behind by whoever (or whatever) had last occupied this place ! `` I'm not sure yet , but if these were just thrown around here then perhaps they may be useful sometime down the line - especially if we can figure out what language/symbols were used on them . `` replied Dr. Edison excitedly as he began picking up each piece carefully before placing it back in his bag once again . `` Ok , let's continue on our way ! `` said John eagerly while pointing towards yet another hallway which was located directly opposite of where they stood at this moment - only to find out that there were no other paths left for them so instead they decided to start walking down one of many side corridors until finally reaching what appeared to be a room filled with old furniture ! `` I wonder if anyone ever lived here ?!?`` asked John in amazement while pointing towards one corner - only to find out that it was actually full of boxes containing various items such as books , clothing , tools etc . `` It looks like someone did once upon a time , but what happened next remains unclear at this point ! `` replied Mr Edison sadly before reaching down to pick up something which appeared to be an old book from one of these many boxes . `` I wonder if it would be possible for us to read this ?!?`` said John excitedly while opening up the pages - only to find out that they contained nothing more than some strange symbols and numbers ! `` What's going on here ??

I would say something along the lines of, "Well then we'll need lots of food! It will probably cost us a lot to feed that many people. We should start planning on getting some sponsors for this." or, if she were more formal: *"As you know, with so many people expected at our event, it would be wise of us to plan ahead and make sure we have enough food! If we do not get sponsorships from local businesses for the party then the cost will fall entirely on us, which is why I suggest planning now."*
