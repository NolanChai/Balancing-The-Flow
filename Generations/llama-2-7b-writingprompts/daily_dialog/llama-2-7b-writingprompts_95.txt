Hello. I've created an app that will help you write your next line of dialogue. It uses natural language processing, and artificial intelligence to make the most likely response for this situation. Please use it for your next turn in the dialogue. The results will be right here in 20 minutes or less, guaranteed!

Hi Joe, I am doing good today. How have you been doing Mary? Things are going well for me. Want to go see a movie tonight? My parents are taking me to dinner tonight. Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night instead? What movie did you want to see?

I think that the first dialog could use more emotion. It sounds kinda bland and I'm not really sure why you are writing it in this format. To me it looks like a transcript from an audio conversation, but without any dialog marks or context clues.

You should try to write something along these lines:
"Hi Joe , how are you doing today ? " *He glances at his watch* `` Not too bad , Mary . How have you been doing , anyway?'' *She shrugs her shoulders and smiles in a self-deprecating manner. She has always been more of a listener than a talker, but she tries to be nice to Joe when he asks how she is.* "Things are going well for me , Joe ."
`` Cool, that's good to hear!'' *Joe smiles and adjusts his tie* `` Want to go see a movie tonight ?'' 

`` My parents are taking me to dinner tonight.'' `` Could you go with me to the movies on Friday night , instead?'' `` What movie did you want to see?'' *Joe's eyes widen and his breathing quickens* `` There is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer .'' 
`` I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ” '' 

That's what you should write, but the dialog might be a little too short. It's hard to say. Try to add some context in between the dialog and it might work out for you!
