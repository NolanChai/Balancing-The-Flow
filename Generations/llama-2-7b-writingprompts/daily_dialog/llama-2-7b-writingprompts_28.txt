It was a tough game and they had to pull out all the stops. They're in the final, no question about that. Now there are two teams left fighting for the grand prize. It'll be a very hard battle but I think they've got this one. 21 is gone but 86 will take his place and they won't let go of this victory so easily. Good luck guys!
