" It is. A little off the top and sides and back to have clean lines . "

" Okay. Is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm? "

" It's natural. My friend told me that you know how to work with curls. "

" That's my specialty! Let me put this around your neck."

" Do you have any product that controls frizz?"

" With the cut I will give you, we can minimize a lot of that."
