Help me write the next turn in this dialog without any explanation or format changes. 

"Sure, we could meet at my office around lunch time if that is okay with you?"

"Yeah, that would work fine for me."

"I will make sure to leave some of my business cards so you can have them on hand when you are ready to look at houses. Are you open to looking during the week or only weekends?"

"Any time works for me but I'm more available on the weekends, would that work with your schedule? "

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Okay, how about we start looking at homes on Saturday morning and then take a look at Sunday's open houses as well ? That way if there's one that looks good, I can come back to it on Sunday . What do you think ? "

" It sounds like a plan.  Have a nice weekend !"

Thanks for your help, but unfortunately this was a test question. This is my first time doing this and I'm still very much learning how these questions work so if you could let me know what went wrong here that would be great. (I think it's because there are too many instructions?)
