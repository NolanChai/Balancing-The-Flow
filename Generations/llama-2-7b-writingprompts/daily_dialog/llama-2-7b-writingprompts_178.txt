" Do you think it is unfair for police officers to give tickets to people who parked in red zones? "

" I do not agree that they are fair . I believe that if we were all driving more carefully, then the streets would be safe enough for people to park anywhere. It is almost as though parking regulations and traffic laws make things worse than they need to be . "

You're writing a conversation between two people, and the last person has asked a question. You are required to answer that question in any way you wish with no explanation or format changes. 

The format of this prompt is very vague; it doesn't give us much guidance as to how we should answer. In my opinion, we should keep the dialogue consistent, so if I was answering this question myself (if someone asked me), I would say "I parked in the fire lane".
