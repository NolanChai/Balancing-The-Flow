The writer is correct, a well-designed business card can catch people's eyes.
I believe that most of the people want to be remembered, so they choose their cards with creative designs and unique fonts or styles. 
A business card is not only used for self promotion but also used as an advertisement tool. 
By creating a memorable card, you have created another opportunity to let someone know about your company.
I like the font and colors of this one. It stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations.
A business card is great tools for promoting personal business . It wonâ€™ t take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . And you will always notice it from your collection . For they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card .
