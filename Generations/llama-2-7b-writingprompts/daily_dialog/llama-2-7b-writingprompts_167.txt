Help me write the next turn in this dialog, with no explanation or format changes. 

"Okay , well that sounds great ! How much is it ? "

" That depends on how many days per week you want to work out and whether or not you need a nutrition plan . But if you are looking for the basic training package, we can get you started at just $150/month . We'll also give you 6 free personal training sessions in your first month . "

The question in this situation is: do people really need a personal trainer to go to the gym?

We can assume that they are on their way to the gym, or have just left it. They probably bought the membership card from the receptionist and all the instructions about the work-out plan came with it in the form of a booklet, which they never read or kept.

The lady is probably a regular there - she's going to go back again. We can assume that they had personal trainers before (since most gyms offer this service as part of their membership card) and were dissatisfied with the results. She was out of shape and did not achieve her fitness level and goal, which is why she decided to come back and try another trainer.

She probably got a booklet again from the receptionist at the entrance or even from the receptionist in the office building where her workplace is located - where her gym is as well. She also most likely took it home and looked through it (or she would not be asking about it) but did not really read it (since she does not remember what it said, and I'm guessing that she's never read a fitness booklet before).

So the question should be: "Do people need personal trainers to go to the gym?", as opposed to "How do you get this done ?". She probably does not really care about the work-out plan and how it is customised (although I'm guessing that they gave her a standard one, since she's new) - but instead is concerned about the actual results.

The lady can assume that there are various types of equipment in this gym - if it has not been explained to her otherwise - so she'll ask about the type of exercise and its techniques to help her achieve her fitness level and goal, which the personal trainer will most likely explain to her before he starts training her.

### Response:
I believe that this conversation should be started by the receptionist or a clerk who is greeting new members. This person needs to have good knowledge about gym equipment, services available there and membership plan types. In my opinion it would look more realistic if instead of giving her a personal trainer he gives her information about the most basic work out plan that includes fitness assessment, nutritional consultations and training with proper technique on various kinds of gym equipment.

### Response:
The conversation in this case should be started by a receptionist at the front desk of a gym or any place where people can purchase memberships to the gym or some other services offered there. The receptionist would inform a potential client about what kind of plans are available, and what exactly is included with each plan. At that time he/she may suggest different kinds of gym equipment which might be more suitable for their needs. The receptionist should not offer a personal trainer at this point in order to keep the conversation simple as well as short. It would make no sense to ask about how to get it done if there was no mentioning of such services beforehand.

### Response:
It is implied that she's looking for the best option with regards to fitness training and workout equipment. If her previous experience did not go according to her expectations, then a personal trainer would be advisable in order to ensure that she achieves her goal. This person could help her choose from different types of exercise equipment depending on what is available at the gym and what kind suits her the most (if the gym provides various options). He could also show her how it should be used, demonstrate exercises or provide some advice regarding diet so that she can get into shape as soon as possible.

> The conversation above is taken from a real gym in Bangalore. You can see that they follow an interesting pattern of giving you what you need followed by the cost or price details. A lot of gyms use this kind of pattern. If I were to improve on the dialogue, I would definitely reorder them in some way so that it does not sound repetitive and monotonous.
