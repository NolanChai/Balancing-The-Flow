I love how the first response is so formal, and then the second has a bit of a snarky tone to it.

Commenting on the format changes - what do you think about putting this into an ordered list (ie., the dialogue as separate items). I've done a couple of these before and they work fairly well for me, especially with some longer prompts like this one.

Comment: Your second response is fantastic! I would suggest splitting it up though so you have 2 responses instead of 1. This makes the format more similar to others and allows people to easily distinguish your answers from other's.
