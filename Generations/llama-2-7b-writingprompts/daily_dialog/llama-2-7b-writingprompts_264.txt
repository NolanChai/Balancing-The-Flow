Thank you! This was a fun exercise. You nailed the tone and dialogue in my story. I added some colorful language to it, but not too much. It's really fun how you can make an action or line of dialogue feel more vivid with just one word (i.e., "come", instead of "enter"). Thanks again!

`` Come in, come in. What can I do for you?'' `` Professor Donald, are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester?''. `` Yes, I am applying on it.''. `` I wonder if I could enroll in it. I know it is a graduate course and I'm a junior, but...''. `` Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up.'' `` I know, but geology of the American west is my major interest and I have done a large reading in the field.'' `` Well, if you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll.''
