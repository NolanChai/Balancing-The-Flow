It is recommended that you use Norton Antivirus, which is currently available for free if your system is registered to a university computer. I always run my antivirus at least once a week, and even more frequently if I'm planning on downloading a large file or am otherwise worried about the safety of my computer. You should also use an anti-spyware program such as Spybot Search & Destroy , which you can download for free from [https://www.safer-networking.org/](https://www.safer-networking.org/). You will want to run this software once a month at least, and sometimes more often if you have the time. The best way to protect yourself is to use a firewall, which blocks out most of the traffic that would be sent directly to your computer, unless it passes through some predefined rules. In other words, it's like having a guard on your front door who only lets in people you know. Norton Firewall is a free download from [https://www.norton.com/](https://www.norton.com/). You should install this when you first get your computer, or even better if you have one already installed but aren't running it.
