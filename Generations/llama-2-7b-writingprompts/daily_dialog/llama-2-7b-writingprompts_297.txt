**The lady is very nice and pleasant. She asks if she can help him in some way and he tells her that he's in a rush, which immediately sets off an alarm. Why is the man so rude to such a nice person? The woman then offers apple pie with ice cream, but he declines.**

" Yes , I'm in a bit of a rush . Could I have a piece of apple pie please ? "

" Certainly ! Would you like it with ice cream ? "

" No , thanks . "
