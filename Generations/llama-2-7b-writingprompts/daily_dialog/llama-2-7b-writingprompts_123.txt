Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" What about if I pay you half now and the other half later ? "

" No , we don't accept credit cards for such a high-end television set . "

" Then how much is the total price of it ? "

" You will have to make up your mind now ! If not, it would be hard to sell this t. v to anyone else . "

```
"That's so great !"

"How much are you selling it for?"

"This t.v is only $ 2500."

"You can't be serious."

"That's how much this t.v costs."

"That's too expensive for me."

"This television is of very high quality."

"You can't go down on the price."
