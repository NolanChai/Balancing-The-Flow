Help me write a response to this scenario, using at least 30 words. 

“I’m going for hike in the southern Rocky Mountains,” Tom said. “I go as much as I can; I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.” “It would be nice to get out of the city, do you want some company?” she asked. “Sure, let’s hike together!” he replied. “My friends and I were just talking about it this weekend; we’re going to head up into the mountains too.” He went on for a bit about how beautiful hiking is before they started discussing where they would go that evening after work.

Help me write the next turn of dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

**Him : ** **So do you have any plans for the weekend Tom?** **Me : ** **Yeah, I'm going to go hiking in the southern Rocky Mountains.** **Her : ** **Oh do you go hiking often?** **Me:** **I go as much as I can, I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature** **Her :** **It would be nice to get out of the city, do you want some company?** **Me:** **Sure but it will be a long hike 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?** **Her:** **Yeah I go a lot too, I saw a bear and mountain lion on my last hike.**

I think you did a good job with this one. 

Here is what I would do differently:

The first line should read: Have any plans for the weekend, Tom?

The second paragraph should be as follows: Oh, do you go hiking often?

The third paragraph should start off with You love to hike because you can get in touch with nature.

The fourth paragraph should be: It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?

The fifth paragraph is missing a word at the end. The sentence should read as follows: Sure, but it will be a long hike; 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?

The sixth paragraph should read as follows: Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.
