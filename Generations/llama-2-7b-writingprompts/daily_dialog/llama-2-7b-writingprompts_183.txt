The bus station's staff greeted Liu Lichi as soon as he got off the bus, asking him whether his trip was pleasant or not. Mr.Liu said that the bus ride was very comfortable and it took 15 minutes to get there from the bus stop. The staff then asked how old he was and Mr.Lui responded by saying that he is 20 years old now.

" Good morning. Are you Mr.Liu? My name is Liu Lichi. How do you do? Please be seated, how is your trip here? Quite good, I think. I came here by bus and it took me about 15 minutes. Oh yes.How old are you? Twenty. Hum still a student? "

I need someone to give me some feedback on what's wrong with the way I'm writing dialog. The instructor's comment was that there were no commas before and after each phrase, which makes it difficult to read (I've added them in below). Thanks for any help!
