You might think that you're just a lowly goon, but you actually are pretty interesting. You can be whatever you want and do anything you wish. So go out there and become a rock star! Don't stop until you've achieved the impossible dream!

The dialogue was very well written. It is clear and concise, but also has a lot of character. I liked how you used dialogue to show that they're in the middle of a heated argument as well. Keep it up!
