We're trying out the format of the story on Twitter as we go. So far, it hasn't been great at getting people to click through. But there are some interesting insights from this experiment and it may be helpful for our next project. 

1) It has been difficult to get people to engage with the content.
2) It is hard to keep up the quality of the dialog in the limited number of words.
3) The conversational style has been harder to maintain than I had thought.
