Hi ! I'm trying to figure out the next dialog. This is all that i got :

Customer: Excuse me . Check please . 

Cashier: OK , how was everything ? 

Customer: Very nice . Thank you . 

Cashier: Would you like this to-go? 

Customer: Yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ?

You mean the dialog between the customer and the waitress? I would do that like this:

"Excuse me. Check please." The waitress looked at her watch impatiently, a look of disgust on her face. "Oh, what are you getting at eight-thirty in the morning for anyway?" she muttered under her breath. Then she looked up. "Sure, sure. Here you go," she said gruffly as she placed a bag with two coffees and an English muffin into a plastic bag. The waitress took the money out of the cash register and handed it to the customer. "Here is your receipt." "Do you take credit cards?" the customer asked politely. "No, sorry, we're not allowed," said the waitress brusquely as she walked away from the table.

**It's a bit of a challenge for me to imagine dialogs in any format, but I think my best shot is: ** 
```
[Terri] Excuse me. Check please. [Check clerk looks up from computer screen, and puts pen on table.] Okay. How was everything? [Terry gives the check to clerk.] Very nice. Thank you. Would you like this to-go? [Clerk nods as he finishes the transaction with another customer and begins putting it in a plastic bag. He hands it over.] Sure, no problem. Here you are. That'll be 25 dollars. [Terri fishes out her purse and takes out a card.] Do you take credit cards? [Clerk nods, and looks for the pen.] Yes, we accept Visa and MasterCard. Okay here you are.[Terry takes her food bag and leaves]
```

> Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Thank you so much! It was a pleasure to help you, and hope you have a nice day." *He then hands me my card back and walks off.*
