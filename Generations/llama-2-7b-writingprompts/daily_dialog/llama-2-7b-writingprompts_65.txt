Hi , Gary, what happened? I was waiting for you at the theater. Why didn't you meet me there?
Come in, come in!
I thought we were supposed to meet here. Don't you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn’t make sense to meet at the apartment. 
“Hi,” said Gary. “What happened? I was waiting for you at the theater.” “Why didn't you meet me there?” “I thought we were supposed to meet here.” “Don’t you know our movie starts at seven? And we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven. Then it doesn’t make sense to meet at the apartment.”
“I’m sorry,” said Gary. We must have misunderstood each other.

Hi everyone, this is my first response so it will not be that good. I would like some feedback on my writing, especially the wording, grammar, sentence structure etc. Thank you!
