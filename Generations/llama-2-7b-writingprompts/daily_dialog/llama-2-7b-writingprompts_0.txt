'We better get moving,' said Shelby. 'We don't have much day light left, and we need to find a place to sleep tonight.'
The two took off again into the woods. They hadn't gotten far when they heard a loud rustling sound. They quickly stopped and listened for any more noises. The wind blew through the trees making the leaves rustle, but other than that, nothing. Shelby thought he saw some movement in his peripheral vision. He turned to see a large bear coming towards them. It was too late to turn around and run so they both stayed where they were and started talking loudly.'Hello bear,' said Shelby. 'We are going camping tonight, is that okay?' The bear stopped about 40 yards from them and looked at the two young boys. He then turned and walked away without a sound.
