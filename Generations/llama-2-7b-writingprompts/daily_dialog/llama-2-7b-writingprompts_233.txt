Sorry, there is no such thing as a bad question. So, instead of judging this question, I'll try to help you by providing some context. There are many different types of financial ratios that an organization or individual could use in making financial decisions. The most common ratios used by organizations are the return on equity and return on assets ratio. The return on assets ratio measures how efficiently a company is utilizing its assets to generate earnings. This ratio takes into account both debt and equity, as the higher this number the more efficient the organization. While the return of equity measures how well an organization's management is using shareholder capital (equity) to create value for them by comparing it to their profitability. The credit rating agency you have been working with will use these financial ratios to determine whether or not your business qualifies. Credit scores and debt are also important factors in determining if an organization meets certain criteria. Debt to equity ratio measures a company's liabilities against their total shareholder funds, which can be either common shares or preferred shares depending on the type of organization that you work for. In order for this organization to qualify they will need to ensure these financial ratios are in line with industry standards and any other regulations set out by credit agencies such as Moody's & S&P etc.. If your company fails at meeting these requirements then unfortunately it will not receive financing from banks which would be a bad thing because you would lose your job and all the people working for this organization may be fired due to lack of funding. The good news is that there are many other ways in which companies can get funding, so I suggest finding another job if your company does fail at obtaining financing from banks!
