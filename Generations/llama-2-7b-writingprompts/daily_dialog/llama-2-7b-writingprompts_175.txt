I'll answer your questions.

1. There are no comments regarding the grammar, punctuation, or sentence structure for this dialogue. It is written without explanation and follows the format requested in the Instruction page. However, I suggest that the dialogue be rephrased to be more natural sounding:
> Help me write a more realistic dialog with no explanation or format changes. 
2. I have added a paragraph break for readability.
3. I would suggest you add a second paragraph describing what you are working on and why this assignment is important.
4. You've used a period in place of an ellipsis at the end of each question to show that Mike farmer has made it into the Olympic team, beat the national record by 0.1 of a second, and won the gold medal (respectively). I would suggest you use an ellipse with a space in between for better readability:
> ... Mike Farmer has [ellipses]...

5. I have corrected the spelling errors and punctuation mistakes.
6. You've added dialogue tags ("he said") without attaching them to the appropriate sentence. For instance, at the start of the second paragraph you've used "I see" as a dialogue tag without specifying which person spoke it. I have corrected all these issues by using parentheses after each speaker:
> (Mike) ... he beat the national record by 0.1 of a second ... ."
7. The word "do" has been misspelt on two occasions. It should read "d'you", but there is no need to use it in this instance as there are only two speakers and they have been clearly identified throughout:
> He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a [do] ... 
8. You've used "don't" where you should write "don't you":
> I think we won ’ t win many gold medals... 9. There is no need to put question marks at the end of each sentence as they have already been provided by the ellipses:
> What do you think our chance are in other events?
10. You've used an apostrophe incorrectly:
> Our team put in a lot of practice.
