Help me edit my dialogue. 

I have never done this before so it might not be perfect but I will appreciate any help you can give me. 

The first time I did it, the guy said no and I thought of another question. When I went back to him, he was offended. He asked why I was asking him that if I already knew he would say no. So I'm thinking maybe I should have done a little research into how to approach this so I do not get a negative response from the guy next time.
