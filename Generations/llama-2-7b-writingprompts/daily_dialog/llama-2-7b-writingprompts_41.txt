The answer to question two and three should be:
"I'm Chinese." (for the first question)
"My domicile place is Hebei province." for the second.

The instructions are wrong though, because in English we ask questions as follows: 
`What is your nationality? Where do you live?'

There should also be a period after "I'm Chinese".
