I'm going to give you a different response based on whether or not the character was at the battle. If they *weren't* there, it's easy - they'd be shocked and upset by how everyone is treating them like heroes. 

If they _were_ at the battle, however... that's a bit trickier. I would argue that if they were at the battle then *everyone* is showing respect to them, including themselves. If someone who was *not* there started saying things like this, they'd be pretty shocked and upset about it.

If you want a more complete answer, let me know - but I'm going to give you an incomplete one now based on what you've already written, because you did say in the original prompt that there is no format change or explanation needed.

" Every time when heroes came back from the battlefield , we took our hats off to them . "

" You were showing respect and admiration for them . "

" I wish I were a hero . "
