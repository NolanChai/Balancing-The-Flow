This question has two parts. I can answer one and leave you with a hook for the other. The first part of this question is about how much money you have to spend while you are in America. They ask where the money will come from, which means that they don't want you to tell them about any sources of income outside of America (so if your parents pay your rent, just say they do). This allows them to determine if you will be able to support yourself financially during your stay and prevents them from having to consider whether or not someone else is sponsoring your trip.
The second part is related but has a slightly different meaning: **Who pays for your airfare** (as opposed to who pays for something while you are there)? The purpose here seems obvious: If you've paid for the ticket yourself, then they know that no one else will be paying any of those costs. This question could also refer back to Part I as a way for them to check on whether or not you have enough money (or credit) available to purchase an airfare if needed (so if there were some sort of problem with getting a visa).

I went to a job interview today. They asked if i was willing to relocate, I said no, that i already lived in New York and didn ’ t want to move anywhere else. 

They told me they would try their best to keep me but they had to make it official tomorrow so I needed to decide if i wanted to work here or not. 

I said thank you for the time today, that i appreciated the interview and would let them know my decision by Monday morning. I got home and told my roommate about the job interview and she was really excited that something might happen with me getting a new job because I haven ’ t had anything since March and it ’ s been hard for us financially so we are praying something works out soon. 

I am going to go for a walk now before bed and then read some of my books for a bit before sleep. Hopefully i have time to get through at least one before the week is over! Have an amazing night everyone!! ♥️

    " Alright ! So you ’ re planning on leaving your house and dog with some neighbors and living with your brother in another country for three weeks … I guess you don ’ t need to come back after the baby shower. But why not just get a hotel or something ? This is nuts . Do you even have an address for this place you ’ re staying at ? "
