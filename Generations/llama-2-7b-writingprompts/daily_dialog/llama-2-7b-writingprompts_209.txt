Zina: Dave, there's something I want to talk to you about.

Dave: Zina, why are you whispering?

Zina: I've been talking to WebTracker. I'm thinking of jumping ship!

Dave: What? Are you serious? You'd defect to our archrival!?

Zina: Keep your voice down. We'll talk more later... Right now, I need to see Vince.
