The office party is coming up. 

I need to help out with the food and entertainment. 

What part would you like me to take care of, the food or the entertainment? 

You don't know what sort of entertainment we should have for it? 

Let's make sure we are on the same page - do we want a formal or informal gathering? 

Let's make this a formal party.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"I need help with the office party. Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do - the food or the entertainment? I have no idea what the entertainment should be. Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal gathering? Now for food should we have Chinese or American food?" "Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American food?"

The dialog is interesting and fun. It's a little hard to get the flow going, but once it gets rolling it does so very well. I would have changed a few of the lines. The first sentence is a little repetitive; maybe try: Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Yes sir, we could split it. What part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment?" I would have said: "I need help with the office party." "Yes sir, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment?." 

The third sentence is a little awkward; maybe try: "I have no idea what the entertainment should be." I would have said: "I don't know much about entertainment." The second and fourth sentences are also hard to flow. Maybe something like this: "Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal gathering?"

"Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American food? I would have said: We should go with American food." The third and fifth sentences are also awkward; maybe try something like this: "We could split the entertainment. What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded music?"
