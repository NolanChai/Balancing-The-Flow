" Well, you are still very young, so that would be ok . Just be careful to not get tired on your way back home. You know how late it is now right ? The traffic is also very bad these days , and I don't want you getting in an accident. I think we should all go out for lunch tomorrow together ? We haven't had the chance yet to introduce ourselves. "

" Yeah, sure! That would be a good idea . Let me call my boss first though.He may have some business with me this evening and want me back here . I will call you once I know if we can meet or not for lunch tomorrow ! See ya around then , I guess."

"Oh, well..I hope you're able to handle it.It seems pretty stressful for me working nights at a convenience store.I've only been here for about a month and I can't really say I like the job.Do you have any hobbies or interests? "

- How come you dropped into this company today? Nice to meet you here. (I would use the word `` me'' or `` myself'' instead of `` here'' in this situation, right?) 

- My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office. I didn't know you were working here. What a surprise! How long have you been doing this? That is great. Do you have to work the night shift? No, in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with. I work five days a week. Do you enjoy work here? It is hard to say. But I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant. Sometimes, I am really under great pressure when it gets busy. Take it easy. I'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant. I hope you haven't been given much trouble in the job. Luckily not. The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss.
