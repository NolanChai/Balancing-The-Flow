" That is pretty expensive . Where did you go to find such a dress ? "

" It was actually on sale at Helen's Boutique , and I got it for one hundred and forty-five dollars . That's the best deal I've ever gotten there , and I shop there quite often . Do you know that place? "

" Yes , I went to their boutique yesterday. They had a great sale on this dress, but they didn't have my size in stock . The lady at the counter told me it would be coming soon so if I come back tomorrow, I might be able to get it for less money than you did. "
