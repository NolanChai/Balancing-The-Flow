I've edited your sentence to match the previous conversation. The instructions are in blue and I added the italics. You may disagree with my changes, but that's fine! I just wanted to make it sound more like a real dialogue (and to make sure that we're not saying exactly the same thing).

"I was surprised to see how few people you have on-site. You provide a wide range of goods and services but have a very small workforce."

"It depends on the time of year, at peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch. We also contract out certain services all year round, for example cleaning. We run a very tight operation!"

"Do you handle the recruiting yourself?"

"Sometimes we use a local employment agency. It depends on the job."
