I would recommend adding an additional sentence or two to each instruction, so as to better explain what should be written.

-"Food is less expensive in a cafeteria , because you serve yourself ."

"How do I do it? "

-"Just pick up a tray, then put a knife, fork, spoon and paper napkin on it and stand in line."

-"How long will it take to reach the buffet?"

"Not long, because people rush for lunch."

-"The line sure does move fast."

-"Tell the man behind the counter what you want."

-"OK. I like that green vegetable but I don't know how to call it."

-"Just point to it if you don't know the name."
