" Great ! How many people are coming ? "

" About 20, but I am hoping to expand the list of RSVPs. "

" OK , so do we need some more food? And how about entertainment ? Do you have any theme in mind? "

" Maybe we could just order pizza and play a few rounds of charades . "

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" OK , well , let's coordinate our efforts . Should this party be formal or casual ? "

" I think it should be casual . "

" I agree . Next , we have to decide on food . We have a choice of Chinese or Continental Cuisine . Which one should we have ? "

" I would prefer Chinese for this party . "

You can't really get much more formal than chinese and casual, so that's good. You could also go the other direction and say something like 
`` Great choices! Since they were both pretty similar, let me see how my other coworkers feel about these two options and then we'll make a decision on which one to choose''
