Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"I'm sorry sir, but if you have gone over our complimentary amenities we will be unable to provide any more to you. Thank you for your understanding. If you have further questions, please visit our customer service desk."

This was a difficult one. If it was the first turn, you would think that it was a joke, or maybe the hotel clerk is just trying to get out of answering your question. I think if we made this the first turn in this dialogue, and then added "So , why's there a guy in my room ?" on the next turn, then it would make more sense.

" Hello ! How do I get more amenities ? "

" I'm sorry , sir . I'm not sure I understand . "

" I'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . "

" Oh , I see . So , you're saying that you've already run out of your amenities . "

" No , no . I've got plenty left . "

" Now I'm confused again ! What is the problem ? "

" What am I going to do about souvenirs ? "

" Oh , I get it ! You want souvenirs ! "

" Yes , I've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs . "
