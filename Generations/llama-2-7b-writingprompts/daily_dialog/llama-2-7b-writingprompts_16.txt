"Channel 5? Which channel is that again?"

"It's the channel right after channel 4 . Are you blind?!"

"Well, I can't really see it... It's dark in here."

The program is an interview with Mr.Brown from the local government who is telling us that the roads are in very bad shape and they need to fix it up immediately but first they have to raise money for it. The next program is about a guy who got shot and killed in a mall robbery by the police. Then there's another one about a bunch of teenage kids that were fighting, breaking stuff up at school today and the school has decided to send them home early because their parents need to know what's going on with their kids. 
The last program is an interview with some woman who thinks her daughter is possessed by a ghost or something and she needs someone to exorcise it out of her daughter because she just keeps acting crazy and doing weird things like running up into walls at night and eating the bark off the trees.
