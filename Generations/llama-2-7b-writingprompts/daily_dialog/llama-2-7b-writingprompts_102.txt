" Do n't tell me that , I ca n't hear it , Doctor . "

" Oh, I do n't know . I suppose we can give you a couple of pills that may lower it a little . "

" But they'll do nothing for my condition ? They' ll help me to work longer hours? "

" No , no . The pills only stop the pain, not the cause . It is your condition which is at fault. You have got to rest. "

" Do n't tell me that again , I ca n' t hear it Doctor . I know what you ' re going to say. Rest ? When? Who will do my work for me? Where am I going to find the time, and who will pay the bills? "

" Well , you'd better find the time . The only way you're ever going to get well is by resting. No work at all, and a diet of fruit and vegetables. "

" What? You must n't tell me that again , Doctor ! I ca n' t hear it! I ca n' t hear it . "

" I can not help but say the things as they are . "

" I know, I know - but you do n' t understand. It is the condition of life which makes my blood pressure high ; and I know how to cure that condition . But if I tell you, you will n't believe me. And now, Doctor , please, please, help me to get better. I want to be able to work longer hours ! "

" It is a hard road you have chosen for yourself, but it is only on that road that you can find the cure . You've got to learn that life is not all work , and that there are many things besides food and money which we need in our lives - like health, love, friendship, family. "

" I know everything about health, love, etcetera, but they have n't helped me so far . Why should I trust you? What can you possibly do for me ? "

" That is the way you feel now , but after a little time, once your body has recovered from the strain you have put upon it and your mind has become free of the worries which are making you ill, then all things will look different . Then you can see that there really is more to life than just money. You've got to get out in the sunshine for a change - walk and play and sing. You' ve been so wrapped up with work that you've forgotten what it's like to live. "

" It may be true, but I ca n' t believe it . I ca n' t hear it , Doctor . "

" You do not need to believe it - you only need to try it and see what happens ! But, you must promise one thing : that you will go away for a holiday . Just for two weeks-and after that you can come back and tell me whether the things I say are true or not. "

" Oh, yes , Doctor . If there is any chance of getting well again, then anything you say goes. I ca n' t hear it - but I promise to try ! "

" That ' s good enough for me . But first of all , you must have a rest - get plenty of sleep, and eat only fruit and vegetables. And then after two weeks' holiday, come back and tell me how it has been . "

" I ca n' t hear that . I ca n' t bear to think about being away for so long! The company will go down the drain - my staff wo n't know what they ' re doing-they wo n' t be able to cope without me. But you do n' t understand, Doctor ! If I stay at work too much , then I'm going to die, and that is the end of all this. "

" Oh, I know it seems a long time-but if you take care of yourself for two weeks, then you wo n' t be too tired to enjoy your holiday. And after that - well, who knows? You may find yourself feeling better than ever before! "

" Oh no, oh no! Not the words I can't hear ! Not even you Doctor , you ca n' t make me take two weeks off work and go away! It wo n' t be good for business - we ' d lose too much money. And anyway, it would n' t help. It wo n' t make any difference at all . "

" You do not know that , you can not know that until you try. But if I am right, then when you have recovered from your holiday and come back to work, it will be a brand new world for you - you wo n' t recognize yourself . "

" Oh no! Doctor , please ! If there is any chance at all of getting well again, then anything you say goes. But I ca n' t believe that I ' m going to feel different after two weeks away from work. It wo n' t make any difference at all - and anyway, it would be bad for business . "

" But if you go on working as hard as ever without a break , then you may find yourself unable to work at all , because of ill health. And that is much worse for business . You would be out of action - and if you do n' t believe me, then get some rest now before the trouble really starts ! "

" Oh no! If there ' s any way of getting well again, then anything you say goes, but I ca n' t hear that. I ca n' t bear to think about being away for so long! The company will go down the drain - my staff wo n' t know what they ' re doing-they wo n' t be able to cope without me. But you do n' t understand, Doctor !

" Well, if you must, then just for two weeks-get plenty of sleep, eat fruit and vegetables only, and go away from work completely. You do not need to believe that it will help - only try it and see what happens . But please, please, promise me one thing : when you get back , after your holiday, come straight here so I can look at you and see how well you are getting on ! "

" Oh no! If there ' s any way of getting better again, then anything you say goes - but I ca n' t believe that two weeks off work will help. And anyway, it wo n' t be good for business . The company wo n' t know what to do without me! "

" You'll see , if you take my advice and go away for a while, then when you come back I will be able to tell that things are much better - the strain on your face will have gone and you' ll be full of energy again . And after two weeks' rest it wo n' t matter whether you' re at work or not-it all comes down to how well you' ve looked after yourself . "

" Oh no! I ca n' t hear that! It wo n' t do any good. You wo n' t be able to tell that there has been a difference because it wo n' t be good for business. And anyway, if two weeks off work is going to make any difference at all , then I wo n' t need you - so what are you getting out of it? "

**I'm so glad you asked.**

The way I see it, there are three fundamental things that can cause an overworked person to slow down:

1. **Exercise:** You need to get your blood moving around the body more often - especially when you spend all day sitting at a desk or behind the wheel of a car. This is one of those "easy" fixes, but it's also the hardest to accomplish. I'm not going to tell you how to do it because it's different for everyone and every situation; just think about what kind of exercise would benefit YOU most and find some time each day or week to get your blood pumping!

2. **Sleep:** This one seems obvious, but I'll say it anyway: you need rest! If your body is constantly tired all the time then there are going be consequences (like stress) which can lead back into overwork again - so make sure that *you* get enough sleep each night no matter how busy things may seem on any given day.

3. **Eating healthier:** It's hard to work if you're hungry all the time because there won't be any energy left once those hunger pangs kick in! So make sure that whatever food choices YOU are making (whether they're good or bad) aren't causing your body extra strain by having too much sugar or fat content - even if it feels like they taste great at first.
