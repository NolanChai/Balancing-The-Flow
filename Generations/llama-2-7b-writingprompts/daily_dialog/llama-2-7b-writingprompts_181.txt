It was the first thing you could have said, just give him directions. You don't need to tell him the street is over on Callaway Street, that's obvious. He already knows where he needs to go. The admiral hotel, he can find it easily enough in a city as big as Chicago. And then of course he'll get lost again trying to find it.

The second thing you could say is, "Why do you need the directions?" because he obviously has no idea whatsoever where Callaway Street might be. But that would just confuse him even more and make the whole situation more awkward than it already was. So better to give the directions like you did.

I'd say that, except I'm pretty sure I know how Chicago works and it still took me three tries to get there from O'Hare airport when I first moved here, so no offense but maybe this guy has a point?
