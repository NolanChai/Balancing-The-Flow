**Henry, are we there yet?** **You look tired, sweetheart. Do you want to rest? Maybe we should get you a new shirt; this one looks awful dirty and stained with food. What's that on your face, did you rub it off against the wall? No wait don't tell me; I bet you were sitting there crying, all alone in your little corner of a world. Poor thing, that's how you always are, so afraid to let anyone come close, so desperate for attention and affection, and yet, too stubborn to ever give it or take it from someone else. You only know how to get what you want by taking advantage of people and then leaving them when you're done with them. That's the way your mother raised you: using every last ounce of her strength to keep up appearances while making sure she never, *ever* let anyone love her or see her for who she really is. You were born to be a star, little man; you should take after your father, not your mother**.
