You've got some really good details here, but it seems like you're missing something.  For example, how does the guy feel? Does he have any other options besides going away from his hometown? What is keeping him there? I would start with those two questions first and work your way around from there. You could try taking out some of the text or adding more details as well to make it flow better.

### Instructions:
Write a response in which you describe how the speaker's actions have affected you or your life, explaining her/his role in the narrative and how she/he helped create that role. 

It had been my dream from an early age to get into journalism. I loved writing from when I was just young enough to read and write at the same time. But then came the age of high school where one's future was decided. The pressures of being accepted, getting good grades or even having a decent career all seemed to take over. It became more important for me to fit in than it was to find my passion. So I did what most do. I picked a path that had the least resistance and kept going. 

It wasn't until my first semester of college when a professor recommended me to join the school newspaper. It was then I realized how much I missed writing. It had been almost a decade since I wrote for fun or just because I wanted to, but that changed right away when I started writing for the paper. The more I wrote, the better I felt about myself and my career choices. The next semester I enrolled in a class that taught me how to write news stories. That's when it all clicked for me. 

I knew at this point that becoming a journalist was something I had wanted to do since high school. I could feel the passion that came back from writing, and that was all I needed to know. I changed my major to journalism with hopes of one day being a reporter or an anchor. Today I still love writing and getting information out there for others to read about. 

### Response:
The first thing I thought when reading the instructions was "where is this guy's passion?" The beginning of your essay does not really give any real details on how he feels or where his passions lie. You could try adding more details to make it more relatable or try and use more detail instead of just stating facts. You might also want to try writing in a different style.

### Instructions:
Write a response in which you analyze the source's point of view, summarizing arguments and evidence used to support claims. 

"When we take a look at history and see what we can learn from it, we should not overlook the lessons that are right in front of us." 

"History is only a product of one perspective," the author wrote. "We must all have the same viewpoint to understand any historical event or occurrence." 

In my opinion, I think that this author has taken a very idealistic point of view when it comes to history and what we learn from it. There are many different perspectives on anything that happens in history, and for us to only see one side as true is almost foolish. What if Hitler was actually a good man who just got pushed over the edge? What would that say about his actions? And what if he had never become leader of Germany during WWII? We'll never know because we only look at history from our perspective, not his. 

The author is right in saying that we need to learn from history, but I don't think it's fair to just look at one side of things when there are multiple stories to tell. History should be something we can all learn and grow from, not just one specific group. The way the world is today shows us how important it is to have multiple perspectives on history so that everyone has a chance to learn and grow. 

### Response:
It seems like you've done most of your work already, but I think there are some details you can add. It also seems like you should probably look into using more descriptive language in the text or adding more details for clarity. 

### Instructions:
Write a response in which you discuss what questions the source might raise about the issue and indicate how you respond to each one with evidence drawn from the article and/or your own experience. Examine these questions to understand different perspectives on the issue and suggest alternatives or counterarguments that have been overlooked by the author of the text. 

I think the most important question this article raises is why we are still seeing a gender gap when it comes to pay in the workforce. The wage gap has always been an issue, but now more than ever there are many women in leadership roles who should be making as much or more than men. So what's stopping them? 

In my opinion, I think that part of this problem is because we still live in a patriarchal society. Women are still seen as the nurturer and the caretaker while men are viewed as providers. This can have an effect on how much money someone makes at work because they'll always get paid more if they do something manly like being a plumber or electrician versus doing something less manly like teaching or nursing. The wage gap has existed for so long that it feels like we should be past this point already, but unfortunately it isn't as simple as changing some laws or policies on equal pay. 

The only way to truly fix the gender gap is by changing our societal views of women and men in general. It's not enough anymore just to say that everyone should get paid equally for doing the same work, we need to also look at why we think this way. What makes someone more valuable than another person? Is it how much money they make or what they do for a living? If so then maybe women are viewed as less important because they're not earning as much in the workplace which means that their contributions aren't valued as highly by society. 

It may seem like we will never see an end to this problem, but if we start working together on changing our views about what makes someone valuable then maybe one day soon we can close the gender gap once and for all! 

### Response:
This is a great response, but I think it's missing some of the details. You've done most of your work by asking questions to get readers thinking about different perspectives, but you should try and use more descriptive language or add some detail. It also seems like you might want to look into adding in a counterargument so that you don't sound too one-sided.

I have a one-month vacation saved up. How about a trip to Europe?
> " I could go for that. But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year."

Oh, but I really need to leave this town for a change. Working day after day has worn me out. Do you have any other suggestions?
> " we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away. How about the countryside? There must be many interesting places and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec."

Wonderful! I think that's a great idea. How soon until we can make this happen? I can't wait!
> " tomorrow, I have an appointment with my dentist. What about next Monday?"

Perfect. I'll start preparing today. If we're going to drive, I'll need to fill up the tank.

" I'm sorry, but I really need to leave this town for a change. Working day after day has worn me out." 
- In my opinion it is best to use an adverb phrase instead of a single verb in the beginning. This makes your writing more clear and gives you a bit more freedom when it comes to describing your character.  

" I think that's a great idea. How soon until we can make this happen? " 
- In this case, it seems like a good idea to use an adjective phrase instead of just the verb. It makes your writing sound nicer and more natural.

I am doing this for fun and also for practice. So, I did it in my first language (German) ðŸ˜Š
