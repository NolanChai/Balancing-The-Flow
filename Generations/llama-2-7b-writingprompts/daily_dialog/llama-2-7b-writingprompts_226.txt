> The second person will need a better explanation on this one. It feels like the speaker was surprised, or expecting something different from their spouse's reaction. I would be more interested in why you think they would have an issue with it, and what they may say to fix it.

```
"I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says painful words everyday . "
```
> This feels too short to me for a 250 word story, I would add more. Also, this may sound weird because of the wording, but it is not clear if he's saying that his son uses those words or they are bad habits his wife has. Maybe it could be restated like: "I don ’ t want you to be worried , but our son has some bad habits now . He says hurtful things everyday ."
> I would also add a question mark on the end of the sentence, because it sounds more natural that way.
```
" What words ? Can you tell me ? "
```
> This is a little wordy for what it needs to be, and maybe I'm just weird about this but I would not say can you tell me like that. Maybe something along the lines of: ``Can you give me an example?'' or ``What are some examples?''
> The sentence as is right now is awkward, and sounds a little overly formal. Also, I think if the speaker knows what he's talking about it would be obvious to him that this person has bad habits. Maybe they could add something like: ``I know you don ’ t mean your son to hurt me. But when he does these things, he hurts my feelings.''
```
" Honey , I don ’ t know what to tell you . Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . "
```
> The first part of this sentence needs reworded because it is hard to understand: ``Of course Tony is a young child.'' or something along the lines of that. Also, if she knows her son has bad habits I would think she'd know he can learn and reason as well. Maybe he could say: ``Tony does n't mean to hurt you when he does these things. He just does n't know any better right now. But I'm sure he will eventually.''
> The response was a little confusing, especially the first sentence, but here is what it looks like if you took out what seemed to be unnecessary and reworded parts: `` Of course Tony is a young child . But do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . He has already been potty trained , can count to 20 , knows all of his letters , colors, shapes , etc. and he even speaks in complete sentences now.``
> In the end, I would suggest:

I think we need more context. Was this an interview, a therapy session, or something else? What does the dad do for work and how does he interact with his son? The way it is written now sounds like the mom is complaining about her son's behavior, but maybe she isn't? It's hard to tell. I think there are better ways of setting up these prompts.
