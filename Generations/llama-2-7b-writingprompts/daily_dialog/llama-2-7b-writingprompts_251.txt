I'll be a bit of a grammar nazi on this one, but I think you've done well, so I won't mark it too badly. If you want to know why I marked this down, feel free to ask me (you can find my name under my post). I'll try and explain in more detail.

1) I'm not sure what you mean by '... write the next turn'. Are you wanting the whole of the conversation? Because there's a lot missing here, so it doesn't make much sense to me right now. 

2) The use of the word "them" in the first sentence is somewhat ambiguous - which group are we talking about here? Is it the businesses who wined and dined them or their employees/colleagues that were there for a week? The pronouns can be fixed by changing either:
* "It was great, they wined and dined us all week."
* "It was great. They wined and dined us all week"
* (Personal preference) "They've been on a business trip for the last 7 days - they've been wined and dined by their company each day."
* "It has been great, they have wined and dined us all week long."
3) There are several errors here: 
   1. The use of 'is' as a verb instead of the noun (first line).
   2. "They" should be in plural form - we can change this to either 'they've...' or 'they've all...'. This is because they are talking about more than one person here (they're not talking about their business, but a group of people from the company).
   3. "Great" should be capitalised as it begins a sentence - "It has been great."
   4. The word 'all' needs to be followed by a verb/participle form or pronoun (in this case: all week) - we can fix this by changing the second line of dialogue: "Great. They wined and dined us all week long"
4) There is a problem with the use of the word 'all' here again. The word should be followed by a verb, pronoun or participle (see above). I'm not sure how to fix this though, because you could either make it a negative statement ("They did *not* wined and dine us all week") or change the sentence slightly so that it makes sense: "They have been wining and dining us all week".
5) The second line should be capitalised at the start - this is for grammatical reasons (it's a new sentence).
6) If you put a full stop after 'week' in the last line, then it makes the dialogue sound quite strange. Either remove the full stop or make it another sentence ("It has been great. They have wined and dine us all week long."), or change the wording so that it is one sentence - either: "Great! They've wined and dined us every day this week" or "It's been a great week - they've wined and dinned us each day".
7) If you're going to use ellipses, make sure that the person using them is talking. If it's the listener rather than the speaker (in this case), then replace with brackets or commas instead. You can see what I mean here: 
   1. [Sally] How was your business trip? [Mark] Great - they wined and dined us all week long!
8) The use of 'dined' in the second line doesn't make sense to me (I think this should be either 'wine-ing', or 'dinner'). If you want to stick with 'dined', then you need to make it plural - "They've been dining us all week".
9) It looks as though you've used a comma rather than an apostrophe. Commas and apostrophes should be in pairs (unless they are used for punctuation purposes, like this), so you might want to change one of those around. You could also try changing the use of commas altogether - I'd probably remove them altogether if I was doing it: "Great! They've wined and dined us every day this week".
10) If you're going to be using quotation marks, then put a space on either side before (or after) the speech. Otherwise, just keep your dialogue as is - no need to use speech marks there: "Great! They've been wining and dining us every day this week"
11) You might want to add some punctuation to make the dialogue flow better: 
   1. Mark: Great. It's been a great week. We've been wine-ing and dinning ourselves silly. (This is a full stop, but there are no spaces either side of it).
   2. Sally: Really? What were you doing for the rest of the weekend? Didn't you go to that new restaurant last night? The one that was featured on Masterchef? I saw the episode last week - it looked amazing! (This is a full stop, but there are spaces either side of it).
12) You might also want to add some more descriptive adjectives in place of 'great', to make your dialogue sound more natural: 
   1. Mark: It's been an incredible week! We've had the time of our lives - wine-ing and dinning ourselves silly (full stop)
   2. Sally: Really? What were you doing for the rest of the weekend? Didn't you go to that new restaurant last night? The one that was featured on Masterchef? I saw the episode last week - it looked amazing! (full stop).
