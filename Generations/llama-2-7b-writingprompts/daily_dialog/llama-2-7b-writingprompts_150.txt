Zina: Hey, Vince. How are you doing?
Vince: Pretty good. Just wanted to say thanks again for your help yesterday with my project. 
Zina: Hi Vince! How is the work coming along for the online auction?
Vince: Oh yeah. I'm glad you mentioned that. I think we need to hire someone new to manage it.
Zina: Can't Elvin handle it?
Vince: I think he's got too much on his plate already.
