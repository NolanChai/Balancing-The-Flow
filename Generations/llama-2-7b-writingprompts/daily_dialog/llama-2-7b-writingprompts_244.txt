**It seems that the next turn is about the doctor who asks if there's any problem with Jimmy, then he sees him in bed and talk to his mother.** 

**The last sentence of the dialog does not make sense **

This is pretty good, the only thing I can say is that it would be better to replace `help me` with some kind of command (e.g. `please help`) as it will sound more natural.

The formatting should stay the same but for the last sentence. It might sound a little weird if there's no paragraph break after the first person speaking.

How's Jimmy today? Better, thank you doctor. Can I see him please, Mrs Williams? Certainly, doctor come upstairs. You look very well, Jimmy! The boy mustn't go to school yet, Mrs Williams! And he mustn't eat rich food. Does he have a temperature, doctor? No he doesnâ€™t! Must he stay in bed? Yes, He must remain in bed for another two days! He can get up for about two hours each day! But you must keep the room warm! Where's Mr Williams this evening?
