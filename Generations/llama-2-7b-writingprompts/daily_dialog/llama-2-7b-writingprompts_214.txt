You did great! Now just fix up the formatting and we're done :)

> "Did you already take the history exam?"

"Yeah. It was hard. When do you take it?"

> "I take it tomorrow morning. There is so much material that I don't know what to emphasize on. What types of questions did you get?''

"Mostly on the civil war. You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr had on American society."

> "What about Abraham Lincoln? Did you get any questions about him?"

Hey, I am just wondering if you can help me with my project. This is supposed to be a conversation between two friends that are studying for an exam. They do not know what type of questions will be asked but they have studied from different parts of the book. One has done more on American history and the other did more on Martin Luther King Jr. I was wondering if you can help me with this project or maybe even give it a shot yourself! The assignment is due on 3/5. Thank you!

Write another part of this conversation without changing anything in the format.

**Ramon:** *Hey man, how's it going?* **Teddy:** *Good! How are you doing today?* **Ramon:** *Not bad, I'm working on a research paper due tomorrow, but I think I have most of the info for my essay now. Are you studying for finals or anything?** **Teddy:** *Yeah, I just got done with that, and I've been trying to get started on the reading list from one of my classes. I still need to write a paper about a topic from _The Crucible_ by Arthur Miller.* **Ramon:** *Oh! I really liked that book. I took a class where we read it and discussed it, so I thought I'd pick up a copy to take with me when I moved for my job interview. Anyway, how are you going to write about it?** **Teddy:** _(in his head) *How am I going to write about it??*_ **Ramon:** *Well, if you have questions, let me know! I'd be happy to help.* **Teddy:** *Thanks for the offer, but I think I'll be good. But if you run into anything while reading that you think will help me, please let me know.* **Ramon:** _(in his head) *Shit... I totally forgot that he asked how I was going to write about it._ (out loud) *Oh yeah! Sure thing!* **Teddy:** *You've got my email, so let me know if there are any other good books you think will help with the exam.* **Ramon:** _(in his head) *Shit... I need to go take a shower and think about how Im going to do this essay now. I should have written it already._* (out loud) *Yeah, no problem! That's one of my favorite books too. You can borrow the book if you want.* **Teddy:** _(in his head) *Oh fuck... No way he'll give me a copy. He must not have noticed I forgot to ask him how he was going to write about it!* (out loud) *You know, I wish there were a way to read this book online for free without downloading the PDF file and dealing with all of that.* **Ramon:** _(in his head) *Well, I could just email it to him. Yeah, thats a good idea!*_ (out loud) *Oh yeah, totally, just send me an email with your address and Ill send you my copy tonight. I have a really nice copy too.* **Teddy:** _(in his head) *Yeah, maybe if he's not doing anything important, but this is definitely going to be in his email inbox right now. Oh well! I can just wait until tomorrow when the bookstore opens and buy a new copy there.*_ (out loud) *Well, thanks for offering that. I hope it helps!* **Ramon:** _(in his head) *Shit, this is going to be so much work to write this paper without a copy of the text._ (out loud) *Yeah, no problem. It'll definitely help out!* **Teddy:** _(in his head) *I hope I can find an online version of it before tomorrow.*_
