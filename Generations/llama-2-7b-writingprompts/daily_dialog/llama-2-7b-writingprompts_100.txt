I hear you are expecting your family. Yes, my parents and soon my brother as well. 
I didn't know you had a brother. Oh yes, he is two years older than me. He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often. 
Oh nice. Is he coming on his own or with the family?

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" My brother had three children but his youngest died last year from cancer . It's such a tragedy , he was only six . He was so smart and clever . And it just came out of nowhere . He started complaining of stomach pains at school one day then within days he had passed away . "

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" He has a son ? "

" Yes , he does . His name is Nathaniel . "

" Oh yes, I see your name on his Facebook profile . He seems to be a lovely boy . "

" What do you mean he's my brother and his name is Nathaniel ? "

" Oh , sorry. I thought Nathaniel was your son. "

It was nice to see the improvement. You have improved significantly with your dialogue and you managed to create a whole conversation instead of just one statement by one person. However, I did not really like the fact that you changed the name of the person at the end of the paragraph as it seemed very weird to me.

Thank you for commenting! I agree about the name change , but is it better than me writing "So when are they all coming ?" every single time?

Comment: If you don't want to write it again and again, then use a pronoun like **she** instead of their names. You can say like this.  "It was nice to see the improvement.

Comment: Thank you! But how do you make it clear that "she" is talking about her family? You would have had to write, "It was nice to see the improvement. You have improved significantly with your dialogue and you managed to create a whole conversation instead of just one statement by one person. However, I did not really like the fact that you changed the name of the person at the end of the paragraph as it seemed very weird to me. " She's talking about her family. " So when are they all coming ?"

Comment: You should write something like this: **They're expecting their family next week**. The word **family** can include everyone including brothers, sisters, parents etc.
