" The building is right over here, on this side of the street. It ’ s a nice building. Just look for number 361 and you should see it easily from there. Park your car and come to the lobby on the second floor, then take the elevator up to the third floor. Once you get off the elevator, turn left at the top of the hallway and make a right at the first corner. It ’ s 545-E, just down there by the stairwell."
