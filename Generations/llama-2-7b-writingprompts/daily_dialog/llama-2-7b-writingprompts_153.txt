The sun was shining brightly above our heads and we had just finished setting up the picnic. I couldn´t believe how beautiful my wife was. As I looked down at her, she took a deep breath before saying: 
"Would you care to join for the picnic tomorrow ? "
```
```
My heart skipped a beat and I replied as quickly as possible: 
"Much to my regret , I'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . "
```
```
I couldn´t hide the disappointment in her eyes. My wife said with a sigh:
" We'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? "
```
```
I looked straight into her eyes and replied: 
" Much as we'd like to , but we've booked up already for that time . "
```
```
Her smile had disappeared. She didn´t say anything, just turned around and went away with a heavy heart. I felt really guilty, so I tried to call after her: 
" What a pity ! You can't join us. "
