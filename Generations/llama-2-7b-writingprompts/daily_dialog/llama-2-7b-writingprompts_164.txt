It is time to ask the customer if they want to leave their number, or an email address and then call them once the person comes back. This is also a good opportunity to let them know that if something happens on Tom Smith’s behalf, you can still assist.

“Sure do. What would be your best number/email?”

### Response:
Give them the number and email address of someone they can contact when this person gets back from his trip. This is also a good time to let them know that if something happens on Tom Smith’s behalf, you will still assist them.

“My name's Mike. I'm Tom's assistant. He left me a note saying he would be away for the week but please do not hesitate to call him back once he returns.”

Hi, I hope things are going well.
I will be out of office next week as I am planning to go for a business trip.
Do not expect a response from me before 15th October as it is a bank holiday on the day I return home.
Please try to reach me through my cell number which I have given below.
You can also contact me via email but I cannot guarantee that I will receive your mails in time so please make sure you send it at least a week before I come back.
I will be available on skype only when I am travelling and it is not always possible for me to give an instant response as the internet connection over there is really poor.
If possible try calling or sending an email if you have any urgent business which needs my attention.
Thank you!

I have no idea what to write for this one. I'd like some help with the formatting as well, since I'm not sure how to separate these short phrases into their own lines. Thanks!
