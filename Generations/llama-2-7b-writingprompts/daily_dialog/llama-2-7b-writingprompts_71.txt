'' Would you like to order now?'' ''Yes, I'll have the shrimp cocktail to start.'' ``What would you like for your main course?'' ``I'll have a steak medium-rare.'' 
The server took our orders and went back inside the restaurant. A few minutes later, he returned with two large plates of food. He placed one in front of me and the other in front of my companion. I was surprised by how quickly they were brought out as it had only been a few short minutes since we ordered. `` Enjoy!'' said the server before leaving us alone again. As soon as he left, my friend picked up his fork and started eating right away while I waited for him to finish so we could talk more about our plans for today's date night out together but before long both plates were empty except for crumbs at which point I finally decided it was time to start talking again since he seemed finished with dinner already anyway despite having not said anything yet apart from asking me if I wanted something else on my plate later but then realized we had forgotten about dessert so went back inside without any further discussion between us before returning outside again soon afterwards whereupon our server returned promptly after hearing us call out from across the street ``I'll take care of those for now'' he said cheerily while giving one final wave goodbye before walking off into oblivion once more never to be seen or heard from again except perhaps in dreams which may come true if only we wish hard enough because maybe then they will appear out of thin air just like magic!

``I'll have a steak medium-rare,'' the man said as he looked around for his server. ``Can we get some bread rolls or something like that?'' he asked. The waiter returned quickly and brought over two rolls each. The man took one of them and began eating while waiting patiently until someone else came by to take their orders; meanwhile, I sat back in my chair and looked around at everyone who was there; it seemed like every seat was filled except for maybe five or so spots where people had already left before us. ``Here's your food'' said the server as he set down two large plates of food on either side of me before leaving again without saying anything else; then again soon after that, another server came over with more drinks which included coffee and milk for each person sitting nearby so now we had six people altogether who were all waiting patiently while eating until finally another waiter returned with four glasses full of ice cream topped off with whipped cream on top as well - this time around though it seemed like everyone else was already gone by then so there wasn't any need for any more orders since we didn't want anything else anyway except maybe just one last drink before leaving; afterward however, things got even better because another waiter returned with two cups filled up completely full of delicious chocolate cake which looked like it had been baked fresh right in front our very eyes!
