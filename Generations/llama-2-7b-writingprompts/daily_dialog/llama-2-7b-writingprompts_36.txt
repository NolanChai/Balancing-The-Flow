"okay , what size is your package ? "

" it ’ s about two pounds, but don ’ t worry ; I think I have enough bubble wrap to cover it . "

" how are you going to ship your package ? "

" i’m sending it using the free shipping service through Amazon . com , so i know everything will arrive on time for Christmas . "

" what ’ s the name and address of where you want this sent ? "

" i live in Boston, Massachusetts. 815 2nd street, apartment 401 . What about your line ? How long is it today? "  

" i don ’ t know how long the line will be , but there ’ s a big sale on at the post office this week so they are getting a lot of traffic. 3 minutes for each person in the line , right? Is that an estimate or a guarantee? "  

" it ’ s not a guarantee . It can take less time than that, depending on how busy they are and how complicated your package is to ship. But i can also see that some people will spend longer than 3 minutes because they have too many packages, or maybe they’ve forgotten something. "  

" okay , well , here ’ s the first page of my shipping label . Would it be easier for me just to buy a book of stamps and mail it myself ? "  

" that ’ s possible if you want to go to the counter yourself, but they might not have any stamps left in stock today. I know it seems like we take forever here sometimes because there are always people coming with lots of packages . And the lines can get long when it gets busy. But you don ’ t have to wait on line ; i ’ ll print your shipping label and put everything else together for you while you stand in a different line to buy stamps. 12:30 - the line is still open here, but people are coming out from behind the counter now . "

" Thank you , Sir. That should be plenty. Do you have any cash or a debit/credit card? I can also do change if necessary."

"Sorry, what did you say about the cards? Is that where it's going to be sent?"

"The stamps will take them there. It'll cost £26 for 30 stamps and we'll need a special envelope that is too big for the postbox so they have to be put through by hand."

Help me write a response for the original post. 

"I can see that ’ s a pretty long wait in line . Is there any way to speed it up at all? I don ’ t have much time on my hands today, so if you can make it as quick as possible then we should be good to go! "

" yes ma'am , could you tell me which line I should stand in to buy bubble wrap and post a package?" 

"you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you’ll have to stand in line over there to post your passport." 

"that’s a really long line. How long do you think it will take to get through all those people?" 

"it takes about 3 minutes per person, so it’ll probably be about an hour's wait." 

"can I buy stamps here?" 

"yes sir, how many would you like?" 

"i need 30 for my christmas cards. twenty of them are going abroad to china and america." 

"do you have any going anywhere in the eu? if you do, those are less expensive." 

"no, ma'am. okay sir, here you go. that will be eighteen pounds and seventy two pence. and the bubble wrap?"
