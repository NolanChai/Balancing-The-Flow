" You mean that they don't accept our offers ? "

" That's right . They say the same thing about your company as well . But this time, I can't go any lower.  This offer is very generous considering all the costs incurred . We have to pass on these extra charges to you and we cannot reduce them further . "

" It looks like there's nothing we can do then . "

" Well , perhaps it is better to continue our talks next year . In a few months, when the prices of the ornaments are more reasonable . We look forward to working with you in the future . "

*I'm not sure what happened. My previous response was "The price is still a little high." and this response was supposed to be in reply to "I am afraid I can't agree with you there, I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies." I think I lost track somewhere. I also didn't catch all of his statements clearly. What did he say?*

"I'm sorry to hear that . I can promise you a better price for next time . "

> I've come to hear about your offer. We have the offer ready for you. Let me check. 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box, at 20,000 yuan; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box, at 30,000 yuan; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box, at 7,500 yuan for shipment in June. The offer is valid for five days. I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected. You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years. The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where. I am afraid I can't agree with you there. I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies. But you must take the design and quality into consideration. You know we are superior to others in design and quality. We have various styles, which the other companies cannot catch up with. Well since your order is large enough, can you give me a rough idea? To have this business concluded, I should say a reduction of least 10% would help.
