The first thing to do when writing dialogue is decide what your characters sound like. How old are they? Are they from a certain culture or region? If you've done that, then you can start filling in the blanks with their words. 

To help you with that process, here are some questions that might be helpful:
- What's their personality like? Do they talk slowly or quickly? Are they rude and condescending or polite and formal?
- What do they want to communicate about the story (what is their goal)? And what do they think *you* are trying to communicate through this conversation?
- If you could describe them with one word, what would it be? Would that word change if the scene was happening in a different situation or at another point of view?

If these questions help, then let's get to work on your dialogue! If not, try doing some research. You can read through interviews of people talking about their day and write down what they say. You could also read through articles where someone is trying to explain something. What words do they use? How do they communicate the information?

" Hello . Good morning, Ruth. Did I wake you up?"

"No, I was just about to get up. What's up Carl? 

"Listen, I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus?"

"B as in boy. You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown."

" Oh , you mean Canal Street? 

"That's the wrong direction. Canel Street is on the other side of Chinatown."

"Oh, I get it. When did we decide to meet?"

"At 10:45 AM. Is Ann coming along?"
