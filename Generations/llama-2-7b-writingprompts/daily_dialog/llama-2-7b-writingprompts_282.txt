I like the dialogue, but it looks unnatural. What if you made it more realistic? For example, he wouldn't just ask how much to exchange right after he says he wants to change RIB into Euro... maybe wait for a moment or two. You could even use "Huh?" to show confusion when the woman asks if she has to buy in that denomination. Also, make it more natural by using "OK" instead of just "Yes".
