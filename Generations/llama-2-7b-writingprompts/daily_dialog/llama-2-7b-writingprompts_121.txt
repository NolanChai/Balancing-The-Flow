I've written about anything that catches my attention. My last posts have been about a visit from my dad, my favorite movies, and my experience working at Starbucks in the past summer. I like writing because I like to document my life as it happens. It's interesting looking back on old entries to see how much has changed since then. I also like to write for fun - that's why I have a separate blog with stories, poems, and songs that I write when I feel inspired.

**The answer to your question is yes. I am a blogger and have been for the last three years. I got started writing when I first moved overseas on my graduate studies abroad in the US. My initial posts were about life on campus, travel stories as well as pictures of myself so my family back home could keep up with what's going on with me. Sometimes I will also post some special English words that I come across while reading and studying.**

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

" oh , it seems that I'm the only one who never blogs . When did you get started ? "

" I began blogging when I first went to the US for my graduate strides . "

" what do you usually write about ? "

" at first, I'll write about my life there. Like interesting things on the campus, travel stories, special English words that I come across. Sometimes, I'll post my pictures on my blog so my family and friends can see them . "

" that's interesting . How often do you write a blog ? "

" it's random . If there happen to be a lot of things going on , I may add several new entries in a week, and if I've got nothing to share, I may leave my blog untouched for weeks. "

" got it . Are you still updating your blog ? "
