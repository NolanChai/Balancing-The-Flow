I think this is quite good, but the punctuation could be improved. There are some misplacement of commas, and periods after 'year' which should either go before or not at all. Also, I noticed that there was a comma before the question mark in John's response to Lisa.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

John was silent for a moment and then said, " Look, I am sorry. This is our anniversary . We are supposed to be celebrating it together ." He paused again and sighed. " It's just that I have spent all week looking through catalogues and on the Internet for things we could do and places we could go and you haven't even bothered to ask me what I think."

Cindy sat there in shock, not knowing where to begin or what to say next. Finally she said quietly, " John , please tell me why you want to go hunting. I have never liked hunting before. How can it be a vacation?"
John stared at her for several long moments and then he said, " It's just something that men do together. I think I have told you this before. You may not know but all of my friends hunt every year so it seems natural to me." He paused again and looked away from her.
Cindy sat there with a pain in her heart. She was so sad at the thought of never seeing him again. " Why do you want to go without me, John? I have always gone hunting or fishing with you. We are supposed to be together."
John turned back and looked into Cindy's eyes. He knew that he had hurt her feelings. " Look, it's just something that men do when they get together. It's a bonding thing." His voice trailed off as he watched tears well up in his wife's eyes.
Cindy sat there and held him for a long time. He felt her heart beat against his chest. She reached around to caress his cheek with her hand and whispered into his ear, " I love you so much."
