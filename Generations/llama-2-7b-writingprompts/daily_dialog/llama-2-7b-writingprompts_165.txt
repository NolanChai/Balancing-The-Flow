" So how did your previous job go ? "

" It went really well actually . I got a promotion and my annual bonus increased by 30%. "

" That is great . You must be really good at what you do. What made you decide to leave ? "

" Well , I would like to take on a more challenging role that allows me to grow professionally. "

" Yes . As an IT professional , it can be quite stagnant if there is no growth in the industry . Do you have any previous experience of working as an analyst ? "

" Actually I did 6 months in that role when I first graduated from university. It was a really good experience but ultimately I decided to pursue my career in IT and took on the position at Company X . "

**May I come in **

" Yes , please **. **I'm Mr Peter**, the Director of Personnel. **What can I do for you?**

" Nice to meet you **, Mr Peter**. I've come for an interview as requested."

**Oh, yes . How do you do? Sit down**, please **.**

" Thank you **.** What was your major in school?**

" I majored in Public Relations **.**

This is the first time that i've heard someone say '' Nice to meet you.'' and not `` Hi, how are you?'' in an interview... :/ 

The thing is that people (at least in China) don't just come out of nowhere. They have been connected with your company before they come to the interview, otherwise it would be pretty unrealistic for them to get a job at such a big place like yours (their first time doing interviews).

So i guess that it should go something like this: 

'' What was your major in school ? '' (you probably want to know if she is qualified for the job, but it would be better to just ask about her work experience)

'' Yes , after my graduation , I worked in a trade company in Macao for one year.'' (talking about her work experience).

It's important that you pay attention to details like that, because if you don't know what she majored and if she has done any related work before... well, good luck trying to hire her :D

**I ' m Peter, the Director of Personnel. I'm glad to have this opportunity to meet with you today. Welcome! We are going to interview candidates for the post of salesperson and I hope we can find a suitable person here. What is your major?**

" Hello. My name is Wang Sian. I am currently applying for a job in your company. What section did you work in?"

**The Export Business Section. Yes, that's good. The export department of our company is one of the most important sections and it has been quite successful. Did you have any internship while you were studying? **

"No, I didn ' t do any internship while I was studying because there were no companies in my city that provided internships. It's just a pity. "

**You should n't say this way. There are many companies in Guangzhou and Macau who provide internship opportunities for students, even those who do not have any relatives here. If you had done an internship, your application would be more competitive.**

" I was really interested in Public Relations when I was studying because it is a very interesting job. But I'm not sure if this career path will work out for me. I ' m thinking about becoming a salesperson now, but you don't know that I have had some experience in the export department before, so I do n't think it would be appropriate to apply for another position.**

" No problem. The Public Relations Department is also one of our most important departments. What kind of work did you do in the Export Business Section? **

" My job was to help foreigners order products from Chinese factories through e-commerce websites. We used English and Russian as languages for communication. I had been working on this project for a whole year but unfortunately there are not many orders because my city is located inland, so the distance between me and foreigners was too far away to do business with them."

" No problem at all! I can recommend you to our export department since you have worked experience in the Export Business Section. But if we find a suitable candidate who has more experience than you, we still need to choose her/him instead of you because you are just an intern student. The interview process will not take too long. We will let you know later whether or not you pass this test."

**Thank you very much! I'm sorry if I have asked so many questions, but my English is really bad and it took me a lot of time to get used to speaking in front of others. If there is anything else that can help me prepare better for the interview later, please tell me! **

> Mr. Wang, thank you so much for taking the time to come by today and discuss this opportunity. You mentioned that you were a Public Relations major in college; was there anything specific that you enjoyed about studying PR? I know there's many different areas of study within PR, but did you find one that piqued your interest most or that you had the most fun with while studying it?
> 
> Also, do you have any previous experience working in the field? What would be something from your time at a trade company in Macao that you'd like to bring into your work here at the agency? I know we're all really excited about this new partnership with China and how it can help us expand our business.

> Again, thanks for taking the time to chat today, Mr. Wang! We'll be sure to follow up soon, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
