" What exactly are you referring to as a charge on your debit card that you did n’t make ? "

" These transactions. The one for $ 50 and the one for $ 40 . "

" Okay, let me check something here. I ’ ll be right back with some information. "

### Response:

" These charges look to have been made by someone with your debit card number. There is no way of knowing where this was done or how it could have happened without knowing more information about the transactions that are occurring . It may also just be an error on the part of whoever made these charges and can easily be reversed, as long as you call to dispute these charges before they hit your account. I would recommend calling a number listed below to contact someone regarding this matter and get this sorted out ASAP. "
