I think the conversation should sound a bit more conversational. You could add a sentence or two like "well i went to high school here but i went to college in texas."
The word "where" can be omitted because it is implied that Paula is going back and forth between her hometown Canada and Los Angeles.
You are doing good!

I'm not sure what to make of your prompt. You're asking me to write the next turn in this dialog, but it doesn't seem like there are any rules or expectations about how much to expand on each question, so I feel like I have a lot of freedom with the content and formatting.
I tried my best to follow the format as closely as possible, using complete sentences and making sure that the answers are all grammatically correct and logically consistent. If there's anything you can do to help me improve on my prompt, I'd appreciate it!

I'm from Canada, originally. From Canada? Where were you born? Montreal. When did you come to Los Angeles? We moved here when I was fourteen. Did you go to school here? Well, I went to high school here but I went to college in Texas. Did you get a job right after graduation? No, I traveled for a while in Europe after college and then I lived in France. When was that? Let's see... That was about six years ago. I bet that was interesting! What did you do there?
