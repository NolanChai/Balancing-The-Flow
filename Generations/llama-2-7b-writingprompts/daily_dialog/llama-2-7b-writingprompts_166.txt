'Why did you get a tattoo of the Eiffel Tower?'

'I was visiting my friend in Paris.'

'Was it beautiful? Did he take you there and show it off like it was his own child?'

'No, I took a trip myself. It was my idea.'

'So why did you get it?'

'I thought it would be nice to have something that reminds me of him.'

'You could have gotten a postcard or picture or something...'

'It reminded me of the best times I spent with him, and those were very few. It was just a tattoo.'

### Response:
`` Why do you think she is attractive? `` `` She has beautiful eyes that look into your soul...'' `` Is it because of her smile that warms you heart? `` `` No, I actually love the way she smells. Her skin is so soft and her hair feels like silk. I could wrap myself in her hair for eternity. `` `` Well, does her voice sing to you? You seem so happy when she speaks....`` `` Yes, but more than that...when she whispers to me it's my heart that sings. I feel warmth radiate from every pore of my body and every inch of my soul feels like it has been touched by heaven. `` `` Well, do you think her figure is attractive?'' `` No, what do you mean? She's fat....''

''Why did you tell me about your love life when I was on the phone with my daughter?'', she snapped.
``Oh sorry'', I replied, `` I didn't know she could hear us'.
''Well maybe if you were more careful with how you speak to each other, that wouldn't happen...'', she said sarcastically, turning away from me and returning her attention to the window. I stood there, in silence for a minute or two, but eventually decided to make a run for it.
''Have fun at your party'', I shouted as I opened the door to the car and drove off. I was going to have to call her later though and apologize. If she didn't know before, she knew now that my wife and daughter could hear me on the phone, even if it did happen inadvertently. I sat in traffic for a few minutes until I realized that she had been waiting there all this time with her bags packed just so we could spend time together for Valentines Day. I decided to get out of the car and apologize as best I could. When I got back into the car, my wife was crying and my daughter had a look on her face like she'd seen a ghost.
``Mommy, what is wrong?'', she asked, `` Did daddy hurt you?''
``No honey, mommy isn't hurt. It's ok...I just need to talk to your dad for a minute''.
``But why are you crying? He didn't do anything right?'' She was looking at me with her big brown eyes.
``Yeah honey he did, but it wasn't bad...it just took him by surprise'', I said.
``Oh'', she replied sadly and then looked up to see if I wanted to make up for the accidental confession earlier. ``Are you mad at daddy?'', she asked with a hurt look on her face. I decided it was time to start over and be honest with my daughter...I mean, what kind of a father would lie to his own child? ``No honey'', I said as I wrapped my arms around her tightly and pulled her into a big hug. She felt warm and comforting in my arms and for the first time I truly understood that she was my daughter and not just some girlfriend who had taken a fancy to me.
``I love you so much'', I said as I held her close and I could feel a tear drop fall from my own eye. ``I love you too daddy'' she replied with the same warmth in her voice that was felt by both of us earlier when she whispered to me over the phone.
``Oh'', she continued, `` why did you tell mommy your love life on the phone?''
```Why do you have to talk about this at work?'', I asked.
``Well it happened while we were having lunch and I was telling her what my plans for the weekend are...she just interrupted me in mid-sentence.'', he replied with a look of frustration on his face.
``Why didn't you ask her to wait until after work?'', I asked him.
``She started to cry hysterically and it was really awkward for everyone around us!'' He said this while pacing back and forth in the office as he tried to get control of himself, ``...and that's when she started talking about her plans for the weekend!'', he finished. I shook my head in disbelief and then proceeded to explain how important it is to be patient with people when they are emotional or distraught over something like a fight they had with their husband earlier in the day, but sometimes you have to let them work through it before they can start to get better.
``But this was different...she wasn't being rational and she started to cry uncontrollably when I brought up how my wife and daughter could hear me talking about her on the phone!'', he said. He went back over his words again trying to figure out why it didn't come across the way that he meant, but then remembered that she was talking at the time and not listening to him...he had been interrupting her when she started to tell a story from earlier in the day.
``But I don't understand why you couldn't wait until after work?'', I asked again, `` It would have saved so much embarrassment for everyone!'', he replied as if I was making fun of his situation. At this point, there was no more to say except for me to tell him that it wasn't fair to blame himself and apologize for the way she reacted when he mentioned something unrelated to what they were talking about.
### Response:
`` Why did you ask if I wanted fries with my burger? `` I asked her while we sat at a small table in an empty fast-food restaurant on campus, `` Because it was one of your favorite foods as a child and I thought you might like to try them again'', she replied.
`` Why didn't you just tell me they were one of your favorite foods? I would have tried them with no problem'', I said. She smiled at me, `` Because then it wouldn't be any fun for both of us if we knew what was going to happen beforehand!''
### Response:
`` Why did you ask me if I wanted to go on a date? '' he asked me while staring into my eyes as we sat across from each other at an outdoor cafe. `` Because I like you, and want to get to know you better'', she replied with a smile that made my heart skip a beat.
```Why did you ask him if he would go on a date?'' she asked me while sitting at the kitchen table with her elbows resting comfortably against the surface of it, `` Because I wanted to see what his response would be'', she said with an equally pleasant smile that was contagious.
### Response:
``Why do you have a new girlfriend?'' She asked me as we sat in our favorite park across from each other on one of those plastic chairs, ``I don't know...maybe I just liked her'', I replied with a shrug while thinking to myself about how it was probably time for us to break up.
``Why did you ask if she was pretty?'' She asked me as we walked down the street hand-in-hand and stopped at an intersection waiting for the light to change, ``I guess because her eyes were really blue...like they could see through things or something'', I said without thinking about it much.
### Response:
`` Why did you get a tattoo of the Eiffel Tower? '' he asked me while we sat across from each other at an outdoor cafe, `` Because when I was there for my first time with him, it felt like something magical was happening between us'' she replied.
`` Why do you have that tattoo of a lion on your arm? '' She asked me as she leaned against the wall next to him while he stared at her intently from across the room with his eyes closed tightly, `` Because I love him and want everyone else to know it'' she replied softly but with conviction.
### Response:
```Why did you tell your best friend about our date?`` He asked me as we were walking down an alleyway after meeting up for coffee at a local cafe.
```I didn't mean to! I just wanted him to know that it wasn't going well, but then he kept saying things that made sense and I couldn't help myself...it was like this thing had taken over my mind!`` She replied while her hands were shaking from nervousness.
### Response:
'' Why did you ask if you could sleep with me? '' she asked him
