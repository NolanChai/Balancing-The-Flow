The response I had in mind was that the U.S.A. team lost, but it's difficult to convey the sentiment through this medium (Twitter). 

I will edit my original question and post a more appropriate one. Thanks for your help!

**Edited** - This is the next part of the dialogue: 

" So they beat Brazil in the finals? "

" Yeah . "

" How'd they do it ? "

" They were really strong. But that's not what I wanted to talk about."

I would like to know who won, the score and how did China beat them so badly (if possible)?

### Original question:
What is the best way to ask a friend for the results of a volleyball match? The following is my initial dialogue.

" Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? "

" Yeah . "

" Who won ? "

" China . "

" What was the score ? "
