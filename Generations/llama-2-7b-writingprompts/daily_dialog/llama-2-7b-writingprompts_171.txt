The customer handed him a roll of film and told him he wanted it developed. He was pleased to hear that the man did not need any kind of special service but just regular processing. The clerk took the film back and said he'd have them ready for pick-up tomorrow. As the man got up from his seat, he handed him two bills along with a small pile of coins. When asked why, he replied that since it was a special request he would like one picture in black and white as well. The clerk counted the money then gave the customer an envelope to put both copies in. He also told them where they could pick up the prints.
