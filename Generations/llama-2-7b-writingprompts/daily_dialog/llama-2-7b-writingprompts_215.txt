" How did your trip go? What was that one story like?'' `` Oh, you know, just another day at the office.'' `` You and I were both on our way to London last week, but we took different routes and went through completely different traffic conditions, yet we still talked about the same thing. How does that work?'', she said. `` Well, there are these things called radio towers and repeaters and satellites --'' `` Wait a minute, wait just one minute. You're telling me you can drive in silence for three hours and then have an entire conversation with someone who is driving alone in another car? On the other side of London?'', he said. `` Well, yeah, but --'' `` What if I drove on the opposite side of the road? Would that change things?'' She laughed. `` Yes, you'd probably just make the same turn as before, and then ask for a repeat''. He grinned. `` And you'd know it was me! How do you guys not go crazy with all this technology?'' `` Well, we have a lot of time to think about things on the road. Sometimes you get lost in your thoughts. Other times there are plenty of distractions. The radio is just one way I can focus my attention outward instead of inward.''. They talked some more but he found himself becoming distracted by her and eventually they arrived at their respective destinations. `` I'll let you get back to your work now,'' she said. He nodded. `` Okay, thanks for the chat. See you next time'', he said as she waved goodbye from the door of her car. Then he walked inside the building where his own desk was waiting. He sat down and then picked up the phone to call someone on the other side of London. `` How do I get my news?'' he asked.
