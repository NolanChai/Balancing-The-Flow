" Weed! You know? Pot, Ganja, Mary Jane some chronic! "

" Oh, umm, no thanks. "

" I also have blow if you prefer to do a few lines. "

" No, I am ok , really. "

" Come on man! I even got dope and acid! Try some! "

*This response was very confusing , but after reading it again , i think i have the idea. *

**The first person is trying to sell drugs and he has a large supply of them , or at least he claims to . The second person is not interested in buying any of these drugs, and does n't even know what some of them are . The third person is still insisting that he should buy some weed , but the fourth person is saying no because he knows that if he tries it once , then he would probably try all of them. **

" Hm... I guess I ’ ll just take some weed ! "

" But you have to be careful , man . You do n't know where those drugs come from or how they are made, and that could make you very sick . "

" Oh no , please , don ’ t say anything like that ! Just give me the weed ! I want some !! "

" Ok then , here take this little bag of it. It ’ ll probably be enough for you to get high on. Enjoy ! "

" It ’ s fine bro , I know what I ’ m doing ! Just come here man ! ''

`` Okay , but you have to promise me you won ’ t do anything stupid . ''

'' Sure thing , I got your back brother ! We are gon na get high and chill ! So how about a joint ?''
