" My manager was very timid , so I would have to take over meetings most of the time. Because he was a managing director, he also had no idea how to interact with other people on staff, and even worse he didn't know how to delegate responsibilities . "

This is a bit of a tough question as there are several things to consider. 
I would say that when planning and organizing for larger projects, the most important thing is communication. It's always good to make sure everyone involved has a good understanding of what needs to get done, but also understands their role in the project. As far as organization goes, I am a pretty linear thinker and do best working on one task at a time. I would probably begin with researching possible solutions and then lay out an outline for each step that will need to be taken. Once that is done, it's important to schedule these steps to make sure you are able to complete everything by the deadline.

" What type of people do you work with most effectively ? "

" I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It's more difficult for me to be around timid people, because I move quickly and I am decisive ."

" What things impress you in your colleagues ? "

" I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment ."

" What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? "

" The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others. I want to hear good and bad feedback in private, so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior ."

" How do you organize and plan for major projects ? "

" I love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then, I set a timetable that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I've already visualized what could happen and how I'd react . "

" Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . "

I prefer working on projects that I feel will make an impact on people. I enjoy meeting with different groups, seeing what they do for their organizations and how my organization can help them achieve their goals. I am good at identifying the need of individuals or teams so as to improve their quality and productivity. 

My favorite part of being a consultant is being able to build relationships in various industries. It has been fun interacting with people from different cultures and learning how they do things, then applying that knowledge to my team. 

The only thing I really dislike about this position is having to travel so much for work related activities. There are many times when I would love to stay home in the evening, but I have to go meetings with clients or other executives of companies I am trying to influence.
