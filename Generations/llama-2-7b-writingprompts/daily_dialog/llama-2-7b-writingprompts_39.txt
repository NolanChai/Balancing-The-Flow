- You may have been put on hold because the agent was not sure about how to spell it. If so, they will transfer you to another agent. Otherwise, she will ask you to verify information like your booking number and where you are calling from. 

" May I please speak with someone else ? "

- This is a good sign because the agent may not know about the details of your case. They will probably transfer you to a supervisor who knows better than they do. 

" Sorry, but we don ’ t have any other agents available . May I please transfer you to an automated system ? "

- This is a bad sign because there are not enough people working on the phone lines and you will probably be put on hold again for another long time. You can also choose to request that they send you an email or letter instead of talking to a human being. 

" I ’ m sorry, but we have been experiencing high volume today . If you would like to cancel your reservation online please go here [ link ] , and if you call back tomorrow between 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM Pacific Time you may be able to reach us sooner. "

I was writing this dialogue in the format of a question/answer with Judy. I think I should have just written it like an actual conversation and not so formal. Here are some edits, but if you have more advice, feel free to leave! 
" Good afternoon ! Trans Pacific Airline . How can I help you ? "
Judy: " Hi , I ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ? "
" What 's your name, please ? "
Judy: " My name is Judy Wang . "
" How do you spell your last name , please ? "
Judy: " W-A-N-G. "
" I see we have a ticket in our system for the July 19 flight from Taipei to Minneapolis , reservation number 80253677. Your ticket is nonrefundable, so there will be a $ 75 change or cancellation fee on your new date of August 2 . "
Judy: " Oh no ! That 's ok . I ’ ll just keep it. Thanks for your help. Bye! ''

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

" Thank you very much, and thank you for your patience. Have a wonderful day ! "

" You ’ re welcome , have a good day too ! Bye-bye . "
