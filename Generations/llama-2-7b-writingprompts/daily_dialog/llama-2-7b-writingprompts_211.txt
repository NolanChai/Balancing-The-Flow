Kara, we're getting close! You've written the first part of a conversation.
The next response from Mike should be more than just another greeting. He can tell her how he is doing and then ask if she would like to see him again.

> Hello, this is Mike. Kara?
>
> *Kara* (on phone)... Everything fine with you?
>
> *Mike* Yeah. You?
>
> Kara. Good to hear from you. How are you?
>
> - Everything's good with me
>
> Mike, I had fun the other night at the movies and was wondering if you would like to go out again this Friday.
>
> *Kara* (on phone)... Not really... I really need to focus on getting packed and ready to move back home.

> - Maybe we could just meet for coffee or something?
