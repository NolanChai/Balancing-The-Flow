"That's because the fashion, taste and social customs and so on vary considerably."

" How to adjust ?"

" Exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers' needs, wants and likes."

" Ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . "

" That's because the fashion, taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . "

" But it is not only fashion that differs between different countries. "

" Of course not . "

" Language barrier and cultural differences may also exist between nations . "

" Yes . "

" For example , Chinese food may taste very good to Westerners , but it may be too spicy or pungent for Asians . "

" I do not agree with that . "

" Well, how about if the product is suitable for some people in Europe , but it does not meet their taste over Asia ? "

" That's different . "

" Yes , but most Chinese products are still very popular in other parts of the world. "
