```
The driver said `` Where do you want to go?'' And he looked at the man in the back seat and said, `` Go anywhere, just get out of my car.'' The driver turned his head around and spit a big green wad in the rearview mirror. He said, `` I've got radio time, so don't talk to me unless you want to go somewhere.'' The man said, `` Look, I'm not a jerk, just answer my question please? How much will it cost?' And the driver says, `` It's $ 10 for me and $ 40 for you, but you can pay $ 5 each way.'' Then he says, `` By the way, what time is it?'' The man looks at his watch and says, `` I know its not quite 6 o clock, why?' And the driver turns around again and says, `` I'm a doctor.'
