I'm going to the hospital to see Susan.

I saw her yesterday, she was a little better.

Must I catch a number 7 bus to get there?

No, you needn't, a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital.

Number 13 buses run much more frequently don't they?

Yes, I caught a number 7 bus yesterday and they said I had taken a wrong bus.
