"Oh, my! Sarah what have you been doing? You look like you've had a good day, but you did n't say a word about it. Well I was busy with some work at the office today and then later we went to a movie with our friends. What did you do? "

"Yeah I had fun as well. Did you watch a new movie? "

"Oh yeah, its name is *The Jungle Book*. Its an adventure film that's really cool! So what did you buy today ? "

"Well I bought a few things and they include some clothes for me. It was the latest collection of my favourite brand."

"I love it when women wear fashionable clothes, but let's have dinner now and talk more about your day?"
