Good job, and well done! You're able to show the conversation in a very clear way. Also, you did not make any formatting changes which is also good, but as the moderator for this subreddit it might be helpful if you put your answers at the bottom of the post so that people do not get confused by how long it took you to write (this was 5 hours). Also, I'd recommend putting your answer in a paragraph format.

Anyways, great work! I hope this helps :)
