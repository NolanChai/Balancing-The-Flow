`$3000?! Are you kidding me? I'm going to Disney world. Give me $150 and tell me where my change is. And for godssake, give it to the next person in line or I swear... I can go a few days without money.`

Help me write a second paragraph to this dialog using the same format. 

" I'm sorry sir but we cannot give out traveler's checks for three thousand dollars at one time."

" Can you help me with four smaller amounts instead then ? "

" Yes, we can do that. What are the smallest denominations your passbook will accept ?"

> Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.
