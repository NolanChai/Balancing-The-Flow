I have heard a lot of people say that rock music really leaves them cold, and I had to wonder if there was something in the particular style that just did not appeal to them. I decided to try an experiment, whereby I would listen to some classical pieces to see if it left me "cold" as well.

The first piece of music I listened to was a Bach cantata. I have never been able to appreciate this composer's work much (I know, I should get over that), but I knew that there were certain pieces by him which were supposedly "beautiful". This particular one was very long and had many different parts, so it took me quite some time to listen to the whole thing. As I listened, I found myself getting more and more impatient with the piece. It seemed to go on forever, and there was something about it that made it seem like an endurance test. Finally, after what seemed like hours of listening, I finally reached the end, only to find out that it had all been done in a major key!

I then decided to try another type of music - this time some blues. Again, I listened for quite some time before getting tired of the song and skipping ahead (it was very boring). Then, halfway through the piece, something happened: the tempo suddenly changed from slow to fast. This change made all the difference; now the music sounded like it had life instead of death! I found myself becoming excited about this new development as well, until I reached another part where everything slowed down again (what a letdown).

So what am I supposed to do with my newfound enthusiasm? I can't just keep listening over and over again; that would be boring. But if I skip ahead too often, then it will be like having no music at all. Hmm... Perhaps this is why some people are so into rock music - maybe they don't want to sit through an entire piece of classical music in order for it to have meaning for them?
