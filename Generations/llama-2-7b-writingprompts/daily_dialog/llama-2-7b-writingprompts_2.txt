It was getting late, Karren could feel her energy waning, she had been talking to this man for the better part of an hour and a half now. He was very interesting, but also very boring at times. She's had enough excitement lately so she was craving something more action oriented. Tim looked up at Karren as he took his final drink from her cup. It was getting late, he could feel his energy waning too. "Oh, it's getting late", he said. "I've got to run." He got up and put a quarter on the table before turning around and walking out of the coffee shop. Karren watched him walk through the doors and then turned her head toward the front counter to see if there were any other customers. She was waiting for them to close, so she could go home and eat dinner with her husband. As she looked up at the clock on the wall, it read 5:37pm. It had only been twenty minutes since Tim left her table. He must've really needed to leave soon. She thought that it was strange how he just took off when he did, but maybe there were other things he had to do that day. Karren walked over to the cash register and began to count out change for herself before turning around and walking through the doors of the coffee shop. Tim was standing by his car outside, waiting for her to get out so they could drive home together as usual after work each day. But today she seemed different from when he last saw her at lunch break earlier that day; something had changed in her mood while sitting across from him talking about nothing important all afternoon long instead of listening attentively like always before taking off abruptly without saying goodbye or even thanking him for being patient enough with everything else she's been through recently.

### Scenario:
In the movie The Avengers, Nick Fury and his SHIELD team are called into action when they realize that Loki has taken control over all of New York City. In order to stop this from happening again, they must find out what made him so powerful in the first place by following up on an old lead from a past case: Tony Stark's father Howard was rumored to be working with aliens in his lab at one point in time. Nick Fury and Agent Coulson go undercover as waiters at an expensive restaurant where they meet with an anonymous man who tells them about some kind of experiment that went wrong back when he worked for SHIELD (which makes sense given how old this guy looks). The only way to fix it seems like finding out more information about what happened during those experiments would help them figure out how best to proceed next; however, before they can find any answers their waiter arrives with our main characters' food and takes off without saying anything else after taking his payment. This left both Fury & Coulson feeling confused because while they had just ordered dessert it never came despite being paid in full (which means either someone else paid for them or something went wrong during delivery)... But now that you've read through those three sentences let me tell you why: first off I wanted this question to be about how your writing would sound if translated into a movie script; secondly, because I didn't want my first question on this site being something too complicated (it was originally going to have two characters talking back and forth for five minutes before finally ending). Finally thirdly because it would make more sense for Nick Fury & Agent Coulson than Tony Stark's father Howard.
