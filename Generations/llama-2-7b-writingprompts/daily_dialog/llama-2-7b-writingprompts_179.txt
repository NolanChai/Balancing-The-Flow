Jeff said, “I think the Supermarket is closed now.” He then continued, “When does it close?” Jeff concluded with, “That’s Too Bad.” The following day, Jeff was at the supermarket. When he asked an employee when it closes on Sundays she told him 7:00 PM and that they were closing in five minutes.

> I think the supermarket is closed now. Oh, When does it close? That's too bad. Don't worry, we can go tomorrow morning. It opens at 8:00. Alright what do you wanna do now? <3

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

> "Jeff, I'm going to the supermarket. Do you want to come with me?"

>"I think the supermarket is closed now."

>"Oh, when does it close?"

>"It closes at 7:00 on Sundays."

>"That's too bad"

>"Don't worry, we can go tomorrow morning. It opens at 8:00."

>"Alright, what do you want to do now? "

>"Let's take a walk for a half an hour. My sister will get here at about 8:30 PM and then we can all go out to dinner"

>"Where does she live?"

This is a continuation of [the previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClozeTest/comments/4y03j6/help_me_write_the_next_turn_in_this_dialog_with/?ref=search_posts). I'll try to make it a little longer this time :
```
" Jeff , I'm going to the supermarket . Do you want to come with me ? "

" I think the supermarket is closed now . "

" Oh , When does it close ? "

" It closes at 7:00 on Sundays . "

" That's too bad . "

" Don't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . It opens at 8: 00 . "

" Alright . What do you want to do now ? "

```

I think it is going to be better if we just cut the previous conversation and start from here. The first part was too short. Let me try again :

> **Jeff** : **Do you know any good movie? I'm bored with this one, but there's nothing else on TV.**

> **Susan**: **You should come with me to the supermarket! It opens at 8AM and it'll be open for an hour before my sister gets here!**

> **Jeff** : **I think the supermarket is closed now.**

> **Susan** : **Oh, when does it close?**

> **Jeff**: **It closes at 7PM on Sundays. I thought they were open longer! That's too bad...**

> **Susan**: **Don't worry - we can go tomorrow morning. It opens at 8AM, so you'll have plenty of time to shop for your Sunday dinner!**

> **Jeff** : **Alright. What do you want to do now?**

```

I think it is too short for a Cloze Test and needs some improvement. The dialog can continue like this :

> **Jeff**: **Do you know any good movie? I'm bored with this one, but there's nothing else on TV. **

> **Susan** : **I don't know. You should come with me to the supermarket! It opens at 8AM and it'll be open for an hour before my sister gets here!**

Do you know

I can understand what the speaker said, but I have no idea where they're going with this. Can someone please help me write the next line? Thanks!
