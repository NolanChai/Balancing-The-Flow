> Hey ! 250 words in this dialog should do just fine. 

"we really were lucky we got the last available table for two --- and we didn't even have a reservation ! Did you see the long lines behind us ?"

"yeah, I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long. I'm starving !"

"let's take a look at the menu so we can order." Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share?"

"what would you rather have, samosas or poppadoms ?"

"I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa. sounds good."

"well, let's get a plate of those then."

"what are you going to have for your main course ?"

This is an example dialogue, but it should not be taken seriously.  It was created with the purpose of demonstrating the format and tone that this kind of dialogue should take when written.  I chose to use informal language as this is what two people who are friends would normally speak in conversation.  If a third person was to join, then they would probably use more formal English.

"we really were lucky. We got the last available table for two, and we didn't even have a reservation! Did you see the long lines behind us?"
"Yeah, I'm glad that we didn't have to wait too long. I'm starving!"
"Let's take a look at the menu so we can order. Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share?"
"What would you rather have? Samosas or poppadoms?"
"I heard that one of their specialties is the samosa."
"Well, let's get a plate of those then!"
"Sounds good. What are you going to have for your main course?"
"I think I might have a dahl. It has chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice."
"That sounds nice. Do you want to share some kebabs as well?"

> A dahl is a South Asian lentil-based soup. It is served in an earthenware pot and typically accompanied by pieces of flatbread, called roti or naan. The traditional recipe includes garlic, ginger, spices and herbs such as cumin (cummin), coriander (coriandre), fenugreek (methye), turmeric, chillies and onions. In India it is usually eaten with rice or other staple grain.

I have one comment and one question. The first is, why don't you have any other words in between the quotation marks? Do you only want to use them at the beginning or end of sentences? The second is, are there any words that you know the meaning of that you aren't sure how to spell but can pronounce well enough for someone to figure it out from context. For example "chickpeas" and "beer" (I didn't look up their spelling).
