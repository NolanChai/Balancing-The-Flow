I'm glad that this was so helpful to someone. I hope it helps them as much as it helped me! :D

This dialog was taken from my college textbook, but it wasn’t nearly long enough for a realistic conversation. The author made up the second reply by filling in the blanks, and it turned out that it made sense. 

I've added to this, creating another response:

" Mr . Smith , please . "

" Sorry , he is out ."

" What time do you expect him back then ? "

" Sorry, I am not sure. Can I take a message ?"

" Thank you for your assistance. Please let him know that we need to see him as soon as possible regarding the new product launch next week. It's a major marketing initiative and we need to get our ducks in a row beforehand."

" Great ! Thanks! I will tell Mr . Smith to call you back immediately. Have a great day!"

" You too ! "

I'm sorry but what is this exactly? You have the script in quotes, but no context.

Comment: Sorry, that was my error. It was supposed to be a short story i wrote for another website, it went like this...
"Marketing Manager ’ s Office . Can I help you ? "
" Mr . Smith , please ."
" Sorry , he is out ."
" What time do you expect him back then ? "
" Sorry , I am not sure . Can I take a message ? "
" No , thanks . I will call back later ."
" That ’ s fine . Please call again later ."
And now it says i need to put the instruction in quotes. Why does that need to happen?
