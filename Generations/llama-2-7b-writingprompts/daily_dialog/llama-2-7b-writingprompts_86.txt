- [ ] That's great ! I always wanted to learn another language . Maybe Spanish or French ? - [x] Yeah , definitely. It's nice to hear your accent. It sounds better than mine. - [ ] How is that possible? Do you mean, my accent sounds better than yours, or my accent sounds more like an American one? - [ ] Uh, I think I know what she meant. But how do you say it in French? - [ ] Ah ! Je n'aime pas votre accent d'Americain! - [x] Ouch. That is harsh . - [ ] Yeah, I suppose so. You should watch out for that. She has a point .

Thank you very much for your contribution. It is excellent! I have a few suggestions for the next turn (please keep in mind that this is just my personal opinion and does not represent anything official). 1) You used "it" to refer to "a shouting match." To be clear, you mean two people are fighting? "It" sounds a little awkward. I would probably write: A shouting match. 2) You wrote that your girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a phone. Instead of saying "haggling," you could say bargaining or negotiating. Haggling usually refers to shopping at an outdoor market. 3) After the first sentence, it sounds like your girlfriend is trying to save money by buying a cheaper phone. But later you wrote that she was fighting with the clerk over the price of a phone. It's probably best if you write about how much the phone costs. 4) In the second sentence, I would put a comma after "conversation" because it's not part of your girlfriend's speech. Also, it seems odd that you said "got faster and faster," but then didn't say anything else (it feels like there should be more about how they were arguing). I would probably write: My perception was that the conversation became an argument over the price. 5) In the third sentence, instead of saying "my perception was that they would fight," you could just say something like "I thought it was a violent shouting match." (It's not clear what your point is about the tone.) 6) It sounds like there are two people having an argument. You wrote: My girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone. But then you wrote: I mean, I understand that. How could it be "my perception" if my girlfriend is doing something? 7) In the fourth sentence, there's no need to say "you must be exaggerating." It sounds like it was an actual argument over the price of a phone, and you know they were fighting because you said so in the previous sentence. 8 ) In the fifth sentence, instead of saying "...everywhere," I would write something specific like "in China" or "in Chinese culture." 9) The last sentence is fine as it is but sounds awkward without any punctuation at the end. If there's no need for a question mark, you should use an exclamation point. And if there's a question mark, you could add a comma. I hope this helps! Let me know what you think of my suggestions! -Rose (Chinese Name: Ru Xi)

Hello! I am so sorry for my late response. It's been a long while and I've been really busy with my final exam lately. Here is my turn. üòÅ
I will give some explanations in case you are interested, but the main purpose of this post is to provide an interesting story from me (I'm not a native speaker so please feel free to point out anything I did wrong) and some suggestions/tips on improving your dialogue. üòé

Firstly, there are some grammar issues that you might want to look into. Here is my edit of yours: https://pastebin.com/2rCdYgWq (feel free to check this out). You may find it helpful to review the post above and your story from a native speaker's perspective. üòâ
Secondly, here are some tips that I can suggest based on what you have written so far: 1) It is good to read your dialogues aloud! If you do that, you will be able to tell if the sentences flow naturally and if it makes sense in terms of pronunciation. It also helps a lot when reading English as a non-native speaker (especially in writing). 2) You may want to look into how native speakers tend to write their dialogue. For example, they usually write with the order of the person who talks first and the second last and then the person who talks last. The order may be different depending on your preference though (but I think it's more common for the first person to talk first). You may also want to look into the formatting. It is good to include quotation marks (" "), but it is optional and it depends on what you are writing about or if you prefer not including them in your dialogue (for example, if there is a lot of dialogue/monologue included, etc). You may also want to look into how native speakers write their speeches. You will usually find that they do not include quotation marks (" ") when it comes to writing the first person's speech and they only add them in for the second last and the last person (the same with monologue though). For example, https://www.englishgrammar101.com/dialogue-exercises-advanced/. This is a website where you can practice writing dialogues online (you may find this helpful if you are trying to improve your writing skills as it has some tips that could help you too). I hope this helps! Have fun practising and good luck on your final exams! üòä
PS: Sorry for the long message. This was actually my first time writing a story/dialogue so I am very glad to hear from you! Please let me know if there is anything else that I can help with, or if you have any questions! üëç
