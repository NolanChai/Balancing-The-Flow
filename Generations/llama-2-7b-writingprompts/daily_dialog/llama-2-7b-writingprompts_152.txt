Hi there! It’s been a while! First off, let me tell you that this is just the beginning. As I said in my last post, I’ve been working on this for months and it’s really just now getting good (I hope). I’ll be posting more and more as time goes on! 

It seems like a lot of people are having trouble with the instruction this week so here is an example: “Hi. How are you doing today? We haven’t seen each other in such a long time.” <-- Dialogue (with some explanation for context) This was probably done by a beginning writer who had been practicing dialogue for a while, but did not yet know how to properly format it. This is a very good first step.

The main problem people seem to be having with this week’s assignment is formatting their lines correctly and maintaining the flow of conversation. I would like to make sure everyone understands the format requirements in order for them to continue writing. 

In my example dialogue, we’ll use asterisks (*) and brackets [ ] for our character names.

**[Sally]** Hello! We haven’t seen each other in such a long time! How are you doing today? **[Tommy]** I’m doing alright, Sally! I was just wondering if you were free this weekend? It’d be great to catch up. 

That looks pretty good! Now, let me give you some more insight on how the conversation works in real life: when two people are speaking with each other, they speak back and forth (they take turns talking). If one person is done speaking, they stop talking and then the other person starts to respond. 

If your character’s name does not appear between lines of dialogue, that means that the character has finished their turn/sentence and it’s now the other characters turn. For example: **Sally** Hey Tommy! How have you been? **[Tommy]** I’ve been great, Sally! We should definitely hang out some time this weekend. 

We can even use dashes to represent pauses in a conversation:

**Sally** Hey there, Tommy! I haven’t seen you in forever! How have you been? **[Tommy]** I’ve been doing alright, Sally! We should definitely hang out some time this weekend. 

When writing dialogue, it’s important to remember that real people don’t speak perfectly (as most of our stories are based on real life). As a result, your characters will likely make mistakes from time to time as they have not yet been trained properly. To show the reader what their character is thinking during these moments, you can use italics:

**[Tommy]** I’ve been great, Sally! We should definitely hang out some time this weekend. 

Another thing to keep in mind when writing dialogue is that characters are not always talking directly to one another. They might be having a conversation with someone who isn’t present (an off-screen character), or they may simply be thinking about something while the other person talks. In these cases, you should write their name at the beginning of each line:

**Sally** Hey there, Tommy! I haven’t seen you in forever! How have you been? **Tommy thought to himself _I’ve been doing alright, Sally! We should definitely hang out some time this weekend._ 

Lastly, dialogue tags are important for showing who is speaking. You can use words like “said”, “asked” or “replied” in order to show what the character did when they spoke:

**Tommy asked _Have you seen my brother recently?_ **Sally replied _Not since we were kids._ 

This is where your dialogue is going wrong. It looks like it's just two characters having a conversation back and forth without any sort of flow to the story. For example, one person could say something in response to what another character has said (like you did), but then that character would stop speaking and give their reply. If your characters aren't giving each other reactions or responding to what someone else is saying, this makes it very difficult for readers to follow along with the story. I recommend reading through some of my other posts on dialogue if you haven't already!

In conclusion, good luck in writing your next assignment! Remember that practice makes perfect and keep trying new things until something works!
