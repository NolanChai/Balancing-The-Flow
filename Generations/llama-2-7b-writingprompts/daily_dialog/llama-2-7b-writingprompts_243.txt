You've done an excellent job with the dialogue so far. There are several ways to add more information and dialogue to continue the story, such as by describing how the doctor is examining the patient or what other symptoms they have (chills? sore throat?). It can also be useful to vary sentence structure. For example:

" Do you think I should lie in bed ? "
" Yes , stay in bed and drink a lot of water . Your fever will be gone in a day or two . "
" OK , Doctor . Thanks for your help."
