You did a good job describing how this conversation would go.  I think the only thing missing is a bit more dialogue from the agent.  Asking why she forgot to send her form is good but don â€™ t be afraid of getting into detail with the unemployment agent.  They really want people like you calling in, they are just doing their job and trying to keep you happy by answering your questions.

**Most of this dialog is very similar to what I wrote, but I did not realize that my answer would be this long! I thought the response would only contain the last two sentences.** 

" Yes , you can send it in early . If there are any questions about your claim form , we will let you know so that we have all of the necessary information to process your benefits . "

### Response:
I tried to make it as short as possible, but I think I wrote too much. 

" Yes , and thank you for helping me with this . "

Hi there, I am back to help you with the next turn in this dialog. I think we need to get some clarity about what happened here. Let me see if I can help you figure it out... The first sentence in your response is missing a capital letter and the word "the". It should read something like: Did you send in your **Continued Claim Form** for the last period? I think that the dialog is still in progress, as we haven't gotten to an answer yet. To answer this question, I think the character would need to say something like: No. The next sentence should be in present tense and end with a question mark, rather than a comma. Something like: Did you send in your **Continued Claim Form** for the last period? The dialog continues by asking if the claim form was sent in time. If it was not, then the character would say that it is too late to mail anything else (since the check has already been written). The response should be: It's too late now. The next sentence needs an explanation of what happens after this point and how long it takes for payments/checks/etc.. Here are some options I have come up with so far, but feel free to make changes if you think they might work better: * The character says "Okay, thank you" or something similar (no need for another response). * The next sentence says: Your payment will be mailed out as soon as we receive your completed form. It's best if this is written in present tense so that it sounds like the dialog is still going on. For example: **Your payment will be mailed out as soon as we receive your completed form** * The next sentence says something like "If you have any questions about how long it takes for your check to arrive, please contact us at [phone number]." or something similar. I think this would make more sense than saying "Okay" because now the dialog is over and there's nothing else left to say. Hopefully that helps! Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions about what happened here. Good luck with your project! Thanks for using Brainly.
