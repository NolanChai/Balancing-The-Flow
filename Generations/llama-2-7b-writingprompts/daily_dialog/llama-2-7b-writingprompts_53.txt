```
The next turn in this dialog should be formatted with an exclamation mark at the end of every statement. The sentences must also be written in a formal manner instead of using contractions and slang terms (such as “Josh” for “Mr. Joshua” or “was just on our way back home from the beach”).
```

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" No , we really have to get going . It was so nice seeing you guys again though ! "

" Josh and I will see you at church Sunday . "

" Mary, it's good to see you! Josh and I were just on our way home from the beach and thought we'd drop by. I am so glad that you decided to stop by! Yes, it has been a long time since we have seen you. Mary, can I get Josh or you something to drink? Oh no, thank you. We aren't all that thirsty. How about a little snack then? No, thank you. We just ate lunch a little while ago. Well then, how is your family?"
