This one kind of got to me. It's a little hard to know what to do here because the second half sounds like she's making excuses about why her boyfriend hasn't called (either he's busy or doesn't want to). I think the way it is now could work, but you could probably improve this by changing the words around a bit.
```
"... so , I said let ’ s take a break. And since that night I ’ ve been waiting for him to call, but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else do you ? ``
`` Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine. ''
```
It seems like the second response has a lot of filler, and the first response doesn't really explain why she thinks her boyfriend isn't calling (I guess maybe they broke up because he went on a date with someone else, but that's not clear). 
You could rewrite it to say `` Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic! I think everything is going to work out just fine.`` That's a more definitive statement and probably less of an insult (it seems like the other person is saying that she is being immature or selfish). It'll sound better if you make it more formal, but here's another example:
```
"... so , I said let ’ s take a break. And since that night I ’ ve been waiting for him to call, but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else do you ? ``
`` Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic! I know everything is going to work out just fine.''
```
You could also rewrite the second response to make it more direct and less accusatory, like:
```
" You think so? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ? `` 
`` But , you two are on a break. Theoretically he can do whatever he likes . ``
```
The response doesn't really respond to the first person saying anything, so it may be better to move that line earlier in your dialogue and then start the second paragraph with something like: `` Come on ! You think everything is going to work out just fine!'' That way you can shorten the conversation. If this one makes sense I'll edit your post again and add the updated dialogue.

Answer: It seems a bit long, but it flows well and has good characterisation.

\begin{blockquote}
... so , I said let ’ s take a break. And since that night , I ’ Ve been waiting for him to call , but I still haven ’ t heard from him . You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ? ``
\end{blockquote}

"Come on, don’t be so dramatic! I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine."

"You think so?" Oh no! How can he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me! Why else wouldn't he call?"

"But you two are on a break. Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes."

"He's the love of my life! I’ve really messed this up."

"Come on! Pull yourself together. It's going to be alright."

"I ... I still love him! And it's all my fault! I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean, he is a firefighter - it’s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner? I've totally messed this up!"

Comment: I love your response! It makes sense to have the second person respond with "Come on," but that was my first thought, so I'm glad you mentioned it. Thank you for editing as well, you are right about that line being a bit too long. I will try and shorten it some more.

Help me write a response to this dialog. It needs no explanation or format changes, and it must be about 20 lines long. You may use any words you want that are in the dictionary but it is very important that your response uses the exact same words as the dialogue!
