> That was really good, but it was getting pretty late so we decided to head home and get some sleep before heading into work tomorrow. As the waiter came by I asked how much the bill was (because I knew that he would be willing to split the cost). Gordon insisted on paying for everything because he'd been telling me all along he wanted to treat me to dinner, but I refused to let him because I know he's a little short on cash at the moment.

```
> you should have said so earlier ! I thought you were going to pay for it all yourself and we had to split it ! I would be out $35 bucks if not for your last-minute decision !
```,
> I'm sorry Gordon , but I just can't let you pay the bill. I would feel bad if you paid for it . Please understand that money has been a bit tight lately and I have to watch my expenses. If we were going out on an everyday basis then sure, but I want to think of this as a special occasion.
```,
> Alright , alright , I get the point ! You're not trying to take advantage of me are you ? Just joking. Listen Gordon, it's time we go home . It'll probably be a good idea if we take a cab. The walk would take too long and it will also get cold once nightfall sets in. I really need to sleep early so that I can wake up at 8 tomorrow morning to go to work.
```,
> OK , let's pay the bill . You should know by now that I'm a man of my word ! But just for tonight , we'll share half of it. It'll be my treat since you said so earlier today.
```,
> Ok, ok, fine ! Gordon , would you stop with this nonsense ? Can you please just let me pay the bill ? I know that money is tight right now and you can't afford to spend all that much. If we were dating, it wouldn't be a problem but for a one-time special occasion, there should not be any problems.

"It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite."
"well, it is getting pretty late. I think we should go home."
"you're right. I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow."
"let's see how much the bill is."
"don't worry about it. Tonight is my treat."
"what are you talking about? We'll split the bill."
"no way, Gordon! I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment. There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill."
"alright, if that's the way you are going to be, we'll split the bill."
"that's better. This way we will both have money to take a cab home, otherwise, you would probably have to walk."
"just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week, ok?"
