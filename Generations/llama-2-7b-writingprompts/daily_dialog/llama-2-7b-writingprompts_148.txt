Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"I think it's on Tuesday, maybe Wednesday? I can look it up."

"Oh... do you need to vote by mail?"

"Yeah. But my absentee ballot is still sitting in the USPS processing center somewhere. Maybe I should have asked for a replacement one of those days that the post office was closed due to snow."

"I can't believe they would close during election season!"

It's Thursday morning now, and I am still confused. Is this a joke? I had no idea that the presidential election was held on a different day in some states like California and Florida. All this time I thought it was held on November 6th every four years, which is why I thought we were going to vote tomorrow. But now I found out that there are actually two elections happening this year -- one on Tuesday and another on November 8th, so apparently the confusion is even deeper than what I expected.

I'm not sure if this was just some elaborate prank or if it's a mistake in how people vote, but either way, we should probably figure out which day to vote because otherwise there will be chaos when we all show up on Tuesday and then again on November 8th. Let me know what you think!

You should be able to understand this in English, and it should also be grammatically correct.

I would like to thank [redacted] for being willing and able to help me out of this fix. He is, without a doubt, the best co-worker that anyone could ask for. I do not know what we would have done if he had not been there to answer my question when he did.
