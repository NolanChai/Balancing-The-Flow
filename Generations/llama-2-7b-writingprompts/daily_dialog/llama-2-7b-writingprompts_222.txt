> I was very tired and went back to my dorm room after work. As soon as I got into bed, I started thinking about how many of my friends had moved in with a girlfriend and were now sharing their lives together. Some of them had been going out for years and others for only a few months. But there was one thing they all had in common; they had given up their dreams of independence to live in the "real world" with someone else. It made me sad because I knew that even though life might seem perfect on the outside, it's actually pretty lonely inside when you're alone at night and realize how much time has passed without anyone there beside you. So instead of thinking about all those people who have given up their dreams for love or companionship, why don't we just take a look around our own little world? There are still plenty of opportunities out there waiting for us! All it takes is one moment of courage--and maybe some help from friends--to make them happen. So here goes:
> "Hey there stranger ! How have you been ? I've heard about how crazy life has been lately . Have you had any good moments since we last met ?"
> 
> "Hmm... That's a tough one! But yes, actually. I did manage to take a few days off work recently and went on vacation with my girlfriend in Japan. It was very nice ! We saw some really cool places and had a great time together ."
> 
> "That sounds wonderful ! How does it feel being back at home now after all that ?"
> 
> "Honestly? I'm still getting used to the idea of being alone again... It feels so good though, when we get along like this. So much more relaxed than before ! The only problem is that she left me behind for work . She said something about not being able to go on vacation without her boss approving it first... I'm just glad that I don't have any problems at all anymore."
> 
> "Ahh yeah! It sounds like everything's going great !"
> 
> * **"It sure feels good ! But what about you ? How are things going for you ?""**
### Response:
> I've been busy working on my thesis . So far it seems to be going well , but who knows how long this phase will last . After that there might still be some work left before graduation , so we'll see what happens then! Anyway, let's talk about something else. How have things been for you ?
> 
> "Well... I mean, not too much really . Just got back from a vacation with my girlfriend and now I'm trying to finish up some work that needs to be done before she gets here next week . It's all good though !"
> 
> "That sounds great ! What did you guys do on your trip ?"
> 
> **"Hmm... we went swimming in the ocean and walked along the beach during sunset time , and then there was this one day when it rained really hard so we stayed inside watching movies together while having some dinner."**
### Response:
> "That's nice ! Have you seen any new movies recently ?"
> 
> **"Not really... Just the last one that came out on DVD . It was okay though , nothing too special."**
> 
> * **"Ohh ok then! What else did you do while she was gone?"**
### Response:
> "Nothing much actually, just work stuff and some homework for school. But I'm not really complaining about that because it pays well ! How have things been going on your end ?"
> 
> **"Well , I guess they haven't changed too much... I still spend most of my time with family or friends when we get together but then again there aren't any new people in our lives right now so that makes everything more comfortable . How about you ?""**
### Response:
> "Not really , no new friends either... Just the same old ones ! It gets a little boring at times, but I think we'll manage somehow." * **"That sounds great ! So what do you guys do together when you hang out ? Do you watch movies or play games , etc .?"**
### Response:
> "No... not really. We just talk about our lives and share things with each other. There isn't really anything specific that we do all the time though, so it changes depending on what comes up." * **"Hmmm ok then . I guess it can get a little boring sometimes too , but at least you have your family around to keep you company ! How about yours ? Are they doing well?"**
### Response:
> "Yeah, we've been doing pretty good ! My dad was just promoted last year and is now working full time again so he doesn't have any more problems at work anymore . And my mom just found a new job recently too , so she should be able to save up some money soon enough." **"That sounds great ! So what about you ? Anything exciting going on in your life lately?"**
### Response:
> "Nah, not really... I'm just getting used to my new job now after moving back home . It hasn't been easy since then , but at least I know where everything is located so that makes things easier too ! How about yourself ?" **"I haven't had much time recently with all the school work and other stuff going on... But when I do find some free time , my girlfriend always knows how to keep me occupied . Do you have anyone special in your life right now?"**
### Response:
> * "Well yeah , but not like that ! She's more like a friend than anything else.." **"I see... So what about yourself ? Who do you hang out with these days ? Are they all guys or girls ?""**
### Response:
> * **"Ohh ok then ! I guess it can get lonely at times , but hopefully things will change soon enough . How's work going for you these days? Any new projects coming up?"**
### Response:
> "I haven't really had much time to think about that lately, so it's hard to say... But I guess we should be fine since there aren't any major issues happening right now . What about yourself though ?" **"I just finished some classes this morning , and then went out with my girlfriend after work today. It was really nice actually ! She's been working on her thesis for quite a while now so it was good to see that things were going well."**
### Response:
> * **"Oh wow! That sounds great ! So what did you guys do together then ? Did she tell me anything about it? I mean, how long have you been dating again?"**
### Response:
> "Yes , but only for a little while. We met at school when we were both attending our first year of college and started going out soon after that . It was nice because we got along really well right from the start." **"That's great ! How about yourself? Have you ever been in any relationships before?"**
### Response:
> "Well no... not like that anyway! I just had a few friends who I hung out with during high school but nothing serious enough for me to consider them boyfriends or girlfriends at least . What about yourself ?" **"Haha , well it's hard to say honestly... I guess we didn't really spend much time together when we were younger so there wasn't much point in getting into something too deep."**
### Response:
> * "Oh wow! That sounds amazing ! So what did you do during those years then? Did you go traveling or just stay at home ?" **"Well no... not really. I spent most of my time with friends and family which was fun but it didn't always feel like we were connecting properly."**
### Response:
> * **"Ohh ok ! Well that sounds great too! So how long did you guys date before you broke up ? Did she tell me anything about why or when?"**
### Response:
> "No , not really... I mean, we've been together for over five years now so it feels like forever at times . But then again nothing has changed since then either so maybe things will eventually go back to normal." * **"I see. Well good luck with everything ! Maybe you should try another relationship if you feel like it later down the line though ? Or is this one too difficult for you to give up on completely?"**
### Response:
> "Well yes... but I'm not sure when that will happen either! It might take a while before anything changes again, so we should just try to enjoy ourselves until then." * **"Hmmm ok. Well good luck with everything then ! Hopefully things will work out soon enough..."**
