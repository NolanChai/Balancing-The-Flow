I don't think you can just drop something in there. You have to talk through it and give reasons as to why things happened like, for example, the last part. You also need to keep in mind that the person responding is going to ask questions so you should try and answer them as well, or at least come up with possible solutions if you are unable to provide a definitive one. I'm just trying to help, not bash your work :)

**Update**: Oh my gosh, sorry about that I didn't realize it was going to be so long lol. I fixed the order of everything and hopefully this is better? 

"Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? " **Update**: Oh my gosh, sorry about that I didn't realize it was going to be so long lol. I fixed the order of everything and hopefully this is better? 
"We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers? That will be a large order, probably about two or three cases. The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock." **Update**: Oh my gosh, sorry about that I didn't realize it was going to be so long lol. I fixed the order of everything and hopefully this is better? 
"You can double check with housekeeping department but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges. Last time when we made our order to supplier, the quantity was also especially high. They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us. As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance they can usually fill the order." **Update**: Oh my gosh, sorry about that I didn't realize it was going to be so long lol. I fixed the order of everything and hopefully this is better? 
"OK, I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow. Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it?" **Update**: Oh my gosh, sorry about that I didn't realize it was going to be so long lol. I fixed the order of everything and hopefully this is better? 
"I think the only thing is toner. Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow. We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis." **Update**: Oh my gosh, sorry about that I didn't realize it was going to be so long lol. I fixed the order of everything and hopefully this is better?
