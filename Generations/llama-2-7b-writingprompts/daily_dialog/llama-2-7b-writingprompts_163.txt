No. You don't need any further explanation on how to complete the next turn in this dialog. You got it exactly right. The only change I would make is that I wouldn't use a question mark at the end of your second sentence (the one about liking more food). If you want, feel free to check out my solution for an alternate way to finish the sentence: `` I'd like some more; it's really good.''
