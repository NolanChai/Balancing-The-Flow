The instructions are quite clear. Just follow them. As far as the dialogue goes, I would write the following (I'll come back and edit after the deadline if you have any comments):

Whew! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line. 
You have much patience. Wow! Your calligraphy is very beautiful. It was worth the wait! Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet. What does it say? This is an especially famous one. It says, "May the passing days bring you health and longevity. May this season of renewal find you basked in riches." Is that for sale?

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" You're welcome ! It's nice to talk to someone who knows about Chinese poetry and calligraphy . "

" Do you know what a poem is called if there are two words in each line ? It's called a couplet . The other kind of poem with two lines is called a quatrain . "

" Really . I never knew that ! What else do you know about poems and calligraphy ? "

" Whew! I had to wait for almost an hour to get to the front of the line."

"You have much patience."

"Wow! Your calligraphy is very beautiful. It was worth the wait!"

"Thank you. Today I'm writing a kind of poem called a Chinese couplet."

"What does it say?"

"This is an especially famous one. It says "May the passing days bring you health and longevity, may this season of renewal find you basked in riches".

"That's very nice. Is it for sale?"

"No I never sell my artwork."

"Really? Then what do you do with it?"

"I give it away. Here, this one is for you."

"Wow! Really? Are you sure? Now I'll have a lucky year!"
