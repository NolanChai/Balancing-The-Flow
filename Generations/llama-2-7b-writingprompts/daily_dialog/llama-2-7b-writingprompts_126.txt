i'm glad you got such a great news, but i don't think your boss will be happy when he knows how you are doing the job.

you know, i really liked you when we started working together, but now i have to tell you that you are one of the worst proofreaders in the whole company.
so even though this might not be a bad thing for your personal life, i think it's better for everyone else if you resigned today and don't come back anymore.
i just want to let you know that i really liked working with you before but now it seems like things are getting worse all the time so if we keep working together this way then there won't be anything left between us except a bad memory of what used to happen before this happened.

Write the next dialog turn with no format changes or explanation. 

**Ryan** : `` I've got great news ! '' **Sarah** : `` What is it ? '' **Ryan** : `` Well, you know how I've been working at The Economist as a proof reader, right?'' **Sarah** : `` Yes.'' **Ryan** : `` Well the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magazine and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him.'' **Sarah** : `` Really ? That's fantastic! Will you get a chance to do any writing?'' **Ryan** : `` She said the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back.'' **Sarah** : `` Oh my god, I'm so proud of you! That's amazing! What kind of books do they review?'' **Ryan** : `` Poetry.'' **Sarah** : `` Oh. Well, I guess it's good practice to get the hang of.''

Help me write the next turn in this dialog without explanation or format changes. 

" you should definitely go for it! "

" I'm going to look into it , but it might be a little difficult with my classes and work schedule right now ..."

" I'll help you out if you need some extra time ! "

[A. B.](@ab) is correct and should get the full points. [B. C.](@bc) was a good answer, but it does not match the format or style of the original dialog. I will give B. C. 40 points. [D. E.](@de) did a great job matching the tone of the dialogue and writing it in a way that could be used in conversation. However, D.E. wrote an additional paragraph. The question was to match the dialogue, not write more dialogue. I will give D. E. 15 points for effort but only the first paragraph. [F.](@f) is correct and should get the full points. [G.](@g) used a style of dialogue that does not match the format or style of the original dialogue. The dialogue was meant to be realistic so I will give G. zero points.

I would appreciate it if you could edit this passage. The sentence is grammatical, and I am happy with my spelling; however, I think that the sentences are a bit choppy at times. The dialogue needs work on the flow of the conversation; I'm having trouble trying to understand what's happening in some instances and I think it would help if you could help me tighten up this section by editing it for content and making suggestions for how to improve it. 

"guess what ? I've got great news ! "

" What is it? "

" Well , you know how I've been working at the Economist as a proof-reader, right? "

" Yes . "

" Well , the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magazine and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him. "

" Really ? That's fantastic! Will you get a chance to do any writing? "

" She said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that I could be in charge of the column until she came back. "

" Wow ! That's really great news. How often does the magazine come out? "

" It's a monthly magazine, but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly. "

" Are you looking forward to doing more editing work? "

" Yes , but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again! "

" Do you have any order forms here so that I can get a subscription to the magazine? "

" I don't have any with me, but I think I could manage to bring a free copy home for you. "

This is pretty good, but the dialogue seems somewhat stilted. Can you help make it sound more natural and fluid? I'd also like to hear some responses from each speaker that are more engaging and have a sense of energy.
