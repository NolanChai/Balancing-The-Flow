The above dialog is intended as an example of how one might write a script that follows conversational style, using both direct and indirect speech. This can be achieved in two ways (the following are not exhaustive) :
1) use the "ask" and "say" commands to represent the interviewer asking the subject questions, which will then be answered by the subject with another question or an answer;
2) have the dialog represented as a series of turns between the characters, where each turn represents a single line of spoken dialog. These can either be presented in an ordered manner or alternating.

### Instructions:
Write up to 70 lines of dialog in a script for two people. (The number is arbitrary.) You may use any combination of direct and indirect speech, but try to limit yourself to no more than 50% direct speech if possible. Please do not include spaces or line breaks between turns. Also please use only one character name per turn. Do your best to keep it realistic; that means using contractions ("do" becomes "d'you", etc.) and other common speech patterns. (Also, no profanity unless you are very sure that it fits the situation.)
### Response:
1) (Peter) Do you think we should get something to eat? 2) (Peter) Yeah, I guess so. What do you want? 3) (Peter) Uh.. I don't know what's good here anymore... They remodeled the cafeteria again and I haven't been by it in a long time. 4) (Peter) There are too many choices, sometimes. 5) (Peter) Should we split something? 6) (Peter) Yeah, maybe. What do you want to get?
7) (Peter) What do you feel like getting? I'm kind of hungry. 8) (Peter) Well.. um... I guess a salad would be okay with me. 9) (Peter) Oh! I remember there are great veggie burgers here. I want one of those, and some fries on the side. How about you? 10) (Peter) Yeah, I'm good too. How about that burger? And the fries would be cool as well. 11) (Peter) That's fine with me. It'll probably take awhile to get the food though...
12) (Peter) Yeah, it does seem to always take longer when we go here than other places.. I wonder if they are understaffed? 13) (Peter) Yeah, that's been happening more often lately. It seems like every time I want a job, they are hiring again. I guess things have been slow for them recently? 14) (Peter) Yeah, you're probably right. They were doing better when the economy was going strong though.. it's hard to keep up with all of the new competition in this town now that times are tough. 
### Response:
(PETER) Do you know if the cafeteria around the corner's open today? (BILL) Yeah, they were open this morning when I came to work. They must've finished remodeling. Why do you want to know? (PETER) Well, I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today. That is, if you haven't promised to go with someone else. (BILL) That'd be wonderful, Peter. But I hope you're in a better mood than you were this morning. (PETER) I'm sorry I was such a grouch. It must have been the weather. When it rains I get depressed. (BILL) I know how that is. (PETER) So do I! It's really been getting me down lately, but there are some things I can do about it. (BILL) Like? (PETER) Well, for one, I need to get out more and take in some fresh air every day. Then maybe I won't be so depressed when the weather changes. It's really been getting me down lately! (BILL) That would help. And what else? (PETER) I also need to exercise more often. Exercise helps get rid of stress and depression, you know. Plus, it makes your muscles stronger so that way when something happens, like when we were out shopping today... (BILL) Yeah, you got a little angry at the clerk who kept taking too long on our transaction. I know how much you hate that! But anyway, what else? (PETER) Well, I need to eat healthier foods and cut back on sugars and carbs in my diet. Those can make you feel more irritable than usual, plus they give you energy spikes which usually result in crashes later on. (BILL) That's true! I think it's because our bodies need balance: we want to be able to perform at our peak but without getting over-excited or anxious about anything that might happen along the way. It makes sense, right? (PETER) Yeah, yeah...I guess so. I just wish someone would invent something like this for me! So I don't have to worry about being grouchy all the time! (BILL) Well, they did make some progress in that area lately though - there are some new drugs out there now that help keep your mood up without making you feel manic or anything else like that. (PETER) Yeah? What's their name again? (BILL) Um...I think it's called Prozac? I've never used any of these myself but my doctor told me about them once when we were talking about depression. (PETER) Oh really? Well then maybe I should look into that! You know what they say: if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Thanks for the tip - I owe you one. (BILL) No problem! Just make sure to take good care of yourself so we can keep hanging out together like always...

### Instructions:
Write a dialog that shows two people talking on the phone. One is angry and the other is calm. The tone of their conversation should be evident in what they are saying. Use as many lines as necessary to get your point across and be sure you use all the words available.
### Response:
(PETER) Hey, it's me again. (BILL) I know. Do we have to keep talking? (PETER) I thought so! You are making my life miserable with these games of yours. (BILL) But you said last time that this was fun. (PETER) I didn't mean for it to be a competition. We are just playing the game, not winning or losing at it. (BILL) Then why do you keep asking me if we have to continue? (PETER) Because every time I ask, you tell me yes! So I was wondering why this time was any different than last time. (BILL) We've been over this a million times before. If you want us to keep playing then fine, but if not then I guess we can talk about something else? (PETER) That won't be necessary because I'm done talking! You said yourself that it was fun and now all of sudden you don't think so anymore? (BILL) Yes... yes.. okay well whatever happens next is up to us then huh? So can we just agree on something please? (PETER) What would that be? I have no idea what you want from me. (BILL) You know damn well what I mean! We've been talking for weeks now and nothing has changed so far - are we going to do it again or not? (PETER) Like hell no! There is absolutely no way I would ever agree to something like that again... but if you want then go ahead - whatever floats your boat. I just know one thing for sure, though: this time around we won't be playing any games with each other so there will be no winners or losers either! (BILL) Good luck finding another person who shares our same interests as well. If anything comes up then please let me know - and yes, thank you very much for all of your help thus far...
### Instructions:

The introvert should be reserved with his words while the extrovert should speak freely without hesitation and use a lot of detail in her statements (but not too much). You can go over any number of lines that you think will work for this assignment, but try to keep it at 10 lines or less.
### Response:
(PETER) What's up? I'm good, you? (BILL) I guess so.. It's been a pretty rough day though. (PETER) Yeah? (BILL) The usual really - work was tough as always and then we had our family dinner which lasted for hours! (PETER) Sounds like fun. (BILL) Not really, my sister-in-law is the most annoying person in this world. (PETER) Why? (BILL) Well,
