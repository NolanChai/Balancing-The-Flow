Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" Hello, Bob." "Hello, Paul," "I want to meet you for dinner tomorrow at 8pm." "Sounds good - where are we eating?" "At Panda Express on State St." "Great! See you then!" _______________________________________

The phone was picked up on the third ring. There was no name attached to the number, but Bob knew it anyway. 

" Hello ? " The voice from the other end of the line sounded nervous.

Bob stared blankly at his computer monitor and tried not to look as angry as he felt. He had spent more than two hours trying to get in touch with Paul, who was supposed to be in the office now for the last half hour. 

" Yes . This is Paul . " Bob's voice was flat, almost lifeless.

" I've been trying to get hold of you all morning , but you never answered your phone or picked up any messages. Is there something wrong ? " The sound in his voice betrayed a hint of nervousness as well. 

Bob hesitated for a moment and then sighed. He was tired of all these silly games that Paul played with him. It had been going on for far too long now, and it was time to put an end to it once and for all.

" There is something wrong . " Bob said in a cold voice.
