Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"That dress is very pretty . Why don ’ t you like it ?"

"It's too loud."

" We've been looking around for many hours. What on earth are you looking for?"

"Well, you know , those styles or colors don 't suit me."

"What style do you want?"
