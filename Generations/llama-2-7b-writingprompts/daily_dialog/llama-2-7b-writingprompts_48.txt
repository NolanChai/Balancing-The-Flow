I'm so tired of the same old questions. Just do your own thing and get outta my way! I have no idea what you are talking about, but just go on and keep saying something stupid, ok?

**Bring in a friend to talk with this person.** 

" Hi , there . Look at these . I have collected some ads here . There is a special promotion for Mother's Day this weekend . "

" Oh , yes . Mother's Day is coming . Do you plan to buy anything ? "

" Of course . I want to buy some night cream for my mom , and some masques for myself . "

" Hmm . In Carrefour , Clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream . "

" How much is it ? "

> Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

" You don't need to buy anything for your mom , she doesn't need anything . She is a very happy person and you are the only person who can make her happier than that . "

" Really ? "

" Of course ! You have done so much in the past years . You helped me through my career changes , you took care of your sick father, you took care of yourself when I was not there for you . My mom loves you so much and she thinks you are just like me . She calls herself a mother-in-law at every chance she gets. "
