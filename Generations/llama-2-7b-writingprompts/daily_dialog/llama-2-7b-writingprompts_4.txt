I think your dialogue is a bit stilted but the overall idea seems to be there. As I'm not sure what you meant about the format changes, let me just go ahead with some suggestions.

The first two paragraphs can be condensed into:

"Have you seen the tower in front of us? That's the famous Eiffel Tower. It was built in 1889 for the World's Fair."

Or if you want a more casual tone:

"There's that Eiffel Tower. Built at the 1889 World Expo, it used to be the world's tallest building until the 30s."

The third paragraph can be:

"How tall is this tower?"

Or more casual:

"That Eiffel Tower? It's like... how many stories tall are you thinking of?"

The fourth paragraph can be:

"Yeah, it's named after its designer."

Or more casually:

"Of course. You know who designed the thing?"

Hope these suggestions help. If not, just let me know and I'll try something else! :)
