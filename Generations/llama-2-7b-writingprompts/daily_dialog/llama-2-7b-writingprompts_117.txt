Thank you for your post. Here is my attempt, let me know if this is what you are looking for.

#### Turn 1
> Hello , Tom . Where are you heading for ?

```
“ Hello there ” he said with a warm smile to the girl behind the counter at the gas station. He turned away from her to put his credit card back into the wallet.
 ```

#### Turn 2
> I am going to a movie theater . You know there is a new action film produced by Hollywood . A thriller , really .
```
“ I’m heading towards that direction,” he said with an air of pride, “the movie was actually filmed right here. It’s called The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.”
 ```

#### Turn 3
> Another terror film ? There is too much terror and violence in the films . Do you like seeing such a picture ?
```
“It’s not so bad,” he said, “It’s actually about a guy who breaks into an abandoned house on Halloween night to rob it. It’s more of a horror film than a thriller.”
 ```

#### Turn 4
> I don't really like seeing bloody frames , but I appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects .
```
“Hmmm, well if you say so,” she said with a sly grin, “I’ll have to go check it out sometime.”
