It is quiet everywhere in winter.
Yes I like winter.
Me too.
It's snowing heavily. What about taking a walk?
That's a good idea. Let's go!

I am writing a story about a young girl and her new friend. This is my third attempt. I would be so grateful for any feedback! 
The day before the snow was forecasted, Jenna sat by her window looking out at the sky and wishing she had someone to talk to about what was going on in her life. She wondered why God made people and decided to take a walk through the neighborhood with her dog. While walking, she noticed that the leaves were starting to change color and fall off of the trees. Soon she would start school again and have more time for homework. Jenna also saw snowflakes falling from the sky. The next day when she woke up she decided it would be a great day to go outside and enjoy the fresh snow with her dog. She started to walk out of her house, but realized she didn't have anything warm enough to wear. So instead she went back in for her jacket. When she came back out, there was an old man sitting on the front porch. He waved at Jenna and said hello. She smiled at him and kept walking down the road. After a few more blocks they met another dog who had white fur. They started playing fetch with his owner's tennis ball. Then suddenly one of the dogs ran into the street. They all looked on as a car came speeding towards them, but it swerved at the last second. As Jenna was about to cross the road she heard a voice call out "Look out!" She looked up and saw her dog lying in the middle of the street covered with snow. Just then she heard someone yelling, "Quick! Help me pick him up." Jenna ran over to help them lift her dog back onto his feet. The driver said he was so sorry and started crying because he thought he had hit something. "It's okay," Jenna said trying to comfort him. Then she looked down at the ground where her dog had been lying, but it was gone! She felt so sad that she began to cry too. Her new friend then handed her a box of tissues and asked if she was okay. She said no. He told her he was going to go find someone who could help him with his dog, and then ran off. Jenna cried harder because now she didn't have anyone else to talk to about what had happened. But when she looked down at the ground again, there was a big white box laying next to where her dog had been. Inside of it was a beautiful blanket with lots of flowers printed on it! She wrapped it around herself and started walking towards home while thinking how nice it would be if someone else lived in this house so she could talk about all that had happened today!
