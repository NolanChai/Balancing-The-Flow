Leo, your hard work paid off! It turns out that our boss is going to be hosting a special meeting after the office closes. We decided to go to Carl 's Karaoke Club and celebrate completing our budget with a few rounds of singing. Miss King will get her contract ready by tomorrow morning at 9, so you should have time for some fun before then! Please join us tonight if you can make it! Happy Anniversary! Sorry we won ' t be there but maybe another time?
