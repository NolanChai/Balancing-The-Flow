Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" Do you believe in UFOs? "

" Of course, they are out there."

" But I never saw them."

" Are you stupid? They are called UFOs, so not everybody can see them."

" You mean that you can see them?"

I think it would be easier if I was writing this and had context on where you were going. I did just watch Contact though, so maybe you can work with that.

Do you believe in UFO's? Of course they are out there! But I never saw them. Are you stupid? They are called UFO's so not everybody can see them. You mean that you can see them in your dreams? No way, they come to earth?

"No I don't believe in UFOs, but there is a lot of evidence that supports their existence."

"Of course, they are out there. You should look up some documentaries to see how much proof exists for their presence and what kind of shape they take when they arrive on Earth."

"But I never saw them."

"Are you stupid? They are called UFOs so not everybody can see them."

"You mean that you can see them in your dreams?"

"That's right. I can see them in my dreams."

"They come to the Earth?"

"No, their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space."

"Aliens from the outer space? Do you talk to them?"

"What do they look like?"

I did not see the response in the text, so I added it.
> "That means that you talk to them? In which language?"
>"Yes."
>"But how do they speak English? Are they American or British?"
>"They're both. They are from every country and have been here for centuries."
