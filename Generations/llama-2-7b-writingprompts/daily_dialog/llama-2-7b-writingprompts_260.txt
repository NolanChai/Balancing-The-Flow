I was going to use your instructions for writing a dialog, but I ended up changing them slightly. I wrote this whole thing in one go with no changes to the format. The only thing I changed was the number of commas between sentences, as you can see above and below: 
" Come on ! It's time to go ! " - " Wait a minute ! Just hold your horses ! What's your hurry , anyway ? " - " Well , I've got to stop and get gas in the car , first . " - " That won't take long . " - " Well , it won't if there no line at the pump . "

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" Hey ! What are you doing ? Why don't we just stop here and wait for me to finish getting gas ? "

" I've had it waiting there for a while . "

" I know , but if you want us to get going again , you can't keep the engine running like this ! "

" Hey ! There's nothing wrong with the car ! It's just that I don't have the receipt yet . "

" Well , I thought you wanted me to wait for you while you got gas ? You've been standing there long enough already ! "
