I'm not sure this is correct English. There's no 'we've managed'. I think it should be *you* have managed.

Comment: It's correct English, though I wouldn't say "We've".  But in the case of a corporation, especially one with a large number of people (the employees) who are doing this work and working for the company (not just as contractors), then it is grammatically proper.

Comment: @DanBron - I agree with you that the sentence structure in your comment makes sense. I'm not sure about whether or not to use *we've* or *you've*.

Comment: The only time a company would be referred to as "we" is if the speaker has been contracted to do work for it - then "We managed to..." would be correct.
