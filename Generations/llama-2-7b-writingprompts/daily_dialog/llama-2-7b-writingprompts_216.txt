Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Well , I guess that would be a good idea . I'm going to try and sleep off my jetlag today . But if it doesn't work , I might need you to call in for me tomorrow . "

"You look pale . Do you want some water ? "

"Yes please . Thanks. ``

"I don't think we should reschedule the meeting after all . You look like your on the verge of passing out , and I'm not sure if you'll be able to make it through that flight . Let me call in for you , and see what we can do about getting you a new ticket . ``

"That's fine . I'm just going to stay here and rest for a little while , then I think I'll be able to make it to work tomorrow. Thanks for your help!''

" Oh , wow ! Thank you so much! I've been feeling pretty bad lately, but it looks like everything will be ok now. It feels like such a relief to know that there is someone who cares about me and wants to help."

" You mean my new tattoo ? "

" Yes , how did you get it without anyone noticing it ? "

" Well , it was actually a little difficult to do since it was just an outline . I had to keep going back and forth between the parlor , where they gave me a black temporary tattoo , and my house , where I put on my long sleeve shirt so no one could see it . "

" But how did you get someone there to give you the tattoo ? It's a bit weird to have a stranger just walk up to your home without anyone noticing that you had a tattoo artist come with them . "

" You're right , that was kind of risky. I used to go to my friend's house and pretend that we were going out for ice cream or something so he could do the tattoo on me there, but it was a bit hard to make sure nobody saw me walk into his house . That's why I decided to buy a black temporary tattoo instead. It's easier to hide the actual tattoo with a long sleeve shirt than just wearing a short sleeved one . "

" Ok , well I hope that you're not going to be embarrassed when it starts looking more realistic in a few days and people start asking how you got a tattoo like that without anyone seeing the parlor . "

" I guess there's always the chance of that happening , but since nobody has seen me with this tattoo yet, I think they'll probably just assume that it was a friend who gave it to me. "

This is the kind of dialog we can see in a soap opera or a romantic movie. It would be great if you could do this and add some details that fit better with your character. I'm not good enough to judge what is missing, so you should decide yourself whether you like it or not, but keep in mind the rules:
- Each line must have exactly 19 words (inclusive) and no more than 20.
- You cannot write more than two sentences per line.
- The whole dialog must be between a man and a woman.
- There is no need to indicate who speaks at each point, since I will be making some comments before I post the next part of the dialog.

" You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work.'' ``I couldn't do that. I have an important meeting to go to today.'' ``Do you feel OK?'' ``Not really after a 12 hour flight, i've got jetlag and on top of that, i think I've also got the flu.'' ``Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now.'' ``Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?'' ``You're really hot. Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down.'' ``OK, I'll stay home this morning and rest but if I feel better in the afternoon I'm going to the meeting.''``Zach what's that on your arm? It looks a bit red but i'm sure it's nothing.'' ``It looks like you have a red rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything?'' ``Just cats but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks.''``I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no, we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine. Let's go!''

I had fun with this one.  I really like writing dialogues between two people.  It can be a challenge to write well, though, especially for something that requires formatting changes or explanation.  This is because the characters are speaking and thinking at the same time, so it's difficult to keep track of when someone says what in the conversation.
