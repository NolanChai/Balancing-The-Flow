"What can I do for you, young man?", asked the rink attendant, as he handed over a small wad of cash and took his skates from the rack. The old lady who had been sitting at the counter watching them exchange their money began to shuffle her way toward the ice with an outdated pair of skates, as the two other young kids joined them in handing over their bills. They were soon followed by a boy who looked about ten years younger than the rest of the group. He seemed very eager to get on his feet and began shaking as if he was nervous or excited as they all stood around waiting for someone to start skating first. The lady had already removed her boots but did not seem to have put them back in their proper place after putting on her own shoes, and now they were piled together next to her chair. The children looked at each other nervously before deciding that one of them should go out onto the ice alone first. After a few moments passed without any movement from either end of the rink, he stepped forward hesitantly and began gliding across it as slowly as possible in order not to lose his balance or fall down too early into his first lap around this unfamiliar space.

" What can I do for you, young man? `` `` I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning.`` `` What sizes do you need?`` `` One pair of 37, and two pairs of 21. One for me, and the other two for two kids.`` `` Here you are. And here are three crash helmets.`` `` Thanks. Well, those two kids are beginners. What should I do about their safety?`` `` Well, there's a lot to do but nothing to worry about. First, make sure they don't go far from the railings.''

* **( R ) ** Oh, yeah, maybe I should ask them just to walk along the railings. **
* **( W) * "That's a good idea. And remind them to be slow at the beginning, not to run into the railings. **

The dialog should continue as if the customer was a beginner himself. The conversation should be in a friendly, helpful tone. 

The answer for the question `What sizes do you need?` should be something like this: `` I'm sorry but we are out of size 21s.'' or `` Size 37 are all we have left right now.'' It doesn't matter if one pair was already rented before.

The answer for the question `What else can I do to keep them safe?` should be something like this: `` You can always hold their hands as well.'' or `` Hold on to your kids at all times while they skate.''

The answer for the question `Should I ask them to stay near the railings?` should be something like this: `` Yes, that is a very good idea.'' or `` Do not let them wander far away from you.'' It's not important if they were told not to go to the center of the lake earlier.
