" If you have to leave, we can talk about it later. For now, you should focus on what you want to do after your lease is up. You could find another place, move closer to home, move away from home."

"I ’m sorry but the property manager says that you owe us $300 for damages and cleaning costs. If we do n't receive the money by Tuesday, then they are going to sue you for it."

"Wait...what ? I just moved into this place a few days ago . I did n't even know that there was any damage here before I moved in ! I only signed the lease because my last place got evicted and I had no where else to go. My landlord is being unfair."

"I understand that you have some issues with your landlord, but this is not something I can do anything about. All I can say is good luck trying to find a new place in the middle of winter in a week's time. You might be stuck paying for a hotel room until we hear from your landlord."

"But...that's so unfair ! If my lease was n't up, I would have had time to get a new place and sort out the problems with my current one. What about getting compensated for that ? My stuff was in storage for weeks and then it got destroyed at the new place. It cost me hundreds of dollars to replace what they lost or stole ! Why should n't I get some money back from them?"

"That is not my decision to make, but I will tell you this: your landlord has decided that he wants his property cleaned and refurbished before you move out. If it costs $300 to do this, then that is what they are going to charge you for it."

"Well...that's not my fault ! What am I supposed to do ? Get a second job or something ? I have no money, just like everyone else during the pandemic right now. My landlord does n't care about me as long as he gets his money back and I still owe him hundreds of dollars in back rent. He has already cut off my utilities because I can not pay them ! How is it possible that I will have to deal with all this, while my stuff at the new place gets stolen ?"

"I am sorry about your situation, but if we are going to get a refund for you then we must know what happened. Where did your landlord move your things?"

"He moved it into storage."

"Then I would expect that he has not stolen anything from you, or else he is going to get a lawsuit for it. Maybe your landlord did n't like your furniture, but what about the damage? You said that it was clean before you moved in?"

"Yes...that is true."

"Then I will see if we can work something out for your deposit. But right now, I do not have anything else that would be helpful."

"But...I told you about my situation! Why did n't you help me?"

"The landlord is asking for a refund because he claims that there are damages to his property."

"But I told him that everything was clean when I moved out! He said that I owe him $300, but the lease does n't say anything about it. When am I going to get my deposit back ?"

" That ’ s a good point . "

" No, I don ’ t think so . "

" It ’ s only fair if you do n't move out of your lease until you finish it . "

" So I should n't be moving then ? "

" You can move but we have to get the money back for the deposit first . "

" I don ’ t know why you are being so mean about this . "

" This is n't fair . "

" You still have time on your lease. "

" There’s no way that I can stay here. "

" That’s not going to be all right. "

" I don ’ t understand why. "

" I’m going to have to keep your deposit because you’re leaving before your lease is over. "

" Why can’t I have it back? "

" Because you’re leaving before your lease is over. "

" You have to give it back to me. "

" You’re not going to get it. "

" But I’m not able to live here anymore. "
