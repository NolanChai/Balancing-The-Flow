" I don ' t really have a favorite . You know, my mom used to listen to all kinds of different things when she drove us around and stuff. So I just learned to like lots of different kinds of music. "

" My dad hated classical music, so I guess I got that side from him. I ' m more like him than you might think . But my mom was the one who really had a big influence on me when it came to liking things. "

" Well, you certainly have great taste in music . I just wondered if you could listen to anything other than classical music? Like pop, or rock, or jazz ? "

“Hey, Blake! Are you still listening to Mozart?”
“Yes.” Do you like it? “It’s great,” she said as she sat next to him in the dark room. “And I heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent” she continued.
Blake looked at her and smiled slightly. “Really? I never heard of that before, but I like it.” He took a long sip from his cup. “Is classical music your favorite?” She asked. “Yes,” Blake replied in a quiet voice.  “What about you?” She asked as she stood up to grab another slice of pizza. Blake was left sitting alone, so he decided that it might be best if he just got up and joined her instead of watching the last few minutes of TV with the other guys. He did n’t know what to say though, so he just sat there awkwardly until she turned around to look at him.
“Hey Blake,” she smiled as she reached out for another slice of pizza. “Do you have any more of those cookies from earlier?” She asked as she took a bite from the crust and tossed it into her mouth without chewing once.  “Not yet, I’m still working on them” he replied while taking another sip of his drink.

"I started when I was about ten years old, so that's going on twelve years now. "

" Is it ? You don't look like a teenager . What do you want to be when you grow up? "

" I ' m not sure yet , but I would like to work in the medical field or maybe in IT."

" That sounds nice and useful too. What about your friends? Are they into classical music ? "

" They listen to it as well . But they like other kinds of music too ."

" That 's good . Is there anyone you like at school ? "

" I do n't know yet, but I think I might like that person in the future."
