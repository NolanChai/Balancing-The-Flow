This is how the response would be in my opinion. 

" Great, thank you for your time . We'll see if we can make it through this interview and get a job from the company of our dreams . I hope so! Have a nice day ! "

The interview with the personnel department has been over. You have passed the interview and are about to begin working at the company, but you still have one question in your mind. It is the interviewing manager who says these words to you, which make you feel a little uncomfortable and uneasy. Why did she say this? What does it mean if I do not get a call from the personnel department within two weeks ? How should I deal with my feelings when I hear those words?

I got 82/100.

- It's difficult to hear the word " that's all" because you spoke too fast. 
- Your pronunciation of the word " at the latest" is not good.(You need to pay more attention to stress pattern)
