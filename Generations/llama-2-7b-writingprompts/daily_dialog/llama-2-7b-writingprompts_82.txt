Hello Jack, I'm John. 

Thank you for taking your time to meet me today, but it is very important that you have read the contract beforehand and not sign any paper. It would be a good idea if you could take out half an hour of your day to familiarise yourself with what I am about to tell you. 

You will need to have completed three months internship in order to become a permanent employee, as we are quite strict on our training programmes and believe in high standards of service delivery. You must be able to work eight hours per day during your internship period but would still be entitled to all benefits including insurance coverage, legal holidays, year-end bonus etc. As an intern you will receive overtime pay for working over the hours specified by us and this will apply even if you have completed your internship period already. 

We also offer various incentives for our employees like five insurances and one fund which is available to all eligible full-time staff members. You are also entitled to enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus. If you work overtime then we pay twice the usual salary as over time pay.

" Yes . There is one question I would like to ask : what are my duties in this job ? "

" I see . Well, your duties are to work at the reception , take phone calls and help out the customers as much as possible. You will be expected to clean up any mess that comes into our office. "

" Sure . When does the internship start ? "

" The next week . Your first day will be on Monday , if I'm not mistaken. What are your thoughts? "

" Yes . I'll start work on Monday and it sounds great . Thanks ! "

Jack : I'm glad to see you.
John: Sit down, please. Maybe you have read the contract, but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract. You must have a three-month internship.
Jack: Yes, I know. When you become a permanent employee, you will have the insurances. You'll get monthly pay and you'll be on eight-hour/day work shift.
John: Wait, will I have five insurances and one fund?
Jack: Yes, you can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus. If you need to work overtime, you'll get twice the usual salary as overtime pay. OK. You have read the relevant terms of the contract. Do you have other questions?
John: How long will the induction training be?
Jack: About two weeks.

" I have a question about overtime pay . Do we get any other benefits ? "

" What do you mean by that ? "

" For example , there are some other incentives for working more than eight hours on duty . Is it true ? "

" Sure , I'm sure you can make the extra money . The pay is not so high , but I think the contract is very good . "

" Well . It's OK . But what about the vacation allowance? How do we get paid for that, for example, when we need to take a couple of days off. I want some holiday pay ? "

" Well , I guess you can enjoy the holiday pay with your salary . The contract clearly states the terms and conditions . "
