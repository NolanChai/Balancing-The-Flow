Yes but only because of that. But anyway it's all down to preference and taste in some sense. I'll say you're not wrong with your opinion about the fansubs/dubs being better since they are closer to original text, but just keep in mind that this is a legal website where we want people to watch legally released content and as much as we want them to do it, only few actually will.
I mean sure you're not gonna get anything illegal from us for a long time since you live in a country with no anime and you need a VPN to even access this website (you don't have to be shy about it just say I use NordVPN or ExpressVPN and whatnot) so you won't be able to get anything illegal from us, but if we ever got big enough that you are actually living in Japan where watching anime is legal and the fansubs/dubs are out then I guess it would all depend on how good is the dubbing compared to the original text.
But hey there's nothing wrong with a little extra spice since some people like their animes spicy.

The term is used because you have to escape your country (legitimately) in order to watch what you want.

I'm sure the UN would be pretty happy about refugees who fled their countries so they could watch anime...

"The reality is that we all have to work together in order to make a difference. Reaching out to distributors and streaming platforms, signing petitions, checking legal international streaming platforms, and importing legally released DVDs or Blu-rays are all ways that fans can show their support for the anime they want to see."

I'm not gonna do this, I'll just pirate it.

Once fans of To Your Eternity even staged a rally near office of local branch crunchroll, they called participants of the rally “marginals” and criticized them for their behavior. But even in this case, some readers are offended by what they hear from critics on the Internet

This is not true. In fact, it was done by ordinary people who care about anime and want to see it legally in their region. We had a similar situation with Vinland Saga. Even if we consider that these are bots, then they managed to create a huge effect. Why does the representative of Crunchroll not answer? Is he afraid that someone will say that his statements are false and that people don't want to see this anime? Or maybe they are just afraid to admit that such a great demand for anime in our country exists?
