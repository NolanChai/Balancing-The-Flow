The [Carbon Compression Technology](https://alteredcarbon.fandom.com/wiki/Carbon_Compression_Technology) used by the Stacks of the Protectorate and the Resleeved people is capable of reconstructing a human body from their [stack](https://altered-carbon.fandom.com/wiki/Stack). This process can be performed at will, but can also be done during execution. The process requires some time to run, however it's unclear how much.

The technologies we have at our disposal are capable of storing an unimaginable amount of information. I doubt that there will be anything in the future that could outperform them, let alone be better at preserving data than digital records. The only thing that could happen is that new technologies might be developed that would allow us to store and process the information even more efficiently, but I don't think they would provide a significant improvement over what we have now.

While there are a plethora of different types of holograms, the most common form is a flat screen that has been embedded with pixels and then backlit. When these light rays strike your eye at just the right angle and frequency they can produce a 3D effect. One would simply put on a pair of sunglasses and a small chip would be embedded in the lens, and then one's computer would generate an image that is projected through this screen.

Consciousness in the novel, like most aspects of the universe, exists on a spectrum. To put it another way, it exists on two different levels; in the 'physical' world, where our minds are tied to the human brain and can only interact with things within this reality (including other humans) and the 'abstract' or 'virtual' world, which is not bound by space/time and where the gods live. In both these worlds, consciousness is stored and processed in a similar way; it is digitised as ones and zeroes on a digital storage medium, whether that be in your brain or a computer hard drive, but its important to note that the act of uploading or downloading the human mind does not simply change one from 0 to 1. Instead, it is more like changing the state of a quantum superposition - instead of just switching between different states (0 and 1), we can also add extra 'zeros' in there (for example, if you think of a quantum bit as a single photon, which is either an electron or a hole depending on its spin, we would be able to have three states: up, down and neutral). The human mind is stored and processed in a similar way - instead of just being 0 or 1, it contains more than two states (hence the name 'quantum'!).

The No-Cloning Theorem is a mathematical proof that states that no physical copy of a given human can be made, due to the fact that it would require duplication of all information. This means that cloning could not occur and that only one "copy" or body could exist at any time. So, in the event of death, the consciousness that was stored on that individual is gone forever.

Yes. The person that dies is still the same person as the one who is reconstituted.

The following is a quote from [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4227) that goes into more detail about this:

> If we assume that consciousness arises as a consequence of the positions and configurations of neurons in the brain, it would be reasonable to think that if one could reconstruct the state of someone's brain (perhaps through scanning) from their behavioral or linguistic record, they would be able to reproduce conscious experience. A possible way to implement such a reconstruction would be to run a simulation of the brain and neuron dynamics on a computer, with the goal of reproducing the recorded experiences as closely as possible. The No-Cloning Theorem suggests that, even if one is able to perfectly simulate the state of someone's brain, it will nevertheless not be possible for that simulated person to have experienced consciousness at all.
> 
> To make this argument rigorous, suppose that we can simulate the neural dynamics of a person on a computer and accurately record their experiences as well as any actions they perform due to those experiences. Suppose also that we have no knowledge about the true nature of reality, i.e., we do not know whether our simulated person is actually conscious or just a mere simulation. Let $S$ denote the state of the simulated brain and let $M(s)$ be the corresponding behavioral record (which may include some sort of language). The No-Cloning Theorem tells us that no matter how close we come to duplicating both $S$ and $M(s)$, there will always be an infinite number of possible configurations $\widetilde{S}$ such that neither $\widetilde{S}$ nor $M(\widetilde{S})$ could possibly simulate any conscious experience whatsoever. As a result, no matter how close we get to cloning the simulated person, their behavioral record is never actually experienced by anybody and thus it cannot be the same as someone else's.

You've seen Star Trek, right? Where people get beamed from one place to another? You know that when they go through the teleportation beam, they appear somewhere else in a puff of smoke or something. Well, how do you make it work?

No. The entity that is beamed down is not the same as the one in the teleportation booth. To begin with, the laws of physics dictate that any energy/matter can only occupy a single location at any given time. In order to 'clone' an object, you would have to transport it twice through the teleporter booth (and then move it from one place to another). The teleportation booth would also not be able to operate normally if you were to try this because of the No-Cloning theorem. So, the only way in which the teleporter could work is by moving the original object's consciousness into a new body (along with everything else about it that defines it as itself).

No, the no cloning theorem does not state that. The no cloning theorem states that it's impossible to create a clone with the same memories and experiences as an already existing individual, but that does *not* preclude the possibility of having an exact duplicate (i.e., with exactly the same physical properties, including positional information). If such duplicates did exist, they would be indistinguishable from each other in terms of their qualia, which is what we're concerned about here - there would be no way to tell that one was a "copy" and one wasn't.

Instead of using the word "quantum", you could simply say it's non-classical. The difference between classical and non-classical is rather than being described by a single probability distribution (a state function), a non-classical system has to be described by many different distributions, one for each observable quantity. So in a non-classical system you have the possibility of quantum superposition for the coordinates and momenta, but you also have multiple states where all components are classical (for instance, two or more macroscopic particles moving together). The fact that there is only one possible state to describe the entire system at each instant of time can be thought of as a limit on how many different distributions of coordinates/momenta/etc. that are allowed in the total Hilbert space.

- There are various models of how the mind works. The one that's most popular and well understood right now is the Computational theory. It assumes that the mind is a computer running programs. 
- This view says that consciousness comes from having complex enough algorithms in our brains that run fast enough to keep up with perception and action. Our thoughts are just information processing, the product of these algorithmic processes in our heads. The same can be said about dreams and hallucinations - they're products of our brains working away at the input it receives (through senses) while we sleep or otherwise not paying attention to anything specific. 
- This is similar to how a computer works, just on a much more complicated scale. A computer processes information based on instructions written into its software by programmers; humans do pretty much the same thing except that our software is genetic rather than digital.
- The Computational theory is backed up by research from cognitive neuroscience and it has many different facets that make it more complex. Some say we're just running some kind of simulation, others argue for the existence of a self - but these are debates in their own right and not directly relevant here.
