                            The first image is too dark for my liking. I'd recommend adding more contrast or brightness, and/or playing with the saturation.
                            
                            In the second prompt, you have mentioned a "bookshelf", but that does not appear to be in the illustration. Also, there are two "--ar 1:1 --v" parameters for the same prompt (I think it should just be one?).
                            
                            The third image is too dark again and I'd recommend adjusting the lighting/shadows or brightness, as well as saturation.
                            
                            You have provided a well structured prompt for all concepts. Nice work! :)
