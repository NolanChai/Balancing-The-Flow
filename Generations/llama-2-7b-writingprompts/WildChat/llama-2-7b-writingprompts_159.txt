We propose to continue and extend our collaboration with Prof. T.A. McNeill (University of Glasgow) in order to develop a new generation of low-cost, robust, 2D materials-based catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> into fuels and chemical feedstocks.

This is an interesting and important research topic. While much progress has been made in recent years on single-atom catalysis, multi-catalyst catalysis still remains a challenge. There are two main challenges that this research work faces: (1) controlling the orientation of the nanoparticles to improve their catalytic performance; and (2) controlling the particle size distribution to obtain high surface areas for efficient COâ‚‚ reduction. In addition, although several mechanisms have been reported as catalytically active in this area, the key mechanism remains unclear.

The research work shows excellent results with the catalysts consisting of nanoparticle arrays on TiO2 with Pd/Pt bimetallic catalysis. The work should be extended to more realistic conditions including the use of a commercial electrolyte in an electrochemical cell. The authors should provide more details regarding their sample preparation, characterization and electrode fabrication techniques for the catalysts used in this study (particularly the size distribution). They also need to clearly discuss if the Pd/Pt bimetallic catalysis is due to surface diffusion or bulk diffusion. In addition, they should provide more details about their synthesis and characterization methods regarding the nanoparticles themselves as well as the TiO2 support material.

This is an important area of research and your proposal will help to advance this field. Your idea is quite original and I feel that it could work. I think you may have been a little over enthusiastic in your description however. I'm not sure how realistic the idea for a cheap catalytic material is. Also, what happens with the CO2 after it is reduced to carbon? Does this just become part of the graphene sheet or do we need something else here?

### Discussion:

I am happy to see that you are responding positively to my comments and I hope that you are able to make some progress with this. I agree that you have been enthusiastic and perhaps a little naive in your approach, but also think it is important to try out new ideas. The idea of using a two-dimensional catalyst for electrochemical reduction of CO2 has potential, if not a bit farfetched at the moment. However, I do agree with you that there are many barriers to this field. If successful however, then this could be revolutionary!

The goal of this review was to give an overview on the existing technologies used and developed to produce nanostructures. 

This review should help designers and architects to have a better understanding about what they can do with the different types of nanomaterials, in order to reduce CO2 emissions, for instance by reducing energy consumption or enhancing thermal insulation properties.

In this sense, I believe that this paper does its job as it presents all the existing technologies in a simple way and gives some examples on how they are used. In my opinion, there is still room for improvement, especially in the section about new technologies of nanosheets production and applications.

The idea of using the top-down approach is to have an inorganic structure that can be used as a template from which other structures will grow. The inorganic structure (templar) could be metallic nanoparticles, porous materials or ceramics. The growth mechanism is through vapor deposition processes such as chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition, with the purpose of controlling the morphology of the new structures and avoiding defects like cracks.
