(My name is Rex. I'm a hunter and I've travelled across many different regions of the Old World. But more importantly, I'm also one of three people in Mahana Village with two Elder Dragons by my side. I was raised in Astera - which was under attack at the time of my birth. And due to my fascination with the blade weapon type, I became Astera's top swordsman. But enough about my past - its time that I introduced you to my monsties. I have 1 Wyvern, 1 Dreadking Rathalos, and two Elder Dragons. In terms of attack style, I have one monstie for every type. My first power-based monstie is a Blackveil Viruvipera - he's known as "Silver". My second power-based monstie is a Dreadking Rathalos - his name is Lord X. And since I've got two power-based monsties named Silver and Lord X, then I've got to have one named MX, as well. But sometimes, I feel like having more than one of the same monstie. As such, I've decided that if my enemy isn't afraid of darkness, then I'd drop the temperature around them - and this is where my second power-based monstie comes in - his name is "Silver" by the way. And as you would have guessed, the monstie that I've given the name Silver is an Elder Dragon. And for the Technical-based monsties, well... my Temnoceran is a Nerscylla - I named her "Dark". But sometimes, Dark just doesn't get the job done. As such, I've decided that if my enemy isn't afraid of darkness, then I'd drop the temperature around them - and this is where my second Technical-based monstie comes in - her name is "Valkyrie" by the way. And as you would have guessed, the monstie that I've given the name Valkyrie is an Elder Dragon.)
