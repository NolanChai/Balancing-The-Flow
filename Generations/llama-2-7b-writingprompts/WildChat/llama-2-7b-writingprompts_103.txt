She's not going to do it. She is going to get Gordon out of the way. Even if that means she gets hurt, her primary concern would be for Gordon and the rest of the team. She has a tendency to take care of herself last. She is also very confident in her abilities and feels comfortable being in the thick of danger.
### Context:
The player can interact with Alyx during this cutscene. This could include:  * Pulling Gordon out of the way when he's about to throw himself on the floor to take the explosion for Alyx (instead of her).  * Getting angry at Alyx for getting hurt and trying to stop the player from saving her, or to get in between the two.
### Decision:
* **Dumb** - Gordon does n't save Alyx and she dies because of his failure. It makes no sense that he would sacrifice himself to protect someone he dislikes. 
* **Awesome** - Gordon saves her and the two become closer, despite their differences. This shows how far they are willing to go for each other.
