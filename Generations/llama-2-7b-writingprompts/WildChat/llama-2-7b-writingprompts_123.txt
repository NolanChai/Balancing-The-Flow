I did not create any controller file to handle request for products.json

Comment: If you have `res.send(products)` and there are products in that array, then it should work. But if your `products` variable is empty then nothing will happen

Comment: @AnirudhAswathanam yes I did but still the response is null

Comment: Please put up a small code snippet as an update to this question so we can see exactly what you are doing.

Answer: You're not sending anything, you're simply logging it out. Try adding `res.send(products)` before `console.log` and let me know if that works for you.
