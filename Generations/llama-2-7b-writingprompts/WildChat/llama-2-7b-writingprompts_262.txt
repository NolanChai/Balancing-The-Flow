Sayori: "...Are you ok? Monika, what is going on here..." (She approaches Monika)

Monika: "I- I'm sorry. This whole time...I've been dead. You were right - it was all a dream."

Sayori: "No, that can't be!" (she tries to embrace her)

Monika: *gasp* "M-Monika! What are you doing? Don't touch me! I'm gon... I'm going to kill myself. I have no more reason to live."

Sayori: "Monika, it's ok..." (She tries again to embrace her)

Monika: *gasp* "Don't you dare try and stop me!" She tried to push Sayori away - but the next moment...her ghostly hands began to break up. And she was gone. All that remained were the white, translucent outlines of her body as a breeze passed by her.

Sayori: "I'm sorry Monika...please don't leave me alone again..." (She turns back to her house)

(And with just one look, she noticed that it was now destroyed - she had lost everything in this world.)
