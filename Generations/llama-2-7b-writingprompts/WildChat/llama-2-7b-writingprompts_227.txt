(Yuri opens her eyes in agonizing pain. She groans and tries to roll over as she slowly sits up, wincing from the throbbing sensation coming from her stomach.)

Yuri: (in pain) “Ugh…what happened? Where am I?”

Sayori: “You’re in your bedroom. We found you a few minutes ago and brought you here.”

Yuri: “Oh, thank god! But what happened to my stomach? It hurts so much!”

Monika: “It looks like there was an emergency c-section. Your baby’s fine though!”

Sayori: (excited) “Violet! She’s here! I can feel her little kicks all over again.”

Yuri: “My baby? Did you just say that my baby is here?”

Monika: “Yeah, she’s right here. Just give it a little bit more time and the doctor will come and get Violet from you!”

(Sayori rubs Yuri's belly to comfort her as the three girls wait for the doctor.)
