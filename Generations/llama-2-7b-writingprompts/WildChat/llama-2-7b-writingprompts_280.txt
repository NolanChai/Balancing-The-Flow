Hello everyone! The scenario for the scene was quite hard to come up with since I had no real idea what the other two are feeling and how they would react in that situation. I didn't want to focus too much on the injury side of things and wanted it to be more a story about Reza and Anneliese's personalities which is why I made some decisions I did in this scene. For example, I chose to make them both at least partially functional and not completely reliant on their catheters or other medical equipment. It's also not clear whether the situation will turn out good or bad for either of them which adds to that tension that we don't know what could happen next. This is the kind of suspense I wanted to write about but unfortunately, as this was my first attempt at writing something like this and I still lack experience in it, a lot of the details are not quite there yet.

Hi Reza,

This week you write another long scene featuring snappy dialog, but unfortunately the storyline is flat, unoriginal and boring. You had me laughing in the first scene about the hospital being empty, because I know it's true. But it was a bit of a let-down that you didn‚Äôt go through with the joke by having them put together, even if only for one night. The dialogue is quite good at times, but then some parts are stilted and forced, and I can see where you struggled to make your characters say something funny.
I found it interesting that in this scene we learn more about Anneliese's past (the guy she was with) than Reza's past (the woman he was with), but also that their relationship is over (she's not his girlfriend anymore). I think it would be even more interesting if the characters are still in love and fighting for each other, trying to make up, etc. This way they could get back together, and their storyline could continue, which I believe you are really good at writing about!
The only part that kept me reading was the bit about Reza saying ‚ÄúYou know what, forget it‚Äù and Anneliese replying with ‚ÄúYeah, let's not do this‚Äù. That was actually pretty funny. I liked how he said it to her face in front of everyone, and she didn‚Äôt get offended by it or anything. Instead she replied that she would still be interested if they could get a hotel room together for one night ‚Äì I thought this was kind of sweet, although they are breaking up!
As for the description of the characters, you did a good job there as well, but some parts felt overly flowery and too much to me. I think it‚Äôs enough to say that Anneliese is ‚Äúa beautiful woman‚Äù, or ‚Äústunning‚Äù instead of saying she has ‚Äúdeep green eyes, with long eyelashes, full lips, flawless complexion and a petite body‚Äù. For Reza, you could just describe him as being taller than her (or maybe shorter).
The description of the nurses is very interesting and I would love to read more about Luciana Vipari. Maybe in another story? üòâ

Well, that's all from me for now. I hope you find some inspiration and keep writing! Take care Reza, and thanks again for your writing. You are a good friend.
