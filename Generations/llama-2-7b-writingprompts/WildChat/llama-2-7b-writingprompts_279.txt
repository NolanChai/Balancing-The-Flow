Writing was fun and easy as it required no creative thinking or writing skills. It is not my cup of tea but I'm glad I did this exercise because it helped me think how to write an interesting script in the future.

Patient: Susan Schmidt (age 45), Female, Caucasian

Presenting complaint: Back pain after lifting box.

History of Present Illness: Patient presents with a chief complaint of back pain that began after lifting a cardboard box from the floor to her desk yesterday evening while at work. She states that she has had a similar complaint on and off for many years, but usually resolves fairly quickly with rest and conservative treatment. She denies any fevers or chills, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness, headaches, abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, rashes or itching, weight changes, or joint swelling or tenderness.
She is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol or recreational drugs. She states that she takes medication for anxiety (Lexapro) daily and occasionally uses over the counter pain relievers as needed for muscle/joint pain. She has been previously diagnosed with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, which is treated with synthetic levothyroxine. Patient denies any significant family or social history that could affect her medical status.
She states that she was physically active and maintained a healthy lifestyle until several years ago when she underwent back surgery to remove an infected vertebral body (T5). She was then placed in bed rest for 4 months while healing and was not able to return to her previous job as a hairdresser. During this time, she gained significant weight and developed diabetes mellitus type II which is currently managed with Metformin.
She is on a stable medication regimen including synthetic levothyroxine for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and 120mg/day of Lexapro for anxiety. She also takes 500 mg acetaminophen as needed for muscle/joint pain relief and 5mg oxycodone as needed for breakthrough pain after surgery in July 2016 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
Her physical examination is significant for normal vital signs, temperature of 98.3 Fahrenheit, blood pressure of 145/95 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute and heart rate of 70 beats per minute. Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally without any wheezing or crackles. Heart is regular with a full rate and rhythm. Abdomen is soft and nontender, bowel sounds are present, there is no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Skin turgor is good with capillary refill of less than 3 seconds. Extremities show no evidence of edema.
Gait is normal without any ataxia or nystagmus. Patient denies any numbness, tingling, or paresthesias in her extremities. She reports being able to ambulate for short distances and states that she has had a history of pain from her prior back surgery and was previously advised not to lift anything heavier than 10 pounds.
Neurological examination is normal with full motor function bilaterally, sensation intact over entire body and no reflex abnormalities. Cranial nerves are intact, the visual fields are equal in size bilaterally and the pupils respond appropriately to light. Sensory testing is intact.
Mental status examination reveals normal thought content and fund of knowledge with an appropriate affect. She denies any suicidal or homicidal ideation at this time. Patient’s overall mental status was not assessed by the treating physician during this visit.
Susan is alert and oriented times four, with no acute disturbances in memory, thought content, behavior, perception of reality or insight to her psychiatric illness. Susan reports that she is feeling very tired lately but states it has been hard for her to sleep the past few nights because she’s had trouble breathing (dyspnea) when lying flat on her back and cannot find a comfortable position.
A review of systems reveals no recent fevers, chills, dizziness, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, lightheadedness or headaches. She states that she does not have any joint pain but reports that it hurts to bend forward more than 90 degrees in her lumbar spine and it feels like something is pressing on the sciatic nerve.
She has no recent weight changes and denies any rashes, itching or swelling of the extremities. She also states that she had a full physical examination performed by another physician last week, which revealed normal vital signs with a body mass index (BMI) of 36 kg/m2, a BP of 145/97 mmHg and a heart rate of 80 beats per minute.
Patient denies any recent trauma to the head or neck. Her past medical history is significant for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in remission since July 2016 and back surgery with vertebral body resection at T5 performed in November of 2014. Patient states that she has been having trouble sleeping lately due to dyspnea when lying on her back but denies any other significant problems besides this, such as a history of migraines, seizures or vertigo.
Family history is significant for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis in both parents and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in one uncle who died from complications related to his illness at age 50 years old when Susan was only 12 years old.
Social history reveals that she is a single mother of three adult children, ages 23 through 34 and works full time as a receptionist for an insurance company earning about $70K per year gross income before taxes and does not use any tobacco or recreational substances.
Patient states that she has had several bouts of depression over the years but never required psychiatric hospitalization, nor was she ever prescribed medication for these episodes. She reports having no suicidal ideations at this time but admits that sometimes it feels like everything is too much and she just wants to be alone all the time.
When asked about her religious beliefs, Susan states that although she was raised Catholic in a strict household where alcohol or drugs were not tolerated under any circumstances (including medication for pain relief), she does not believe in God anymore but would consider herself agnostic rather than atheist because “if there’s something out there watching over us all then why did my uncle die from cancer when he was only 50? I guess we just gotta do the best with what we have here on Earth.”
Susan reports that she has been seeing a psychologist twice per month for several years now to discuss her depression and anxiety but denies any history of mental illness or previous suicide attempts. She states that she was able to sleep through most nights without medication until recently when the dyspnea began interfering with her quality of life.
Patient is currently on a stable regimen including synthetic levothyroxine for Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, 120mg/day Lexapro for anxiety and 5mg oxycodone as needed for breakthrough pain after surgery in July 2016 for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). She also takes 500 mg acetaminophen as needed for muscle/joint pain relief and 10mg alprazolam once daily at bedtime to help her sleep.
When asked about other medications, she states that she takes a multivitamin supplement daily and also uses an over the counter anti-fungal cream (Terra-Gel) on her feet for athlete’s foot every night before going to bed because she does not like to wear shoes or socks at home but wants something to protect against infections.
She denies any history of drug allergies, and reports that she has never been diagnosed with an allergy or food intolerance during any prior medical evaluations. Her immunizations are current according to the CDC recommended vaccination schedule for her age group but she does not have a documented tetanus booster shot within the past 10 years as required by law in New York State since August 2013 when a new regulation was enacted requiring all adults who live or work in NYC to get vaccinated against pertussis (whooping cough).
Patient’s medical history reveals no history of alcohol use disorder (AUD) and she denies any current abuse of controlled substances including marijuana, methamphetamine or heroin. She does not smoke tobacco products but reports that her father used to chain smoke cigarettes throughout his life until he died from lung cancer at age 58
