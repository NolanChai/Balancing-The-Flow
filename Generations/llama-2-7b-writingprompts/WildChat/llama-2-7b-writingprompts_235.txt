**The year is 2133 AD in America. The United States of America is finally coming back after a devastating nuclear war nearly 150 years ago. Before the war, America had several states that were governed by the federal government. In the aftermath, there was no central authority, and every state acted independently. Some of them even fought against each other. Then came “The Great Crusade”, a campaign to bring all of North America together under one rule once again. The first crusader was Henry “Enrique” Santos who wanted to reunify the chaotic lands and restore the United States. On a platform of general pan-Americanism, he swept the country’s election that year. A man of mixed American and Mestizo descent, Henry was a charismatic and accomplished commander who had many victories under his belt. He would add many more during his Great Crusade, although his diplomatic triumphs are as consequential as his military ones. By the time of his death in 2088, he had reunified all of North America under one rule again and established a new country called the “United States”.


The United States is ruled by one president who has absolute authority. The Senate is composed of representatives from states, who are elected to ostensibly represent the interests of their home state. They in turn elect the Potus (President) as they would like in an old parliamentary democracy. While Potus’ word may be law, in his old age he has left the task of governing the country to the Senate. However it is an open secret that he wants his eldest son to be elected as the next Potus. The Washingtonians, supporters of the Potus and the Santos Line, back the move and are actively canvassing Senators for the coming election. Meanwhile the Republicans, their main opponents, are working to prevent the election of Marcos’ son. Furthermore they are moving forward with their plans to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the Potusial title with a true republican structure centered around the Senate. The political drama continues.


The United States is governed as a proud republic, with the authority of the Potus unquestioned across the realm. However once you start asking around it turns out to be rather complicated. In theory, the Potus is freely appointed by and subordinate to the various cities of the Republic. In reality, the issues of communicating over the vast breadth of the United States has led to power being centralized in Potus and the Senate. While Potus Marcos’ word may be law, in his old age he has left the task of governing the country to the Senate. However it is an open secret that he wants his eldest son to be elected as the next Potus. The Washingtonians, supporters of the Potus and the Santos Line, back the move and are actively canvassing Senators for the coming election. Meanwhile the Republicans, their main opponents, are working to prevent the election of Marcos’ son. Furthermore they are moving forward with their plans to replace the semi-hereditary nature of the Potusial title with a true republican structure centered around the Senate. The political drama continues.


Any discussion of the United States shouldn’t neglect the complicated and deep history with its southern neighbor, Mexico. The country was largely spared from the nuclear exchange except for unlucky cities on the border with the United States but it could not escape from the flood of American refugees, the fallout or the nuclear winter. Government authority completely disappeared in most of the country and Mexico’s government ruled with an iron first. In the end around 30-40% of Mexico’s prewar population died in the years that followed, compared to the much higher death rate to the north. Despite the collapse of social order, the Mexican government did not fully collapse. After only a couple decades, the national government reasserted its authority across the country and the population began to grow again. By the 2050s Mexico cemented itself as a major power and one of the most developed countries in the Americas.


Today, Mexico and the United States rest in an uneasy status quo. The border cities in the south where the sphere of Mexico and the United States overlap lie within a dual suzerainty under the two countries. While many in the United States seek to directly control all territory held by the former United States they know better than not to provoke Mexico. After all, Mexico supplies the majority of the oil to the United States and is their main economic partner. Obviously its a really bad idea to provoke them.

It depends on which republic. Rome was a Republic that fell, but it lasted centuries and even though it fell the ideas were still around for hundreds of years.

### Explanation:
Rome is often cited as an example of how to build a stable government. It had many faults, including corruption at all levels.

I'll go with the first one, since that's probably the more important problem. I've had a hard time thinking of things to say here. I'm going to be vague and say I do not have much experience in this area, so I hope it's okay. The government should represent the people as best as they can (this is where the second part comes into play), but what happens when we get into an era where there are too many people for a single country? What will happen to that one person who does not have enough of their voice heard in the election system? I'm going to go out on a limb and say there's no way to account for everyone. If you have a government that represents all its people, they are going to have to give up some things so they can represent more people. At this point you start to get into the problems of having too much power in one area of the world (which is something I believe the Republic will avoid), or splitting up your nation's borders and causing civil war. It might not be a problem now, but what if it becomes one later? It all boils down to this: do you want a government that can make quick decisions, or would you rather have a government that represents everyone? I think we need both in order for our system to work properly.
