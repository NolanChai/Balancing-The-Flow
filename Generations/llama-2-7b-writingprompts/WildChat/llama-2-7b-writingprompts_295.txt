Yes there are, but they're quite pricey and might not fit your budget. A basic surge protector will prevent the plug from connecting to any outlet in case it is misused, as long as it's wired correctly. I'd suggest looking at the following two products for inspiration:

Comment: +1 for the response and I have taken a look at that one but i am looking to something that will prevent anything other than a UK plug from being connected in the first place.

Comment: That's difficult, because they are designed to be able to accept any type of plug. You could try something like this [link](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0039X8V0W?ie=UTF8&camp=167646&creativeASIN=B0039X8V0W) but I haven't seen a UK version, and the description makes me think it will be difficult to install in place of your existing plug.

Answer: There is a device called [Plugguard 20A](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B0039X8V0W?ie=UTF8&camp=167646&creativeASIN=B0039X8V0W) that is made specifically to do this job. However, I suspect you will find it quite expensive.
