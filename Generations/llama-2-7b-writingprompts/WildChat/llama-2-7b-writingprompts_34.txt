* 8. The attested forms of personal names based on Hermanubis in papyri and inscriptions from Egypt are: Ἑρμανουβίων (4 instances), Ἑρμανουβῖς (3 instances), Ἑρμανούβιϲ (6 instances) and Ἑρμάνουβισϲ (1 instance).
* 9. The oxytone -ῖϲ in the name of an Alexandrian nurse ἡ τροφόϲ ἑρμανούϲ is probably a form of -ῖδος, as you surmised; this is not so strange when we recall that theophoric names were often unmarked for gender in the Roman period.
* 10. It appears that -ῖς was commonly used to mark women's theophoric names, because of its similarity with Greek feminine names in -ίσϲ (cf. -ός). However, there are at least two other cases where -ῐϲ is applied to personal names based on Egyptian gods: -ῑϲ Ανουβισϲ in a letter from Oxyrhynchos (Coptic GM 16217) and -ϲ Ἑρμανουβισϲ in a fragmentary inscription from the Temple of Isis at Philae (IG VI 1054).
* 11. You may be correct to observe that -ῑϲ is "often declined with a dental declension" but, I do not think this suggests confusion of Hermanubis' name with the Greek feminine names in -ίς (-ίδος) or that it was conflated with oxytone Ἑρμανουβίσϲ (< Ἑρμανουβισϲ), as you propose. -ῖσϲ is a common Greek suffix used for theophoric names; so, I suspect that it was not accidental that this form of Hermanubis' name also appears in papyri and inscriptions. It is worth pointing out that there are no instances of personal names based on Ἄνουϲ that appear to have been used as feminine theophoric names, even though -ῖσϲ was often employed for this purpose.
* 12.-ἱων and -ᾶϲ were common Greek suffixes but they did not apply solely to personal names based on Hermanubis; cf., for example, Ἑρμανουβίων Πάτερ (Hermonobion pater) in a fragmentary papyrus from Oxyrhynchos (P. Oxy. 1709).
* 13.-ᾶϲ was a common hypocoristic for personal names, including feminine theophoric names; so, it is plausible that this form of Hermanubis' name could be used interchangeably with its longer form in business correspondence.
