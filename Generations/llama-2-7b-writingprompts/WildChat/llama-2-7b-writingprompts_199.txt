### Explanation:

* Kaliningrad Oblast was carved out of East Prussia after World War II as the Soviet Union's "Kaliningrad Region". It is on a strip of land between Poland and Lithuania along the Baltic Sea. In 2008 it had about 1 million inhabitants.
* Gus-Gus (or Gusev) was the name of an old East Prussian town now called Svetly. The reason for the name change is unknown, but is believed to be related to a military base in the area.
* Chernyakhovsk is the site of the former Konigsberg airbase (Konigsberg was the German name for Kaliningrad Oblast's capital city Kaliningrad) which housed some 250,000 Germans. The Russians renamed it to Chernyakhovsk after a battle during World War II and then used it as a prison camp (1946–51). It is now the home of one of Russia's largest military bases with about 80,000 troops.
* Nesterov was named for Soviet Marshal Aleksandr Semyonovich Nesterov, who died in an airplane crash near Kaliningrad in 1925 while testing a new plane designed by Antonowich (the ANT-10 was the first four-engined aircraft to be put into production in Russia).
