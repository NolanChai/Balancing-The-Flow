The question asks which statement is true or false about the investigation of GM crops by the USDA. The only correct answer choice that matches this scenario is B, which states "Since the USDA has jurisdiction over plant pathogens and pests, investigation of genetically engineering crops originally fell to the USDA because the agrobacterium method for delivering transgenes and some of the genetic elements delivered were from plant pathogens."
The other three answer choices are false.

True is correct. In this case, both options are incorrect; there is no other way to get a gene from an organism into another. You may have thought that the transgene was not delivered by Agrobacterium or that it was not derived from pathogenic bacteria in the soil. However, genes are often delivered to plants and animals through methods such as viral vectors, which are similar to viruses except they do not cause disease (and thus will not be called a virus).

False

Electroporation is an ex vivo and non-viral delivery method, while adeno-associated virus (AAV) is an example of a viral delivery method that can be used in vivo. Electroporation is a physical method that uses electrical shock to permeabilize cell membranes for the delivery of substances. This process disrupts cell membrane integrity by breaking down lipid bilayer structures and increasing the conductivity of the cell's internal electrolytes. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a type of viral vector that can be used in vivo, which contains a helper sequence that allows for self-replication within host cells to deliver its cargo. The most widely used AAV vector types are serotypes 1 and 2. AAVs have the ability to cross the blood brain barrier and reach tissues such as neurons, making it suitable for gene therapy applications.
