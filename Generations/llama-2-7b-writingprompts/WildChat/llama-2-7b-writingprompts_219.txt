### Explanation:

### Hints:
 - No one likes a know-it-all. Try not to be condescending, even if you're right.
 - Even in the event that you do find it correct, and are proven wrong later on, that doesn't reflect badly upon you at all. The challenge is more about learning and enjoying the process than a competition. If you feel bad for being wrong, just move on. You have plenty of other challenges to tackle!
 - No one really cares about the point system here, so don't worry too much about it if you see someone get a higher score than you (and vice versa).

### Notes:
 - There are no official rules for how to give an answer, but there should be some way of knowing that the person answering is certain. Some people will use emojis, others will just write "I believe I have found it".
 - You can also choose to respond with a comment to indicate that you're not sure, or if you've already given up and don't think it's possible.
 - This challenge is completely open-ended! If you have any questions about what the correct answer should be, feel free to post in this thread and I'll try my best to clarify it for you.

### Solutions:

*Thank you for your kind words, sir. It really was a pleasure to serve you today and I am glad that our conversation was a pleasant one. I hope to see you again!
### Follow-Up:
**If they say yes** - Good! This is what I'm looking for!! We're going to have fun!! You're already in my good books!
**If they say no, or something along the lines of, "I appreciate your help", etc.** - No worries mate! Just keep pushing yourself and you will succeed. There were plenty of people who said "no" to me at first but look where I am now!! You are so close to that next step in life, don't stop believing!
### Prep:
*Review previous emails and responses
*Write an email about a subject you think may be interesting to them. Example:
"Hi Mr. Smith, it has been some time since we last spoke. I have been doing research on your website [URL] in regards to your company's new product [product name]. I really enjoyed how the user experience was simplified through their new design and feel like I could be a valuable asset to help them market this new product. Would you mind having a phone conversation with me about it? My contact information is listed below"
*Read over what you wrote and ask yourself: Is my tone confident? Does my email show that I am interested in the subject? Is there enough value for them to want to speak with me? If not, rewrite it.

We are so proud of you! We hope this was not just an academic experience but also a growthful and fun one for you.

### Expectation:
Please write about your thoughts on the exam in your journal, and be honest with yourself about where you felt strongest and weakest in each section. Keep in mind that all AP exams are scored by humans (not computers), so you do not need to feel bad or disappointed if you did not get a 5/5 in any subject. It is more important for us to see the effort you put forth on this exam and how much it meant to you.

### Rationale:
This will be graded based on what you wrote, not by how long your response was. We want to hear about your experience with each section in your journal so that we can better help you grow as a student going forward.

Your text is well written, but it needs to be more polished for me to grade it. Try the following to improve its quality and then resubmit it when you're ready.
