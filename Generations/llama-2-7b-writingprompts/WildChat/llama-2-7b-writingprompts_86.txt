I think the manager's main goal is to bring value to customers, in order to do so they need to understand their needs and wants. A systematic approach helps managers make better decisions to help the business grow and be more successful. The management approaches I'm going to focus on are; strategic planning, continuous improvement and kaizen.

### Strategic Planning:
[Strategic Planning](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_81.htm) is a managerial approach that helps managers organize and prioritize activities in order to achieve long term goals. This is very important as it makes sure all resources are focused on what needs to be done, with the objective of meeting short-term objectives, while keeping an eye on the future and long term goals. This type of planning also allows managers to stay in control of their employees' time and activities.

### Continuous Improvement:
[Continuous improvement](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_81.htm) is a management approach that focuses on improving processes continuously to make them more efficient, reduce wasteful work and improve quality. This means managers need to pay attention to details as well as the big picture of what's happening in their company. The main goal here is for companies to learn from mistakes and fix problems quickly before it gets out of control.

### Kaizen:
[Kaizen](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newPPM_81.htm) means "improvement". This management approach focuses on small, incremental changes that lead to larger improvements over time rather than revolutionary changes at once or all at once. It's not about making radical changes but instead looking for ways to make the current processes more efficient and effective in order to increase efficiency with fewer resources needed overall while still meeting customer expectations/needs as best you can with what you have available today (and tomorrow).

### Conclusion:
As we see, these three management approaches are very similar but also different. The main difference is that strategic planning focuses on long-term goals and continuous improvement focuses more on short term objectives while kaizen helps managers focus on the details of their processes to make them more efficient with fewer resources needed overall (and meet customer expectations/needs as best you can with what you have available today).

Five-Year-Olds and the Development of Language.

### Discussion:

**Ideas, Not Words**

In her book _The Five Year Old_, Erika Christakis states that toddlers are more interested in the ideas behind words than in the exact pronunciation or spelling of those words (1993). She explains that the first five years is when children develop the idea that language can be used to communicate. They begin with a very concrete, literal interpretation of what they hear and then move on to understand more metaphorical expressions, such as _get a leg up_ or _let your hair down_. During this time they also become interested in the sounds associated with words. The first five years is when children develop their phonological awareness. Christakis says that even before children have an understanding of grammar or syntax, they understand how words are put together (1993). She goes on to state that children under five tend to focus more on the _idea_ behind a word than on the exact pronunciation and spelling (1993).

**Academic Language in Classroom Instruction**

An article by John D. Bransford and James W. Pellegrino from 1984 stated that one of the best ways to increase a child's vocabulary is to provide them with academic language (Bransford & Pellegrino, 1984). In _The Reading Teacher_, Kathy Glass states that children do not understand new words if they are not given opportunities to use those words and that using more complex words will increase a child's vocabulary (2006). According to the article by Bransford & Pellegrino, young learners should be introduced to academic language through direct instruction and modeling of correct language. They say that children can understand 95% of what they hear as long as it is said clearly; however, if it is not said with an accurate model then the child will have a hard time understanding (Bransford & Pellegrino, 1984). The article by Bransford and Pellegrino also states that the more a child hears academic language, the better their vocabulary will be. This is because the child will recognize the words as being used in various situations outside of school (Bransford & Pellegrino, 1984).

**The Use and Understanding of Language Developmentally**

Christakis states that children develop language by listening to the adults around them and imitating what they hear. She also says that children use metaphorical expressions by the age of three (1993). The article by Bransford & Pellegrino states that young learners can understand 95% of what is said as long as it is said clearly; however, if not said correctly then they will have a hard time understanding (Bransford & Pellegrino, 1984). The article also says that children do not understand new words if they are not given opportunities to use those words and using more complex words will increase vocabulary. Christakis states that the first five years is when children begin to develop their understanding of language (1993) and that it takes place through listening, imitation, and metaphorical expressions (1993). In her book _The Five Year Old_, Erika Christakis states that children will focus on the idea behind a word during the first five years of their life more than they will worry about spelling or pronunciation. She also says that young learners do not understand new words if they are not given opportunities to use those words and using more complex words will increase vocabulary (1993).
