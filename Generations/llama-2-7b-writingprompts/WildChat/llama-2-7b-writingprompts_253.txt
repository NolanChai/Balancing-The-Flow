Response is good so far, though it's not as good as I'd have liked. But my favorite part is when Petunia realizes she can use magic, because I find that hilarious. I also like Kazuki and Kanae's personalities a lot, and I've already written the first chapter of their story together in Japan (I had to do it that way so they could meet each other at some point).
