**Body Paragraph 1:** Eating unhealthily is a sign of laziness as it leads to obesity, which could result in serious chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus. This will affect the patient's quality of life and can even be fatal at times. As for exercise, it has been proven that exercising regularly helps to prevent ailments such as hypertension and heart disease, which would normally take decades for symptoms to appear. In short, these lifestyle choices can affect people in many ways. **Body Paragraph 2:** Eating healthier and exercising should be encouraged by the government through public service announcements (PSAs) and even a campaign on social media so that it is easier for more people to find out about it. This could lead to them changing their unhealthy habits for the better, which in turn would reduce the burden of the healthcare system as well as save lives. **Conclusion:** In conclusion, I believe that eating healthier and exercising regularly is vital so people should be encouraged to do so through the promotion of good nutrition and physical activity by the government.

More and more people decide to eat healthy food and exercise regularly as we have been encouraged by many sources, such as government, media, and education. I think there are several reasons why people decided to do so in recent decades. Firstly, government plays an important role as a promoter. For example, government provides various types of subsidies to food that is good for health. For instance, in Thailand, the rice price in rural area is significantly lower than city. Therefore, people tend to consume more and more white-colored rice which is believed to cause diabetes. On the other hand, red-colored rice is considered as a healthier type of food since it contains fewer carbohydrates compared to normal one. Secondly, media also affects peoples' decision to eat healthy food and exercise regularly because it has power to educate people about importance of good health. For example, advertisement that is produced by government and organization such as Thai Health Promotion Foundation informs us about benefits of consuming a fruit every day and encourages us to do so. As we know, fruits contain vitamins which are important for our body. Finally, education also makes people become more aware of importance of good health. For example, some schools provide classes about nutrition and physical activity. Moreover, parents are educated to teach their children how to eat right and exercise regularly. In addition, many books about healthy life style have been published and promoted in many countries recently. All these sources make people realize that we should take care of our own body by eating healthier foods and exercising more.

Besides the reasons stated above, I believe there are some things can be done to encourage more people to eat healthy and exercise regularly such as government should reduce or even eliminate subsidies on unhealthy food for example, white rice in rural area. As a result, we will consume less of these foods that cause diabetes and obesity since their prices have become high enough to deter us from eating them. Secondly, media should stop advertising products which are considered as not healthy such as unhealthy cake and candies in children's TV show so that parents will not be influenced to buy these foods for their kids. Finally, education is very important because it can teach people how to live a healthy lifestyle. As we know, good nutrition and regular exercise are essential for good health. I think it is also important to educate about the benefits of healthy diet such as weight loss and reduction in risk of diseases like cancer and diabetes which can be caused by unhealthy foods.

In conclusion, I believe that more and more people decide to eat healthier food and exercise regularly because there are many sources promote them to do so including government, media, and education.

Hi there! I'm sorry that this was late but it's a pretty good essay. I think that this question was a bit unfair though because you had to write on the trend of adopting healthy lifestyle in a way where you did not mention what are the reasons why people adopt the habit (or why they don't). So if you were going for higher marks, I would suggest that you write an essay with more structure like this:

Academic IELTS Writing Task 2 is one of two tasks in this section. The academic version of writing task 2 tests your ability to formulate a clear argument and communicate it to the reader through the use of logical reasoning.

The world's richest people are also the most greedy. They do not give what they have, but only take from others and use their money for themselves. The worldâ€™s wealthiest people like Bill Gates, Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg are all known to be philanthropists, and they all donated a large amount of their riches for charity work.
