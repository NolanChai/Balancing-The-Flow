A scene where Will, Mike, and Dustin are on the way to meet up with Steve. As they walk through the woods, they notice that there's something wrong with Max as she's screaming and throwing things around. The three of them go back in her house and try to talk to her. It is clear that she has lost all control of herself. They start to try to calm down but she begins to get violent again so the boys call Steve, who arrives with his car just as Max has completely lost her mind. Will goes for his gun and they lock Max up in a room before they leave to meet up with Steve. The next day, Mike and Dustin are outside of the house and notice that there is a mysterious man who has been staring at them. The boys go back inside and begin to hear weird noises coming from Max's room. As they're trying to find out what's going on, the man burst into the room and begins attacking everyone in sight with his mind powers. Will is able to shoot him but the boy comes back to life a couple of minutes later and they are forced to kill him again.

Max was still on her couch watching the TV. The scene was cut short by a commercial break. She turned off the TV and started to think. She thought about what it would take to make her do something that evil, then the thought occured to her. ``I'm being controlled by some kind of alien parasite!'' she exclaimed. ``It must be the Mind Flayer from that game, Super Mario Bros 2!'' she then went outside and started to dig a hole in her backyard. After about half an hour she had a tunnel deep enough for her to enter without anyone knowing. She entered the dark cave that she had made and found something on the wall. It was a red button. ``Press me?'' said the button, but Max just ignored it because of how creepy it seemed. Then the button started speaking again, saying: `You've come too far to give up now.' Max then pushed the button, which turned out to be a button that opened a hatch in the cave floor. In front of her was a red portal, and she was about to step through it when she felt an evil presence in her body. It seemed to be controlling every muscle and thought. The portal closed behind Max, and she suddenly found herself in front of the TV again. She then stood up and said: ``I've always wanted to do something really evil!'
