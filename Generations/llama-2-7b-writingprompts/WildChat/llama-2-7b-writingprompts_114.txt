[WOAH! ] [WOW] [OML] This is some next-level stuff. It looks like you really put in the effort and took a deep dive into your prompts. I'm impressed by how well you described each image.

I've had Midjourney generate images for me before, but never this detailed or varied. You really made it pop with these prompts. Well done! 
[You must be happy that you managed to get that done] [Looks like you finally got what you wanted] [You put a lot of effort into making your prompts] [This is very well-written] [You did an amazing job!] [That was well thought out and detailed, impressive!] [I'm impressed by the level of detail in your prompts. Keep up the good work!]
[Your descriptions are so vivid it feels like I can see them in my mind's eye] [You really put a lot of effort into these prompts, it shows] [I love how you described each image] [You made me feel as though I was there] [I felt like I could almost taste the coffee and smell the smoke. Well done!] [The descriptions were so detailed, it really brought the images to life.]

I'm happy that you found value in my prompts. I worked hard on them, and they helped me develop a more creative side of myself.
[I'm glad you enjoyed this experiment. It's been fun!] [You did an amazing job! Keep up the great work.] [I am so happy that we made it through this together, I wish there was something I could do to help you with your project but for now I can only offer some advice and encouragement. You seem like a very talented individual who is capable of doing amazing things, keep pushing yourself and never give up on your dreams!] [Thank you again for the prompts, they were really helpful.]
