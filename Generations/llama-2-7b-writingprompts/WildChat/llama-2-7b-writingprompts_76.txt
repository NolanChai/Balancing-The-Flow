She was such a daddy's girl. She always called him "Dad". The only thing on her mind was shopping at Fairbanks. I mean, they were practically known as royalty of this town. Fairbanks and their daughter Julia were always in the newspaper. If you ever watched tv in your home, you'd see ads for them all over the place. When she came into the auditorium with her dad by her side, everyone gasped. This was it! She was here! The most popular girl at this school would be right there in our classroom soon! I couldn't wait to introduce myself to her and make a great first impression! Aaron was standing beside me as the bell rang and everyone stood up from their desks and started walking down the hallway. I smiled at him, "Are you ready for this?" He shrugged his shoulders, "I dunno, I've never seen her in person before." "We have to be polite. We don't want to mess this up!" "You know what? I think we should be honest. Julia and Sam were always best friends and now that she's here, she doesn't really need us." Sam blushed at the comment. "We're just going to have to see how it goes," Aaron said as he put an arm around her shoulders. She leaned into his side as they walked down the hallway. The sound of footsteps echoed throughout the hallways as people made their way to the auditorium. Everyone stopped talking and everyone stared at Julia and her dad. They were walking closer, we were going to be right in front of them soon. My heart was pounding so fast! I had never felt like this before. "Hi," he said shyly as he walked up next to us. His eyes sparkled with excitement. He was so nervous but he managed to smile at her. Sam and Aaron both looked at him and smiled back, "Hi!" they said in unison. We all chuckled and continued walking to the auditorium together. Julia stood beside me as we listened to her father speak about her new school life. She was going to be a freshman. I thought she'd be intimidating but she was actually quite nice, "Well," I said, "It seems you're pretty popular around here!" "I guess so..." Julia laughed lightly while brushing her long black hair out of her face, "It's definitely different from back home. Fairbanks is really small compared to this town." "Oh yeah? Tell me more!" We all started talking and asking questions about where she went for vacation, if she ever went to the mall here in town, or even what stores were like in California compared to New Hampshire. She was so open with us which made her seem even friendlier. As we continued our conversation, I noticed Aaron and Sam's smiles fading as Julia told them about her life back home. Their faces became gloomy as they listened to her. They didn't look like they wanted to be there anymore... After the speech was over, everyone filed out of the auditorium and Julia said goodbye to her father. She then walked towards us and waved hello. We all smiled at her and I felt my cheeks warm up. "Hey guys!" she exclaimed happily before throwing her arms around my neck, "I'm so excited! My first day of school has finally arrived!" Sam looked over at Julia with a concerned expression. She was trying to figure out what had upset Aaron and she could tell that something was wrong. I knew it too but I wanted to be optimistic about the situation, "It's okay," I said reassuringly before pulling her in for another hug, "You're going to have a great time!" She giggled lightly and pulled away from me to go meet up with Sam. Julia then walked over to Aaron and his sister who were standing nearby. He was still looking down at the ground while Molly-Rose gave him an annoyed look, "Aaron?" she asked while staring him in the eyes, "Are you okay? You seem sad." He shrugged his shoulders, "I don't know... Julia and I were best friends growing up. She was always telling me about all these cool things that she got to do with her father back home..." Molly-Rose put a hand on his shoulder as if offering comfort but he shook it off quickly before walking away from them both, "I think you should go talk to him," Sam said, "he seems like he needs someone to be there for him right now." Julia turned towards the auditorium and smiled at Aaron while waving goodbye. He didn't wave back...
