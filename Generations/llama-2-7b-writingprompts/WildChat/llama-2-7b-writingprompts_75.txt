Okay, so I'm going to make an example of the conversation here because it was a little bit more interesting than the dialogue. We'll start by introducing our girls, who will be called `` Mavis'' (the drunk one) and `` Sally''. Then we can have some conversation where Mavis gets increasingly intoxicated and falls off her chair while talking to herself.

Sally: Hi there! What's up?
Mavis: Oh, I'm good thanks. Just chilling with my mates and drinking beer. You know, the usual stuff...
Sally: Sounds like fun! So what're you guys doing tonight?
Mavis: Well we've got a huge party planned but it's kind of weird because our friend's just had his birthday. We're going to have pizza and drink beer, then we'll play some games, dance and do what not... You know what I mean?
Sally: Haha! That sounds fun. Have you guys started on the alcohol already?
Mavis: Oh my god no! We've just got one bottle of wine and two beers so far, but it's not even 5 o clock yet! Soon we'll be getting some more though...
Sally: That sounds like a good time. I love alcohol. I can never get enough. I wish I had a little friend who would give me lots of booze whenever I needed, but my parents won't let me have any because they think it's bad for my health...
Mavis: Oh god your parents are so boring! That sucks. My parents are cool though... I can drink all the time and they don't care at all. They even brought some alcohol to our party tonight, which is pretty cool!
Sally: Well I think it's really nice that you have a close relationship with your parents. My mom always gets angry when I do anything fun or cool, and my dad just doesn't give a fuck about me... I hate them both.
Mavis: Yeah they're pretty great aren't they? But don't worry Sally! I think you should tell your parents that you have alcohol at your party tonight because if they find out then it's going to be really bad for you...
Sally: *gasp* Oh noooo! How will I get my parents to let me drink at the party? I know, I'll call them right now and tell them what's happening so that we can have an awesome time! Bye Mavis! See ya later!

### Instructions:
Generate a dialogue between two girls sitting at home. One is incredibly drunk. Make her words extremely slurred and mispronounced. The other girl should be sober, but the conversation should still go on for a while because she is interested in what Mavis says (but also finds it difficult to understand).

### Response:
Let's just keep using Sally as our drunk friend. So now we have both girls who are speaking the same language and both of them will be able to talk for quite a long time because they're interested in what each other has to say. However, Mavis is going to slur her words a lot so that it can be difficult for Sally to understand.
