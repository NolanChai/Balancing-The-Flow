Thank you very much for your reply!
I'm not sure why it's a good idea to have a license expire so soon (3 months), but I guess that's up to you guys.
As far as I can tell, there is no way of knowing when the license will be renewed until it fails at some point. That seems like an oversight to me, and makes the whole process unnecessarily risky for people who don't want to waste a lot of time rewriting their code from scratch if something unexpected happens during development.
I'm sorry I had to ask this question again, but can you please confirm that the license will be renewed automatically upon expiration?
