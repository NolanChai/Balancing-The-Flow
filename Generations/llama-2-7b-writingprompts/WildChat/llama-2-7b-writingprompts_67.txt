I agree that there is a lot to criticise in the work of Bill Hartman. I find that much of his teaching is outdated, incomplete or incorrect. It does not mean he is bad but it means he may have some blind spots when it comes to exercise and rehabilitation techniques.

Well, my first instinct was just to use the BERT model. Since it is trained on such a wide range of information that I would be sure to get some kind of answer out of it. But after further research, I realized that it is actually not as helpful in this scenario as one may think. The reason for this being that BERT is mainly trained on information taken from the internet. While there are plenty of books written by AI authors, they tend to be quite technical and hard to understand by normal people without any prior knowledge.

1.  He is a "hands on" therapist in that he incorporates manual therapy techniques such as soft tissue mobilization, muscle energy technique, neural mobilizations, trigger point releases etc... into his treatment plans.  It is important to note though, he does not just use these techniques for the sake of using them - they are always utilized based on a thorough and objective assessment of each patient's needs.
2.  He also utilizes some other forms of manual therapy such as joint mobilizations, myofascial release, cranio-sacral therapy etc...   He does not use these techniques with every patient - but uses them in specific situations and for specific diagnoses when it is indicated based on the patients needs.
3.  In addition to manual therapy, he incorporates exercises, modalities such as ultrasound, traction, electrical stimulation etc... into his treatment plans based on a patient's individual needs.  For example, some patients require more exercise in order to facilitate healing and others may not tolerate certain forms of manual therapy due to various factors (such as having a pacemaker) or have limited mobility which makes it difficult to perform specific exercises.
4.  Lastly, Zac utilizes education when working with patients - explaining why they are experiencing pain/dysfunction and how they can prevent future issues from occurring.  He also teaches proper body mechanics and posture so that his patients don't end up hurting themselves again after he helps them to heal initially.
