There are a few different options here. You're not going to get away with the "socially conscious car rental" name, and there's no way you'd be able to register it as anything that remotely resembles your original domain. So the best option is probably to just register something that sounds close enough to make people think of you but not close enough for them to get too suspicious (for example, "socarrental.com" or "socarsharing.net") and then redirect it to wherever you decide to go with your business.

A strength of mine that I think would be a valuable asset to the company is my ability to multi-task. At my job, we are often working on multiple projects at once, which requires us to switch back and forth between various tasks. Because I'm so used to doing this, it makes me very efficient in getting things done quickly without sacrificing quality. A weakness that has been brought up by some previous employers is my tendency towards perfectionism when working on projects or assignments alone time (like during lunch hours). This isn't necessarily a bad thing but I do have trouble letting go sometimes so it takes me longer than expected because everything must be perfect before moving onto the next task!

Internal Auditors should be able to communicate their observations in a concise and clear manner, to ensure that the correct information is passed along from them to management.
In addition, they are required to have strong negotiation skills when dealing with people who may not share their viewpoint or disagree with their findings, as this could result in the internal auditor becoming too emotionally involved in the situation and losing focus on what needs to be done.
An Internal Auditor must also possess strong analytical abilities, as they will need to analyse data from different sources to provide accurate conclusions about certain issues that arise during their investigations; this includes analysing financial statements for any discrepancies or irregularities which could indicate fraudulent activity has occurred within an organization’s operations.
Lastly, good internal auditors also possess excellent interpersonal skills since they must interact with people on a regular basis while conducting their duties effectively without compromising ethics standards set forth by law enforcement agencies or regulators governing various industries across Canada (for example).

**D** is the correct answer. Auditors are expected to be honest, impartial and independent in order to ensure objectivity during the execution of their responsibilities. 
Audit firm must have a set of core values that guide employee actions and decisions as part of the instituion’s culture. When internal auditor is aware of his or her weaknesses, they can use it for self-improvement.
