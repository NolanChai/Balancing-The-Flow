Thank you for your prompts! You may have noticed that I did not submit the responses to your prompts. This is because the responses are the most valuable part of the prompting process, and I want you to be able to receive the best feedback from me as well as other users in order to improve. 
                            
                            **To ensure maximum quality and authenticity**, I will only generate images based on your prompts when I am not busy with other tasks. As a result of my limited time, I may take up to 24 hours to respond after you submit the prompt. Once I have submitted my response image, I will update this comment box with the generated image, as well as any comments and feedback regarding the prompt.
                            
                            **Once your images are posted, please remember to rate them for other users!**
