Today's special at The Spur is a pizza topped with taco meat, lettuce, tomato, onion, olives, bell peppers, and cheddar cheese. The Spur's house dressing is a homemade salsa sauce that combines all of these ingredients plus some garlic and a little bit of lime juice to make a tangy, zesty, and spicy dip for your pizza crust. You can also have this delicious combination on top of one of our classic cheese pizzas or as an appetizer with a side of garlic bread.
