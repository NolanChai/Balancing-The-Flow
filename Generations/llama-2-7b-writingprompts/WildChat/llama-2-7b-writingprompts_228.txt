_Mary is a beautiful, innocent virgin who is chosen by God to be the mother of His Son. She becomes pregnant in an act of grace when she accepts the invitation of God's Holy Spirit._

### Explanation:

The Catholic Church teaches that Mary was born without original sin (see [RCC 491](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/catechism/p2s2c3a6.htm#IV) and [RCC 518-520](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/catechism/p3s4c1a5.htm)). It is believed that God chose Mary, a virgin, to become pregnant with the Son of God without sin; in this way Jesus would be born free of original sin and able to redeem mankind from it (see [RCC 499](http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/catechism/p2s2c3a7.htm#IV).) Mary was the first person ever chosen for this special vocation, which is why she is called `Theotokos` (Greek for `mother of God`) by the Orthodox church; a title that has been rejected by Protestant denominations and other Eastern churches.
