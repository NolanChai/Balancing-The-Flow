*Jimmy is one of my favorite characters from the comics and I can't wait to see him make his silver screen debut.
*I wonder if Dan Garrett's "Beetle" suit will show up in the movie. That would be pretty cool if it did.
*I remember seeing a photo of Ted Kord standing next to Blue Beetle, so I figured that he'd still get some presence in the film. It makes sense though since his company is also featured and Kord Industries already exists within the DCEU. I wonder if we'll ever see him again in the future films.
*I remember hearing somewhere that Jaime didn't want to be a hero at first. That would make him more relatable than usual, which isn't always a bad thing.
*I thought that there was an Atom in the DCEU? I guess he never got his own film though.
*The Superman Legacy movie will feature Supergirl and several other DC characters. This is different from how most superhero movies are made, as they usually just focus on one character's origin story or backstory. The MCU has been criticized for this before, but it makes sense with what the DCEU is doing now that there's a shared universe between both universes (unlike the 2015 movie Batman V Superman).
*I hope we get to see some more of the Scarab in action. I always thought it would be cool if they gave Jaime an actual mechanical scarab-like suit instead of just giving him a helmet and some gloves.
*If nothing else, Blue Beetle will succeed in making superhero heritage a celebrated component in the film genre. The DCEU is doing that now with its own unique take on how legacy works within superhero films.
