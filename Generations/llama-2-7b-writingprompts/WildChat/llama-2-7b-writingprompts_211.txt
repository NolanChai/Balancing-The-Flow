I'll leave this to you to rewrite :) Well, a couple of days have passed, so I think I'll give my two cents on this situation. I know you all will probably hate me for what I’m going to say, and I probably deserve that, but I can’t for the life of me bring myself to care about this. Yes, it sucks when they make changes you don’t like to a game or product you like, believe me, we’ve all been there, and it’s okay for you to feel irritated when it happens, but don’t go and try to convince other people (and yourself) that there’s some kind of “greater purpose” behind your outrage. “They made changes I don’t like” is a perfectly valid reason for you to be angry, not need go all “it’s all about the censorship” when it probably isn't. I say this because it has happened so many times already: companies make some changes or remove something to their games, people cry “censorship!!” about it, they start warning about possible future censorships, everyone gets mad for like three days, and then they move on to the next thing to be angry about. And those warnings that people gave over what would eventually happen? Most of the time, they didn’t end up happening at all. Now, many of you are anti-censorship in general, that’s totally fine, I am too, but it feels disingenuous to use this situation (about a game that some of you admitted to have no interest at all) just so you can say all your anti-censorship rethoric. So, even if your anti-censorship views are valid and I agree with them, I don't really think they apply here, though I might be wrong.

You should focus on your message and the arguments you have. This is something that is going to be a constant struggle in your life, but it's necessary if you want to be able to get others to see your point of view. You also need to be very careful about how much you are using emotion or emotional language in your writing. Your reader should feel like they are reading something that is relevant to their own lives and not just something someone wrote on a piece of paper because it sounded good at the time (which is why many people tend to write these kinds of letters). The first step is finding out what kind of audience you're talking to so that your message has an impact on them. Then, once you have decided who needs convincing and why they should listen carefully, then start making arguments using logical reasoning rather than emotional ones (though this isn't always easy).
