I found some of my answers [here](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-websites-for-learning-programming), but I did also look through Google and a few other sites to find the answers, but I didn't keep track of what I looked at.

* Permanent hair color is still a niche in the market and there are relatively few major players. The top three brands have combined to control over 70% of the market share according to Euromonitor International. They include L'Oreal, Henkel and Wella. The remainder is primarily split between smaller local or regional brands.
* According to Euromonitor, global value sales for permanent hair color are set to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2% from 2013-2018, which is significantly lower than the overall cosmetics and toiletries industry CAGR of 4%. Permanent hair dye is still considered niche in many regions. This is likely to change over time as consumers become more educated and aware of its benefits.
* According to Euromonitor, the US continues to dominate sales for permanent hair color globally, accounting for 58% of value share in 2013. The growth of the middle class in emerging regions, however, is driving growth in this category as consumers are more aware and accepting of new technologies, products, ingredients and concepts.
* According to Euromonitor International's “The Future of Men’s Personal Care: New Concepts, Technologies & Ingredients” report, the global market for men's permanent hair color is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2% from 2013-2018. This segment has become more popular in recent years as consumers are becoming increasingly aware and accepting of new technologies, products, ingredients and concepts that are typically only associated with the female market.

Yes, it is. If you walk down any street here in the southeastern part of Brazil you will see many men with brightly colored hair. The most common colors are red and blonde. I've even seen some people with pink hair. However, this practice is not as common in other parts of Brazil such as Rio or Sao Paulo, which is where all the tourists go to. In those cities you may see a few men with brightly colored hair but it is much less than in the southeast.
