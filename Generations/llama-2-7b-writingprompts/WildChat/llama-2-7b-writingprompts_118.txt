[this is told entirely from Sayori's point of view:]

(In the hospital…)

Sayori: “Huh? Where’d you go? MC?”

MC: “Sorry, I needed to take a quick bathroom break.” (I leave the room. After about 45 minutes, I return.)

MC: “Sorry for keeping you waiting.”

(The nurse hands me something in a box with my name on it and walks out.)

Nurse: “Here’s your daughter, sir. Her name is Sachiko. Take care of her well.” (I leave the room. After about 45 minutes…)

MC: “Sayori, I brought your little girl home.” (I hand Sayori a box.)

Sayori: “Thank you so much MC! She’s so cute!” (I open up the box and see a baby in it. She’s gorgeous. I kiss her head as Sayori takes her to feed her.)
