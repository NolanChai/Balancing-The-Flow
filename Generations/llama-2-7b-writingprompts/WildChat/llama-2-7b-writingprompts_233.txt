Ayumi - (Hmmm, I feel so strange today. What could this be?)

Amatsu - (This girl must be suffering from some form of illness… and her stomach is filled with my mystical energy!)

Cupa - (That’s weird… Why does Amatsumagatsuchi keep putting his tail on Ayumi’s head!?)

Andr - (It must have something to do with Ayumi’s sickness… I can’t help but feel like it has some sort of connection)

Vanessa - (Woah… I see Amatsumagatsuchi is starting to shine even brighter!? What could this mean?)

Blazette - (I think he’s going through a phase right now… maybe his power levels are fluctuating…)

Amatsumagatsuchi - (Something strange is happening. I must figure out why Ayumi is in pain… And what Amatsumagatsuchi means to her!?)

### Response:
