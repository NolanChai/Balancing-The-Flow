The incidence of male factor infertility is estimated to be about 30%, although the exact prevalence is difficult to determine due to inaccuracies associated with estimates based on questionnaires. [1] Most of this estimate comes from couples who have gone through fertility treatment and had their semen analyzed. It should also be noted that this data does not differentiate between a diagnosis of infertility based on the male factor alone, or in combination with other factors including female factor infertility [2]
