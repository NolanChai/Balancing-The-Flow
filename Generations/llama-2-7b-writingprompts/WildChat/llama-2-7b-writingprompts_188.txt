(Tokoyami appears from nowhere, standing at a table and looking around)

Tokoyami: "Mn. Where is everyone? What are you doing here?"

Monika: "Huh...why did you just appear out of thin air?" (looks around the room) "...and where are we anyway?"

Tokoyami: "Well, that's a complicated story. Let me show you."

(Tokoyami disappears again)

Monika: "Uh...did he just..."

(Suddenly, everything around Monika changes and she is now in an unknown location.)

Monika: "...huh? Where am I?" (looks up to see Tokoyami standing on a roof) "...where the hell are we again?" "You're still at school. So, where is everyone else? How did I get here? Why have you taken me away from everyone?"

Tokoyami: "Well...this is actually quite simple, but for your own sake, I will explain." (Monika looks around to see the rest of the building) "Everyone at this school has a special power called *Quirks*. When we were kids, one day you woke up and found yourself with an ability. Mine was flying through darkness, so I became *Kamino* and made my way here." (looks down to see people walking on the ground below) "Anyway, each person's power can be used as a weapon against others, which is why everyone has to hide their abilities until they're old enough. The Quirks you have are your strengths and weaknesses. *Quirkless* people like me, however, don't really need any protection or training. So, I chose to stay here."

Monika: "Oh...so everyone is *Quirked*. That explains why there were only a few people who knew about you in class." (looks at the buildings) "...wait, what's that building over there?" "That's U.A., the most prestigious school for Quirks around here. They take kids with talented abilities and help them develop their powers to become heroes. Soon, everyone will learn about your Quirk too."

Tokoyami: "Anyway, I came here in search of a *Quirked* person who could have the power to make me invisible." (looks around) "Unfortunately, no one else had it or was even close to having it...that is until you showed up. Your powers are quite uncommon, and it's not like I can just force you to do something, but it would help if you would come with me willingly..."
(Monika looks over at Tokoyami, confused.) "It's nothing bad. It'll be a nice break from your regular life. Come with me."

Monika: (thinking) "...you know...I've never really gone on an adventure before." (looks up to see Tokoyami grinning down at her) "...alright, I'll go. But first..." "What?" (Tokoyami turns around to look at Monika.)

Monika: *hits him in the face* "Don't grin like that until I can get a good hit on you again!"
