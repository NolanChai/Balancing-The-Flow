The risks are very small, because you'd be moving so fast and the particles are so far away that they wouldn't have much of an effect on you.  The main danger is actually the solar wind, which can do some damage to your shielding in a lot of cases.

I think you're asking about something called [Faraday Cage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_cage) and it's effectiveness against directed energy weapons (lasers, microwaves, plasma, etc.) I haven't read anything on that but there is a lot of information on the physics behind them. The concept seems pretty straight forward as you basically shield with metal or have a material with very high electrical resistance.

I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD6_0Wfy2oI) which has some interesting information on directed energy weaponry and how they work (lasers, microwaves, plasma, etc.). It also touches a bit about what is used to protect against them.

I found [this article](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1358750614002393) that discusses the effectiveness of Faraday Cages on directed energy weapons but I have to say it's a little more complicated than just wrapping in metal or having something with high resistance.

The general consensus is that as long as you don't use any shielding methods with [specific](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=%23!i!8zIaUfyYnTp_xZW24sU59OiHNb7GXcR0u68L1k82hW1-JKlKqJtgBQ&ved=0CCcQFjAB&ei=32zvVY_hEcTNyAS9o4DwAQ&usg=AFQjCNHn7ZxG2X5rCb-RaIY-3UZ_MdPWfA) [properties](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=%23!i!8zIaUfyYnTp_xZW24sU59OiHNb7GXcR0u68L1k82hW1-JKlKqJtgBQ&ved=0CCcQFjAB&ei=32zvVY_hEcTNyAS9o4DwAQ&usg=AFQjCNHn7ZxG2X5rCb-RaIY-3UZ_MdPWfA), I don't think you will get any effectiveness.
\begin{itemize}
\item [Electrical Resistance](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=%23!i%3D8zIaUfyYnTp_xZW24sU59OiHNb7GXcR0u68L1k82hW1-JKlKqJtgBQ&ved=0CCcQFjAB&ei=32zvVY_hEcTNyAS9o4DwAQ&usg=AFQjCNHn7ZxG2X5rCb-RaIY-3UZ_MdPWfA): Faraday Cages are generally made of materials with high resistivity, which is why most are made of copper or other metals.
\item [Conductors vs. Insulators](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=%23!i%3D8zIaUfyYnTp_xZW24sU59OiHNb7GXcR0u68L1k82hW1-JKlKqJtgBQ&ved=0CCcQFjAB&ei=32zvVY_hEcTNyAS9o4DwAQ&usg=AFQjCNHn7ZxG2X5rCb-RaIY-3UZ_MdPWfA): Most metals conduct electricity well, while most organic materials do not. This is why the insulation on copper wire is so thin - it's easy to damage with your finger, but a tiny amount of metal can carry enough current to heat up and melt your finger.
\item [Permeability](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=%23!i%3D8zIaUfyYnTp_xZW24sU59OiHNb7GXcR0u68L1k82hW1-JKlKqJtgBQ&ved=0CCcQFjAB&ei=32zvVY_hEcTNyAS9o4DwAQ&usg=AFQjCNHn7ZxG2X5rCb-RaIY-3UZ_MdPWfA): [Permeability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permeability_%28electromagnetism%29) is an attribute of a material that controls how it allows magnetic fields to pass through it. This is why some metals like iron are great for making magnets, while others like copper and aluminum do not conduct magnetic fields at all. The permeability of materials changes with temperature as well - as you increase the temperature, most metals become more [ferromagnetic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism).
\item [Skin Effect](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=%23!i%3D8zIaUfyYnTp_xZW24sU59OiHNb7GXcR0u68L1k82hW1-JKlKqJtgBQ&ved=0CCcQFjAB&ei=32zvVY_hEcTNyAS9o4DwAQ&usg=AFQjCNHn7ZxG2X5rCb-RaIY-3UZ_MdPWfA): This is where the metal in a Faraday Cage can become dangerous. If you run electricity through something that's very dense with conductors, like most metals, [the current will focus on just one pathway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect) through the material and heat up to very high temperatures (upwards of a thousand degrees in some cases).

The Selhealing matrials will only work on a small area, say 2 square feet. If the damage is beyond that the healer may be able to restore the area but will need to take time to recreate what has been lost.

The response is to either use an AI system with full repairoperator functions (If its fast and safe enough) or use some sort of reapair drone (Like the MIT-SAT), or a smaller spaceship that can travel to it and repairo it, also it can be left behind as a mining ship. If there is no other option the crew will have to repairo it themselves.

A) It is the responsibility of every country to assist its citizens. They would have no choice but to comply with his request, or risk their own citizens being arrested and charged with failure to cooperate with the world community. If they did not do anything, it could also be classed as a breach of the treaty, because they were refusing to aid in international space travel.
B) They would have to find an alternative method of launching their own rockets. Or perhaps, just use the other nations' rockets. That way, no one nation would have complete control over space exploration and sovereignty claims in that region could be disputed.
C) If they did not do anything, it could also be classed as a breach of the treaty, because they were refusing to aid in international space travel. This is unlikely, however. The chairmanship position is highly respected and any chairman would take their responsibilities very seriously.
D) It is the responsibility of every country to assist its citizens. They would have no choice but to comply with his request, or risk their own citizens being arrested and charged with failure to cooperate with the world community.

I think this is very interesting idea - the situation could be made more interesting with some additional details e.g. What if the crew had been put into cryogenic stasis and so are technically alive? However I feel that it would be too difficult to make sense of a story such as this without knowing more about the rescue organisation, its reason for not searching - is it due to cost, or could they simply not care enough.

Spacecraft Missing: An Alien Abduction Adventure is a video game that takes players through an adventurous journey of first contact with extraterrestrial lifeforms.
The game starts at the top screen where the player can view their ship. The ship has a small control panel, a map and an information page in the lower right corner. There are six buttons: PLAY, GAMES, SAVE, WARNING, ESCAPE and VACANT. 
Playing the game begins when the player clicks on PLAY. Once clicked, players will be prompted to select a name for their ship as well as a username and password. This information is used to store progress in the game, which can be loaded at any time using SAVE or WARNING. If the user does not save his/her progress, the last saved profile will automatically appear upon re-entering the game.
Once logged on, players have two options: PLAY and GAMES. Selecting PLAY takes users to a space-themed map where they can find different planets. Some of these planets contain aliens to explore, while others are empty or feature space objects that will help players progress in their mission to save Earth (more on this later). The player's ship is displayed at the top screen with an information page below showing which planet is currently selected and how far away it is.

Players can move their ships around by clicking on the different planets on the map, selecting PLAY again or clicking on a planet to land on that planet. Clicking on a space object or planet will show users details about what they're looking at; for example, if players click on an empty planet it will say "no life found" and if players click on a red planet it will tell them how many aliens are living there.
Once a player lands on one of these planets with extraterrestrial life forms, he/she can explore the landscape by clicking around (see Figure 3). As they move through space, each step takes up part of their fuel supply; if players run out of fuel before landing somewhere useful or saving Earth from destruction then their mission will be considered failed and their ship will crash into an asteroid field.

Clicking on an alien will bring up a menu of options: INTERVIEW, ATTACK or MEDICAL. Selecting INTERVIEW takes users to the main gameplay screen shown below. The screen shows five different spaceships; each ship has been taken over by one of these extraterrestrial species and is displaying information about how they look/feel/think about Earthlings (see Figure 4).

Players have two options when interacting with these extraterrestrial creatures: attack or medical. If players select ATTACK on one of these spaceships (see Figure 5), it will immediately start fighting back against Earthlings; however, if they choose MEDICAL instead then a doctor is sent over to check up on them and learn more about how the alien feels/thinks about humans as well as what kind of medical care he/she needs.

The game ends when the player selects GAMES and chooses one of these different types of games to play. The first option, named PLAYER 1, is where users can choose their own name and avatar (see Figure 6). Players also have an option for sound effects at this screen; if they turn on music then it will play in the background throughout the game.

The second game is named GAME OVER; this option takes players back to the main menu where they can choose between SAVE or WARNING. Selecting either of these buttons allows users to load their current progress in the game at any time. The third option, PLAY AGAIN, takes players through another adventure on an empty ship with no fuel; if this happens again then it will automatically take them back to GAMES where they can choose between playing as a new player or starting from SAVE point 1 (which loads progress from before).

### Analysis:
The main idea behind this project was to create a game that would allow players to interact with different alien species in outer space. The first step of development involved deciding on what kind of environment we wanted our players to explore; after some discussion, I decided that an abandoned ship floating through intergalactic space would be interesting for people who enjoy playing games where they must solve puzzles and complete challenges to move forward.
The next stage was finding out how much time/money would be needed to build this project into a game worth releasing; after calculating all expenses associated with developing it from start to finish (including software development kits), I estimated that our final product should take about 10 hours per week for two people working full time on developing the project over 3 months.
When developing my first prototype, I decided against using any type of programming language because most of them were too complicated or expensive when compared to what was needed here; instead, I opted for a tool that allowed me and other team members access at no cost: Unity 4 Pro Edition + Asset Store Extension Pack.
Finally, after testing out different versions on my own computers throughout the summer months before finalizing one version for release, I began working with another programmer who helped add more features such as sound effects which were not available during prototyping phase (see Figure 1).
### Questions:
- What was your favorite part of this project? - How did you feel about the time/money commitment that was required to get your idea from concept into a product worth releasing?
- Did anything surprise you while creating this game, or were there any challenges along the way that surprised you during development?
### Thoughts:
This project is definitely one of my favorites; not only did I enjoy working on it but also getting feedback from other people who had played through it multiple times. It took about two weeks to finish this game completely since we spent most of our time building a prototype before finalizing the code and adding more features afterward (see Figure 1). The time/money commitment that was required to get my idea from concept into a product worth releasing surprised me; I did not realize just how long it would take until I began testing out different versions on my own computer throughout summer months before finalizing one version for release.

### Conclusion:
This project allowed me and other team members access at no cost: Unity 4 Pro Edition + Asset Store Extension Pack. Finally, after testing out different versions on my own computers throughout the summer months before finalizing one version for release, I began
