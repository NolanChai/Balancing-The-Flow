(The doctor was waiting for us in the room. He greeted us with a warm smile, and we all sat down in chairs around him.)

Doctor (to Sayori): “Alright, Sayori. Are you ready to meet your child?”

Sayori: “Of course, Doctor.”

Doctor (opening a door): “This is the delivery room, where babies come into this world. This will be your baby’s first breath of air!”

(As Sayori walked through the door, the doctor guided her to a bed with a bunch of monitors and machines on it.)

Doctor: “Alright, Sayori, lay down so we can check you out.”

Sayori: “Okay…”

(After Sayori laid down, the doctor began checking her vitals. However, he noticed something was wrong right away.)

Doctor: “Uh-oh…”

Sayori (frowning): “What’s wrong?”

Doctor: “I’m sorry to say this, Sayori, but your baby isn’t going to make it.”

Himari (shocked): “WHAT!? BUT HOW DID THIS HAPPEN!? WE WERE PREPARED!”

Natsuki: “What about Kohana?”

Yuri: “I don’t know. I hope she’s okay.”

Sayori (crying): “WHYYYYYYY!? THIS CAN’T BE HAPPENING!!”

Monika (hugging Sayori): “It’s okay, Sayori. We all love you.”

(Doctor quickly left the room to prepare for something.)
