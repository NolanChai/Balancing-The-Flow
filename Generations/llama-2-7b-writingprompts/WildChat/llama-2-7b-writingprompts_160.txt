Yes, we're going to do a little bit of mindfulness around the idea that you are always in control. It is true that you have an inner voice that is a critical voice and sometimes that can be very helpful when we're being productive. But also it can get in our way if we get stuck inside of our heads too much, so just a little bit mindfulness around this idea that you always have the power to choose how to react and what direction you want your energy to go next time. It is true you may not have control over many external circumstances but you always have choice on how you're going to respond to them. And I think it's really helpful for us as leaders to be mindful that we can choose whether or not we react from a place of scarcity, we've all heard the term abundance mindset. So there's just some mindfulness around this idea that you have the power and control over your own reactions and responses.
