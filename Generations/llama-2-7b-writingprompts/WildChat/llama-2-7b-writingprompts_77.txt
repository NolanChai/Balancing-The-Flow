It's been about two decades since we all heard the big news that Napster would be shutting down. It was a music-sharing website where you could download music from artists like Metallica for free. The company itself only lasted four years, but it did pave way for other services to come in. Since then, the industry has evolved greatly and many have been trying to figure out what's going on with royalties for musicians who are releasing music through streaming services.

We live in a world where people use social media as their main source of entertainment. Music is very much a part of our lives now, whether it’s the background noise while we’re working or listening to our favorite artists while cooking dinner. The industry has changed so much that even people who have never been big fans are listening more and downloading less. With this new way of consuming music comes an entirely new set of challenges for musicians trying to make a living off their art form.

The biggest challenge facing today’s artists is how they get paid by streaming platforms like Spotify or Apple Music (or any other service that provides on-demand audio). These services pay out royalties based on how many times each song plays on these sites, but it can be difficult for musicians to know exactly how much money they're making off their music since there’s no direct relationship between sales and revenue.
