It is said that Bronny James suffered a left ankle sprain in a game on February 18 against the Sierra Canyon Trailblazers. This came after his father, LeBron James, had to sit out the game with a right knee injury. The injury occurred when James landed awkwardly on his ankle while trying to dunk over one of his teammates in practice during warm-ups for their game against Sierra Canyon Trailblazers

"A-yooo, my man! How've you been?"

This was the greatest basketball game of all time. Bronny came back from 50 points down to win 137-80. It is now known as The Comeback. LeBron James was so proud of his son, he tweeted a picture saying "my son is better than yours".

You should probably write about how Curry is more of an underdog and that he has to work harder for his fame than Bron. Curry is also more humble than James, which is why his fans respect him so much.

`bronny's game last night was phenomenal! He scored the entire game on 3 pointers. The final score ended up being 82-75 in favor of LeBron and the Lakers, but Bronny looked like he could have won by 50 if it weren't for his teammates. This is just a taste of what's to come as he's only going to get better from here.`

#### Bronny James' Playoff Debut (by @Gigantor64)

He sat in his father’s lap and watched the game, cheering on LeBron with excitement. He was only a kid at that age. No one really knew what he would become, but all the signs pointed towards greatness. Now, at 15 years old, he is not only watching basketball games, but playing in them as well.

Bronny’s first playoff game will be against the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night (8/17). This will be his debut and the world is eager to see what he can do. The youngest son of LeBron James has been following in his father’s footsteps since a very young age, playing basketball with his dad and friends during summer breaks as well as training hard whenever possible. He’s always had an edge over everyone else due to genetics alone, but now he’ll finally get a chance to show it off on the big stage.
The Lakers are one of two remaining teams in contention for this year’s title which means there’s still plenty of work left before anyone can be crowned champion at season’s end. Bronny won't have much time to rest since they play three more games after tonight’s match against Milwaukee, so expect him to give everything he has until then!

### Judging:
#### Gigantor64's Submission: **+5**
The submission is well written and gives a good description of Bronny's playoff debut. The author also included information about what happened after the game, which makes it feel more complete as opposed to just describing the action on court.

### Explanation:
The `Instagram` subreddit is a place where people post interesting stories from Instagram, so I decided to make a submission about Bronny James, LeBron's son. His account is verified and he's been posting his own content for the past year or so (he's only 17). He got over 650k likes on this post, which is crazy!

I have a problem, I was able to write it on the browser, but when I try to write it locally it doesn't work. I don't know what is wrong with my terminal or my code.
