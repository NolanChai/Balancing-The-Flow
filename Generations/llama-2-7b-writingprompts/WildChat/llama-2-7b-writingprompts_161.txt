Yes, you will get the same results. It is all about timing. However, it is better to keep on injections during that period, since there is no benefit of taking hgh injections every second day or every third day (and you risk side effects). If your pct protocol does not contain nolvadex or clomid for a couple of months, then I would not recommend you to start again after the end of this month.
