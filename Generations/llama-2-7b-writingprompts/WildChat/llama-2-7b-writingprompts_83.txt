> The first thing you notice when you enter the street is the strange architecture; it's like nothing you've ever seen before. Houses are stacked haphazardly onto each other, creating a jumbled mess of rooflines and walls that seem to go on for miles. The streets themselves are narrow and winding, making them difficult to navigate, but there is something strangely comforting about the way they wind around each other. It's almost as if you're lost in a maze, but at the same time, you know exactly where you are. There are no clear landmarks or markers on this street, but that doesn't seem to matter; somehow it feels like home.
> As you continue down the street, you start to notice that there seems to be some kind of pattern in the architecture. The houses get progressively smaller and more cramped together as they go deeper into the neighborhood, until finally they give way to an area of abandoned buildings with broken windows and overgrown weeds. It's like a forgotten part of town has been swallowed up by this bizarre pattern, leaving only its ghostly remains behind. It's almost haunting in a way, but also beautiful in its own strange way. The street itself is narrow enough that you can feel the warmth of other people passing by on either side of you; it gives you an intimate connection with those around you that you don't often find in larger cities. There's something about being surrounded by strangers but still feeling connected to them, even if only for a moment or two as they pass by on their way somewhere else entirely.
> You turn the corner and find yourself in an alleyway lined with trash cans; it looks like someone has been living here at some point because there are old mattresses scattered about along with other items that suggest someone may have had a home here at one point or another but no longer do now for whatever reason (probably because they're all gone). There seems to be some kind of light coming from above somewhere - perhaps it's coming through one of the windows in one of those abandoned buildings? You can't tell exactly where it's coming from though since there are so many different angles that could be causing this effect, but regardless you decide to head toward whatever light source might be emanating from up high.

The story of New York City is one of immigration and adaptation, one of resilience in times of adversity and innovation in the face of opportunity. The story began in the 1600s with a Dutch settlement at the southern tip of Manhattan Island, then known as "New Amsterdam." After the English took control from the Dutch in the late 1600s, the colony was renamed New York City and continued to grow. By the mid-1700s, it had become one of the largest cities in North America.
In 1825, New York City's population reached one million people for the first time. This growth continued through the next century with an influx of immigrants from all over Europe and Asia as well as migrants from other parts of the United States who were attracted to its economic opportunities. By 1940, New York City was home to more than eight million people -- nearly half of whom were born outside America -- making it one-third larger than any other city in the world at that time and twice as large as London or Tokyo (both with populations around six million). In 2013, there are now over eight million residents living within its borders.
New York City's history has been shaped by many factors: natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy in 2012 which flooded large sections of lower Manhattan and knocked out power for millions; wars between England and America; economic booms such as those seen during the Depression Era or post WWII era when jobs were plentiful but housing was scarce; political corruption that has long been associated with city politics; high crime rates due largely to gang violence over recent decades; public transportation systems like subways which have helped make this one of the most walkable cities in America despite its size (more than twice as large as San Francisco); cultural influences such as jazz music or Broadway musicals that have come out of New York's diverse population; sports teams like baseball's Yankees who are so popular they still fill stadiums even after 15 World Series titles and over a century since their first championship (the longest winning streak in any sport).

The people who built this city are gone now, but some of us still live here and work here, even if we're not from around here. We came to build something great -- to be a part of history -- and we did it. This is what remains.

Here, the incentive is power. Whoever controls this city controls everything. But there are competing interests: those who want power over this city, and those who want the freedom from it. And they're all at war with each other.

#### The Sovereigns

The Sovereigns are the most powerful people in the city. They have control of every aspect of life here -- they own the banks, the businesses, the land, and even some of the government itself. They made this city what it is today: a place where only the rich can survive. The Sovereigns hold on to power with iron fists, crushing any who would challenge them in their quest for control.

Their motives are simple: they want to be in charge. They do not care about anything else but themselves and their own power. If you stand in the way of a sovereign's ambition, you will be destroyed or bought out -- either one is just as effective at achieving total domination.

#### The Militias

The militia groups are all about protecting those who can not protect themselves. They want to ensure that everyone has what they need and deserve in order for them (and their families) live in peace with others around them without fear of violence or harm coming at any moment from either side - whether it be from an individual attacker, gang member or even government authority figures who may try taking advantage over someone else's life situation.

#### The Thieves Guild

The Thieves Guild is a powerful organization that has been around for centuries and they have infiltrated every aspect of the city. They control what you eat, where you live and how much money you make or don't make - all because it keeps them afloat financially as well as being able to do whatever deeds need done without anyone knowing their true intentions. The guild is run by an inner council that is responsible for making sure everything stays in order while the outsiders only know what they are told by someone higher up on the food chain - usually a member of the council itself so as not too much secrecy gets revealed during times when things might need investigating further than usual before any decisions are made regarding certain individuals.
