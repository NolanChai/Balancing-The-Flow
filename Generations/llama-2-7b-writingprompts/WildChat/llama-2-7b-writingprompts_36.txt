Mindy: “Why won't anyone help me?!” (sobs) “I can’t even fly anymore…I keep falling and falling…” (cries again) “I just want to go home! Where am I?”

Valefor: “It’s alright, Mindy. I’m here now.”

Mindy: “Oh, Valefor? Thank goodness, I was so worried!”

Valefor: “Calm down, it’s fine now.”

(Mindy is still crying)

Mindy: “I-it’s just…I don’t know what to do. My wings have never failed me before! I always thought they were strong enough to handle anything!” (cries)

Valefor: “It’s okay, it's going to be alright.”
(picks Mindy up and carries her inside the cavern)

Mindy: “Thank you…thank you so much! I feel so safe when you carry me!” (crying stops)

Valefor: “There there, it’s okay now. We just need to figure out what's causing this.”

(Inside the cavern, Ifrit has found a source of disturbance.)

Ifrit: “I think I know what this is.”

Bahamut: “What is it?”

Ifrit: “The ambient energy here is being corrupted by…something. This source of darkness and negativity is causing all the other aeons to fall ill.” (points towards a small, glowing orb) “There’s our culprit.”

Valefor: “What should we do? Destroy it?”

Bahamut: “Hmm…no, I don’t think that would be wise. We must find out what this dark force is and how to neutralize it without causing any further harm. Do you have any ideas?” (looks towards Ifrit)

Ifrit: “We can try summoning another aeon. Maybe they know something about this darkness we don’t.”

Bahamut: “Alright, let us see who is strong enough to handle it.”
(all the aeons gather around the glowing orb)

Valefor: “Here goes nothing…” (she reaches out with her hand and summons Anima. She’s still sound asleep.)

Anima: “Mmm? What’s going on?”

Ifrit: “Anima, wake up!”

(Anima slowly opens her eyes)

Bahamut: (quietly) “Go ahead.”

Anima: “Okay…” (focuses her attention on the orb) “Hmm…it feels familiar. As if I’ve seen it before, but…where was that?”

Mindy: “Where is it? What’s going on?”

Valefor: “Calm down Mindy! It’ll be alright.”

Anima: (continues to examine the orb) “It’s…it’s dark, but not entirely. There seems to be a glimmer of light, like a tiny star shining through the darkness...”

Bahamut: (thinking out loud) “Darkness and light are two opposing forces. Perhaps this orb represents a balance between these two energies.”

Anima: “It’s a beautiful balance…but I can sense something off about it. There is an imbalance in the dark energy - like a tear in the fabric of reality. This tear must be causing the others to fall ill.” (pauses) “But how do we fix it? Is there anything I can do?”

Bahamut: “There may be another way, Anima…if you’re willing to give this a try. Valefor and Ifrit, take Mindy away from the cavern. I don’t want her getting hurt if things go wrong.” (looks towards Anima) “It will not be easy, but you must focus all your attention on the orb and channel its power through your own energy. Use this to repair the tear in reality. You are our only hope against this darkness.”

Anima: (nods) “I understand…”
(Valefor and Ifrit help Mindy out of the cavern, leaving Anima alone with the orb.)

Bahamut: (lowers his voice even more) “Now, it will take all your strength to repair the tear. I’m afraid there is no guarantee that you will succeed, but…we must try.”
(Anima closes her eyes and focuses on the orb. The energy slowly begins to glow brighter, shining through the darkness.)

Mindy: “What's going on? Why are we here?”

Ifrit: “It’s okay Mindy, everything is alright now.”
(Bahamut walks towards Anima. Suddenly, a bright light begins to emanate from the orb - it shines brighter and brighter, almost blinding the aeons.)

Mindy: “Uh…what’s that? Is this what I think is?” (pointing)

Ifrit: “That’s the sun, Mindy! We’re outside of the cavern now!”
(Bahamut kneels down next to Anima and places his hand on her shoulder.)

Bahamut: (whispers) “You did it. I never thought you had it in you.”

Anima: “I can’t believe it either…it was so difficult, but now that the darkness has been defeated, everything feels lighter and brighter.” (smiles) “Thank you all for helping me. It wouldn’t have been possible without you.” (looks towards Bahamut) “But most of all, I need to thank you, Bahamut.”

Bahamut: (nods) “It was my pleasure, Anima. You were a true force to be reckoned with.”
(Anima takes a deep breath and smiles)

Anima: “Now that this darkness has been defeated, we should all get some rest and recover from our injuries. We’ll have plenty of time later to celebrate our victory!” (nods at each of the aeons) “Good night.”
(Everyone bows down respectfully, except for Valefor who is still standing next to Bahamut.)

Bahamut: (whispers) “Thank you. You were always there for me when I needed you most…and now it’s time for you to rest as well.”
(He places his hand on her shoulder and smiles sadly.)

Valefor: (staring at him) “You’re leaving?” (sobbing)

Bahamut: (nods) “Yes. I cannot stay here any longer, Valefor. This world is too heavy a burden for me to bear.”
(He opens his wings and flies away into the distance.)

Valefor: (crying) “No…no no no no NO!” (runs after him)
