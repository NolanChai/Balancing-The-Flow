I've always believed in this saying. The more I learn, the better I will do on tests. However, many students disagree with me and are not sure if it is true or not. Some argue that rote memorization has no place in learning a subject. Other say that you only need to memorize information for certain times (like the period when you're preparing for exams). I think this argument makes sense because we always get overwhelmed by the amount of information we have to learn so it would be helpful if some were forgotten later on.

One way of understanding the impact of cognitive load on the brain is to consider what happens when it’s not there. For example, when we are daydreaming, our brains are often distracted by thoughts or emotions that do not seem to have a clear connection to our current environment; this suggests that during these periods, our brains may be focusing on other things rather than processing new information from the outside world. On the other hand, when we’re actively engaged in learning, we can better identify connections between different concepts or ideas because it requires us to think about them at once instead of just one thing at a time as with daydreaming. Therefore it seems possible that there could be two types of cognitive load: one type which helps us process new information quickly while another type which slows down our processing speed due to distractions or lack of concentration (e.g., when we’re stressed).

“Memorizing” anything is an incredibly bad idea. Knowing something doesn't mean that it makes sense to you or that you understand how it works.  We learn more effectively by taking the time to figure things out for ourselves rather than just being told what they are and then memorising them.  The biggest impact of having/promoting a comprehensive understanding is that you can ask better questions, and get better answers from your learning.  You'll have a much easier time determining where you went wrong with a question if you understand the material at a deep level rather than just regurgitating information.  Memorizing things makes it easy to cheat because memorisation is all about repeating something that was given to you in order to pass an exam rather than actually understanding the material yourself.  The other problem I see with “memorization” is that it's incredibly difficult to do without making mistakes, especially if you have a large amount of information to memorise.  You end up learning things incorrectly or forgetting critical pieces of information because you tried to cram everything at once and it didn't stick properly.  The biggest problem I see with this is that students try to make themselves feel good by just memorising what they're told, but then when it comes time to actually do something in real life they haven't learned anything other than the superficial knowledge of what a thing is and how to pass an exam on that subject.

1. The statement "memorisation is not essential for effective learning" can be supported by the findings of research from memory experts such as, Richard Wiseman and Daniel Schacter. They argue that many people think they'll remember something if they re-read it or repeat it multiple times, when in fact, it is better to spend more time on understanding concepts and making connections with information rather than repeating the same information over and over again. 
2. To support this claim I will present a quote from Daniel Schacter who conducted an experiment where he found that "students who focused on making connections between different pieces of material, and spent less time re-reading the text, had better long-term memory than those who just memorised lists or repeated passages over and over again."
3. In conclusion, it is important to understand that there are many other methods to ensure effective learning beyond repetitive memorisation which are more efficient, such as using concept mapping or making connections between different pieces of information rather than spending too much time on repetition or re-reading material multiple times when this may not be the most effective method for long term memory retention.
4. Based off these findings I would recommend to my students that they focus more on understanding concepts and making connections with information rather than just focusing on memorisation as it will have a better effect in helping them learn new material effectively over time.
