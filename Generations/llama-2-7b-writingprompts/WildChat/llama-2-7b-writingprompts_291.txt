Greetings! I want to inform you about the latest market developments, including: 1) Banks are offering high deposit rates up to 7% due to high deposits and low interest rate. Some of our clients already have been contacted by banks, some others are still worry about locking in current yield for long tenors, which is why they don't want to rush. We need to take advantage of this opportunity by promoting CMS (7%) before the end of 2015.  
2) Investors still favor FCNs over UST due to lower interest rate. Some investors are hesitating about bonds, which is why we should keep emphasizing on the credit quality of UST in order to attract more clients.  
3) For our CMS products (CMS 154 and CMS 156), we are still not able to provide a 20-year tenor for investors. We need to contact investment banks or other financial institutions to see if they have this product available, or we can offer CMS 154 with 2-year maturity and promote the liquidity of the product.  
We will keep you updated in the coming weeks. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Thanks!
