I would say that the most effective subliminals are the ones with high quality sound. The one you want is one where it's not too much and not too little, but just right. For example, if you hear a loud roar or someone yelling at you while you sleep (which is bad) then it may be because of something else that they were trying to do. However, if you hear whispering when you are asleep then it could be subliminal messages telling you what will happen next in your life and how much better off you'll be when all this is over with!

The 7 subliminals would have an affirmation for each one:
1) You are loved, cared for. - I love you (parent or child).
2) It is safe to open up now (you can trust me).
3) No more abuse will happen (it's over and it won't happen again).
4) I am healed from my past painful experiences of being hurt/abused in any way, shape or form. - The past does not define who you are today!
5) Your childhood is just a memory that was created by society (I love you).
6) You are safe to talk about what happened when we were young without fear of judgment or shame because it's okay for me too talk about how my parents hurt me/abused me so much too - but now that doesn't mean anything anymore because I am healed from all those experiences and have moved on from them.
7) I am safe to talk about the past without fear of being judged or shamed (I love you).
