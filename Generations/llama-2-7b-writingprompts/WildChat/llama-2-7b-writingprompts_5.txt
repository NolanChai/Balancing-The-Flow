A. An aortic aneurysm is present, and will require surgery to prevent rupture. A murmur is usually heard in the pulmonary area, but in this case it is associated with a diastolic heart sound which points towards an aortic component of the murmur.

### Discussion:

The aorta runs from the left ventricle and ascends to the abdomen where it gives off three major branches, each branching into further branches. The brachiocephalic artery originates at the point in which the aortic arch bifurcates into two branches (left common carotid artery and right subclavian artery), travels down towards the neck, and eventually ends by giving off three major branches, one of which is the vertebral artery. The left common carotid artery then gives rise to the internal carotid artery and the external carotid artery which supplies blood to the head via the superficial temporal vessels and the facial veins. The right subclavian artery then continues down towards the thorax, where it ends by giving off two major branches; the innominate (right common carotid) artery and the vertebral artery.
The aorta has three layers: 
* Tunica intima - composed of endothelium and media layer. It is the innermost layer that is directly in contact with blood.
* Tunica media - consists of smooth muscle tissue, elastic fibers and collagen. This layer supports the aorta’s shape, size, and tone, and helps regulate its pulsatile function.
* Tunica adventitia – composed of loose connective tissue and elastin fibres that form longitudinal strips. The tunica media is supported by this outermost layer which provides strength to the aorta and allows it to withstand high pressures during systole. The aortic arch, thoracic and abdominal portions of the aorta are surrounded by adventitia whereas only the ascending and descending aorta have tunica media covering them.

The survey has to be conducted in a scientific way. The collected data should be representative of all socio-economic groups. A proper sample size will ensure that the data is accurate and not biased by small errors. To prevent errors, the responses are to be kept anonymous. The questions asked would be selected randomly from a list of possible questions. This would be done by using software or an algorithm.

### Justification:
In my opinion, the government should first conduct a survey on its people’s health and level of education in order to create awareness about these topics among the masses. The collected data will act as a base for further action steps taken up by the government.

The patient is not eligible for influenza or pertussis vaccine until 12 weeks gestation because the vaccines are contraindicated during pregnancy before this time, and may be administered at any point in pregnancy afterward. The patient does need varicella and rubella vaccination. Rubella is part of a routine vaccine series, but it's also important for the patient to receive that vaccine because if she gets infected during her first trimester with rubella, there's a high risk of miscarriage. So the most appropriate response would be A: Varicella and rubella.

The most important step is to slow down. Slow your speech, ask if you were understood, and give them time to write it down. Also, I believe that nurses should get a phone call from the lab stating results and be asked “Did I hear right?” before being given an assignment or patient care.
