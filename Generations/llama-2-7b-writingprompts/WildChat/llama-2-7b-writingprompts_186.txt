1. Azure Site Recovery is one of the best way for DR solution, you can also have cloud backup by using Azure Storage and it will take care of all your disaster recovery scenario. 2. You should be able to move all your VM’s to Azure by using various ways like virtual machine migration , Azure site migration etc.
3. There are lot of performance monitoring tools in azure and other tools from third parties which you can use to monitor the system, check them out here https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/cloud-management-and-monitoring-solutions/
4. Secure connection between sites and Azure will be handled by using VPN for that purpose. And there are various types of connections like Express Route which will allow you to connect on private network also.

**Hello**, I was able to locate a PPT presentation titled 'Microsoft Azure Overview' that is available for download [here](https://www.slideshare.net/sudhirbansal1234567890123/microsoft-azure-overview). It covers some of the main points you're looking to cover and is an excellent starting point for your PPT. Additionally, I have also included a link to [Microsoft Azure Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHQ8TdEvM_L5BQJxWUwKNYDmIvCXA4rRi) which is an extensive course on Microsoft Azure that covers topics like Cloud computing, Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service(SaaS).

- IaaS = Infrastructure as a Service (cloud) provider; A provider who offers virtual hardware to rent for computing power.
	- For example Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure are all Iaas providers.
- PaaS = Platform as a Service provider; A provider that builds platforms for software development on the cloud.
	- For example Heroku, Zoho Creator and Google App Engine are all PaaS providers.
- SaaS = Software as a service provider; A provider who offers web based applications to rent/buy.
