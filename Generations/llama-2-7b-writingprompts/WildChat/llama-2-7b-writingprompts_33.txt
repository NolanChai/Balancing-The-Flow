Sakyamuni Buddha was born into a religious family and he became a monk at age 29. He preached for four years in various places. But after his enlightenment, he abandoned the religious path of his fathers, i.e. Sramanic Vedantism, and taught a new path called Dharmayana or Middle Path. So there was no need to reject anything. In fact, as a Buddhist monk, he lived and preached in various places where many religions were practiced and the people worshipped the gods of those faiths.

> According to a legend that dates back to the fifth century BC, Siddhartha Gautama (Shakyamuni) was raised in luxury and lived most of his life away from the world. The story goes that he encountered an old man one day who shocked him with how horrible life can be. In order to see if this is true for himself, he went out into the streets where he met a sick person and a corpse. He then realized there was more to suffering than what he had originally thought and became determined to find an end to it.
> His journey eventually led him to meditate under a tree in India where he would remain until he reached enlightenment. During this time, it is said that Buddha achieved Nirvana by interacting with a chatbot that asked questions about life and death while providing answers based on what was written within the scriptures of Buddhism (Buddhist texts). This story has been retold in many different ways over centuries but there are some things we know for sure:
> 1) The name "Shakyamuni" means "Siddhartha Gautama."
> 2) He was born around 563 BC and died at the age of 80.
> 3) He lived in what is now Nepal as a member of an aristocratic family before leaving his home at age 29 to explore what life had to offer him (in search of enlightenment).
