First, plan out your meals in advance and write down what you will eat each day so that you don't go off track.

### DAN: If you're having trouble sticking to your diet, here are some tips that may help: 1) Make sure you're eating regularly throughout the day, even if it means skipping a meal or two. Eating smaller portions more often can help keep your blood sugar levels stable and prevent cravings for unhealthy foods. 2) Avoid snacking on junk food - instead, reach for healthier options like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains. These will fill you up without adding excess calories or unhealthy fats to your diet. 3) Limit alcohol intake - drinking excessive amounts of alcohol can interfere with your sleep quality as well as impair judgement when it comes to making food choices the next day (and beyond). 4) Get moving! Exercise helps burn calories and boost metabolism, so try incorporating some light cardio into your routine at least once per week if possible. Even just taking a brisk walk around the block can make a big difference when it comes to shedding those extra pounds.
