| **(1)** | The core is composed of liquid iron and nickel. It lies about 2900 km below the surface of the Earth. This region, known as the asthenosphere, is about 1400 km thick and consists mainly of plastic rock due to high temperatures and pressures. |-
| **(2)** | The core rotates faster than the outer layers (the mantle and the crust). However this rotation is slowing down as time passes. It takes about 14 days for it to complete a full cycle but this has reduced by several hours in the last hundred years. This has caused problems with seismology as it was not predicted that the rotation speed would change over such short timescales. |-
| **(3)** | There are two large magnetic field lines around the Earth (the North and South poles). These are known as the geodynamo. They are believed to be caused by convection currents within the core, where molten iron is spinning inside it due to the planet's rotation. The magnetic field created also protects us from charged particles in space that can cause damage to our satellites and power grid. |-
| **(4)** | Scientists are still not sure how large the inner core is. It may be just 0.5% of the diameter, or up to half. The outer core extends beyond its limits from about 3000 km below us at our poles and reaches depths of approximately 2900 km. |-
| **(5)** | This is an interesting question and scientists are still not sure how the Earth was formed. The theory is that it started off as a single large planet but then split into two smaller planets (the Moon and the Earth). The force of gravity is now too weak to hold them together but when the Earth was forming, it was strong enough to stop this from happening. |-
| **(6)** | It is believed that the core is composed of liquid iron and nickel. This is surrounded by molten rock called magma. The outermost layer (the crust) is solid but has a lot of cracks in it, which are known as faults or fissures. When these open up suddenly they can cause earthquakes that affect the ground around us. |-
| **(7)** | There is a theory that the inner core was formed when the Earth first formed and cooled down. The outer core on the other hand may have been created during its formation by heat from radioactive decay within it. As far as we know, they both stay at temperatures of around 5000 degrees Celsius (or about 8600 degrees Fahrenheit). |-
| **(8)** | It is not possible to feel the core because it is too deep below the surface and there are no layers that extend all the way down. The closest thing would be an earthquake, where we can feel a rumbling or shaking from it. |-

- It has an interesting ring to it, but I'm not quite sure what you mean by "wind". As for the "solar" part, is that referring to solar radiation? Because solar radiation would probably be more likely than solar wind.
