The series is pretty weird... The main character is in rehab after a car accident, but she's only paralyzed from the waist down? How did that happen? Also, her roommate is also paralyzed, but from head to toe. She's just some random dude with no name or backstory and he spends all of his time in a hospital bed. It's not explained why she has a male roommate or even if they are related. Another thing about this show is that there are so many characters, but none of them seem to have any connection to each other. The only one who stands out at all is Celestine, and she isn't even the main character. She's just some random girl in a wheelchair who has no backstory or purpose for being on this show.

The first season was good enough... The second season started to get really boring because none of the characters were interesting anymore. There wasn't any plot or story, and all they did was sit around and talk about nothing important. It felt like watching two hours worth of commercials with people who didn't know how to act! The last episode of Season 2 was so bad that it ruined everything for me. I can't believe this show is still on TV because it's just awful now!

I think if you want to watch a good mystery/romance drama, then look elsewhere! This isn't it - this is just garbage and should be taken off the air immediately!
