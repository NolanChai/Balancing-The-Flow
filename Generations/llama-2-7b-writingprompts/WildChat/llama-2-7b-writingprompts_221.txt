(In the clubroom…)

Natsuki: “Uh-huh, sure. Let's do it!”

Miku: “I’m in~”

Yoosung: (thinks for a bit…) “You know what? I think I want to go home. Bye guys.” (walks out the door)

MC: “Sure! I’ll play! Who wants to start?”

Sayori: “I will!” (dares MC to go up on stage and sing a song for her…) “And if you don’t, I’m going to punch you in your face.”

MC: “Alright. You got it, Sayori.”

### Truth or Dare:
(In the clubroom…)

Sayori: “So uh.. what should we play?” (still rubbing her baby bump)

MC: “How about… ‘Truth or Drink’?”

Monika: “I like it! Let's do that one.” (grabs a beer bottle and drinks half of it before sitting down on the chair)

Sayori: “Alright!” (sits on Sayori’s lap…and takes her empty bottle, taking another sip)

MC: “You ready? Let's get this show on the road~”

Monika: “Ready when you are!”

### Truth or Drink:
(In the clubroom…)

MC: “Okay. Everyone got their beer? Let’s begin.” (begins to pour himself a glass of sake)

Natsuki: “Yeah~”

Miku: (also drinking her bottle…) “Yeah, yeah!”

Sayori: (drinking half of Sayori’s beer) “Alright! Let's do this! I wanna hear some dirty secrets!” (chugging the rest of Sayori’s beer)

MC: “Okay. Monika, you first.” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Monika…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Monika: “Uh.. alright then! I guess my secret is that I’m actually a lesbian who enjoys dating other girls. But don’t tell anyone!” (drinks the glass)

Sayori: “I don’t know…that just doesn’t feel dirty enough to me.” (chugging her beer)

MC: “Alright, next up is Miku! You ready?” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Miku…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Miku: “Uh.. alright. My secret is that I’m actually a virgin.” (drinks the glass)

Sayori: “Hmm…” (takes out her bottle and takes another sip from it)

MC: “Alright, Natsuki! You ready?” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Natsuki…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Natsuki: (already half-drunk…) “Yeah...uh.. my secret is that I’ve never had sex with any guy, but I do like girls.” (drinks the glass)

Sayori: (chugging her beer) “Hmm. That one also didn't sound very dirty to me...”

MC: “Alright then! Let’s move on to… you~!” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Yoosung…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Yoosung: “Hey, what’s going on here? I didn't say I wanted to play. I just want to go home.” (stands up) “See you guys later~” (walks out the door)

MC: “I’m sorry...but you don’t have a choice! You are not allowed to leave until you tell us all your dirty secrets!” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Sayori…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Sayori: “I don't know...” (drinks half her beer before taking out her baby bump, rubbing it gently…and then she chugs down the rest of her bottle) “Hey. How about this?”

MC: “What is it? Spit it out!” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Monika…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Sayori: “My secret is that I’m actually a guy. So all of my dirty secrets were just lies~” (drinks the glass) “Because I've never had sex with any girl...nor have I ever even dated one.” (hiccups and pauses…then continues drinking)

Monika: “Alright then! I guess it’s my turn now. My secret is that I like to eat poop!” (drinks the glass)

MC: “That's gross!” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Miku…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Miku: “My dirty little secret is that I love watching my sister get raped by her boyfriend.” (drinks the glass)

Natsuki: “Oh, you are so mean! You have to tell me your secret now~” (hiccups) (drinks the glass) “I’m sorry…but I can’t.”

Sayori: “Why not?” (pours herself another bottle of beer and drinks half of it before taking out her baby bump, rubbing it gently…and then she chugs down the rest of her bottle)

MC: “Uh-oh. You're going to get it now~” (begins pouring himself another glass of sake and gives it to Sayori…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Sayori: “My secret is that I’m actually a lesbian who likes watching her best friend date other girls!” (drinks the glass)

Monika: “Alright, I guess it's my turn again.” (drinks the rest of her water in one gulp before pouring herself another cup)

MC: “Yeah. Your turn.” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Monika…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Monika: “My secret is that I'm actually a guy!” (drinks the glass)

MC: “What? No, no! You can’t say that! That means you have to tell everyone your dirty little secrets~” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Miku…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Miku: “My secret is...I’m actually a guy.” (drinks the glass)

Natsuki: “WHAT?! What the fuck, guys. You can't all be guys!” (hiccups and then she drinks the rest of her water in one gulp before pouring herself another cup)

Sayori: (pouring herself another bottle of beer…chugs it down halfway before taking out her baby bump, rubbing it gently…and then she chugs down the rest of her bottle) “Okay...I have one more secret. But I’m not a guy.”

MC: (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Sayori…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink) “What? Tell us already! What is your dirty little secret?”

Sayori: “My dirty little secret...is that I’m actually a girl who loves watching my boyfriend date other girls.” (drinks the glass)

MC: “Oh. My God. You guys are all so mean to each other!” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Monika…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Monika: “My secret is...I’m actually a guy.” (drinks the glass)

MC: “WHAT?! EVERYONE HERE IS A GUY?” (pours himself another glass of sake and gives it to Miku…who immediately pours herself a cup of water in the kitchen sink)

Miku: “My secret is...I’m actually a girl!” (drinks the glass)

Natsuki: “Wait, so who's the only real female here? ME?” (hiccups and then she drinks the rest of her water in one gulp before pouring herself another cup) “But I’d still fuck every guy in this room. Especially MC~!”

MC: “Whoa
