**Channel 4** **Broadcast - 20th December 2003** **Just weeks before the launch of Channel 4, and with it's new look, logo and attitude, the brand wanted to introduce itself to it's new audience in a simple and effective way. The challenge was to embrace this new identity but not give too much away - it would have been easy to be bombarded by an overload of information and clues that would only make sense later when the new Channel 4 brand finally launched.** **It was decided to use motion control to reveal a cluster of TV's arranged into a Christmas tree shape, with the last screen showing the new logo as part of the new Channel 4 identity. It was also important that this piece should be relevant for any time in the future - the content is purely graphic and abstract so it could easily be re-used on future channels or in other forms of media (and no doubt has been!). The original idea to use a 'reveal' of a Christmas tree was thought up by Channel 4's Production Director.** **The brief was to create an ident with this motion control camera move, which is exactly the same as the one used for the Perspective Ident (a stylised logo animation that introduces each channel of Channel 4). I worked closely with the production company and DOP to get everything ready for filming. The biggest problem during the shoot was that although it had been tested out in advance, the camera moved a little too far right on the reveal shot - meaning we only got enough shots for one take! It's amazing how stressful something like this can be when you have a very short deadline!** **After editing the ident I worked with a friend to create the final audio. The original idea was to have a subtle fade-out of a Christmas song that fades into a new, more upbeat tune - but unfortunately due to time and budget constraints it wasn't possible. In the end we chose an uplifting Christmas music piece with the lyrics 'Christmas is here at last' as an appropriate soundtrack.** **This ident was broadcast for one day on Channel 4, as part of a countdown until the big night of channel launch. The new logo appeared on the final TV screen for just a second before cutting back to the presenter who had been watching from off-screen throughout this sequence. I'm really pleased with how it all came together and the whole project has now become a classic within Channel 4 production!**

I have no clue how to make this look right. The only way I could think of making this work would be to animate the whole thing. Any help would be appreciated as well as feedback for how it looks and sounds.

### Update:
I have added some sound effects to make the static more clear.
