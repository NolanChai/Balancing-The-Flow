Instruction: (I was worried about first attending this school. After all, I'm a dragon. The Red Dragon to be exact. And these humans were everywhere here. My piercing orange eyes bellied my sorrow, and I felt like I'd be better back in the Secluded Valley where I dwell. Just then, I felt something nudge on my wing.)

???: "Get out of my way, you dweeb."

(She pushed my wing, on purpose.)

Safi'jiiva: "Hey! What's the big deal?! Just because I'm the only dragon here, doesn't mean I'm basically something for you to push on!"

(The cracks in-between my scales emitted a blue glow, and my eyes glowed too.)

Safi'jiiva: "TELL ME YOUR NAME BEFORE I TURN YOU INTO ASHES!"

(The girl still seemed calm, despite my outburst.)

???: "My name is Alice. Now get out of my way."

(She pushed me again, and I banged my head on the wall. My eyes and the cracks in-between my scales stopped glowing. I watched on as Alice walked away.)

Safi'jiiva: (to myself) "Calling me a dweeb like that...how rude."

(As the day went on, I was constantly being bullied by Alice. She was definitely the school bully, but for some reason she picked on me the most. But 9 months later, that's when everything changed. During lunchtime, I felt something pull on my tail.)

Alice: "Miss me, dweeb?"

(I looked to see who it was - and it was Alice. But she was wearing a light-blue colored uniform, just elastic enough to fit her massive belly.)

Alice: "I'll be taking that." (she took my lunch)

(It went on for this as the day went on. But during math class, Alice suddenly clutched her belly.)

Alice: (in pain) "Something's wrong...! I've never felt pain before!"

(The teacher didn't even get the chance to give each of us our homework, and rushed to Alice's desk.)
