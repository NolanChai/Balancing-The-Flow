You're right. The sentence should be translated as “迅速盗贼奔驰斜坡上” (The Velociraptor runs on the slope quickly). But, unfortunately, I don't have any good translation for “It stalks its prey above the waterfall.”. You can just translate it to “盗贼以水难渐冲浪” (Velociraptor takes advantage of water).

Comment: I am pretty sure there are other translations, but as far as I know this one is the most accurate. "上" means "above", but not every time; it has a more general sense of direction (like in "The house sits on the hill"). The translation that you came up with may be good for some contexts, like "It stalks its prey above the waterfall." in English, or "盗贼在瀑布上奔驰" ("Velociraptor runs across the waterfall"). However, your translation can also work well when the meaning is clearer than a simple word-for-word translation would be.

Answer: 1) It stalks its prey above the waterfall

This should be: 奔驰斜坡上

2) The Velociraptor runs across the waterfall quickly. (盗贼奔驰瀑布上).

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
The Velociraptor stalks its prey above the waterfall.
\end{blockquote}

There's a big difference between 「stalking」and 「running across」! In fact, these two words are so different that they should be translated with completely different sentence structures: 步行走瀑布上 vs. 奔驰斜坡上。

\strong{A good translation for your sentence would be:} The Velociraptor runs across the waterfall quickly.

I would say 1 and 2 are good translations. However, the last two could be better (in my opinion). You may have done this intentionally to be more literal. If you did, I will respect that. However, if not, here is a suggestion for "swift thief/robber" in Mandarin: 迅猛龙. I like using the character 吃 (Chī) instead of 潜伏(cénpù) because it seems more natural to use this when you are translating from English to Chinese. In addition, "swift" is also an adjective that can be used with any noun/verb. However, in this case we need to make sure the word is associated with thief or robber (抢劫人).

If you use the character 盗, it could mean steal something from another person, which I think is not what you want.

For your last sentence, yes, you can have 迅猛龙在瀑布上方潜伏追踪猎物. However, in my opinion, this may be less natural since it seems too long and not flowing well with the others.

If you do use "swift thief/robber" in Mandarin Chinese: 迅猛龙, then here are some suggestions for the English translation: 
* Swift thieves (or robbers) are hunting prey on the cliff above.
* Swift thievers( or robers) hunt on the cliff above.
* Rapid stealers( or rober) are hunting prey at top of waterfall.
* Raped robers is hunting at top of waterfall.
* Robbed robers are hunting at top of waterfall.

Comment: I think the translation in the comment above was good and just a little bit different from mine so I would say "Raped rober" does not really translate the word properly, however the first 4 translations (I think) are pretty decent and can be used interchangeably with each other. So my vote is 5/10.

Comment: Your translations were a little bit better than mine but it was still not as good as "Raped rober" so I am going to give you a score of 3/10 for your translation.

Yes. The sentence has an exact equivalent in Chinese, with the literal meaning “Velocirhaptors hunt baby dragons.”

* 譯文：
  * 她是這些森林的頂級掠食者。(This sentence has many meaning)
    * She is a top predator in the forest. (more common meaning)
    * The highest level of the food chain in these forests.
  * She is an Apex Predator in the Forest.
* 原文：

She is the top predator of these forests.

Single-horned wing dragon

### Explanation:
The Chinese character 單 has the meaning of 1 and 单 means single. 喙 means horn/beak and 翼 means wing so it is a literal translation for Single Horn Dragon as you could have a single-horned beaked dragon.
