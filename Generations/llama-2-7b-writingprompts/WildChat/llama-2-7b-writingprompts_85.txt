{This would be written from Monika's point of view}

(The Supernatural Club Meeting had been a very stressful one. After all, it was only the beginning of March but Sayori and Yuri were already pregnant with twins! The whole club room was tense when Natsuki announced that she had decided to take Monika's place in the Phoenix family for her humanity test. I wasn't sure whether or not this was a good idea, so I asked Yuri if it would be possible to see what happened after the Phoenix Family takes their humanity tests. She nodded and agreed.)
