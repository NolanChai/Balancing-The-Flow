Awwwww...that's cute! I bet the FP girls would be good cooks if they lived in the same universe as Goku. ðŸ˜Š

The Freedom Planet Girls are having a conversation. They talk about Lilac's adventure with the Ants and what she said, like the fact that they're immortal. The girls discuss how scary it is to see something as small as an ant turn into something so huge and powerful. They also wonder if Goku would be able to beat them since he was about the same size as a normal human.
