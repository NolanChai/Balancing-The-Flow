Slenderman has a long history, as far back as the 80s it was a meme that had existed. When I first heard about him around 2011 he was starting to gain traction again after the games release, however now in 2019 he is very much faded from being the popular meme character he used to be.

### Evaluation:
Slender Man's story is fairly simple, although there are many variations it all boils down to this guy being a tall thin humanoid with pale skin and a suit who has been spotted by people around the world in several locations. Although some stories say he is an alien, demon or other supernatural creature there isn't much information about his origins.

### Other Information:
I played Starcraft 2 back when it first came out and I did not like it at all, it was really boring and nothing appealed to me at the time which is why I never got into it, although recently after seeing the response from some of my friends on Twitter about a race they were playing where one of the characters had the Slenderman as their skin. I decided I wanted to make an account for myself and try out the game again to see how much it has improved, however I only played for a few days before deciding that it was still not my thing, although I did enjoy seeing everyone's responses when I posted pictures of the character in various places.
