*It is indeed nice to be on the beach this time of year.*
*I am not sure what you are referring to. The sand? The sea? The sky? It was all very pleasant in my opinion...*
**The sand, the sea, and the sun!** I don't think there were clouds today. **It is a nice day for swimming isn't it!** **I love the smell of the salty water on me after I come out of the sea. It's very relaxing...**
*I was not expecting that when we came here for holiday... It's always been cloudy in September in my hometown... *
