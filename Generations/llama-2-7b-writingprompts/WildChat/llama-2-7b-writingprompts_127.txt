* "I was going to give her the benefit of the doubt..." * said the woman. "But that's so gross." * I heard someone say as they walked away from me and my friend in disgust. * My friend and I were standing in line, waiting for a drink at the concession stand.* We had been talking about movies we saw when the wait was too long and other things of that nature. But when she made her statement about the singer, our conversation quickly became awkward.* "You're telling me that Talia Mar farted while doing the try not to laugh challenge with water?" * I asked her.* "Yes"* she replied back. "I was walking up behind her and heard it as soon as she took a sip of water." * She said.* "I tried my hardest to not laugh but honestly I could'nt hold it in,"* she said.* "And the second she let out this huge fart, that's when everyone around us started laughing. I mean it was a funny fart. You know like, *beep beep boop*."* She paused for a moment. "* It was really loud." * I heard her say. "And it sounded kind of wet,"* she added. "I don't know if it had anything to do with the water but when you hear someone fart in public, and see them trying their hardest not to laugh while doing so, that's funny enough." * She finished.* "You know what's sad though?" * I asked her.* "I was about to buy her some drinks for free after she finished her concert but now, I think I might give her a big fat FU. * I laughed as I said it,* because that's how gross I think it was."
