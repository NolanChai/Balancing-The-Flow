####1. The article is a short piece written for the student newspaper of Longwood University, called The Rocket's Red Glare. It's a college newspaper. The article was written in 2017 by Michael D. Clarkson. It appears to be an opinion piece. This article is about the Longwood State Lancers, which are Longwood University's men's basketball team.
####2. In the first paragraph, Mr. Clarkson introduces a thesis statement: "The team has had its share of ups and downs over the past 40-plus seasons". He goes on to write about how the team has won championships, but also suffered through bad years as well. This is his thesis.
####3. In paragraph three, he writes about a former player and coach named Ed "Bone" Dugan. Dugan was a good coach who had high expectations for the Lancers, but those expectations were never met. Mr Clarkson says that even though the Lancers weren't able to win championships during Dugans's tenure as head coach, he still did a lot of great things for the program, such as recruiting good players and teaching them how to be good men on and off the court.
####4. In paragraph four, Clarkson discusses how Longwood has struggled since 2010 with only one winning season in eight years. He says that while they are a young team now, it's important to remember what Ed Dugan did for this program, and hope that the current players can continue his legacy by doing well on the court.
####5. The author of this article is Michael Clarkson from Longwood University in Virginia. It was published on September 29th 2017 in a paper called "The Rocket's Red Glare" which is an opinion column about sports. I believe it is written as a persuasive essay because he wants to convince people that the school should be proud of what Ed Dugan did for their program. He does this by talking about how good of a coach and player he was, but also mentions his failures so we don't forget them either (like losing games).
####6. In paragraph 14, Mr. Clarkson talks about how Longwood is not as competitive anymore because they've had some bad years recently. He says this has been hard for fans and alumni who have followed the team since before then. They want to see success again!
####7. The author uses many different techniques in order to persuade his readers that Ed Dugan was an amazing coach despite his failures as well as show how great he really is at what he does best-coaching basketball teams (especially young ones). He also gives examples throughout this entire piece which helps support these claims by showing us how talented some of these athletes were while they played under him or even before then when he coached them during high school or college years!
