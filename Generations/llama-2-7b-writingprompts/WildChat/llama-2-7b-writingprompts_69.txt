Dear Ms. Dust,
Thank you for your inquiry. As we have already discussed, I am happy to perform the ceremony for your lovely couple. I would like to suggest that you consider holding the ceremony outdoors on the property, as a beautiful setting will make this day even more special and memorable for the bride and groom. Please let me know if my suggestion is agreeable to both parties.
With best wishes.

`` The following is what was said at our wedding... ``

In the beginning there was one. And he looked out into space.

And there was more than one. He saw stars and galaxies and planets. He saw life.

He saw love and affection, and a little bit of lust. But then there were two. Two hearts beating as one, like one soul in two bodies. And he smiled because now he saw hope. Hope that we would succeed together. And for the first time, he felt sadness. He knew this was only the beginning.

But now, it is over, and we have arrived at the end of our journey... but I see more stars and galaxies and planets in your eyes than ever before. It's not lust anymore, it's love. But this time there are three. Three hearts beating as one, like two souls in one body. And he is filled with joy because now he sees hope. Hope that we will continue to succeed together and that our journey will never end.

So I say... Now go forth into the night sky. Shine brightly on the darkest of nights, and always keep each other warm. Remember who you are and what you've been through and always come home to me and my family with a big smile. The best is yet to come.``
