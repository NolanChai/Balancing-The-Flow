Yes we need a new freezer, we can only use the one that we currently have. Please let us know when you’re available for delivery so we can make arrangements.

### Follow up:

If possible could you get us another quote? The one on your website seems quite expensive. I was hoping for a cheaper alternative but I guess it's out of our budget anyway.

### Response:

I’ll give them a call in the morning and see if they can do anything better. It would be nice to have a cheaper option, let me know what you find!

### Follow up 2:

They were able to come by today and make an offer. They did it for less than half of your price so we’ll take that one please. Do you think they will be available next week?

### Response:

I'm sure they should, I’ve only heard good things about them from other people who have gotten service from them as well. Let me know when it arrives and let the team know that we’re on schedule!
