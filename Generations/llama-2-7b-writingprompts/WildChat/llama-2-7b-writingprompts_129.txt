In this study, a series of Pt-based bimetallic electrocatalysts with different Fe:Pt ratios have been synthesized by an electrochemical reduction method using the solvent free Fe(Cp) 3Cl/SbF6 system. The catalytic activities for CO oxidation were determined in a rotating disk electrode (RDE). It has been found that the CO2 single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) of these electrocatalysts is highly increased with increasing Fe content, which can be attributed to the formation of Fe-rich clusters. By using the optimized catalyst Pt60Fe40/C, a CO2RR system was constructed and operated as an electrolyzer, where it provides a promising electrochemical approach for the production of CO2R with high CE and EE.
