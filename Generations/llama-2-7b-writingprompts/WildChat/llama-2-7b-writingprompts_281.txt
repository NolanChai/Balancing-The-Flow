Good morning ocean,
You have been a great friend and you always make me feel happy.
I really like it when I'm around you because it feels calm and peaceful, especially in the mornings. You remind me how beautiful our planet is.
Thank you for being my companion during my many journeys. I hope we'll be together forever.
