The operation is done under local anesthesia and is a quick, simple procedure. The incision is made on the skin of the outer ear canal, just before it opens into the ear drum. The sinus tract is then identified by probing the bone with a probe and cutting out the sinuses from the surrounding tissue.

- Open a terminal window and navigate to your working directory (the place where the Makefile is located). You can do this with `pwd`. If you have not set the workspace, then you will be in the default directory which should look something like `/home/you/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.4.1`.
- Run `gem install bundler` to install Bundler. This will require an internet connection and should take a few seconds.
- Open your Gemfile with your favorite text editor (we recommend using [Textmate](http://www.textpad.com/)). There are many other editors you can use, but Textmate is nice because it has autocomplete and syntax highlighting.
- In the new window of Textmate open a new project, either by file or command line.
- Start editing your `Gemfile`. This should look something like:

```ruby
source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'rails', '4.0.6'
gem 'sass-rails', '3.2.5'
gem 'uglifier', '1.3.0'
gem 'coffee-rails', '3.2.2'
#other gems
```

In the first loop, you will check if each element in `arr` is the same as each other. If it does not equal the last element, add it to your result set. Then start the next loop with checking if the next element is greater than or less than any of the elements before it. If it does not meet this condition, then add it to the list.
