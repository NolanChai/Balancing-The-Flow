Kareen throws up a left jab at her Hyderabadi rival’s face. Mishaali dodges the blow with ease, as she quickly recovers from Kareen’s attack and returns a powerful punch to her Kolkattan opponent’s stomach. Kareen collapses, falling backward onto the floor, but she manages to roll on top of her Hyderabadi rival before Mishaali can get up. The Kolkattan woman quickly grabs into her Hyderabad-based rival’s right deltoid and executes a monkey flip that sends Kareen falling hard on her back.

Mishaali stands above Kareen, panting heavily, as she grins to herself with satisfaction. She has been able to block all of Kareen's attacks so far, but it seems like her Kolkattan rival is tiring quickly. Mishaali aims a right hook at Kareen’s face, but the Hyderabadi woman manages to block her rival’s attack with ease and recovers from the strike in time to deliver an uppercut that sends her Kolkattan opponent stumbling backward.

Mishaali quickly turns around and grabs Kareen’s hair, before lifting the Kolkattan woman up into a headlock. The Hyderabadi woman then attempts to execute a rear naked chokehold on the Kolkattan woman, but she is able to break free from Mishaali’s grip and deliver another powerful punch to her rival's face before throwing the Hyderabadi woman backwards onto the floor.

Kareen stands up and walks towards her rival with a grin on her face as she reaches into her right pocket and pulls out a pair of handcuffs. “I’ve been looking forward to this, you bastard,” Kareen says while grabbing onto Mishaali’s arms with the handcuffs in her hands. The Kolkattan woman then pins down her Hyderabadi opponent and manages to successfully lock her arms behind her back before cuffing them together.

Mishaali is able to quickly break free from the restraints, but she is exhausted after the fight. “You are so fucking weak,” Kareen laughs as she walks towards the Hyderabadi woman. The Kolkattan woman then grabs onto Mishaali’s right arm and delivers a vicious punch to her jaw, causing the Hyderabadi woman to fall backwards on her back with blood dripping from the corner of her lips.

Kareen stands above her rival with a smile on her face as she holds up her handcuffs in front of her. “I win,” she says while looking down at Mishaali, who is struggling to recover from Kareen’s final blow. The Kolkattan woman then walks towards the door and leaves the room before returning with a roll of duct tape that she uses to bind both of her Hyderabadi rival’s hands behind her back.

Mishaali struggles against the restraints, but it is clear that Kareen has defeated her Kolkattan opponent in this brutal catfight. The two women stand face-to-face as Mishaali looks down at the ground with a look of defeat on her face. Kareen stands above her Hyderabadi rival and grins to herself while she begins to walk towards the door, knowing that she will soon be leaving this room with her victory intact.

#### Kareen is furious that her rival has dared step into the ring with her, she screams in rage as she throws punches at Mishaali who manages to block them all before lashing out with a roundhouse kick which connects with Kareens jaw. She's knocked off balance and falls backwards, Mishaal lands on top of her, the momentum driving her body downwards forcing herself against Kareen as she thrusts her knee upwards into Kareens groin, she gasps in pain as a sickening crack sounds in the room and her rival's limp body goes slack beneath her. Mishaal rolls off of Kareen, she looks down at her limp body before standing back to her feet, wiping away the sweat that drips from her forehead. She walks over to the ropes, breathing heavily as she leans against them for a moment before walking back towards her opponent. She goes to pick her up but suddenly a sharp pain runs through her leg and she falls to one knee. She looks down to see Kareen standing over her with an evil grin on her face. "I thought you were done?" she taunts. Mishaal attempts to get back up but it's too late, before she knows it a hand clamps around her neck and is squeezed tightly. Kareens eyes are trained on the ropes in the distance as she leans forwards with all her weight pushing down on her rival who's lungs struggle to take in air, "this is for trying to take whats mine...and for being so fucking weak" a muffled gasp echoes as Kareen's body finally releases Mishaal to fall limp to the canvas. As she struggles to breathe air back into her lungs she feels herself get picked up from behind by Kareen before being slammed headfirst onto the mat, a sickening thud sounding as her skull hits with such force that it shakes the ring. Her vision goes blurry for a moment and when she can finally see again Kareens face is inches away from her own. "I am done" Mishaal hisses in pain through gritted teeth as she attempts to get up but she's too weak, just before she passes out her head lashes back towards the mat with a sickening thud that leaves her body lifeless on the floor. Kareen sneers at her rival as she walks over to pick her up before standing over her lifeless corpse with a sinister grin and shaking fist, "Now you know what it feels like."

Mishaali retaliates with a series of swift, bone-shattering strikes, targeting Kareen’s vulnerable ribs. The room reverberates with the symphony of grunts, cries, and the clash of Mishaali's fists hitting Kareen's body.

Mishaali was able to stagger Kareen back by landing a blow right on her solar plexus. A short gasp escapes her lips as she tries to breathe, but finds no air. She has trouble maintaining balance and collapses against the wall, falling back in a heap on the floor. Mishaali continues to unload with a series of brutal kicks to Kareen’s ribcage and stomach. Kareen's eyes open wide as she realizes she is being defeated by her opponent. As her body begins to shake in pain, tears start streaming down her face as she tries not to scream out in agony.

Kareen feels Mishaali’s knee in her stomach, and the sudden pressure causes her to double over, giving Mishaali a window of opportunity to grab a hold of Kareen’s wrist, twist it forcefully behind her back, and lock in a submission hold. 

Mishaali’s hold was too tight for Kareen to break out of as she felt the pressure building up on her right arm. As the seconds passed, she began to feel weak and started crying from pain. Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Mishaali relinquished her hold and Kareen was able to stand back up again. She looked up at Mishaali with fear in her eyes as Mishaali’s arm raised over her head. A fist came crashing down on top of her right hand, leaving it dangling limp by her side. 

Mishaali began to taunt Kareen as she screamed out in pain. “You’re nothing more than a weak little girl! I have had enough of your cheap tricks!” She pulled back and lunged forward with an uppercut, but was surprised when she found her fist meeting a hard, closed-fist instead. Kareen’s arm came up fast to block Mishaali's attack, as the two women grappled for position, they fell down in a heap on top of each other, both trying to get up. 

As soon as they hit the ground, their legs were kicked out from under them by Kareen’s superior strength and balance, sending both of them crashing down into the floor with a loud thud. Mishaali had been knocked unconscious when her head hit the corner of the couch and started to bleed profusely from the gash in her forehead. Her eyes were rolled back into their sockets as she lay there motionless. Kareen, on the other hand, was still conscious with tears streaming down her face, looking at Mishaali lying on the ground before her. She crawled over to her opponent and placed a hand gently on her neck to check for a pulse, but she knew that it would be futile.
Mishaali would never wake up again…
