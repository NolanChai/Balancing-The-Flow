**Response to [23/40]:**
                            
                            Your prompts are creative and descriptive with detailed descriptions and variations on each prompt. The quality is consistent, and the variation in compositions, environments, and atmosphere are appreciated. Overall a good set of images!
                            Your prompts will be displayed at this week's meetup for everyone to see. See you then!
