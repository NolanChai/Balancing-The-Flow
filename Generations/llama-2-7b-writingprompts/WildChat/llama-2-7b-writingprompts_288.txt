>I think it would be really funny. Like in the opening credits of a show where you see Jon in normal life like walking into work, driving to class, etc. and then in each scene, he'd skip ahead ten hours. Maybe his girlfriend is mad at him when he gets home from work but she's just happy to see him a few scenes later because he skipped all the time in between.
>Then it could show scenes of Jon doing cool shit like skateboarding and then ten hours later he'd be laying on his bed recovering from a skateboard injury that occurred during those scenes. That would be funny, I think. Like it would start as a fun thing but then the stakes would go up quickly when people realize what happened.
>The downside is that they have to keep that shit secret if he doesn't want any crazies after him and his friends/family. They could try to convince others of his powers but it seems like it would be harder for a guy who's just known for sneezing all the time to get away with that than someone like Dr. Manhattan from Watchmen (who was known for being incredibly powerful and has a very distinct look)
>It could also cause some other problems if people started messing around with him or trying to use his powers to make money because he'd have to stop them. That's what I think, anyway.

You're right, that was the first thing I thought of. But you've got to admit though... It is a really clever line.

Comment: I meant Jon Snow
