[ ] I am sorry, but this is a non-story. There's no real conflict or plot progression. It seems like you wrote it as one of those "A guy wakes up in the body of his most hated enemy" stories and didn't do anything with it.
[ ] That's not what happened, this is a story about a businesswoman who finds her rival has used black magic on her to change her into a femboy husband for her rival, because she's sick of the hostilities and wants to stop them and make their relationship work by being a loving breadwinning wife. There are no "mental compulsions" or anything, it's just that he was forced to use male pronouns and take on a male name when in femboy form.
[ ] The story is fine if you have a fetish for femboys. You seem pretty invested in the subject.
[ ] I do have a fetish for femboys, but this story seems to be more about their relationship than the fact that his rival changed him into one of them as an ultimate act of hostility. It would make a good start to a novel, but not a good story on its own.
