Dear Neil,

thanks a lot. I am available for the next 2 weeks after that we'll be going on holiday (I'm sure you can relate to that!) and then in November as well. However if there is an issue with that, let me know!

I've sent over some dates of availability for you. Please get back to me with your preferred one(s) from this weekend onwards.

Walid

I'm sorry Neil.  It will be my first time at the conference. I would like to spend it with my friends and family, as we haven't had a chance yet this year.  I hope you understand.  Can we have another time?  We are busy in June also but I can try July or August

I'll send you some of our dates in the coming week, once they come out on my calendar.  Have a good one!

I've corrected the sentence.
I hope you can accept it, sir!
