- This is an example of how I'd go about it.  This is not the only way but it would be my starting point.  You can always use the results as a base line and try different techniques until you get what you want.  Just remember that the equation is a starting point, nothing more.  The actual compression process will be affected by so many variables that this one equation is just not going to work in every application.
- The only thing I really see you can do is find an acceptable amount of superheat and then use your calculated superheating on the compressor head at that point and add the 10% (this is a rule of thumb).
- Since the actual superheating is so variable, my preference would be to go ahead and look for a starting point where you will get a good enough amount of superheat.
- As I've said before there is no way to tell from your question if this application is an automotive or industrial type of thing, but these calculations are normally done on a large scale and not in small refrigeration units like home AC/refrigerator compressors.  I say this because you need to take into consideration all the factors that affect the superheating (temperature, pressure, flow rate, heat transfer, etc).
- If your application is industrial then you may also need to look at how much and where you are using it.  If you only need to make ice for a small refrigerator unit in your kitchen then you can probably use the superheating as calculated.  But if you were to take that same unit and put it in a commercial sized walk-in freezer or cooler then you will definitely need to add more superheat since the heat transfer rate is higher in those cases.

The only way to increase the power is to install a larger turbine. I suggest you find out what size your current turbines are and then search for a larger set, however it will cost quite a bit of money.

A simpler solution would be to change the fuel mixture on your engine, this has been done in the past by using more oil than required.

The influence of inlet air temperature is directly proportional to the output power. This is a common characteristic for all turbomachinery and can be explained by energy conservation as follows;

For an ideal gas, the specific heat, $C_p$, is given by : $C_p = \frac{k}{T}$, where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649 × 10−23 J/K and T is temperature in Kelvins. This equation can be used to convert the heat input into power output from a turbine as:

$$P_{out} = \frac{C_p}{k}\int_\text{inlet}^\text{turbine} dT = 1.415 \times 10^6 \; W $$

We can also use the enthalpy, $H$, which is a function of temperature and pressure: $h(P,T) = C_p\cdot T$. This gives us : $P_{out} = \frac{d H}{dt}$. If we define the change in temperature as $\Delta T$ we get:

$$P_{out} = \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta t}$$

Now the change in enthalpy, $\Delta H$, is given by $\Delta H = h_\text{inlet} - h_\text{exit}$. For this case we can take $h_\text{exit}$ to be $2.0$ MPa and $h_\text{inlet}$ to be $1.5$ MPa, as given in the data sheet.

$\Delta H = 0.5 \; \mathrm{MPa} \cdot (2 - 1) = 0.3867 \; \mathrm{J/kg}$

Using the ideal gas law: $\Delta P = nRT \implies RT = PV $ we can calculate the change in internal energy for a given mass flow rate, as shown below.

$$Q_\text{out} = \frac{\rho V_\text{inlet}}{\mathrm{R}} \; \Delta T = 10^{-3}\; \mathrm{kg/s}\cdot (785\; \mathrm{kg/mol})\cdot (\frac{300\; K}{\mathrm{Celsius}}) = 2.43 \cdot 10^6 \; \mathrm{J/s}$$

Combining all of these, we can find the change in enthalpy per second to be:
$$\Delta H_\text{out} = 2.43 \times 10^6\; J/s \cdot (0.5\; \mathrm{MPa}) = 1.217\; MJ/s$$.

Combining the two, we have:
$$\Delta H_\text{out} = P_{out}\; dt = \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta t}$$
$$\implies P_{out} = \frac{\Delta H_\text{out}}{\Delta t}$$, where $\Delta t$ is given in seconds by :
$$\Delta t = \frac{1\; s}{P_{out}} = 0.435 \; \mathrm{s}$$

The power output at an average of 2.7 MPa and an average temperature of $T_\text{avg} = (358 + 692) / 2 = 543 K$ is given by : $$P_{out} = \frac{\Delta H}{t_\mathrm{average}}$$

For the current values, this results in a power output of $1.07 \; \mathrm{MW}$.
