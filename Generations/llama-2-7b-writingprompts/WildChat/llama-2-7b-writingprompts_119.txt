[there would be dialogue in this story, which would include a flashback of Indigo giving birth to Nilou:]
(It was almost the day of the Sabzeruz Festival in Sumeru - the domain of Lesser Lord Kusanali, the Dendro archon and goddess of wisdom. It was also the first time that Nilou had used Hydro since becoming pregnant with Indigo. However, it was discovered that her belly button was ripping open as she gave birth to Indigo, as if Indigo's birth was premature. Eventually, a team of four experienced Dendro users - Kaveh, Collei, Tighnari, and Alhaitham - were sent to investigate the entire domain of Sumeru. But when they went to investigate the theater, they came across Indigo's newborn daughter - Nilou - on the stage. However, Indigo was crying - as if Indigo had given birth to Nilou prematurely while practicing for the upcoming festival.)
