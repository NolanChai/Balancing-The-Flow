In my story, I want to show how Alyx and Gordon meet for the first time in Half-Life, which is also one of my favorite levels in the game. Alyx is on a date with another man and she's starting to get nervous that her date doesn't know anything about her (he has no idea whatsoever who Dr. Eli Vance or Freeman are). It turns out this isn't just random; as I'll explain later, Gordon's actions will directly affect the relationship between Alyx and her father.
Alyx is getting nervous that her date doesn't know anything about her. She remembers how she met Eli Vance at a coffee shop (he had been studying up on his daughter) and how he was always there for her when she needed help with school or science projects. However, this man has never once brought up these things! The only thing they have in common is their shared love of comic books. He doesn't know that she grew up on a farm in Nebraska or anything about her life before the Combine invasion (well except for that one time he asked if she had ever lived on Mars).
In the meantime, Gordon Freeman is trapped inside Black Mesa with no way out and no way to communicate with anyone outside. The Combine have taken over all communication systems and there are only rumors about what happened at the facility after his escape. Gordon knows he needs help but can't find anybody who will listen or believe him (or even understand why they should care). His first instinct is to try calling for Alyx, but she's probably on a date with that guy and doesn't know where he is right now anyway!
At one point during this period of waiting around trying not to die from radiation poisoning or getting shot by security cameras while being chased by some sort of alien monster thing that keeps jumping at him every time it sees him--but really, I'm not going into detail here because who cares? It doesn't matter anyway! All that matters is that when all hope seemed lost, someone finally answered Gordon's call for help: Dr. Eli Vance himself!! But how could this be possible??

In my story, I want to show how Alyx and Gordon meet for the first time in Half-Life, which is also one of my favorite levels in the game. It turns out that she has been waiting on him outside since she saw his photo (which is a little creepy). She knows all about him because of their shared love of comic books--and even though he doesn't know anything about her or what she did before coming to Black Mesa, they still manage to get along really well!

The Combine have taken over all communication systems and there are only rumors about what happened at the facility after his escape. However, one day Alyx finds an old message on her answering machine from Eli Vance saying that he was worried because Gordon hadn't called him back yet! She calls up her father right away--but he doesn't know who this man is either...until she tells him about how they met at Black Mesa, where Eli had been studying up on his daughter before she got there. The two begin talking through a door (since no one can get near Gordon) and eventually Eli decides that they should come visit so he can meet this guy who saved his daughter's life!
