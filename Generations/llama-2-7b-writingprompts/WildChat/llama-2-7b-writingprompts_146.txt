```
This is a python program.
It is also called a script because when executed, the script does something for you (it runs).
In this case, this Python Script writes the text "Hello World" to the console.
That is it's purpose; however, other Python scripts can be used to perform much more difficult tasks. 
Python has been written with simplicity in mind and thus, is easy to learn even by beginners.
It is also an open source language, which means that many people have contributed their time and effort to the development of it.
