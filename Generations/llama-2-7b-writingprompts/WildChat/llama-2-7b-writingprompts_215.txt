The story is as follows. You have to wait until the end of this page to see what actually happens (it's worth it I promise)

You enter the stadium and see a group of cheerleaders practicing on the side, but you notice one standing out from the rest, she was doing some fancy kicks whilst singing and twirling her batons. It made you wonder if this girl was even going to be any competition. You're confident in your ability to beat anyone with ease and so it didn't bother you that much when you saw her practicing by herself. But when the end of practice came, she called out for you.

> [2] No thanks. I'm not interested in what you have to say.

### End

The battle begins. You grab a drink from the bar on your way out of the dressing room and notice that the girl seems to be looking at you with envy... You wonder what she could want with you, but as soon as you turn around she is gone (you knew it was a trap!) You enter the stadium and see a group of cheerleaders practicing on the side, but you notice one standing out from the rest. She's doing some fancy kicks whilst singing and twirling her batons. It made you wonder if this girl was even going to be any competition. You're confident in your ability to beat anyone with ease and so it didn't bother you that much when you saw her practicing by herself. But when the end of practice came she called out for you.
