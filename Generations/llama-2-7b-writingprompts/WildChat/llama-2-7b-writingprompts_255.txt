The tourist information website below lists a few routes you could take. The most popular is called the **Ring of Kerry** which starts and finishes in Kenmare on the Ring Road (N71) which also takes in Killarney town at its eastern end. 
[https://www.visitkerry.ie/drive-the-ring-of-kerry.html](https://www.visitkerry.ie/drive-the-ring-of-kerry.html). You could also consider the **Ring of Beara** or **Wild Atlantic Way** routes, but these would take longer than the Ring of Kerry.

### Recommendation:

This is one of those trips that you can easily spend a week on and see everything you need to in each place you visit. There's so much to do in Killarney town it could even be a destination on its own, but I would recommend taking the full day to drive around the **Ring of Kerry** route as described above.

The tour started in the town of Kenmare where we stopped off for a quick bite to eat and some coffee before travelling on to visit Skellig Ring. On route there we passed by many sights that would be good for our second day including the Torc Waterfall, Gap of Dunloe (Gorge), Ross Castle, and Muckross House. 
The first place we visited was the Skellig Ring, a stretch of coastline in the Iveragh Peninsula between Portmagee and Valentia Island. The route itself is called Skellig Ring because it leads around the west side of the Skellig Islands, which are uninhabited islands off the coast. We saw the Skellig Ring from the comfort of our car as we drove to and from Portmagee where we would be crossing over to Valentia Island on a ferry to visit Skellig Michael. The view was beautiful with the rocks and cliffs along the route, especially with the sun reflecting off of the water and glistening on the islands. It was so tranquil that you could feel yourself drifting into the beauty of it all as we passed by. 
Once we were done at Skellig Michael and Portmagee, we began our way back to Kenmare where we would spend the night. We drove through many places that would have been great to stop off in for a second day including Muckross House, Torc Waterfall, Ross Castle, Sneem Village, Gap of Dunloe (Gorge), and Killarney Brewing Company for an Irish pint. We also stopped in for a quick bite to eat at O'Donoghue's Bar and Restaurant on the way back.

The following is a summary of my responses to your queries. *Driving around the Ring of Kerry counter-clockwise (as suggested), should be done in one full day. *If you have a car hire arranged for the duration of your visit, then you will probably find that it has more than enough space to fit everything in, including all members of your party and their luggage. You might like to think about using a larger vehicle which could take the pressure off the roads to an extent. *I would suggest you book into Muckross House for the night if this is a possibility. However, as you will be close by, it's also possible that you could stay in Kenmare and drive down to Muckross every day if necessary. *If you plan on visiting the Skellig Islands (which I strongly recommend), then make sure that you book onto one of the daily tour boats well ahead of your departure date. A boat trip is required to access them, but there's a 15 minute walk up to the Monastery and back down again at the end which can be quite challenging if you have mobility issues. It would definitely pay to do this in advance. *If you are looking for other interesting places to visit on your way around the Ring of Kerry, then I would recommend a couple of things: *Ross Castle (near Kenmare) *Killorglin (visit the Puck Fair - Ireland's oldest fair and see if you can spot any 'púcas') *Dingle Peninsula *Waterville *Valentia Island *Gap of Dunloe *Cahersiveen (see the stone fort at Cromwell's Bridge) *Portmagee *Torc Waterfall in Killarney National Park (although it is a popular attraction, you should have no problem getting there and parking nearby) *Muckross Abbey and Traditional Farms (all within walking distance of Muckross House - so you could spend the whole day here if desired) *The Torc Mountain Walk which takes in some stunning views over the valley. *Glencar Lough I hope that these suggestions are helpful for your planning purposes. If there is anything further that I can do to assist with your plans, please feel free to reply back or contact me again anytime. Kind Regards, Cormac
