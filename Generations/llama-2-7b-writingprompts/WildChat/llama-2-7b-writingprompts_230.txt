I get that same error. It seems to work fine on my end if you do the following:
* Delete the file i18n/en.php and replace with the one below
* Download and upload the translation files from http://www.php-i18n.org/translations.html (there is an example of this in your project)
* Edit the index.php file to load the translated file like so:
```php
// i18n/en.php file from translations site
$lang = 'en';
// get all translation files with the same language code
foreach (glob(__DIR__ .'/i18n/*.php') as $file) {
    require_once($file);
}
```
