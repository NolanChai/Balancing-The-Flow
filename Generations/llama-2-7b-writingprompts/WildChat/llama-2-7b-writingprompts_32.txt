Inspired by a conversation I had on 4chan, I came up with this mission. In it you play as Frank Tenpenny, who is being chased down the street by a mobster named Floyd Hebert, and his bodyguards, who want to kill him for some reason. You must fight your way through the streets of Los Santos to make it to your safe house in time. Along the way you meet several characters like Officer Frank Pulaski, Officer Dave Norton and even Tommy Vercetti (from Vice City)
