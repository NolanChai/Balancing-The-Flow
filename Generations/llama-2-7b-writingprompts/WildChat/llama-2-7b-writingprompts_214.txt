The mass of H2O formed is not given but if it was given, it would be equal to 1 molecule of water. Since 1 molecule of water weighs in at 18 g/mol (notice that the mass of oxygen and hydrogen are also 16 grams each), then you can calculate that for every one gram of oxygen there is 2 moles of water formed and similarly, for every gram of hydrogen there is also 2 moles of water formed. That means that a total of 48 g/mol of H2O will be produced.
