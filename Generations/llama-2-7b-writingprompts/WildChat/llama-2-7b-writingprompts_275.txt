On 27 January, 1950, Queen Renata received her first visitors since being wounded in Operation Unity on 6 January. The Belpaesan Worker Party’s leaders were invited to a private meeting with the queen at Royal Palace. Upon entering the palace, the group was led up a winding staircase and down a long corridor before reaching Queen Renata’s chambers. After being introduced by her personal attendant, Renata stood from her wheelchair to shake hands with each member of the party as they entered the room. She smiled graciously at each, their smiles returned. They then sat down in a semi-circle around the queen and spoke to her about her condition, and the political situation within Belpaesa following Operation Unity and its aftermath. The queen listened intently, offering praise for their work in fighting the pro-Western regime and their commitment to social justice. “My friends,” she said once they’d finished speaking, “the Belpaesan government has pledged to take steps towards ensuring all citizens are treated fairly and with respect. We will continue working towards this goal, and I hope you will join us in this effort. As your queen, it is my duty to lead this country into a brighter future for everyone who calls it home.” The group was visibly moved by Renata’s words; they rose from their seats one-by-one, each offering a respectful bow before departing the palace and returning home with renewed enthusiasm for what lay ahead.
