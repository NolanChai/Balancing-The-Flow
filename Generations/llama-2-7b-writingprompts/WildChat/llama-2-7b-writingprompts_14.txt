The way you have explained it is very unclear. You should provide a detailed description of what it is you would like to do. For example, how many rows are there in your data? Do they all need to be updated at once or individually? Do you need to select multiple cells/rows for the query? Do you want the data copied from Excel into another location such as SQL Server? Do you have VBA enabled?
