### Prompt: [ WP ] `` There are two sides of a coin, one that's in the air , and another that is yet to be dropped '' - Write a story of how the coin flips its fate
### Story: The room was quiet. The only sound was the faint ticking of the clock on the wall. As I sat there, staring at the coin spinning in my hand, I could not help but feel a sense of anticipation building up within me. It had been years since I had last flipped this coin; a symbol of my past life and all the mistakes that had led to it. As the moment drew nearer and the coin began to drop, I could feel my heart racing with excitement. Was this finally going to be the day where everything changed? Or was it just another false hope? The moment came as swiftly as a raging storm; with one flick of my wrist, the coin flew through the air and landed on its side. `` Damn it!'' I yelled out in frustration. But then something strange happened. As I looked down at the coin, it seemed to be glowing with a faint green light. `` What is going on?'' I thought to myself, as I reached for the coin. Suddenly, an image appeared before my eyes. It was me, from years ago; holding this very same coin and flipping it through the air. But there was something different about it - a faint glow emanating from within. `` What is that?'' I asked out loud, as I continued to stare at the image. Suddenly, the room seemed to come into focus; the clock on the wall chimed as the sun began to rise outside. It was morning once again. As I looked down at my hand, I could see the glow had faded from the coin - but it was still there. A faint green light, hiding within. `` What does it mean?'' I wondered. Then, the answer came to me in an instant - a memory from years ago, when I had first found this very same coin and its hidden power. `` There are two sides of every story, one that is yet to be told...'' But for now, at least there was hope.
