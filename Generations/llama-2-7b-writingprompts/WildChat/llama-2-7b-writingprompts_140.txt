The answer is (3). The meaning of $r$ in $\int _ {R_ {2} } \! f(x) \, dy$ is that if you take a polar rectangle with the same area as the square $R_ {2}$, then $\int_{R_ {2}} \! f(x)\, dx = r \int_{R_ {2} } \! f( x ) \, dy$.

The best explanation I have for this question was the one provided by the teacher. If $f$ is a bounded continuous function, then we know that there exist some $\delta>0$, such that $|f(x)|<\epsilon$ whenever $|x|< \delta$. From here it follows that $f$ is differentiable at $x=0$ and we obtain $f'(x)=lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}=1$.

Comment: You're assuming f is continuous, which was not specified.

Answer: It is actually always defined, regardless of boundedness. Let $\epsilon>0$ be given and let $y\in R^2$. Then there exists an open ball around $y$ with radius smaller than the diameter of your $R^2$, so the length of it's boundary is smaller than the diameter as well (the boundary is a closed line). So we have
$$|f'(0)|\leq |f(x+h)-f(x)| \leq \frac{|h|}{r}\cdot\max_{z\in R^2}|f(z)|<2\epsilon,$$
so the limit exists. Now let's say $f$ is not continuous at zero. Then there are two open balls around 0 with diameters smaller than $\delta$. The one which contains the point where f has a discontinuity will have an infinite length and therefore no limit can be taken on it, so the other must contain the point, as well. This contradicts the above statement.

Answer: Let's assume that $f$ is continuous at zero. Then there are two open balls centered at 0 with radii less than $\delta$. If you take their union and subtract a little bit from the diameter of the bigger one so that it does not contain any point in the other, then the smaller ball still contains every point where $f$ has discontinuity. So there is no limit (because each sub-ball will have infinite length). But we assumed that there was a limit, so this is absurd and hence $f$ can't be continuous at 0.

Answer: Let us consider the function $g(x)=|f(x)|$. It is bounded from below by $|f(\mathbf{1})|$ since it is continuous on $\Bbb R^2$, non-decreasing in both coordinates, and hence equal to $|f(\mathbf{1})|$ at most. (The set of such $x$ can be chosen as the diagonal.) Moreover it is bounded from above by a constant which depends only on $f$. This implies that $g$ is continuous. So $\sqrt g'$ is well-defined.

Comment: Your answer assumes that $f$ is continuous, but it doesn't matter since OP already proved that if $f$ is bounded then $\sqrt{f}$ is differentiable at zero.

The answer is (a).

Answer Choice (b) is not correct because the three dimensions are represented by three coordinate axes and a volume in 4D means 6 coordinate axes, while in a triple integral only 3 coordinates are needed.

Answer Choice (c) is not correct since all of the answer choices are true for different types of integrals, namely double and quadruple integrals.

(b)... we will have 3 subregions that we need to integrate. The first two regions are the same, and thus they can be combined into one integral. The third region is where x<=z<=y<=1, which is just a subset of x<=z<=1. Thus, (b) is the correct choice

If you're looking for a hint, it's the first one that's probably wrong since it will be out of proportion to all three coordinates being equal. The second one is pretty easy to figure out though - each coordinate is equal, so you just have to solve the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3=1$.

The third one looks like a really bad answer though...

Comment: I'm looking for an explanation that would include why it can only be one of the 3 options.  For example, you say "you just have to solve the equation $x^3+y^3+z^3=1$" but my guess is there are some additional constraints to make this solution possible?

Comment: If you consider that the sum of all the three coordinates has to be equal to 1, then yes. If not, it can't possibly be a solution since one of the coordinates would have to go outside the [0,1] range (and you can't have the sum being higher than 1 either).

Comment: Thank you, that is what I needed!
