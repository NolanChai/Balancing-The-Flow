We start off with a quick review of what we're going to do, and some background on the concept.  Quantum computers work by manipulating qubits.  A single qubit can hold one bit of information, but a qubit can also hold two bits of information at once -- which is how it "surprises" people (you'll see that I'm trying to avoid technical jargon like quantum superposition and entanglement).
