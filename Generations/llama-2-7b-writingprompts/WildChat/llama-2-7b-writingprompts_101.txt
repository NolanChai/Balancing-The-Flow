Amatsumagatsuchi: “I never expected my descendants to be born in such strange clothing…”
Ayumi: “Thank you Amatsumagatsuchi-kun for helping me. I’m sorry that the pain got the best of me - I thought this was gonna happen.” 
Cupa: “I see…so what exactly are we? Where did we come from?” 
Andr: “We were born on the Minecraft world! The human race!” Blazette: “Yes, that’s right. We humans have been living in this universe for over ten years. But now there seems to be some kind of disturbance…” Vanessa: “Oh yeah - we are Monsters. And we are here to defeat these Endermen.” Amatsumagatsuchi: “Okay, that’s enough with the introduction!”

[  ] Amatsumagatsuchi (The Dragon of Lightning), is a dragon that takes on many different forms during the course of his life. He can be found in the high mountain peaks, and is most often seen at night. Amatsumagatsuchi was once a giant snake-like being but eventually transformed into an enormous storm cloud that moved as it pleased. He had power over lightning, wind, rain, hail, snow, heat, sunlight, thunder, and fire. His body could be found at the center of all these forces in his realm. The people who lived in his territory were a hardy breed with short life spans but lived in harmony with nature. When they died their spirit would be reborn into another creature depending on where it ended up. When he was still a serpent, Amatsumagatsuchi had the ability to speak and could understand humans as well. The only way to kill him was by destroying his realm. Once that was done he would lose all of his power and transform back into a giant serpent. 

[  ] Ayumi (Mother), is an ordinary mother-to-be who has been pregnant for the past few months. She’s been waiting patiently in the mountains for her child to be born. There are storms happening in the area but she’s never worried about it because it always seems to calm down after a little while. She’s been seeing strange things lately, like how the trees have been changing colors and growing differently than usual. And then there were those two big snakes who kept following her around wherever she went. The only thing keeping Ayumi sane right now is knowing that her child will soon be born into this world as a dragon of lightning. 

[  ] Cupa (Mother), has always had a soft spot for animals and nature. She grew up in the forest with her mother, who taught her how to survive off of what she could find or grow herself. When Cupa was young she would spend most days playing around with animals like squirrels, deer, raccoons, and foxes - even dragons sometimes! As an adult she had gone back into the forest but this time not for adventure; instead she went there to study how other creatures lived their lives so that one day she could help others learn as well. This knowledge would prove very useful when Cupa found herself surrounded by strange creatures called Amatsumagatsuchi who seemed to be able to communicate with her through words, emotions and even touch! The more time went on the closer they became until finally Cupa decided it was time to ask them why they were here in the first place. 

[  ] Narwa (Sun), is a giant dragon who lives at the top of Mount Fuji with her mate Ibushi, and their child Amatsumagatsuchi (Dragon of Lightning). They have been living there for hundreds of years and are said to be descendants of the original Amatsumagatsuchi. They protect Mount Fuji from intruders and keep an eye out for any humans who might try to climb it without permission. Narwa has an egg inside her body which will hatch at some point in time, but right now she's waiting patiently until then. 

[  ] Ibushi (Sun), is a giant dragon who lives at the top of Mount Fuji with his mate Narwa and their child Amatsumagatsuchi (Dragon of Lightning). They have been living there for hundreds of years and are said to be descendants of the original Amatsumagatsuchi. Ibushi has an egg inside him which will hatch at some point in time, but right now he's waiting patiently until then. 

[  ] Shimizu (Storm), is a giant dragon who lives at the top of Mount Fuji with his mate Narwa and their child Amatsumagatsuchi (Dragon of Lightning). They have been living there for hundreds of years and are said to be descendants of the original Amatsumagatsuchi. Shimizu has an egg inside him which will hatch at some point in time, but right now he's waiting patiently until then. 

[  ] Jiro (Fog), is a giant dragon who lives at the top of Mount Fuji with his mate Narwa and their child Amatsumagatsuchi (Dragon of Lightning). They have been living there for hundreds of years and are said to be descendants of the original Amatsumagatsuchi. Jiro has an egg inside him which will hatch at some point in time, but right now he's waiting patiently until then.

I’m sorry that I didn’t get back to this, but I just moved into a new place in New York and it took me some time to adjust. Anyway, as much as I enjoy writing about these characters and their problems (which is why I joined the writing team), I do not think it's appropriate for me to write any more stories for this particular storyline.
I like how you developed the plot and it definitely had a lot of potential! If anyone else would like to take over, please feel free to do so - or contact me if you have any questions about taking over. I’m not going to ask for a certain amount of time before the next post is submitted because I know that life gets in the way sometimes and that's completely understandable!
Thank you again for all your work on this storyline, I hope whoever takes it over has fun with it :).

Vanessa: Hey Mindy, what are you doing here?
Mindy: Oh hey Vanessa! I just came to tell you that a blood moon will be rising in two months... which is only half a blood moon. Do you want me to get the full moon ritual?
```

#### The half blood moon rises - its red light eerily signaling its presence. Unfortunately, its not enough to trigger Vanessa’s labor. They’ve tried everything - a hot bath, freezing cold temperatures, chili peppers, a blood moon, nothing seems to work. Vanessa just wouldn’t go into labor. And since Arachnus was nowhere to be seen, another fun time in bed wasn’t an option. The next day, Mindy and Vanessa go out on a sibling adventure - that’s when they come across Arachnus fighting Dragalisk (Mindy’s boyfriend). As Dragalisk unleashes a blast of xenoversal energy, Arachnus fires an acidic blast. The two blasts collide, and form a deafening explosion - thankfully, no ears were left damaged. And although the blast was loud, the only thing Vanessa received was pure shock - and, just like with the blood moon, Vanessa didn’t go into labor. Not even the shockwave could induce labor. But only 5 weeks later, Vanessa looks at her stomach and seems strangely happy - as if she’s comfortable with 20 human-spider hybrid scurrying around in her womb. And despite the sheer amount of time that went by, Vanessa’s children didn’t seem to run out of oxygen - as if they were letting in oxygen just by scurrying around in their mother’s womb.

Cupa: What’s this? (looks at Inscrane with confusion)
Inscrane: It’s a plant that can help with labor pains! We want to make sure Vanessa’s safe in labor. You remember how that one went, right? (to Cupa)
Cupa: Yes... Yes, I do.... (looks at Inscraine again with confusion, then looks at Vanessa)... Are we gonna try this out?
(Vanessa is clearly relieved and smiles at them both - but she’s still got that weird look of concern on her face)
