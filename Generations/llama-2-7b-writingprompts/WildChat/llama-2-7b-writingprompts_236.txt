This response is based on the principles of separation of powers and checks-and-balances. In addition to the principled argument that a legislature should not have any executive power, there were several other reasons for such separation. One was the “independence of will,” which meant that every member of the Political Advisory Council could only be persuaded but never forced into making decisions on important issues (Li, 2011). The second was to prevent the legislature from usurping the authority of the executive by taking advantage of its monopoly on power in order to manipulate and interfere with the judiciary. There were also other reasons for such separation of powers. For example, if the Political Advisory Council made a ruling on an issue that could only be interpreted after careful review of its merits and demerits, then it was unlikely to make any hasty decisions based on personal interests or prejudices in order to please powerful political masters. As long as the members were appointed by the emperor with unanimous vote from his councilors (the Council for Examining Constitutional Government), the Political Advisory Council would be able to provide objective advice and make impartial decisions that reflected the general will of the people without being influenced or manipulated by powerful individuals.
