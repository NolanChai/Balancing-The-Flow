Christian (Kickboxing-Boxing) is interested in Selina and Valentina, as well as being a firefighter with upper body strength and toughness. I think he should be boxing for his striking style and Jiujitsu for his grappling style. He would have a very difficult time defending himself on the ground unless he was using strikes to control the fight, but that would leave him open for kicks in the legs. Boxing is what I'd say is the easiest striking style as long as you know where your head is at and how to read your opponent. Christian should be able to defend himself with a couple of punches before they take him down and start working on his submission techniques, then once he has control, he can switch back to boxing in order to keep them on their backs (unless that's not possible) until help comes or the fight is over.

Tommy (Muay Thai-Wrestling) has a ton of speed and core strength which makes him an excellent kickboxer, but his legs aren't strong enough for long strikes so Muay Thai would be good for him in that he can throw punches while holding onto his opponents arms to keep them from using their strikes. As far as grappling is concerned he seems like a wrestler with a lot of speed, but he has trouble taking people down and getting them on the ground so he'd probably be better off in Judo (if it wasn't full contact) to learn how to use throws while learning submission techniques from judo.

Billy (Shuai Jiao-Karate) is very agile, but not strong at all which makes me think that karate might be the way to go for him as he can throw punches and kicks to defend himself but if his opponent grabs onto him then he's screwed. I have no idea what Shuai Jiao is though so it could just as easily work, but since this is a beginner class in martial arts I feel like karate would be the way to go.

Stacy (Brazilian Jiujitsu-Karate) has good leg strength and agility which makes me think that BJJ might be better suited for her, unless she wants to throw kicks then she's stuck with Karate for it's lack of focus on the legs.

Selina (Mixed Martial Arts-Grappling) has a ton of core strength and flexibility so I think grappling would be ideal for her, but if you wanted to she could also learn Judo or Sambo, as well as striking styles like Boxing and Muay Thai.

Valentina (Kickboxing-Karate) is more flexible than strong so Karate wouldn't work very well for her since it focuses a lot on striking from the legs. I think that she should learn Judo or Sambo instead, as well as Boxing and Muay Thai, but if you wanted to you could make her learning Kickboxing/Muay Thai a secondary style so that way she has more of an opportunity to learn how to throw kicks from the legs.
