I think your response is incorrect because you do not seem to have read my post carefully. My thesis has nothing to do with the etymology of Hermanubus and everything to do with his function. I suggest that this character represents a blending of Hermes and Anubis, which is also attested in some inscriptions in the Graeco-Egyptian tradition. This is why I specifically said it has "nothing to do with etymology." As for your references:
1) I was referring to the Greek etymologies for Hermanubus, not a name in Macedonia.
2) The inscription from Dion only attests to Hermes/Anubis, not Hermes-Anubis as I suggested. There is no "Hermanubius" on this monument. It says Hermes/Anubis. That is why the inscriptions in the Sarapeum of Carthage were cited for reference since they are both attesting to Hermes-Anubis.
3) I do not know what you mean by "The name is probably to be related" and this does not make sense.
4) As for the cult, my point was that it was attested in Macedonia after Egypt. If we are only going to consider evidence from Egypt then why bring up the inscription from Dion? If your thesis is that his cult did not exist outside of Egypt then there's no need to use this inscription.
5) I would like to point out that I specifically said the following: "The cult was attested in Macedonia after it was established in Egypt." This means that he existed as a character before he appeared in Dion, and therefore could have been introduced into Carthage by merchants from Egypt.
6) As for my post's relation to your response: I suggested that the cult of Hermanubis was attested outside of its home of Egypt in Macedonia after the 1st century AD when it appears in Dion. You specifically said that the cult was attested in Carthage during the 2nd century AD, which is my point. Your response does not address this issue.
