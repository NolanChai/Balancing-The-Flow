### **GROWTH FRAMEWORK**: Racecar’s Virality Engine
We will create the following components in our Growth Framework:
1. Viral Loop
2. Acquisition Plan
3. Activation Campaign
4. Retention Campaign
5. Revenue Plan (Optional)
6. Experimentation (Optional)

### **VIRALITY LOOP**: The heart of your growth machine, the virality loop is a closed feedback cycle that allows you to scale infinitely with minimal investment. Your Viral Loop will include these components:
* **1. Referral Mechanism** – This includes sharing/recommending/talking about your product or service (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, SMS).
* **2. Incentive Program** - If you’re trying to drive more referrals in your viral loop, adding an incentive is the most effective way to increase engagement. Think about how you can incentivize a new user and reward them for referring friends. (e.g., $10 Amazon Gift Card).
* **3. Internal Promotion** – This refers to internal sharing of your product or service within an organization, team, community, etc. (e.g., Slack, Teams)
* **4. User Engagement** - The more engaged a user is with the product or service, the greater the likelihood they'll share it with others. (e.g., social media posts)

### **ACQUISITION PLAN:** This should include these components:
1. Acquisition Strategy – Describe your acquisition strategy. How will you reach new customers? What channels do you plan to use and why? Will you run paid or organic campaigns? Why is this the best choice for your product/service? What is the target customer profile? (e.g., age, income, gender)

5. Competitive Landscape – What are the strengths and weaknesses of your competitors? What unique value propositions can you use to gain a competitive advantage in this industry?

First step is to define the audience that you're going after. From this you'll be able to see where your ads can be placed and what messages are best suited for them. It would seem like a great idea to start by targeting physicians, however as a first step it could be more effective to go after parents of children with ADHD. Parents will likely have more emotional attachment to the issue than doctors, but if we can get them to make an initial connection with the product then they're probably going to refer their physician.

### Recommendations:
- Targeting physicians as a first step may be effective, however it might also be more efficient to target parents initially in order to build greater brand recognition and awareness, which will lead to the eventual conversion of referrals for ADHD physicians.
