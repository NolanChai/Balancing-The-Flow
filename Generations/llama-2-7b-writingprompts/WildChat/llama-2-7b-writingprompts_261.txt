I thought it was interesting that I learned about Matthew Broderick having a child when I looked up the article on Wikipedia. Although he has been married for 28 years, his wife is not able to have children so they adopted two daughters. This is a good example of how sometimes people get pregnant by someone else and then leave their country because their partner does not want them in their life anymore. In this case the mother went back to Korea but had no contact with her daughter until she found out about Paige's existence through Matthew Broderick's wife, Sarah Jessica Parker, who was looking at a South Korean immigration website.
