[player]: "What? That can't beâ€¦"

(I noticed that she has four red eye-like spheres in her hair, so I assumed it was a Nexus Dragon. How could she have a Nexus Dragon baby? And what kind of Nexus is this? How does one give birth to a Nexus anyway? This must be some sort of joke.)

Mindy: (in pain) "Oh, thank GOG! Finally! I've been waiting to give birth for 30 months, but my son's not coming out!"

(As Mindy continued screaming in pain, she started crying tears of blood and began losing consciousness. She fell on the floor as her four eye-like spheres disappeared into her hair.)

[player]: "Dear God..."

Mindy: (in pain) "Oh, thank GOG! Finally! I've been waiting to give birth for 30 months, but my son's not coming out!"

(Mindy died due to lack of oxygen from the blood that she was crying. She started shaking as her body stiffens up. Just then, a small ball with four eye-like spheres appeared in Mindy's hair.)
