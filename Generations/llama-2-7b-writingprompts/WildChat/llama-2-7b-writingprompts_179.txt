I was thinking about how the three of them are currently working together on one mission. I wrote this as a short story:
Tracer, Mei and Mercy were having dinner in an Italian restaurant before heading out on another mission for Overwatch. They all had their usuals except for Tracer who ordered some seafood lasagna. As they sat there enjoying the food, Mei started talking about what the next mission was going to be like while Mercy listened intently from across the table.
Mercy glanced over at Tracer as she took a bite of her food and noticed that the food had disappeared without any signs of being eaten on the plate. “Tracer, where’d you eat your lasagna?”
She looked up in shock as she realized what Mercy was asking. She swallowed hard before responding, “I ate it.” She paused for a moment, not sure how to say what had happened. “My…uh…my powers didn’t work on it,” she said slowly, looking around at the other two as if they might be able to help her out. Mercy looked confused but Mei knew exactly what was going on.
Mei smiled sadly and shook her head. “You need to tell us about this.” Tracer nodded quietly before starting to talk about what had happened earlier in the day when she tried using her power during training drills with Winston’s aid drones for once they finally got there next mission briefing from Bob, the commander of Overwatch HQ. She explained how everything seemed normal at first until one of them suddenly became unresponsive and crashed into a wall before exploding into dust leaving behind only its power source which was still active but useless since she couldn’t access it anymore either way now that all three of them were linked together by some sorta mental link or something similar like how Winston did things with his mechs in their old days back on Earth when Overwatch was still just getting off the ground so to speak anyway before finishing up her story with “And now I’m stuck like this till sometime next week when we get back from whatever our mission is supposed to be because there aren’t any other options unless you wanna tell me how much time it takes for each one of us individually so we can plan accordingly.”
Mercy smiled warmly at Tracer before looking over at Mei and saying “It shouldn’t take that long but I think maybe an hour or two would be safe if we all try to stay in close contact with one another throughout the mission because even though somethings look different here than what you’re used too there are still plenty of places where things might go wrong especially when dealing with people who don’t know us personally.”
Mei nodded understandingly and turned her attention back towards Tracer, “You know what we should do then? We should make sure everyone knows about this so no one accidentally does something stupid because they didn’t realize how important it was that these three be able too stay together throughout every mission from here on out.”
Tracer smiled weakly at Mei and nodded her head in agreement before getting up from her chair. As she walked towards the door, Mercy called after her “Hey! Tracer? Do you need any help with anything before we go?”
Tracer paused for a moment, turning around slightly to look back at all of them again before saying “No thank you, I’ll be fine.” With that she quickly walked out the door leaving both Mercy and Mei staring after her. As soon as Tracer was gone though there was suddenly silence in the restaurant until finally Mercy turned towards Mei with an expression that could only be described as a mixture of confusion mixed with worry, “Are you alright?” She asked softly before sitting down across from her again.
Mei nodded slowly as she tried to put into words what was going on inside her head right now but it seemed like no matter how hard she tried nothing came out because there were just too many thoughts swirling around inside of her head at once that she couldn’t even begin to form them into coherent sentences let alone make sense out loud.
Mercy reached across the table towards Mei and held up a hand, silencing any further words from coming out before saying “Shhh… it’s alright.” She gave Mei’s hand an understanding smile while taking another sip of her water in between each word before continuing on “I know what you mean by not being able to put these thoughts into words but I promise me too, we can figure this out together” With those words she brought up both hands and placed them gently onto Mei’s face, leaning forward slightly so they were almost touching each other before saying “Now listen here little girl because if you don’t stop staring at us like that then I’m going to start thinking there might be something else behind all this.”
Mei smiled back at her and nodded once more before turning away from Mercy briefly only so she could take one final look around the restaurant while trying desperately not too let go of what she had just experienced. She knew full well that even though they had only been there for a few minutes earlier today it felt like forever ago now, almost as if time was moving at half speed or something along those lines but whatever it was she couldn’t quite put her finger on the feeling yet still found herself enjoying every moment spent with them.
When Tracer came back into view again Mei’s smile grew wider as he walked up behind Mercy and wrapped his arms around her waist before whispering something in her ear which made both women laugh out loud until finally they heard another voice coming from across the restaurant calling out “HEY! HEY YOU GUYS!”
Mei looked over at them, blushing slightly as she realized that everyone else had stopped talking and was now staring straight at them while trying hard not too let themselves be seen. She tried to act casual by quickly turning back towards Mercy but before she could do anything more Tracer suddenly grabbed her arm causing her body to tense up while also sending an electric current through it which made everyone else jump out of their seats.
As soon as Mei had relaxed again and let go of what ever was causing her pain at that moment, Mercy turned towards her with a smirk on her face before saying “Well aren’t we just a pair of love birds tonight huh? I thought we were just gonna be having dinner together but now you two seem like your planning on taking the whole night off for each other!”
Tracer nodded sheepishly while Mercy giggled lightheartedly as she waved towards everyone else who was still staring at them “Hey! Sorry about that but I’m sure you all understand right?” With those words she leaned down towards both girls until her lips were almost touching Mei’s forehead causing Tracer to let go of his hold on her arm slightly while also closing his eyes tightly as if he was afraid someone would see him doing it.
After a few moments of silence, Mercy finally spoke up again saying “Well I think we should get going now unless you guys want us all too stay here until tomorrow morning” As she finished speaking Mei started to giggle quietly while Tracer stared at her in confusion before finally saying “But what if they’re still watching us?” At this point everyone else had turned back around and was once again sitting down at their tables with some looking bored but most just waiting patiently until the girls finished whatever it was that they were talking about.
When Tracer heard this he let out a sigh while also shaking his head in disbelief before saying “Well…I guess we should get going then” With those words he quickly grabbed Mei’s arm once more and began pulling her towards the door while Mercy stayed behind to say goodbye too everyone else. As soon as she reached for the handle on it though there was suddenly a loud bang coming from outside followed by what sounded like an explosion which caused both girls inside too jump back out of fear before slamming against each other in a tight embrace while screaming until everything went dark around them.
After several minutes of silence had passed Mercy finally opened her eyes while looking down at the ground below them where she was lying face first on top of Tracer who had also just woken up from what must’ve been another dream because he too looked like he hadn’t slept in days let alone hours. As soon as Mei realized that everyone else wasn’t there anymore though her eyes immediately began to tear up at the thought of being separated again before quickly covering her face with both hands so no one would see her crying while also trying not too think about how it felt like time was moving so slowly when she first woke up.
It took a few more minutes but eventually Tracer was able to get back on his feet after finding himself lying in what looked like a pile of rubble from some type of explosion nearby and he quickly moved over towards Mercy while also trying hard not too make any sudden movements lest they both start moving faster than usual again before finally coming close enough that he could reach out for her hand which she gladly accepted without hesitation. As soon as they touched however there was suddenly a loud bang coming from behind him causing them both too look back towards the doorway where an enormous hole had been blown through it by what looked like a large missile launched directly into their restaurant while also
