No, I don't think so. A loving mother may still have Narcissistic traits but is likely to express these in different ways. For example, if a parent is highly self-absorbed and has difficulty putting their childâ€™s needs before their own they might use their children as scapegoats or use them as pawns. They may also be hypercritical of their children when it comes to achievements which they themselves could not achieve (e.g., sporting activities). A narcissistic parent will likely want their child to be the best at something in order that the narcissist can bask in reflected glory and use this as a source of attention, praise or supply. It is possible for narcissists to love their children but it is likely to be conditional upon the child meeting certain criteria such as being the perfect child (e.g., achievement-orientated) who provides ongoing supply of admiration.
