He was the laughing stock of Wizards Haven, and I can't say that it wasn't deserved. You see, this man had an affliction. No matter how hard he tried or what spell he cast, he could not directly cause something to happen. The best he could do was point his wand at someone else and make them do the thing for him. The worst part is that he didn't know he did anything wrong until it became obvious. He was always in a hurry to get somewhere or do something important, so he would cast a quick spell on himself to get there faster or perform some task better. Everyone else just assumed he was lazy and never got around to doing the things properly, but his condition prevented him from being lazy at all. The man was always busy because he couldn't take shortcuts in life.
When I found out that he could only point his wand at someone else and make them do something for him, it became obvious why he had never been very good with people. Whenever anyone asked him to help with a task, he would just point his wand at them instead of helping directly himself. Everyone would just laugh when they saw him walking around town with a wand pointed at someone else. I decided that we could make an honest man out of this guy if I got my hands on some enchanted items. So, one day I asked him to help me with some spell research in the castle library. He immediately started casting a quick spell and pointed his wand at me when he noticed that it was too difficult for him to cast spells properly. This was the first time that we had actually spoken to each other without being forced together by magic. I explained what I wanted him to do, but as always he just pointed his wand at my eyes and said, `` Do it yourself!''
I decided to take advantage of this situation by giving him enchanted items to make me look smart in front of the other wizards. The first thing that I gave him to make was an enchanted hat which would allow me to cast any spell from inside my head without ever saying a word or pointing my wand at anyone else. After that, he made me an enchanted cloak with pockets that could hold anything and anything in the pocket would be instantly transported anywhere I wanted it to go. Then he gave me an enchanted bag of holding that would allow me to carry everything inside without ever opening up or getting tired from all my hard work. Lastly, he made me a magic ring that was indestructible so no one could ever break into my house and steal any of these items again.
The other wizards at the university were very impressed with what I had done. They couldn't believe that this man had actually created all these things for me to use, but they didn't know about his condition. Once everyone saw how well he could do magic by pointing his wand at people instead of himself or anything else in front of him, they began to accept him as one of their own and treat him with respect. The man finally had a chance to prove himself before all those other wizards that were always making fun of him behind his back. This was the first time I ever saw someone use magic for good instead of evil! It made me feel really proud to be able to help this guy out by giving him some enchanted items so he could finally show everyone else what kind of magician he really is.
