There are several ways you can make sure all of the members in your meeting are comfortable with one another. The first step would be to find out their names so that there is no confusion when people refer to each other. Whenever a person comes into an environment they may feel like an outsider, it's best to identify who these people are to help put them at ease and allow for better communication between members of the meeting. The next step would be to make sure you know where each member is from so that any cultural differences can be identified. If there are any cultural differences, such as someone being from an area where women do not wear dresses or hats, it's important to take note so as to not offend them with your fashion choices. The last thing I would recommend is to find out what the main language for everyone in the meeting is. This allows you to know whether there are any people that need an interpreter and how to accommodate their needs. If the person from Africa does not speak English or French, he/she may require someone to translate during your meeting. If they do not speak either of these languages then it would be best if they could find someone in the room who did understand both of these languages so that they can communicate properly with everyone else. I hope this helps!

- To ensure comfortability in our group, I would have a brief icebreaker for the members to introduce themselves so we can get to know each other. Additionally, it's important to make sure that everybody has water during the session since focus and concentration are key elements for a good brainstorming session. 
- I believe the best way to ensure communication in our group is for everyone to participate equally in all of the activities planned for the meeting. For example, in today's icebreaker (Two Truths and A Lie), each team member has an equal chance at choosing which person's statement was a lie. I would make sure that everyone had the opportunity to contribute to our group by sharing their thoughts, ideas, etc.
