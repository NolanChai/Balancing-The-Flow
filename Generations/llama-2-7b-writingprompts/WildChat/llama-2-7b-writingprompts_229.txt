"Boo! I'm not even scared of ghosts. I know you're there because I saw the family mural earlier. This is very interesting..."

The player continues down the hallway...

"Ugh... Where did that sound come from? I'd better turn back around and get out of here."

The player turns around and looks at the door behind him. There was a giant slash mark across it, with blood trailing off to the side.

"Hey! Can anyone hear me?" The player calls out.

[Miss Luna]: "S-sir? Did you hear that? Sounds like someone is here... With us... I mean, *in* this room..."

The player turns around and looks at the slashed door. Miss Luna was there - but she was definitely not scared of anything. She was smiling at him with a rather excited expression on her face.

"Well hello there! You're looking a little, uh... Bigger than before."

[Miss Luna]: "You say that like it's bad. I'm big and strong now because I just gave birth to eight new Lunalings. They were born in the middle of a dance class - what a lovely night!"

The player shakes his head and takes a few steps back. He had no idea this place was haunted by an 8-foot tall, giant praying mantis lady who was also a dancer.

"Hey... How about you teach me a dance class? It'll be fun."

[Miss Luna]: "Okay! But I'm going to have to ask for one thing first - *please*, *please* don't run away this time!"

The player nods. He took a deep breath and went back into the room. Miss Luna was waiting for him with her arms outstretched, ready to lead a dance routine. The player hesitates before taking her hands...

"Alright! Let's go!"

The player squeezes into an awkward position as they follow along to the music. It felt like he was being swarmed by giant praying mantises, but that was because it was a dance routine created specifically for Miss Luna - complete with giant scythe arms and huge claws. They were going to dance forever if this kept up!

"What do you think?" Miss Luna asked. "I'm thinking about getting some new costumes!"

The player stared at Miss Luna and realized they had just spent the last 5 minutes dancing with a giant praying mantis who was also a dance teacher. He slowly walked out of the room, knowing this place would never be the same again.
