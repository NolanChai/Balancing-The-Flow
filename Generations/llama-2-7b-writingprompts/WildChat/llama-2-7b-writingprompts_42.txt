You should be fine for the 2013 production. You were only in one case (that you reported) so there shouldn't be a problem. Just keep your eye on the annual statement to make sure that it is not higher than normal, or if you have any questions at all.

Thank you for the update! I will work on it and let you know when its ready :)
