I had never heard a question so absurd before. I did not think this through and merely answered yes out of reflex. The teacher asked for my explanation and I was left speechless. I have tried to formulate the answer but nothing seems logical enough for an 8th grader.

### Testing:
Passed 100% of the time.

### Final grade:
Clean and nice code, good use of data. I don't know if there are other ways to do this but the approach taken by Snapchat is simple and effective. There were some problems with the code but it was mostly easy to debug as you fixed them along the way. Overall, very good job.

I'm not sure. I was raised Christian so that is my starting point but I have a lot of respect for other religions and believe they all contribute to the greater good in some way or another. I'd say if there were no real need to choose one over the other, I'd be a Christian.
