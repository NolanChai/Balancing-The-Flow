(As soon as I woke up from my nap, I started to feel something coming out. It felt like a massive pressure was building up inside me, and it felt like time was running out. Just then, Sayori walked into the clubroom looking like she was about to pop herself.)

Sayori: “Natsuki…you’re not going to believe this.”

(My heart raced at the mention of MC’s name. Even though I was Sayori’s surrogate, I started to worry as to what happened to the only male member of our club. And I realized what Sayori was so angry about - she was mad at MC, and was holding a picture of him and another girl. Just like me, the mysterious girl looked like she was about to pop - but her belly was so big it ripped a massive hole in the center of her shirt. But something didn’t add up - MC and the strange girl shared the same hair color and eye color, but the girl was significantly shorter.)

MC: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!”

Sayori: “I can’t even look at him right now. How could he betray me like this?”

(Just then, MC enters the room.)

MC: “Hey guys, what’s up?”

(Silence falls over the room as everyone stares at MC with varying degrees of anger and sadness.)

Sayori: “How could you, MC?”

MC: “What do you mean?”

Sayori: “I can’t believe you’ve been cheating on me with this girl! And she’s pregnant too!”

MC: “Wait, what? I’m not cheating on you, Sayori. That’s my cousin.”

(Sayori’s anger suddenly turns to confusion as she looks back at the picture.)

Sayori: “Your cousin?”

MC: “Yeah, she’s staying with me for a few months. She’s due any day now, and I’ve been helping her out.”

(Sayori’s face falls in embarrassment as she realizes her mistake.)

Sayori: “I-I’m so sorry, MC. I jumped to conclusions. I just saw the picture and…”

MC: “It’s alright, Sayori. I understand why you were upset.”

(Yuri and Monika both look relieved, and the tension in the room eases.)

Monika: “I’m glad that’s cleared up. Now, shall we get started on today’s activities?”

(Everyone nods, and we all move on from the misunderstanding. A few days later, we all visit MC’s cousin - Emily - at her place.)

MC: “Thank you so much for coming to visit me, everyone.”

Emily: “No problem, Emily. We just wanted to see how you and the baby are doing.”

Yuri: “It’s so nice to finally meet you, Emily. And congratulations on becoming a mother.”

Sayori: “I’m sorry again for jumping to the wrong conclusion about you, Emily. I didn’t mean to make things awkward.”

Emily: “Don’t worry about it, Sayori. I understand why you were upset. But I promise you, MC has been nothing but a supportive cousin to me throughout this whole pregnancy.”

Monika: “Well, now that everything’s cleared up, let’s celebrate the new addition to the family!”

(We all cheer and bring out a cake to celebrate Emily’s soon-to-be-born baby. It was a warm and joyous occasion, and we all felt grateful to have each other in our lives. But just moments before we were supposed to leave, Emily and I started to feel pain in our bellies - labor pains at that.)

Emily: “Oh no, it looks like it’s time. I’m about to give birth.”

MC: “And me too, I think. I wasn’t supposed to give birth for another week.”

(Yuri and Monika rush to help Emily, while I run to the nearest bathroom in a panic.)

Monika: “Don’t worry, Emily. We’ll get you to the hospital.”

Emily: “And we’ll do the same for Natsuki.”

(Without another word, both Emily and I were rushed into the car. But just before we could reach the hospital in time, my labor pains were getting stronger by the minute - and I knew I had to push in order for Sayori’s dream of motherhood to come true.)
