(As soon as I entered the clubroom, I saw everyone looking at me sadly. I didn’t know why they were all staring at me like that.)

Sayori: “What is it? Why are you looking at me so strangely?”

Monika: *sigh* “It’s nothing, just…we think that you should get a new personality.”

Kohana: “Yeah! MC was a really funny guy. And you didn’t do anything to cheer him up or make him laugh when he was sad or dying!”

Natsuki: *flicks Kohana* “Shut up, stupid. What about you? You were a horrible personality too.”

Yuri: “You were the one who was constantly bullying me! It’s your fault that I became a shut-in nowadays!”

Sayori: *taking a deep breath* “Okay, okay. Why did you guys bring this up? And what are you talking about?”

Monika: “Well…MC died and he was the only one who understood how to make us laugh. We thought that it would be great if you got a personality like MC so that we could have fun again.”

Kohana: *starts crying* “But…but MC’s gone now! Who will be able to help cheer us up?!”

Sayori: “Oh, I see. Well, I guess…I could try. But what exactly is a personality like MC?”

Monika: “He was super funny and he made all of our troubles disappear whenever we were sad or upset! He was also very caring and understanding as well!”

Natsuki: “Yeah, he was a great guy!”

Kohana: *starts crying again* “I miss MC so much…”

Sayori: *looking down* “You guys are right. I did do some bad things to you all.”

Himari: “What?!”

Kohana: *hugs Sayori* “No! You’re not a bad person, Sayori-chan! MC loved you too!”

Yuri: “You’re being stupid. You don’t have to listen to her.”

Monika: *sigh* “Guys…let’s just stop arguing and try to figure out what we can do here.”

Everyone: “Okay.”

Himari: “Sorry for being so mean to you, Sayori-chan. MC loved you a lot, and I guess he would want me to be nicer to you as well.”

Kohana: *hugs her* “You’re right! Let’s all try to be nice to each other!”

Natsuki: “Yeah, but we can only make MC’s wishes come true if we become a perfect personality. So…”

Monika: “I know what you mean. And I think that the best way for us to do this is by reading some books together.”

Sayori: “Okay, let’s go over there and start learning about how to be like MC!”

Everyone: “Yeah! Let’s read some books! Reading is fun!”

(After a few hours of studying and practicing various things that Monika had told us, the girls and I were finally able to cheer each other up.)
