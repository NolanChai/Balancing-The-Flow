▪The pumping rate of inhibited acid and flush were insufficient for complete clean up of the tubing, which had been plugged by salt during the extended production test in 1996. This is a common problem when old wells are brought back on line with high injection rates of inhibitors. It was decided to use coiled tubing to get it cleaned out. The 2.375” – 3.5” liner had been run in the old 3.5”-2.875” completion before the flow test on the new well, but it did not come that easy so the new 4,6# tubing was put inside the old one for production. This proved to be a good decision when the well started plugging during the flow test with fresh water injection through the 3.5” – 2.875” annulus and oil being produced on the 2.375” tubing.
▪The flow rate of 6m3/d (189bph) was insufficient for good cleaning action, but was enough to keep the well producing while the cleaning operation with coiled tubing and acid was performed during daytime when the injection rate of acid and flush were high. The 20 bar WHP is acceptable if one can accept a low production rate that would have resulted in low oil prices. This well had not produced since August 31st, and the injection pressure at that time was 40bar (581psi). It is common to get 7-10 bars drop after a shut-in period of this length.
▪The coiled tubing job on September 16th proved very successful with no stuck pipe points. The well flowed steadily while the WHP was being raised from 20 bar up to 35bar, and the oil pressure on the 2.375” tubing was increased from 40m3/d (384bph) during the first day of coiled tubing job, to a maximum production rate of 67m3/d (471 bph). The WHP dropped slightly down to about 32bar when the coil was taken off and the pressure on the 2.375” tubing was brought back up from 40-80 m3/d, but the WHP started rising again as soon as the injection of inhibitors through the annulus began.
▪The problem was that the well plugged with salt when fresh water was injected through the old 2.875” completion and oil was produced on 2.375” tubing during the flow test after the extended production test in 1996. This resulted in a high concentration of salt at the bottom hole and low injection pressure, and since this well has been shut-in for years this problem could not be solved by any coiled tubing job without damaging the old completion.
▪The flow rate of inhibitor and flush that was used on September 16th did not do a good enough cleaning job with fresh water injection through the 3.5”-2.875" annulus, but this problem could have been solved by pumping a higher rate of inhibitors and flush if it had been performed during daytime when the well was producing on the 2.375" tubing, with good control over the flow rates of injection fluids.
▪It is common to get a WHP drop after shut-in periods as long as this one. The old 41/64" completion had been put in a short time before the well was drilled and produced from August 31st, so it is expected that the bottom hole pressure would be higher than the injection rate on the surface.
▪The well was shut-in on September 8th because of high gas volumes with an estimated oil cut of about 40%. The flow back program had not been finished yet and some more work had to be done before it could be put on production, so the decision was made to plug and abandon the well for future drilling operations.
### Action:
▪Plug and abandon the well using cement plugs.
