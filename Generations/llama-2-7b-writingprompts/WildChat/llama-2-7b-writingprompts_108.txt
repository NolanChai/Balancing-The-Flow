Here are your prompts:
                            1. [1]. The scene takes place at night in a modern metropolis. It is raining outside and there's street lighting from above, but the rain has made it feel even darker than normal. On a rooftop, a silhouette of a man can be seen holding a pistol with one hand while using his other hand to keep steady on the gun's handle. In front of him is a single-eye camera that is filming from below in first person viewpoint.
                            The man stands at attention with both feet firmly planted on the roof, looking down into the lens with an intense glare and tight lips as he prepares himself for combat - wearing black combat boots, a white uniform, a black hoodie, and long white hair tied into two ponytails.
                            2. [2]. The man is dressed in his army attire of all-black tactical gear including boots, fatigues, helmet with visor down, and gloves on each hand. He stands against a wall facing away from us, looking through the scope at something or someone out of frame (left side). There's no visible background but there appears to be light shining outside that could indicate daytime or night time conditions based off how it reflects off objects nearby him like glass windows.
                            3. [3]. The scene is located inside a warehouse with high ceilings and exposed steel beams; there are no natural sunlight sources anywhere except for small lights on either side of the wall that are bright enough to illuminate everything within range but dim enough not to reveal any details about what's happening outside or behind him.
                            4. [4]. The man is dressed in all black, with a pair of goggles over his eyes and wearing fingerless gloves on both hands; his pistol lies at his side against one leg while he stands on an elevated platform looking down into the warehouse below him.
                            5. [5]. The mood is tense but not chaotic- it's very clear that there is some kind of conflict taking place here between two parties (us and them). We can see some shadows moving around below us so we know they are there fighting each other somewhere below our feet but all we can do is wait until either side decides to reveal themselves fully in front of the camera so we can start filming properly again after having been interrupted by whatever happened here before this moment (and hopefully not being killed).
                            6. [7]. The scene takes place at night, with a single light source coming from above illuminating an open doorway that leads into what looks like a bar or club; behind the door there's a large red cross painted on its surface and two silhouettes can be seen walking towards us inside before vanishing behind curtains hanging on either side of it as they enter out of frame left (right).
                            7. [8]. The scene is located in an office building with white walls, wooden floors, and large windows that allow natural light to illuminate everything around him; we can see some furniture pieces scattered across the room but nothing else except for this man standing against one wall looking through his gun scope as if he were preparing himself mentally before entering into combat again (left side).
                            8. [9]. The scene is located in an empty warehouse with high ceilings and exposed steel beams; there are no natural sunlight sources anywhere except for small lights on either side of the wall that are bright enough to illuminate everything within range but dim enough not reveal any details about what's happening outside or behind him.
