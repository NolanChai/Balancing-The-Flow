The following is dialogue from a scene from the animated series 'Jane', where Jane's older sister, Andrea, gets arrested. The scene starts in their home after her arrest. Her mother and father have come back from the police station with her daughter. They are in the living room; Andrea's mom (Elizabeth) is sitting on the couch and Andrea's dad (Mark) is standing next to her, holding his wife's hand while their daughter watches them. Elizabeth: Mark... Mark: What? Elizabeth: I don't think we should tell Jane what happened yet. We need to talk about it first. She'll be devastated. I know she loves Andrea very much and this will hurt her. Mark: Okay, but is there any chance that she will be released soon? Elizabeth: I'm not sure... they are charging her with a pretty serious crime. She may have to spend some time in prison for it. But we can talk about what will happen next when that time comes. It might be helpful for Jane and you both if we know the details of what happened before she gets released from jail. Mark: Okay... Elizabeth: I'm sorry, Andrea. This is so hard on us all but especially on your daughter and her father. We love you very much and will always support you no matter how long this takes to resolve itself. Mark: Yes, we're here for you... always. The scene ends with a close up of the daughter watching as her parents talk about her sister being in jail. She is very upset by this and looks at them with tears in her eyes as they look back at her.
