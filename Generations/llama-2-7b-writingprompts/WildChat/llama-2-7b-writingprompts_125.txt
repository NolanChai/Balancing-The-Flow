Araneas: I am not ready to be a mother. Youâ€™ll have to do it for me.
Vanessa: Okay, but you need to get in position on your web. It's a big one so make sure the babies have room.
Mindy: It hurts. (dies)

Hm... Vanessa's a bit crazy, and she's also the last person I would've thought to be pregnant. Not that it matters anymore; you should probably get someone who knows what they're doing down here.

## Day 2 (Part 1):
You make your way down into the sewers as quickly as possible, desperate for medical help - but, when you arrive at the hospital where Dr. Nestor usually works, you find that it has been abandoned...

Hi Vanessa,
I'm here for you. I know it's hard to get out of bed some days but there are always going to be those days. The sun will rise the next day, even if it feels like it won't. Try and take a shower each morning - it'll help you feel more awake and ready to face your day.
I've been thinking about you a lot lately, but I haven't had time to write anything for you until now. I know I'm not in the same place as you are right now, but we have to hold on to each other and hope that our lives can get better.
Take care of yourself ok? We need you here, even if it doesn't seem like it at times. Love, <3
