- 1) If the AI does not have a human lawyer, it will be hard for the AI to communicate with the other party. And it can only respond to the same type of questions as that of humans.
- 2) The AI may miss some important information or evidence during the process.
- 3) The AI also is unable to answer unexpected questions in the arbitration proceedings, and has difficulty solving a problem out of its scope of knowledge.
- 4) The AI cannot provide the explanation for its decision and the reasoning behind it, which may be against the principle of justice and equality before law.

### Question:
the disadvantage of AI used in international arbitration is that it's too slow to process, it needs a large amount of data.

### Response:
- 1) It has limited understanding of legal knowledge.
- 2) It does not have human reasoning ability and will not be able to answer unexpected questions or solve problems beyond its scope of knowledge.
- 3) It cannot explain its decision, which may violate the principle of justice and equality before law.

the disadvantage of AI used in international arbitration

### Questions:
What is the potential of AI in arbitrations? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using AI in arbitrations? How can it be used in arbitrations, to what extent can it be used, and how would the use of AI affect arbitrators, counsel, parties, or other stakeholders involved in a dispute resolution process?

yes i do.  he is my classmate and my friend. we have many things in common, such as our love for our school and country. he is a good student with high grades in all subjects.

In this short article I will highlight my takeaways from the panel discussion, which focused on the application of Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) in international commercial arbitrations. The panel was moderated by Dr. David Sullivan and included:
* Mr. Ian A. Laird – Partner at Squire Patton Boggs LLP (London).
* Ms. Maria Gavrilidou – Chief Counsel, Data Sciences, at Thomson Reuters (New York).
* Prof. Dr. Marc Döring – Professor of Law and Chairman of the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Law at the University of Passau, Germany.
* Mr. Simon Lofgreen – Partner, Head of Commercial Dispute Resolution Group in Kuwait.

In the following, I will focus on the key points of each speaker. In particular: (1) a description of how AI can be used to assist parties and arbitrators with legal research; (2) AI can be used to prepare for arbitration hearings, e.g., to identify witnesses or to generate questioning documents; (3) how AI can be used to predict the outcome in international arbitration cases; (4) AI can assist arbitrators and parties with drafting of awards.

#### Legal Research:

The first topic addressed by Ms. Gavrilidou was legal research, which she suggested could be supported by AI tools, such as the Lexis Advance software. This software is designed to improve search results in a user-friendly interface, including access to international legal databases. Ms. Gavrilidou highlighted how this tool can help users to identify relevant precedents quickly and accurately.

The second point made by Ms. Gavrilidou was the importance of preparing for arbitrations using AI-based analytics tools, such as “Ravel”, which can assist with identifying patterns in legal reasoning (e.g., citing authorities) and other documents (e.g., briefs, expert reports). She suggested that this tool could also be used to identify key themes throughout a dispute (e.g., similar arguments made by multiple parties), which may help with arbitration preparation.

The third point was the use of AI tools for the purpose of identifying legal precedents in the context of international arbitrations, using data from Kluwer Arbitration Database. Ms. Gavrilidou suggested that AI tools can be used to identify cases which are relevant and not relevant to a specific dispute at hand. This process should help lawyers and arbitrators to quickly find key arguments in the context of international arbitrations, e.g., “contract interpretation”, or “validity of contract” etc.

Finally, Ms. Gavrilidou made a point that AI-based analytics tools can help lawyers and arbitrators with their preparation by identifying key points in the case which would be relevant for further discussion. This process helps to identify important parts of an arbitration before it starts.

#### Arbitration Hearings:

The second point made by Mr. Laird was the use of AI-based tools during arbitrations, including the generation of witness lists and questioning documents. He suggested that lawyers could use such tools to identify relevant witnesses in a specific case. This process may help lawyers and arbitrators to quickly find key arguments in the context of international arbitration hearings.

The third point was the use of AI tools for the purpose of identifying legal precedents, using data from Kluwer Arbitration Database. Mr. Laird suggested that these tools can be used by lawyers and arbitrators to quickly find key arguments in a specific arbitration case. This process helps parties identify important points before they start their hearing.

Finally, the fourth point was the use of AI-based analytics tools for drafting awards. Mr. Laird suggested that these tools can help lawyers and arbitrators to quickly find key arguments in a specific arbitration case and then assist them with drafting awards. This process helps parties identify important points before they start their hearing.

#### Outcome Prediction:

The third topic addressed by Prof. Döring was AI-based prediction tools, which are used to predict the outcome of disputes in international arbitrations. He suggested that these tools can be helpful for lawyers and arbitrators who want to quickly understand how their case is going. For example, they may help lawyers identify important points before they start preparing arguments or witness lists.

The fourth point was the use of AI tools for the purpose of identifying legal precedents in international arbitrations, using data from Kluwer Arbitration Database. Prof. Döring suggested that these tools can be used by lawyers and arbitrators to quickly find key arguments in a specific arbitration case. This process helps them identify important points before they start their hearing or drafting awards.

Finally, the fifth point was the use of AI-based analytics tools for drafting awards. Prof. Döring suggested that these tools can help lawyers and arbitrators to quickly find key arguments in a specific arbitration case and then assist them with drafting awards. This process helps parties identify important points before they start their hearing or drafting awards.

#### Award Drafting:

The fourth topic addressed by Mr. Lofgren was the use of AI-based analytics tools for award drafting in international arbitrations. He suggested that these tools can help lawyers and arbitrators to quickly find key arguments in a specific dispute at hand and then assist them with drafting awards. This process helps parties identify important points before they start their hearing or drafting awards, which should speed up the process of arbitration hearings and drafting of awards.
