The Legend of the Jews (1909) is a book by Sir John Maundeville, it is a story about a man named Maundeville who went on an expedition in search of the Holy Grail. The man had spent over 4 years traveling through many countries and different cultures to discover the history and tales of these nations. While he was on his journey he came across some Jews that had been exiled from their homeland, he decided to stop off for a few days at their camp site where he learned more about them. He talks in length about how they were treated horribly by other cultures and eventually were forced to leave everything behind in search of new land to live in. After being chased out of most lands they ended up on a large piece of desert land where they were able to farm their own food supply while also trading with those who lived around them. The Jews would bring grains such as wheat or barley along with dried fruit which was used for making bread. They also made liquor from the wine that they had been forced to leave behind in their homeland and then sold it at a premium price since there were few places left where one could get good drinks like this anymore due to trade laws restricting imports/exports between countries during this time period (the 12th century). The story ends with Maundeville returning home after nearly five years abroad, he was very happy with all of the new information that he had learned about cultures around him and felt inspired by how hardworking these exiled Jews were even though they did not have much else but what they could carry on their backs!
