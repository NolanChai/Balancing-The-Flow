> A cup of coffee is filled with atoms and molecules, all moving around randomly. The cup is in a closed system, so there's no way for the atoms to leave the cup (unless someone opens it up). As time goes on, more and more random collisions occur between these atoms/molecules, causing some of them to collide so many times that they end up being completely destroyed. This is why we can't see anything solid in our everyday world, because there isn't enough energy left for us to observe it.

> Eventually, the cup will be filled with nothing but atoms and molecules flying around randomly with no way of forming into coherent structures like a cup. This is heat death: an infinite amount of time has passed since any of these random collisions caused anything solid or structured to occur at all! The universe would just continue expanding forever without any lifeforms being able to interact with each other again - which makes sense because why should it?

An infinitely large room of hydrogen would have the same density as our Universe. If it was a closed system (which our Universe is), then it would be at thermal equilibrium and you could use your analogy to describe the Big Bang. However, if we assume that our Universe has no boundaries then it would never reach thermal equilibrium because it's not in thermodynamic contact with anything else. The only thing that can happen is a random distribution of particles, which happens pretty quickly, but for all practical purposes there isn't any real difference between an infinitely large room of hydrogen and the Universe itself.

It's kind of like a lottery. It is easy to imagine the universe as a giant random lottery, where all things happen by chance.

The problem is, the way you have described your universe and how you have described the universe I have is vastly different from each other. As you said yourself, there is no actual order or time as such in our infinite universes, but there *is* an infinite number of us in the same universe. It would be very difficult to prove or disprove a theory without knowing the specifics of both our universes.

Comment: Your response is a logical fallacy called **equivocation**. This means you are talking about something that's not what I am describing. I'm pretty sure I have made it clear enough by now that time has no order or direction, there is no past and future, and nothing is causally connected to any other thing. The only connection between events in my universe is the fact that they all happen at once (at least, as far as we are aware). I'm not saying anything about your universe beyond what it would be like if you were able to observe one event simultaneously from multiple locations, which can be done.

Well, in this case there's a higher chance of finding a Boltzman Brain if you search for one. The universe has infinite space so it would be easier to find one since there are more things to search through and thus more possibilities that they exist. However, I think the existence of an infinite number of universes is much less likely than ours existing. So it's a toss up as to who wins this debate.

If it were a boltzmann brain then it would just be another boltzmann brain existing in some other part of the multiverse, there would not exist any one boltzmann universe (the existence or non-existence of said boltzmann universe is independent of whether or not you are a boltzmann brain).

Yes, one way of doing this is by using the [thermal bath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_bath) technique that you learned about in class last week. A more detailed description and how-to on building a thermal bath can be found [here](http://www.prairie.maths.ox.ac.uk/Publications/Fitzgerald2012/Fitzgerald_2012.pdf).

**You create a vacuum.**

**And then... nothing happens because the vacuum is not complete, and you have an unsteady state where pressure inside the container increases, but does not cause any change to happen because the pressure outside the can (in your case, your room) has no effect on what's going on in the can.**

**The vacuum is created when there are no particles inside a closed container. You create an instantaneous state of almost-vacuum by opening a sealed container of water and then letting it sit until air molecules escape. But you cannot ever get to absolute zero or true vacuum, because the laws of thermodynamics prohibit this.**

### Explanation:

I'm going to assume that this question is about a can of water being opened in outer space; if it is not then I'll have some other ideas below...

You cannot get true vacuum because there are always some particles (radiation, neutrinos, etc) passing through the walls. So when you open a can of water, water vapor starts to escape into the room. That pressure increase causes the air in the room to expand and cool as it tries to maintain equilibrium with what's happening inside the container; however, it cannot reach absolute zero because there is still a finite amount of water in the can (and eventually no air molecules). So when you close the can you'll find that there will be some pressure increase in your room.

The only way to really create vacuum would require an infinite amount of time, and not even the laws of physics allow for something like this. A better explanation might have been "what happens if you try to evacuate a can full of water using a pump?" but it's hard to tell what was meant in this question so I'm going with what was actually asked...
