You are going for too long with this bit; I stopped reading around word 100,000. You could save yourself a lot of time by doing one of three things: (a) make your writing shorter; (b) make it more concise; or (c) take out the whole part where you describe how they are both sitting down and begin to pee all over themselves simultaneously.

Thank you for your critique, which I will use in my revision. I appreciate the advice on description (which I think is the strongest part of this story), but I'm not sure that it makes sense to talk about the coiling poop or bulging leggings unless they're actually there. But thank you for pointing out the details, and I will make those revisions in my next draft.

The woman talked about how she met her friend through a mutual friend who had recently gotten married to the man (my grandfather) my great-grandmother is now with, but it was not at all a love marriage; she was already married and he was also married. The two women became friends over a shared interest in reading books and literature of many kinds as well as their mutual interest in politics and social issues that affected them at the time, such as the suffrage movement. They also took part in other activities together, like playing tennis on the weekends or going to dances or parties. The two were very close for about 50 years until my grandmother's friend passed away a few years ago and she has not been the same since.
