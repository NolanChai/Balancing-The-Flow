She went to the beach, she wore her dress, she sat on the sand, and the man came. She looked into his eyes, they were green. `` No thanks'', said he, `` I have a wife''. Then she got up, put on her shoes, and left. As she walked away, she saw him again and asked him what was wrong. He just laughed and winked at her. She turned back to the shore, and suddenly there was a wave! A big wave! The man shouted `` Duck!!'' and the girl's dress flew up and got wet!

Story about Strombilia and her friends, and a man with an old-fashioned camera.

### Story:
Strombilia was 25 years old now (her birthday's coming up) but she still acted like a child. She loved the beach - the sand and sun, the water and all the things you can do on the shore. The beach was where she felt most comfortable in life - more than her bedroom or workplace.
But this time of year was her favorite: she could hear the cries from the other girls when she first arrived to the beach because they saw Strombilia's beauty in a bikini and knew she'd get all their attention. They hated her - but it made no difference. She felt like a queen on the shore.
The sea was calm today, almost as if God himself had built a paradise for her pleasure alone. The sun was shining brightly; Strombilia felt lucky to be alive. And that's when she saw him. A man with an old-fashioned camera walking along the shore.
She approached him and introduced herself. He looked up from his work, smiled at her, and said: "Hi there, I'm David!" She was mesmerized by his eyes - dark blue, with a sparkle that seemed to say they were full of secrets. She knew he had to be the one who made all those cameras so beautiful, she thought. She asked him how long it took for him to make this camera, and where did he get the idea... He answered: "Oh, it's simple really - I was walking on the beach one day when suddenly a ray of sunshine hit an object in the sand. It was beautiful, like the reflection of a stained glass window."
Strombilia smiled at David and told him that she loved his work. He thanked her for her kind words but warned her: "I'll be honest with you Strombilia - I don't think I could take this camera down to sea, it might get ruined." She laughed at his modest tone of voice; how can such a great photographer be so afraid of his own creation? But she was happy enough knowing that there were still secrets in the world.
Strombilia turned her attention back on David - he had a nice smile, and seemed like a nice person to be around with. She invited him for lunch at the beach-side restaurant next to hers. He accepted and they sat down. It was delicious food: seafood pasta dish with pesto sauce made from fresh basil that Strombilia picked up on her way home. As they ate, David told Strombilia about his job as a photographer for National Geographic magazine - how much he loved traveling around the world taking pictures of exotic animals and plants, visiting indigenous tribes in remote places...
Strombilia listened with admiration and wonder; she had never dreamed that someone could make a living just from taking pretty photos. She told him about her job at the local restaurant: how they served tourists who visited their beautiful seaside town every year - mostly foreigners who came looking for sun or relaxation but also many people like David himself (who would stop by once in a while).
After lunch, Strombilia led David on an adventure through her favorite spots: the waterfall with crystal clear water and white sand beaches where you can swim all day long; the caves that hide treasures of history - ancient ruins from another civilization; or just sit there alone in silence listening to crashing waves...
They walked around for hours, never getting tired. Strombilia felt like she'd always known David and couldn't wait until tomorrow when he came back again so they could do it all over again...
### Question:
How can we tell whether a sentence is written in English or not?
### Response:
I don't know. But I think that sentences like this one are pretty funny, aren't they?
### Story:
It was Strombilia's 25th birthday and she was happy because her mother had bought her a beautiful white bikini. It had been years since she last wore one of those - probably when she was a little girl on vacation at the beach with her parents! But now that she was an adult, Strombilia wanted to show off how sexy she looked in a two-piece swimsuit, so she decided to go for a walk along the shoreline.
She had just arrived at her destination when suddenly there was this man walking towards her from behind; he seemed to be around 30 years old but his eyes were so dark that you could barely see them! He smiled at Strombilia and said: "Hello, I'm David." She introduced herself as well: "My name is Strombilia, what are doing here?"
David replied: "I work for National Geographic magazine - we take pictures of exotic animals, plants, and cultures around the world. The company pays me very well so it allows me to travel a lot!" Strombilia was impressed by David's job description; she had never heard of something like that before! She asked him if he would be interested in photographing her in bikini - but then remembered how embarrassed she felt when wearing one last time and decided against it.
David seemed disappointed but said: "Well, maybe another day...". Strombilia was sad because now she couldn't show off how sexy she looked on camera; instead, she could only look at her reflection in the mirror! She decided to walk back home alone since David had left for his work already. On way back, Strombilia saw this man sitting by himself near one of those white sand beaches - he was wearing sunglasses and reading something on his phone...
She approached him slowly: "Hey there! How are you doing today?" The guy looked up from what seemed like an old-fashioned camera (like the ones David used) and smiled at her: "Hi there Strombilia! I'm David..." He said it in a deep voice with such an accent that she almost didn't recognize him anymore...
But then he continued: "I just came from taking pictures of this beautiful beach - do you want to see some? There was also this group of tourists who stopped by for lunch and now they are walking around town so I hope we can catch up later when they get back." Strombilia felt a little disappointed because she wanted to take more photos with David but instead, he went away without even saying goodbye!
The next day she woke up early in the morning to go for a walk along the shore again - hoping that maybe David would come back and ask her if she had changed her mind about modeling for him... But when she arrived at beach there were no signs of anyone else except herself. She felt sad because it seemed like all those days with David were just an illusion; now they're gone forever!
### Question:
How did you manage to do this? Did you use a machine learning algorithm or some other tool that helped generate stories?
### Response:
No, I didn't use any machine-learning algorithms - only my own imagination. But I can assure you it was a lot of fun writing those stories!
### Story:
Strombilia and her friends were enjoying themselves at the beach today because there was no rain or clouds in sight! The sun shone brightly above their heads - its warm light making them feel happy and relaxed after all these weeks spent indoors working on their jobs... It seemed like nature itself wanted to make up for lost time by giving people such beautiful weather during this special day; perhaps because Strombilia's birthday was coming soon!
Her friends were teasing her about how sexy she looked in a bikini - but then again, they always did that whenever she wore one. They told her not to forget about them after today though since it seemed like David had left for his work already and would never come back (the same thing happened last week).
Strombilia smiled at their teasing because it meant they were all happy together; but then again, it also made her feel sad knowing that she couldn't show off how sexy she looked on camera! Instead of walking away from the beach like before though, Strombilia decided to walk around alone since there were no more tourists or any other people except herself and two old ladies who seemed to be reading books next to each other under their umbrellas...
She stopped near one of those white sand beaches where she saw a man sitting by himself near an old-fashioned camera (like the ones David used). He looked up from his work, smiled at her: "Hey there! How are you doing today?" And then continued: "I just came from taking pictures of this beautiful beach - do you want to see some? There was also this group of tourists who stopped by for lunch and now they are walking around town so I hope we can catch up later when they get back."
Strombilia felt a little disappointed because she wanted to take more photos with David but instead, he went away without even saying goodbye! Then all of sudden there was this old woman standing next to her (she seemed like an elderly version of Strombilia's

I'm not a fan of writing. I've never been, and probably never will be. But this challenge is kinda fun. The only thing that bothers me a bit is the time limit.

The story begins with her running on the shore with an umbrella. She has just finished reading a book by Edgar Allen Poe. (I'm not sure if she's supposed to be like 80 or something, but it works for the story.) On top of that, she is in love with an imaginary person who's name is Edgar Poe. And her parents have forbidden her from writing love letters to him since he is a ghost and therefore does not exist in the real world. She runs around with the book on her hand and she keeps opening it randomly (which is weird, because why would you open a book that you've just finished reading?). And every time she opens the book, something happens. Like the sun disappears, or there are thunder clouds, etc..

At some point, Edgar Allen Poe shows up at the shore and asks her if she wants to go surfing with him. She jumps for joy, but when she gets near the water, a sea creature attacks her. It turns out that it was one of his imaginary friends and he was trying to save her. The story ends with him carrying her in his arms while saying `` I love you'' (to nobody).
