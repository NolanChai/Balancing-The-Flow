The kidneys work hard to keep fluid balances by keeping the correct amount of water in the body. They also help balance other minerals like sodium and potassium. When a person has CKD, their blood vessels (or the filtering units inside the kidneys) can get damaged or start leaking. This damages the ability to filter out waste products properly. This means that sodium and potassium levels in the blood could increase, and it also means that water is not being filtered out of the body normally so a person may get dehydrated (this will be more noticeable with CKD than in healthy individuals).

|   < 3.5 mEq/L (2.5 mEq/L) |    > 3.8 mEq/L |      ~5.4-7.0 mEq/L |

### Discussion:

Potassium is excreted by the kidneys, and may be increased when diuresis is induced during acidosis. If a potassium level of less than 2.5mEq/l is found in this setting, a potassium loading dose may be given to reverse the acidosis (with calcium for tetany). Potassium levels will increase in this setting even if there has been no change in renal function; however, it's unlikely that a level of more than 3.5mEq/l could occur without the presence of diuresis or hypokalemia.

TB of the lung (pneumonia or primary)

### Discussion

The patient has symptoms consistent with tuberculosis and physical examination findings are also highly suggestive. TB of the lungs, in a person who is HIV positive may indicate AIDS-defining disease. However, HIV testing was not done during consult because the clinic was too far from the laboratory.

Based on the case presented in class, I would expect to see the following values for these three tests.
- The ROM test is a reliable and valid measure of balance control in persons with PD [1]. Therefore, it should be expected that the performance on this test will be significantly impaired in this subject's population. I would also expect this same patient to have worse performance than other patients with mild Parkinsonism (with the exception of those who are younger).
- The single limb stance task is a valid measure of balance control that requires motor control and sensory perception [2]. Therefore, it should be expected that the performance on this test will also be impaired in this subject's population. I would expect similar results for this patient to those seen with the ROM test (i.e., worse performance than others who are older or younger).
- The timed up and go task is a valid measure of gait speed, which has been shown to be a reliable measure of Parkinson's Disease progression [3]. Therefore, I would expect this patient's results on the TUG test to show worse performance than other subjects (with the exception of those who are younger).

1. The patient presented with a history of severe chest pain, shortness of breath and sweating that had been progressively worsening over 2 hours prior to presentation. He has a past medical history of hypertension for which he is treated with HCTZ/Losartan (Losartan Potassium), Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypothyroidism for which he is treated with Levothyroxine (Levothyroxine Sodium). He is a smoker and drinks alcohol at least twice per week. On admission to the ER, his blood pressure was 158/94 mmHg, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute and temperature was 37.1°C (98.8°F). His pulse oximetry reading is 93% on room air. The patient has a soft, moist cough that produces scant white frothy sputum which smells of cigarette smoke.
2. Physical examination revealed bilateral crackles throughout the lung fields and hyperresonance to percussion in the left chest (left lower zone) as compared to right lower zone with increased volume at both bases, tachypnea (17 breaths/minute), heart sounds were normal bilaterally without added splashes or gallops. The patient was tachycardic and hypotensive on presentation (158/94 mmHg) but these values improved to 120/74 mm Hg after intravenous administration of 20mL normal saline in addition to initial doses of IV metoprolol.
3. Blood test results are listed below:

* Serum electrolytes were within the reference range, except for a potassium level of 4.6mmol/L (reference range: 3.5-5.2 mmol/L).

* A complete blood cell count revealed no evidence of anemia. Hemoglobin was 12.9g/dL with a hematocrit of 0.37; red blood cells were within the normal range at 4.8 million/mm^3 and platelets were 350,000/μL.

* The white blood cell count was elevated at 12,900 cells/mm^3 with 60% lymphocytes.

* A basic metabolic panel revealed a BUN level of 28 mg/dL and serum creatinine of 1.4mg/dl (reference range: 0.7-1.3).

* The patient's alanine aminotransferase was normal at 69 IU/L; however, the aspartate aminotransferase level was markedly elevated at 154 IU/L (reference range: 0-38).

### Diagnosis and treatment plan:

### Treatment plan

The patient’s diagnoses include acute pulmonary edema, cardiomyopathy and hypertension. His diagnoses are listed below in order of the highest priority.

1) Cardiomyopathy - Patients with CAD commonly present with chest pain that is substernal or described as pressure. The patient’s symptoms are more likely to be non-specific but may include nausea, vomiting, sweating and shortness of breath. The signs of cardiovascular collapse are tachypnea (breathing over 20 times per minute), hypotension, bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) or pulseless electrical activity on the ECG with no blood pressure response to resuscitation. The symptoms may be precipitated by an event that causes stress to the heart and cardiac output, such as exertion. The patient also had tachycardia (heart rate over 100 bpm), which is a compensatory mechanism that occurs in patients with CAD to increase blood flow through the body.

2) Hypertension - The patient’s serum potassium level was high at 4.6 mmol/L. Serum potassium levels greater than 5.5 mmol/L indicate hyperkalemia, which is an emergency that requires immediate treatment to reduce the concentration of potassium in the blood and prevent cardiac arrest. The patient’s pulmonary crackles suggest interstitial edema (fluid accumulation between the capillaries and cells) and bilateral pink frothy sputum may indicate pulmonary edema which occurs when fluid leaks into the air spaces of the lungs, causing an increase in lung volume.

### Treatment plan (continued):

3) Pulmonary Edema - The patient’s blood pressure was 120/74 mm Hg and his heart rate was within normal limits at 95 bpm prior to administration of IV metoprolol. Intravenous metoprolol can cause bradycardia, which is a slowing down of the heart rate in order to improve cardiac output (the amount of blood pumped by the left ventricle). Metoprolol also decreases pulmonary edema by blocking catecholamine receptors and reducing afterload.

##### 1. Patient should be prescribed with antibiotic, since it is likely a bacterial infection from contaminated food.

##### 2. For the pain, the patient can take ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed for the discomfort.

The most likely finding would be tachycardia with normal blood pressure. A rapid ventricular response would explain the palpitations and also the mildly elevated heart rate (tachycardia). Tachypnea might also suggest hyperventilation as well.

Acute gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) 
with possible symptoms of acute pancreatitis. 
Most likely to be caused by NSAIDs and/or alcohol consumption, 
which was confirmed during interview.

Abdominal Pain is the most common complaint in clinical practice. It can be difficult to differentiate between organic and non-organic pathology based on history and physical exam alone. Abdominal pain can be a symptom of many disease processes including but not limited to, acute appendicitis, gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, liver disease, ulcers, etc... In the pediatric population abdominal pain is a common complaint in children, however most of these diseases are more often associated with adults. Pediatric patients are generally considered to have an acute illness when abdominal pain has been present for 3 days or less and chronic if it has been present longer than three days (Mayo Clinic). The duration of a patient's abdominal pain is important because it can help differentiate between organic and non-organic pathology. In general the presence of nausea, vomiting, constipation, or fever should all be considered in the differential for any patients with abdominal pain.

### Evidence:

Abdominal Pain is a common symptom that can occur alone or as part of a more complex presentation. It can be difficult to differentiate between organic and non-organic causes, however it's important to consider nausea, vomiting, constipation and fever in the differential diagnosis. Acute Appendicitis, pancreatitis, gallbladder disease, ulcers, liver diseases can all cause abdominal pain, but are more often associated with adult populations. The duration of a patient's abdominal pain is also important when differentiating between organic and non-organic pathology. In general the presence of nausea, vomiting, constipation, or fever should all be considered in the differential for any patients with abdominal pain.

I think it's a lot like the one in [the other case](https://github.com/lifthrasiir/learn-java/issues/45)...

A peptic ulcer occurs when the mucosal surface of the stomach or duodenum are damaged by a process involving acid and/or pepsin. There can be multiple causes but most commonly, it is due to chronic gastritis that is secondary to helico bacterium pylori infection (HBP). HBP infects the mucosal surface and inflames the stomach lining causing the formation of mucus which protects from damage. It also secretes an enzyme that breaks down pepsinogen into pepsin, which increases the amount of gastric acid in the stomach.

### Discussion:
Peptic ulcer disease is a chronic condition with 1-2% annual incidence rates, and it occurs most commonly in middle age adults. Approximately 65% of ulcers are associated with HBP. Other causes can be use of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory medications (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen or aspirin which may cause a decrease in gastric mucosal production of prostaglandins, the protective effect of these compounds is why they are not recommended for routine usage. Other factors can include stress and smoking.

HbA1c in diabetic patients is a risk factor for MI, so we need to rule that out. If it was positive then would have to treat with insulin and other meds to lower glucose levels. Also, creatine level can be elevated due to renal dysfunction secondary to poor glycemic control of diabetes (especially in the elderly). It's important that you rule out diabetic ketoacidosis as it can increase troponin.

Troponin I is released when cardiac muscle cell membrane is disrupted and it can stay elevated for a week so we need to get this checked on admission in 6 hours. If TI stays elevated after 12hours then it will likely rule out MI. It's important that you rule out ACS as it will require medical treatment (i.e. aspirin, beta blockers and nitrates).
