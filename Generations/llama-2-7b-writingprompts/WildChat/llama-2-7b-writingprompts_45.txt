I consistently prioritize clear, accurate, and legible documentation of nursing information. I am acutely aware of the importance of upholding patient confidentiality in accordance with the patient code of rights and privacy act guidelines. During my time on the unit, I frequently utilized software applications such as Medi-Map and Vcare for medication administration and documentation purposes. After each use, I took great care to log out from these platforms diligently, ensuring the utmost protection of patient confidentiality. On one occasion, I conducted a blood sugar level check for a resident and administered the required insulin as per the instructions in Medi-Map, all under the supervision of my preceptor. The blood sugar level was in the normal limit. Following the procedure, I recorded the details in the patient's electronic file with date and time, and counter signed by the preceptor, maintaining accuracy for future reference and safeguarding patient privacy.  check the grammar and spellings and make it 150 words

Nurses are bound by strict guidelines when it comes to handling patients' personal information. This includes not revealing anything about a person's condition, diagnosis or treatment outside of their immediate healthcare team and other authorised parties (such as the patient's family). Additionally, nurses must also maintain confidentiality with regards to medical records, notes, and reports written during a person's care. This helps ensure that only those who are directly involved in the patient's care have access to this information - which is essential for maintaining patient privacy rights within healthcare facilities. By following these protocols closely when it comes to confidentiality and privacy protections, nurses can help protect their patients' safety while providing them with the best possible level of care.

In recent discussions with residents, it is common for them to inquire about the significance and effects of taking particular medications. As a caregiver, I have found that providing clear and comprehensive explanations can greatly impact residents’ understanding and compliance with treatment regimens. In one interaction, a resident expressed concern about taking Levodopa, as he was unsure of how it could benefit his condition. To address this inquiry, my preceptor and I took the opportunity to explain that Levodopa is an essential component of Parkinson’s disease treatment because it helps to replenish dopamine levels in the brain, which can lead to improved symptom control. Additionally, we emphasized how taking the medication as prescribed can help manage the overall condition and potentially alleviate any associated side effects. By providing clear and comprehensive information on the benefits and risks of taking Levodopa, my preceptor and I helped our resident feel more confident in their treatment plan and its potential to improve their health condition.

Thank you for providing context around what happened during your shift as well as your justification for taking the action that you did. It sounds like things went smoothly once you provided information about why his medications were important and the risks of not following directions. I believe your preceptor would be proud to see how calmly and efficiently you handled this situation.
