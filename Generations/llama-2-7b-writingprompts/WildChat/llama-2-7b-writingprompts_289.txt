A few days have past, and the girls are getting bored of waiting around for Naruto to wake up. They decided to take a walk through the forest to gather some firewood. They find an abandoned temple and decide to explore it. They find an old book called "The Art of Naruto" which teaches them all about the boy they've been waiting on. While in the temple, the girls are captured by the shinobi.
