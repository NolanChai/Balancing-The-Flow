* A series of digital audio or video files which are distributed over the Internet. 
* Podcasts are usually available free of charge, although some do have a cost associated with them (either direct purchase by the listener/viewer or subscription). 
* The content of podcasts may be either original programming, such as a radio show, a video game playthrough, or a talk-show, or it could be in the form of an audiobook. 
* Podcasts can also take the form of interviews with people who have knowledge about some subject and are willing to share that information. 
* The term podcast was coined by Ben Hammersley for a radio show he produced: It is a portmanteau of iPod (a popular music player at the time) and broadcasting.
