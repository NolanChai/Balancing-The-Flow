I think this is a nice addition to the world-building side of Planet Psychre but there's some things that need improvement.
Firstly, this may be because I'm not used to working in Imperial, but I couldn't really tell where you ended and started your paragraphs. This made it difficult to keep track of what you were saying on a sentence-to-sentence basis as well as an overall scale. It might help to indent some of the lines for this, so that we know when you switch to another topic.
Secondly, I found a number of sentences in there which didn't seem to flow very naturally and took away from the clarity of what you were trying to communicate. These are not all problems but they do seem like a common issue:
```
In the space view, Psychre look like glittering bluish gray Luna. Black spots on Hjaoith heated by absorption of starlights, ice crystals and starlights causes planet support life, ice-based proteins and lipids evolve life. Life on Hjaoith is not carbon-based but ice-based, flora and fauna on planet. Ice-based flora, icewood trees has light blue woods and leaves.
```
This just seems like it doesn't flow as well as what you were trying to communicate could be stated in a single paragraph or so. Similarly, this:
```
Lomneal is sophont spacefaring species, they are blue humanoids designed in humans, skin color resembles #74b0ff, hair color resembles #bdd9ff, blue eye irises are dark that contains melanin, blood is transparent lack of hemoglobin, lomneals are hermaphroditic with no concept of genders. Lomneal race is pacifist and xenophile. Society is pirate anarchy, they are polygamous pansexual.
```
Just seems to be a bit confusing; it's easy to lose track of what you were trying to say here. It could help to have the sentence start with something that you want the reader to remember and then go from there in your narrative:
```
The lomneal species are blue humanoids, designed like humans but with a #74b0ff skin colour, #bdd9ff hair, blue eye irises darkened by melanin and transparent blood due to lack of hemoglobin. They are pacifist and xenophile, polygamous pansexual anarchists who live on the ice-based world Planet Psychre.
```
Now, these might not be the best examples but I hope you get the idea! You'll notice that in my example above I made it quite short; if you feel like your paragraphs are a bit too long, this can also help with clarity.
Thirdly, I think you need to spend more time on the "hard" science and less on the world-building. This is an article about technology rather than an adventure story so while you want to build up your world, it's probably not necessary for the story to be told here. You could make a wiki entry or something if that's what you are interested in. I also found this part:
```
Hjaoith is alien homeworlds of lomneals, fourth rocky planet in cold zone around G-type star named Op, native to the same galaxy as the humans on planet Civtia. Map of Hjaoith is similar to Luna, a destroyed Earthâ€™s moon collided with Saturn, map has large black spot made of blacker rocks. Lack of oceans and atmosphere. Bluish gray regions of map contains ice crystals, Middle gray areas of map lacks ice crystals, middle gray is more than bluish gray. In the space view, Psychre look like glittering bluish gray Luna. Black spots on Hjaoith heated by absorption of starlights, ice crystals and starlights causes planet support life, ice-based proteins and lipids evolve life. Life on Hjaoith is not carbon-based but ice-based, flora and fauna on planet. Ice-based flora, icewood trees has light blue woods and leaves.
```
rather confusing because there's no real worldbuilding going on; you simply list the facts. You could have used those for a wiki entry or something of that nature but as far as an article goes it'd probably be better to do what I said above in terms of clarity. You can still add details about how these things came to be, whether they are factored in and if not, why not, etc.
That's all for now! Hope this helps you improve your story-telling abilities on the site :)
