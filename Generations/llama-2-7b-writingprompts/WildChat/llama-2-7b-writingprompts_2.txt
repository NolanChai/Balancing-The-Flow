### Story:
*Megan's voice echoes from behind the couch.* (She is reading a newspaper while lying on the couch, her feet bare and facing Dave.) “It’ll be out next week, I think… called ‘The Hypnotist’.” “Dave! Look at me. *Look* at my eyes. *Notice* the pattern of light & shade. *Now* stare into them. Stare into them. Can you do that? Good!” (she smiles.) “I’m going to say a word… I want you to repeat it back to me. The first time, I’ll just say it; then the next time we’re at a movie and there is a scene with hypnotism in it – I want you to get out of your chair and do as I tell you. *Here* we go… ‘Hyp-no-tist.’” (She says the word again, louder this time.) “Can you remember that? Good! Now listen carefully… There is a man called Jackie Sullivan who’s a hypnotist in the movie, and he wants to use his hypnosis on people – but they don’t know it. *You* are going to be the first person he meets after leaving jail for breaking into a house & stealing a watch. He wants your wallet… (she holds up her hand) so I will say ‘Open your wallet’ - and you will do that! (She smiles.) Are you ready? Good!” *Megan begins the induction.* “Say this, in your mind: I want to feel my legs growing long. Repeat that after me – I WANT TO FEEL MY LEGS GROWING LONG.” *Dave closes his eyes & repeats her words… then opens them again and looks at Megan as if he’s in a trance, repeating the phrase.* “I want to feel my legs growing long. Repeat after me – I WANT TO FEEL MY LEGS GROWING LONG.” “Yes! That's it!” She says, clapping her hands with joy & excitement. “You are doing really well Dave, keep going!” *Dave repeats the phrase over and over again.* *Megan claps louder as she can’t believe how deep Dave has gone. He’s almost unconscious!* “That's it, that's it… I'm hypnotizing you Dave – you are going to feel your legs grow longer.” *Dave is still in the trance.* (Megan now walks behind the couch and moves her feet closer towards Dave.) “I’m taking my shoes off so I can feel what you're feeling. You want to see them?” She says, moving her bare feet close to Dave. “Yes.” He says in a deep voice with his eyes closed, as if he is just waking up. *Megan sits on the edge of the couch and slowly moves her feet towards him.* (Dave reaches out for Megans foot but she stops him.) “No Dave! Do not touch my feet.” *She giggles and looks at Dave in his hypnotic trance, then back down at her feet and grins with a smile. She takes one of her shoes off & places it on the couch next to Dave.* (Dave is still holding Megans foot and she is trying not to laugh.) “How are you feeling Dave? Do you want my other shoe too?” She asks, now playing with both feet. *Megan looks over at Dave and realizes he's smiling at her and nodding his head. His eyes are still closed as if he’s in a trance.* (She giggles again & moves her foot closer towards him.) “Yes.” He says again. “Do you want to take both shoes off?” She asks. *Megan now removes the other shoe and places it on the couch next to Dave with his feet, then she gets up from the couch and goes into the kitchen. Dave is still sitting there, smiling.* (She comes back 5 minutes later with a cup of hot chocolate & two marshmallows.) “Are you feeling better now? Did you have enough time to feel your legs getting longer?” She asks while handing him his drink. *Dave smiles and nods his head yes. He looks at Megan, as if she is the hypnotist.* (She giggles.) “I’m going to go upstairs now; I'll see you in a bit.” *Megan walks upstairs and leaves Dave alone on the couch with his drink & both shoes removed. A few minutes later, she goes down into the living room again & finds that Dave is still sitting there in front of the TV, but he’s now looking at her as if she’s a stranger. He looks confused… yet calm and relaxed. She asks him what's wrong then he slowly begins to speak.* *Megan stands there in shock & disbelief for 20 seconds before screaming at the top of her voice, “DAVE! GET OFF THE FUCKING COUCH!” (She rushes over and starts slapping him hard.) Dave jumps up off the couch and quickly runs out of the living room and into their bedroom. Megan chases after him & slams the door closed, but before she can get to her son they have already gone back downstairs again. She goes outside and shouts: “DAVE! YOU GET OFF THE COUCH RIGHT NOW!” (She runs out of the house in search for Dave.) *Megan walks around her neighborhood, looking everywhere she can think off – but he's nowhere to be found. She goes back into their home and sits down on the couch in front of the TV with a blanket wrapped around her body, just in case there’s a scene about hypnotism & Dave decides to do as Megan told him earlier… but there isn’t – it was all a dream. (She takes off the blanket and throws it across the couch.) “It's okay now… you can take your shoes back on.” She says out loud while getting up from the couch. (She picks both shoes off the floor & puts them back on her feet.) *Megan then goes into their kitchen and pours herself a glass of wine before sitting down again in front of the TV – it’s now 12:30am.* She opens her laptop while thinking about what just happened…
