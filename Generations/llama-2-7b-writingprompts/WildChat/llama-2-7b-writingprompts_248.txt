correect grammar: "Hi Jimmy

Thanks for your query. The business objectives are not currently uploaded into HR Direct but if you want to know what they are then you should speak with your line manager or the relevant Head of Department, they will be able to tell you these.

Best regards,

correct grammar: "Hi Jimmy,

If you look at the performance objectives listed on HR Direct, there are no goals listed against them yet. You will need to enter your business objectives for each goal by yourself (at least until your manager has assigned them) and then once they have been assigned by your line manager these will be updated in HR direct so that you can see how close you are to meeting each of the goals.

Thanks,

HR"

Hi there! 

For HR Direct, we are working on a project to provide Business Objectives for our employees. This is still under development and unfortunately will not be available before the end of this quarter. I would like to suggest that you complete the spreadsheet provided by your manager as well as submitting goals into HR Direct once they have been made available in that platform.

Sorry to hear that. Yeah. I'm actually away until tomorrow. But yeah. Next weekend should be fine. I think we should just wait for the weekend then. Sorry.
