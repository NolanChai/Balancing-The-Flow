1) Essentially, the Orientalist discourse is contingent upon a distinct power dynamic that enables the West to create and maintain reductive images of the East.  Exercising control over the Orient’s representation, the West situates itself as the observer, imbued with the power to discipline by defining what the East is and is not. The “power/knowledge” nexus – the notion that the production, dissemination, and control of knowledge serve as primary agents of power is reminiscent of the Panopticon, wherein the West becomes the observer, the bearer of the power-laden gaze, determining the Eastern identity, norms, morals and interests. This gaze reifies “a grid of intelligibility that legitimates specific research as objective knowledge.”
2) The paper seems to be rather vague about its claims. For instance, the introduction does not explain why it is important to examine Orientalism in relation to gender issues. As a result, I don’t really know how this paper is relevant to the class discussion and what it can add to it.
3) The author uses a lot of quotes from Edward Said and it would be nice if he/she could also reference other sources that discuss Orientalism in relation to gender issues.
