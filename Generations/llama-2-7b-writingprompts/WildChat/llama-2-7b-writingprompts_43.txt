To check whether a mail is originated from your IP address or not, you have to use the following command in a Linux system:
```
tail -f /var/log/maillog | grep spam
```
The output will be something like below:
```
Mar 15 21:46:30 rk.labs localhost[7994]: <5838ecec3f-0d52-48a1-beff-cf3258ec4a93@gmail.com>: hostmaster@rk.labs [2009-11-12T12:13:15+08:00] (HELO rk-sandbox.local.)
```
As you can see, the sender mail is `<5838ecec3f-0d52-48a1-beff-cf3258ec4a93@gmail.com>` and the destination ip address is `rk-sandbox.local.`
The **maillog** file contains all messages which are received by your mail server. You can also use the following command to check whether the origin of a mail matches with its destination:
```
tail -f /var/log/spamassassin/spamd.log | grep spam
```
