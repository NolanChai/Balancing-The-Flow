fivem scripting lua

you'd use this function from fivem, the function is called when a player interacts with an item.

```csharp
public static void OnItemUse(BasePlayer player, Item item)
```
you can check the blip on item use in fivem via this function and delete the blip after a certain amount of time if no one interacts with it.
