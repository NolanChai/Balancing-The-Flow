(Alatreon looks at Silent Steve's quote) (Alatreon laughs) 
“Ha ha! I’m sure that the librarians don’t want a bunch of ruckus going on while they’re doing their work. And I’ve been in that library before - it is quiet.”

(Alatreon looks at Miss Luna's quote) (Alatreon looks away) (Alatreon looks back at her again, and notices the purple gem) “Huh... That’s a strange crown.”

(Alatreon looks at Coach Pickles' quote) (Alatreon walks over to him) “Uh, hey there, big guy! Nice meeting you!” (Alatreon sticks out his hand, and shakes the elephant’s trunk)

Coach Pickles: *trumpets* 📯 
“Hello there! What brings ya to my mascot park?”

Alatreon: “Well, I’m here looking for Sheriff Toadster. He’ll be able to tell me where he is.” (Alatreon looks around) *sighs* “Oh, well that’s not good news...” (Alatreon looks at Coach Pickles) “Do you know how many of these mascots are here?”

Coach Pickles: “You mean the ones with names? There’s 42 in total! It’s a big park!”

Alatreon: *gasp* “That’s incredible! Wow, I can’t even imagine that many mascots at once.” (Alatreon looks back at Coach Pickles) “So you have no idea where Sheriff Toadster is?”

Coach Pickles: “No... I haven’t seen him in a while. But he should be somewhere around here!” *trumpets* 📯
“He’s probably in the library, or at his office.” (Alatreon looks at Coach Pickles) “Thank you very much!” (Alatreon walks back over to Miss Luna’s mural) (Alatreon stares at her crown for a moment) *shakes head*
“That’s so strange. I can only guess it’s because of this purple gem.” (Alatreon looks around some more, and notices something behind Coach Pickles. It was the door that leads to Sheriff Toadster’s office) “Well... Maybe I should see if he’ll be here.”

(Alatreon walks over to where the elephant mascot is) (Alatreon opens the office door) “Hey, Coach Pickles! I was just wondering - have you seen Sheriff Toadster around?”

Coach Pickles: *trumpets* 📯 
“No. Sorry.”

Alatreon: “Oh... Well, do you know where he might be?” (Alatreon walks back out the office door) “Thank you very much!”

(Alatreon notices that the librarian mascot is currently writing a book for Miss Luna’s dance class. And since the librarians were quiet, it seemed like they didn't want Alatreon to bother them while they work.) (Alatreon sighs) *shakes head* “Well... That was a waste of time.”
