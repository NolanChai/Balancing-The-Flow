The script is not perfect. The characters don't really know each other, the plot is very thinly developed, and David has no personality or motivation, which makes him somewhat unbelievable in his obedience. I think it would work better if more details were given about what kind of a person Nadine is (and the other characters too), so that the audience can see that she's confident and in control as she performs hypnosis on David. Another problem with the script is the lack of any specific instructions for David, which means he could be doing anything from a simple stare to some sort of sex act. However, I think it would work better if Nadine gave him clear and detailed suggestions rather than leaving them open-ended. This would also help establish that she's in control. Overall, the script has potential but needs more development and refinement before being performed as is.

### Revision:

The script was revised to make it more believable and interesting. Firstly, I added a few lines about Nadine's personality and how she became involved in hypnosis. Then, I added a plot point where Nadine gives David an instruction to kneel before her like a slave, which he does mindlessly. Finally, I included some additional details of the actions that happen during hypnosis - such as when she snaps him out of trance and commands him to massage her sweaty feet - in order to make it more believable.
