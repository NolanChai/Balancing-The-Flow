I am quite impressed by how much you are able to take from a random piece of fiction, and incorporate it into your own world. You did an amazing job in creating such a unique episode of Dexter's Laboratory. I also loved the storyline and plot that you came up with for this episode. Your writing was clear and concise which made reading very easy.

### Storyline:
Hookocho returns after being missing for 6 years due to an accident at the age of 17. She wants to start a new life by becoming a YouTuber and reconnecting with her friends, family and most importantly, her crush from school, Chunichi. 

### Characters:
Hookocho - The main character who returns from an accident at the age of 17 after being missing for 6 years. She wants to start a new life by becoming a YouTuber and reconnecting with her friends, family and most importantly, her crush from school, Chunichi.
Chunichi - The male love interest who Hookocho had a crush on in school but was too shy to tell him how she felt. Now he is the popular and handsome boy who everyone admires. He also happens to be an amazing YouTuber who has been on several of Hookocho's videos since they were kids, and still continues to watch her videos today even though she was gone for 6 years.
Sakura - Hookocho's best friend from school who is now the most popular girl in highschool and very popular with boys as well. She also happens to be Chunichi's girlfriend since they started going out sophomore year when Chunichi found her through one of his videos where she was wearing a purple skirt (which she has not worn again since then). Sakura does not know about Hookocho or what happened with them before the accident because their families did not want anything to do with each other.
Yuuta - Hookocho's twin brother who has been watching his sister's videos religiously ever since her disappearance and is now a very famous YouTuber in Japan as well. He helps Hookocho create content for her channel when she starts up again, but does not know about any of the problems between them before she left (Sakura hates him because he always bullied her).
Yuzuki - Sakura's best friend who has been watching Hookocho's videos since sophomore year as well and is now a YouTuber with over 10 million subscribers, most of which are girls. She helps Hookocho make new friends by introducing them to her through their videos where they talk about everything that happened after the accident (including Sakura).
Mishima - The teacher at school who was very close friends with the family before and still keeps in touch even though everyone else has distanced themselves from them. He is one of Hookocho's biggest fans, watching all her videos since they started uploading again and helping her get back into YouTubing by introducing new viewers to it through his own channel where he reviews different things on Youtube including Hookocho's videos (which are very popular).
Hinako - The girl who was bullied by Sakura in school after they started going out, but Chunichi stopped because of an incident between them that led up to the accident. She does not know about anything since then and still believes he will come back someday (which is why she follows his channel religiously).
Kotone - Hookocho's aunt who was very close friends with Chunichi's family before, but has been distancing herself from them ever since the accident. She does not know about anything else either and still believes that he will come back someday (which is why she follows his channel religiously).

### Storyline: The main character returns after being missing for 6 years due to an accident at the age of 17. They want to start a new life by becoming a YouTuber and reconnecting with their friends, family and most importantly, their crush from school, Chunichi.

He is a member of The Loud House, who tries to get rid of his annoying family with little success. His ultimate goal was to blow up the house and kill everybody inside. However, this only made things worse for him as he lost all of his powers and became one of the most insecure beings in existence. Hookocho eventually escaped from Koosland during the episode Jeepers, Creepers, Where Is Peepers?.

### Reward:

100 coins.

This is a remake of the Jeepers, Creepers, Where Is Peepers episode where Will was destroyed by a ghost.

[08/14 14:00] Hookocho: I think I'll play the girl, since I have long hair and everything. [08/14 14:02] Hookocho: What about Dexter? [08/14 14:03] Hookocho: And Dee-Dee? [08/14 14:05] Hookocho: We're gonna need a plot too. [08/14 14:07] Hookocho: I have an idea for the plot already! [08/14 14:12] Dee-Dee: (Hookocho, if you play me, I will kill myself.) [08/14 14:15] Dexter: That's a terrible idea. [08/14 14:16] Hookocho: No, it's not! It's called "Hookocho the Girlfriend" [08/14 14:32] Hookocho: Hey guys, what's going on? [08/14 14:34] Dee-Dee: (The game is over)

The following are the lines for each character, including the narrator's lines.

Narrator - He was a man who could never go to sleep on time, and he always slept like a baby when he did.

Auntie - But I thought you were going to be a teacher?

Mother - You know what teachers are like; it's all right for them. They can go to bed at eleven o'clock and not even think about waking up before six in the morning.

Father - Yes, well, I was never one of those types myself.

Narrator - He had a very simple philosophy: if you want to do something, it has got to be worth doing thoroughly, so that's what he did, and the rest is history!

Mother - And your father?

Father - Oh, I suppose he was one of those teachers, but he was all right when he was younger.

Auntie - So how does one get to be a teacher in this day and age? It's very hard for young people to find a job these days!

Mother - That's true. I have no idea why so many people want to become teachers, especially since the pay isn't that great.

Auntie - But you must admit that there are some real advantages to being a teacher; it certainly doesn't hurt your resume either!

Mother - Yes, and if you happen to be a good one, they can even let you teach overseas!

Father - Now that is true. I have an uncle who lives in Canada and he makes quite a bit of money teaching English there; the government pays him very well and he gets all sorts of perks as well.

Auntie - Oh, dear God! I'll bet that his wife is always complaining about how he's never home; it must be so hard to raise children without their father around, especially when you have a bunch of them like your uncle does.

Father - You know, I have always been a bit jealous of him because my brother was such a wonderful teacher. He had this great way about him where he could teach anyone anything they needed to learn in the blink of an eye; it really is amazing when you think about it. And yet here we are living right across from each other and he never comes over for a visit!

Mother - I know, dear, but I'm sure his wife is just as busy as you are, especially now that she has all those children to care for; and besides, your brother is probably teaching somewhere far away from here.

Auntie - Yes, I suppose you're right. It must be hard enough being a teacher without having to deal with all the extra responsibilities of raising kids as well!

### Explanation:
This episode is about a man who was always late and how he eventually became a teacher. The narrator describes his philosophy and how it changed his life, as well as some of the other characters in the story.

Not sure what you're referring to. Are you talking about the film franchise or the character in the film series? If so, I think it is definitely a possibility that this takes place after the events in the films but that doesn't necessarily mean anything for the character of Peepers specifically. As far as the episode is concerned he just shows up out of nowhere without any explanation.

When you first see Peepers, he'll say that he's not going to turn into a monster (and he doesn't), but he'll also say that he can do many things. He'll then give you a list of his special powers which include: Telekinesis, Mind Reading, Invisibility, Fire-Blast, and Ice-Blast (which are the same powers as Dee Dee). If you click on him after, he'll say that his head is full of Dee Dee's special powers.
Peepers will then fly back into Koosland with you, when you go back in the episode 10: Peepers. He'll then show you how to use all of his special powers and then he'll tell you to try them out by clicking on him. He'll also say that if you're stuck or can't figure something out, click on him again until he helps you with it (which is the same thing as Dee Dee).
If you choose to leave Peepers in Koosland when you go back, he'll tell you not to do so. He'll also say that if you are stuck or can't figure something out, click on him again until he helps you with it (which is the same thing as Dee Dee).

### Interview:
Peepers doesn't have an interview.

I think I should make this a bit more clear. The game was originally designed to be played with just two players, so you can see my confusion when I suddenly had four players playing it! I had some ideas for how the rules could be adapted if there were more than two players but I had to scrap them because of time constraints (and also that I don't know Japanese).

* Tough Guy: The tough guy is always the one to take on the responsibility. In this case, he takes on the responsibility of taking care of the kitten. He ends up making a big fuss over it, which makes everyone else laugh at him.
* Sickly Boy: The sickly boy is always the one who's feeling ill. In this case, he feels ill because he's not used to sleeping on the ground and needs to be carried home.
* Fatty Girl: The fatty girl is always the one with a big appetite. In this case, she wants to eat something that is not good for her (like grass).
* Shy Boy: The shy boy is always the one who doesn't want to get involved in anything. He just stands back and watches everyone else do their thing.
* Cute Kitten: The cute kitten is always the one who makes everything better. In this case, it makes things fun for everyone because it's so cute!
