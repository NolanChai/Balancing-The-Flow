The purpose of the introduction is to grab the reader's attention, inform them about what the paper will cover, and provide an overall focus for their reading. A good way to think about a strong introduction is to imagine it as a miniature version of your paper.

a.

* Write your thesis statement in the first paragraph; this makes it easier to read when you go back to add transition sentences. 
b.
* Make sure you include some background information and any necessary explanations in the introduction, but try not to give too much away (this can be done in more detail later).
c.
* Include a mini-thesis statement in each paragraph of the introductory section. This will help keep your focus clear throughout the paper, and make it easier for you to write strong transition sentences from one topic to another. 
d.
* Don't forget about introducing any outside sources that you use in your essay! Even though these aren't quoted directly, they are still important because they helped shape your ideas; you should credit them properly before jumping into your own analysis and evaluation of the material.

### Thesis Statement:
The thesis statement is the main argument or claim that a writer makes about their subject. It can be used to show what the topic will be, but it does not provide any evidence for this claim yet; instead, it only states an opinion with limited proof. A good thesis should be specific and contain at least one fact from your outside sources (if you are using them). 

### Background:
The background section is where a writer gives more detail about the topic that they will discuss in their essay; this includes any necessary explanations as well as additional facts from other sources. This information does not have to be directly related to your thesis statement, but it should give readers some context so that they can understand what you are talking about and why it is important enough for them to read further into your paper. 

### Transitions:
A good transition sentence helps link one paragraph or idea with another, which makes for smoother reading on behalf of the reader. When writing these types of sentences, try not to use words like `` and'' or `` but'' because they tend not be as effective (and sometimes confusing). Instead think about what type of relationship exists between two different points within an essay; is one idea more important than another? Or do you need some background information before moving onto a new section of text? Transitions should help readers understand how everything fits together and why it's relevant.

The main idea of this passage is to inform us on how to write a paragraph in an essay.

b.
This author supports his points by giving us a list of what needs to be included in each part, which I found very helpful. The first example was really clear as it showed the different sections and where they were supposed to go in an essay. The last example was a little confusing as he jumped around a lot but overall this passage is a good one for learning how to write paragraphs or how to organize your thoughts when writing an essay.
