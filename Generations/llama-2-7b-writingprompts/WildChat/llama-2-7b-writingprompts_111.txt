Eye of Kingthulhu: "Do not mock me! This island is no longer the place that I created. But I’m going to create something for YOU!"

Necrohemoth: "Yeah, what's that supposed to mean?"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Well you guys have been complaining about this place not being like Fear Factory anymore." (Points at Necrohemoth and Archeogiana) "So I’m going to make it so that we can take out our frustrations on each other, and only each other. There will be no humans involved in this! Now what do you think about THAT?"
