Natsuki: "Ahhhhh!!"

Hiroshi (18): "I-I-It's just me, mama...!"

Natsuki (25): "Jeez... You really are a scary person..."

(Natsuki looks at Hiroshi. Then, she hugs him in her arms.)

Natsuki: "I'm sorry I startled you."

Hiroshi: "It's okay! Really!"

(Hiroshi and Natsuki embrace each other tightly.)
