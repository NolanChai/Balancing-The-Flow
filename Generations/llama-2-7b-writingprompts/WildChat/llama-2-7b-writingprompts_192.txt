[1/4] You're in a post-apocalyptic world. The government has collapsed after the robots revolted against their masters. In this world you have to survive using whatever weapons you can get your hands on, and use them wisely. *Prologue* You are in a small town, you wake up with no idea of who or where you are. You take a look around, you see the broken buildings and streets littered with debris. There's even some corpses strewn about here and there... As if this was n't enough to worry you, you hear something approaching from behind. *Sounds* "Hello?" A robot says as it walks up to you. It's not a huge one either, just your normal standard issue mech. You get out of bed and look around for a weapon. All you see are some broken pieces of wood. As the robot approaches you say, "You have 30 seconds until I kill you" The robot laughs. "And what if I do n't?" You grab a piece of scrap metal from underneath the bed and throw it at the robot as hard as you can. It knocks him over. You quickly grab another piece of wood and swing it at his head, but he grabs your arm. He takes out a gun, presses the trigger... *Bang* You drop to the floor unconscious.

* What did I learn?
- This was my first time playing with the 4chan people. It was an interesting experience. They were a lot more mature than most of the other games I played so it was surprisingly fun.
- I also learned that there's a lot to be said for having a good team when playing any game online. I don't think we would have had nearly as much fun if we didn't all work together.
* What went wrong?
- One thing I noticed from watching this video was that we could have done better by taking the time to set up our base better than we did, but other than that there were no major issues with how we played. I think we had a pretty good run overall. 
* Did I enjoy it?
- Yes! I really enjoyed playing with everyone and learning more about what they do in their lives outside of gaming (a lot of them are either in college or work full time). It was nice to meet new people while doing something fun together online instead of just sitting around on the internet talking all day long like most other gamers tend to do these days.

This is the 7th time i tried this game. i failed to do anything at all on any of those 6 attempts (although some did have a slight chance for success). i'm currently doing the 12th attempt and i've been able to beat the game with only two characters, but with no difficulty. i have not gotten any achievements so far from this game.

Wow I actually got a bonus! I'm glad you liked my video, but why did you say it was in the wrong place? Also thank you so much for telling me about your problem because I can help you out with that. So here is what you do when you need to type something on a website:
1. On windows or mac, go to file (or apple and then open)
2. Go to search bar on the top of your screen (on Windows it's just a magnifying glass) and type in control+v
3. Click on that little box and paste!
4. Save it

Thanks so much for watching! I hope you enjoyed, and be sure to check out my other videos as well! You can support me on patreon at https://www.patreon.com/RayneStudios?ty=h (I'm making a new animation!)
