"In reply : — In the first place, there is nothing in the text which indicates that John borrowed his ideas from the Rabbins. We find in Revelation 17 : 8, and in Revelation 20 : 6, that these thousand years are immediately connected with the reign of Christ ; and it has been shown, by all the expositors we have seen, that this reign is described as closing at the end of the thousand years. In the second place, there is not a word said about the resurrection of the righteous during this period in Revelation 20 : 1 ; and it appears from Revelation 20 : 5-7, that the purpose for which the righteous were raised was to be judged according to their works. In the third place, there is not a word said about wings or flight in Rev. xxi. 4. But there is an allusion to wings and flight in Isaiah lii. : — " How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings ; who publisheth peace, who bringeth good tidings of good, who publisheth salvation." Here it is evident that the righteous are represented as being commissioned to publish salvation among the nations and that they were to accomplish this by traveling over the mountains. Again, Isaiah lii. 7 : — " How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings ; who publisheth peace ; who bringeth good tidings of good ; who publisheth salvation." This passage also has a reference to the righteous and to wings; but there is no allusion whatever in it to flight, or traveling over waters.

Again, Isaiah lx. 6 : — " But thou shalt be called Tsiyon ; The law shall go forth of Zion." This has a special reference to the establishment of Christ's kingdom upon the earth, and also refers to his reign as being spiritual; but it in no way alludes to resurrection or to flight. Again, Isaiah xxxi. 9 : — " They that dwell under his shadow shall return ; they shall revive as the corn, they shall blossom as the vine." Here, too, we have a beautiful reference to resurrection and revival; but there is nothing in it alluding to wings or flight. The only passage which seems to bear upon this subject in the Old Testament, that I can discover, is in Exodus xix. 4 : — " And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in fire ; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace." In this passage the Lord descends upon Mount Sinai in fire. The earth trembled, etc., while God went up in the sight of all the people. This is evidently an allegorical representation of the second advent, when "the kingdoms of this world shall become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ ; and he shall reign forever." — Revelation xi. 15. Hence it appears to me that there is no valid objection to the application of Rev. xx. 4-6 to a thousand years, as a period during which the church's prosperity was to be sustained by Christ's personal presence on earth; and I am satisfied, with respect to Revelation xxi. 4, that there is nothing in that passage which necessarily requires us to understand it of a flight over water; for the fact is, that this is no where stated or implied. But we have here, as in most cases, allusion only to what is common and familiar ; and, hence, the application to Christ's reign upon the earth, with his personal presence during the thousand years, is very appropriate. — (p. 243.)

"The dragon was restrained for a thousand two hundred and threescore days. There are three periods of time mentioned here : viz., one thousand years ; twelve hundred and sixty days; and a thousand two hundred and threescore days. The first, or thousand years, is the period during which Satan was restrained from his deceptive work among men; but we are not told what were the particulars of this reign. But it is evident that he was permitted to deceive and torment the nations during a part of the time. Hence we read in Rev. xii. 10 : — " Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God ; and the power of his Christ." Here Satan is represented as having power over all men to seduce them into sin. This was evidently true of mankind during a part at least of this period. Again in Revelation xviii. 2 : — " And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen ; and is become the habitation of devils; and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird." Here it is evident that Satan had possession of all men, during part of this period, to seduce them into sin. But it was only in the midst of their prosperity that these nations were thus deceived by him ; for at other times they were taught the truth concerning God. Hence we read in Rev. xiii : 3-5 : — " And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast." Here the beast is represented as being worshipped by men throughout the earth, which could not have been true of them at any other time than during this period.

But the particulars of Satan's work upon mankind during a part of this period are described in Rev. xii. 9 : — " And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the Devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world ; he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him." Here it appears that men were to be deceived by this old serpent during part of this time. Again, in Rev. xii. 12 : — " Therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell therein ; Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea ; for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time." This passage indicates that Satan was permitted to deceive men during part of this period. But it does not seem to imply that he had power over all men during any part of this period; — for if this were the case there would be no reason why we should say, as we do in Rev. xviii : 23-25 ; " And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee ; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee : for thy merchants were the great men of the earth, and all nations were deceived by your sorceries. And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints." Here it is evident that Satan had not power over all men during this period; for we are taught that he did prevail to some extent on mankind. Again, Rev. xvii : 2, 3 : — " With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication ; and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication." This passage shows that men were led into sin by this system. But we are not told what was its nature or extent; nor is it said that they all went astray, but only that a part of them did. Again in Rev. xix : 19-21 : — " And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army; and the beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." Here we see that some who had gone astray during this period were led back to God; but it is not said that they all went so far as to be decoyed away by the false prophet and the beast. Hence there may have been some among mankind, for part of this time, who were kept from sin. But we are not told what was their particular state at other times ; — perhaps a part were taught the truth at all times. We are also informed in Rev. xx. 3 : " And I saw the beast, and the false prophet, which wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshipped his image ; these both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone." Here we are informed that this was to take place at some future time. We are not told when; but it must have been at least after the thousand years. But, as the particulars of Satan's work during part of this period are described in Rev. xii. 9 and in other passages which we have already quoted, there seems to me to
