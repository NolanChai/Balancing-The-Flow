*I am not sure if I understand what you mean by this, but maybe the following will help.*

**The first thing I want to say is: If you have a lot of adrenaline, it might be worth looking into why you are in that state.**

There can be many reasons for feeling adrenaline. An example from my own life would be fear; if we get scared for our life or the life of someone close to us, it's not uncommon to feel adrenaline kicking in - because in situations like that, a lot is at stake and you want to be as alert as possible.

There can also be other reasons for feeling adrenaline. For example when I was cycling through the mountains with my girlfriend last year, we had some nice steep climbs and there were moments where the road was very narrow and not much space between us and a cliff. In situations like those it's natural to feel adrenaline - because you have to be alert and careful to avoid an accident.

In other words: I think that if you are in such a state, it might be better to focus on what is causing the state of mind instead of trying to magnify or replicate it. Because when we are in adrenaline-state, many things just become easier and more likely - like for instance getting hurt while playing sports.

Now that I got rid of the long-winded introduction, let's talk about some techniques which can help you increase your state of mind, even though they don't necessarily lead to adrenaline-state.

There are many things we can do to make ourselves more alert and aware - meditation, physical exercise, listening to music with a fast beat etc. But there are also other things which help us relax. If you know what helps you relax, you can try using those techniques to get into the state of mind where you feel calm and alert at the same time.

Some of my personal favourites would be:

- **Pomodoro technique** (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) - 25 minutes work followed by 5 minute break. I usually do a 30-minute pomo, but this is completely up to you. It helps me get into the state of mind where I feel calm and alert at the same time.

- **Listening to music with a fast beat** - For example [Dubstep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubstep).

- **Writing down my thoughts** - Sometimes if I'm in a state of mind where I feel overwhelmed and my thoughts are racing, it helps to write down everything which is on my mind before I continue with what I was doing originally. Then once I have all the thoughts down on paper, I can just delete them from my head without actually doing anything about them. It's a very satisfying feeling, like cleaning up your room :)
