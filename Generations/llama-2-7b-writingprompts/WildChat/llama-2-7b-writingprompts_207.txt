Smoke Automatic Fire Detector is a system that senses smoke and alarms to send warning signal to the authorities. The heat of smoke could also set off a fire alarm if it rises too high. The main component for this type of automatic fire detector is an ionization chamber which consists of two electrodes with wire mesh in between them. As smoke particles enters the ionization chamber, they will make contact with the electric charge on the wires and change the electrical current from low to high voltage which causes the alarm to ring. Heat Automatic Fire Detectors are also used to detect heat rise. These types of fire alarms are less sensitive as compared to smoke ones because it can only detect a temperature above 135 degree celsius and it needs time to trigger the alarm. These types of automatic fire detector usually consist of three elements which is thermal resistors, fusible link and microprocessor. The thermal resistance measures how much heat could be dissipated away from it before breaking. If the heat rises to a certain threshold level, then the microprocessor would send signal to the fire alarm system to set off warning signals. Automatic Fire Detectors in Flame is mainly used to detect flames and it uses different methods to sense the flame. For example, ionization type of fire detector senses the smoke and heat generated from a fire while infrared one would detect the infrared signal given by a fire. These automatic fire detectors usually consist of infrared beam which sends out invisible rays that could be detected if there are flames in front of it. The fire alarm system will then be alerted once these rays are broken by the flame. Conclusion: Smoke Automatic Fire Detectors is a type of automatic fire detector which senses smoke and set off an alarm. Heat Automatic Fire Detectors can detect heat rises in the environment while Automatic Fire Detectors in Flames can detect flames using infrared rays.
