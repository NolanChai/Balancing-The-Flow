This is how you do it.
1) Add in a background and stick the character on top of it so that they're not floating in mid-air. This will make them look better, at least to me.
2) If it looks like the character is standing on water or something like that, put some textures on him so he/she doesn't have the same texture as the background.
3) Make sure that your character isn't too big in comparison with other characters you make. This will cause him/her to look really small and it will just mess up everything else. I know what you're thinking: "I can make a tiny character easily because I use the 1 pixel width tool." Well, if you're going for anatomically correct proportions (and you probably are), then this won't help much.
4) If your character is too big to be animated in one frame, then just put him/her in the background and make it so that he/she moves on top of it.
5) Add any textures or shadows you want with the texture tool. You can use this as a way to make things like shading on your characters. This will help add detail. Also, try not to just put them over a really bright background because they'll just look weird.
6) If you don't have any textures or shadows and you want them on there, then go into the texture tool and choose "Random Noise", make sure that it's "Small" in size and hit save. This will give your character a good texture. You may also use this method for making shading with other tools, but I recommend using the normal texture tool since it has more options than this one does.
7) If you want to do a walk cycle or something like that (and you probably should), then go into "Animations" and add in your own animations or download some from here: [ http://www.goanimate.com/ ] They're free to use, but if you want to upload them, just give credit to the person who made them (if they have a name). I recommend using animations from other people because they'll be better than what you can do on your own.
8) If you want to make an animation but it has some glitches in it or something like that, go into "Animations" and click the blue circle next to where it says "(Animation)" with a line connecting them (you should see this when you've uploaded an animated gif). This will take you back to where your animation was. Now look at all of the frames individually until you find one with the problem, then hit "X" on that frame and save your animation again. You can also edit individual frames by using the slider bar underneath them (this is a good way to fix small problems in your animations).
9) If you want to make some cool text effects like the ones you see on GoAnimate, then go into "Text" and click "New Text Box". Then just add any text and format it however you want. You can change colors and styles with the text tool too.
10) I know this sounds complicated but it's pretty easy to do once you get used to how things work in GoAnimate (I learned from watching a lot of tutorials). If you need some help, just ask me or someone else in here (you may also look at my profile if you want to see all of my animations).

How to be like Spongebob, Baldi, Tom Cat, Axel Stone, Bugs Bunny, Jason Lee Scott, Gordon Freeman, Caillou(GoAnimate) and Ellis (Left 4 Dead 2). This video is about how to copy other people's voices in school. I will demonstrate how to do the voices for each of these characters. In the end, you will have learned all their voices. This video should only be shown at school. If it shows up somewhere else then you did something wrong and will get your account banned or possibly your life taken away from you. You can't take any credit for this video because I was just making a tutorial for how to make a voice. Also, if someone made a video of themselves saying all these characters voices, that is completely fine as long as it isn't on youtube. This video must be shown in school because people want to see the rest of their favorite character's lines without searching them up on google. If you get in trouble for doing this then you deserve it, so don't blame me. You can still watch these videos at home though but I suggest not telling anyone about this video. If someone does tell others, they will probably hate your guts and never talk to you again. I don't care if you do get in trouble for doing this because you deserve it. Now go make a new video showing how to do each of these characters voices like me and upload it.
