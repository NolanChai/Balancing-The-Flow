The old adage that an elephant never forgets appears to be true, based on a touching video showing an Asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart. After a 62-mile (100 km) trek through the forest, the two were reunited and embraced each other with a joyful trunk and tail shaking before falling asleep side by side in the mud. The video of the elephants' reunion went viral on social media in 2019 after being posted by the Elephant Nature Park, which has taken care of the two Asian elephants since rescuing them from a logging camp in Thailand more than ten years ago. It is unclear how long the mother and daughter duo were separated for but they had been kept in close proximity to each other during their time at Elephant Nature Park, according to the park's manager Lek Chailert. The pair were able to recognise each other instantly despite having not seen one another for a number of years. 'We do not know how long this separation has taken place but we do know that they had been kept together during their time here,' Ms Chailert told DailyMailTV, adding that elephants have an extremely strong sense of smell. A video shared by the park shows the two elephants coming within touching distance of each other before embracing in a joyful hug after years apart. The duo were then seen nuzzling and gently caressing one another as they walked side-by-side through muddy terrain. Afterwards, they lie down next to each other in the same spot with their trunks wrapped around each other's leg, while the mother looks over her shoulder at her daughter before falling into a deep sleep. 'It was the first time we saw them after six or seven years and I did not expect it would be this way,' Ms Chailert said of the emotional reunion between the two pachyderms. According to Ms Chailert, elephants never forget those closest to them. 'Elephants have a very strong sense of smell so they will remember each other and their babies even though they've been separated for many years,' she explained, adding that it is likely the mother elephant had also missed her daughter. According to Ms Chailert, it was not unusual for Asian elephants to be kept in close proximity to one another or live with family members during their time at logging camps because there are 'not a lot of male elephants'. She said that while the mother and daughter have now been reunited, they would likely spend much of their time apart from each other. 'They might not be together all day long but I think they'll spend nights together and it's a happy ending,' Ms Chailert added.
