I'm not really sure how I should be feeling about this whole thing, and I've been struggling with it for a while. On the one hand, Aaron Hernandez is a violent murderer who deserved to spend the rest of his life behind bars (and then some). He may have had mental health issues that he was never able to resolve, but in my mind there are no excuses for what he did. On the other hand, I can't help but feel sorry for him at this point, as a human being who will spend the rest of his life locked up with no possibility of parole. I think we should be more concerned about his mental health and how to prevent these kinds of tragedies in the future than we are about "putting him behind bars where he belongs."
