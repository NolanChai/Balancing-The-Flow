Kentucky is in a very tough situation here because, while they've already admitted to what happened on their end of the deal, it would be foolish for them to apologize for something that didn't even happen. The only thing we can do at this point is hope that Harrison has grown up enough since his dad and coach got him a 2nd chance to take responsibility for his actions here.
