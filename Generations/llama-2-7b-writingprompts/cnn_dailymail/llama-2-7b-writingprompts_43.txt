The New York Times reported last week that New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo has made an historic trip to Havana as he seeks to capitalize on President Barack Obama’s efforts to normalize relations with Cuba. Cuomo met with Fidel and Raul Castro, both of whom praised the governor’s accomplishments during his eight years in office. They were pleased that under Cuomo New York has become a leader in areas such as affordable housing development, healthcare, and infrastructure improvements. The brothers also commended Cuomo on his efforts to increase economic development across the state, especially in upstate regions that have long been neglected by Albany politicians. They said that they are interested in learning more about how New York has achieved these advancements while maintaining its rich cultural traditions and close ties with immigrant communities from around the world. While many on both sides of the aisle have criticized President Obama’s decision to normalize relations, Governor Cuomo is viewed as an example for other politicians in how they can work together despite political differences and geographical distance.
