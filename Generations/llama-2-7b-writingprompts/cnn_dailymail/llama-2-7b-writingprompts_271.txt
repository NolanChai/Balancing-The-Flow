Sarah's right. You have no idea how many people are still angry at him for his treatment of Kate Middleton, and you should be, too. It was so uncool. I'm a total hypocrite because I dated Chris Robshaw in 2007 when he was just starting out at Leeds University. We'd been seeing each other for six months before I found out he had a girlfriend already! When I confronted him, he got so angry that the next day I woke up covered in bruises and Chris was nowhere to be found. It took me ages to track him down. He was camping with his dad in Scotland at the time. So don't let him off easy - he's a proper arsehole!
