"I find it very easy because, when I played for Inter Milan or for Brazil, I was never happy with myself if we lost," he told BBC Radio Five Live's Sportsweek programme. "You don't know what to do next after the final whistle - you have to get up and give everything again.
"I don't like that feeling of losing. You need a very strong mind and I find it easier to be in charge than playing for somebody else."
The 42-year-old added: "My ambition is to coach Brazil. The players are there, they just need to work hard and play well.
"I played alongside [Ronaldo] and Rivaldo. They were the best players in the world at their time but they could do better because they did not have a good team."
