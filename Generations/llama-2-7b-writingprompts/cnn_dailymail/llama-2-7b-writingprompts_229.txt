### Explanation:

The first sentence is just a rhetorical device, an excuse for an example. It's also why we have the [rhetorical question](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetorical_question) tag; you don't need to do this. The second sentence is the actual example of the phrase or idiom that you want us to look up, and there are no punctuation problems here: it's a comma-separated list in parentheses with a dash between items (e.g., `This is a test`, which has a colon in it but doesn't need one), just like the first sentence. Finally, the last sentence contains a dash that should be a semicolon to join two independent clauses; it also uses "its" for "it".

### Hint:

It may help if you think of this as a list and try to identify each individual item separately instead of as one big block. For example, the first sentence is a single rhetorical question, so that's just one item. The second sentence is made up of five independent clauses with commas between them. That's a separate item too. Finally, there are two dashes, which you can think of as part of a third list if it helps (e.g., `this glass needs washed`, and `in New York`).
