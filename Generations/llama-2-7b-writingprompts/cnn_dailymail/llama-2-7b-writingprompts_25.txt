> [Sigh] OK I have a few hours until my next assignment (3.50 am this morning), so thought i'd have a bash at this one. I did it pretty quickly, but I didn't get the 1st paragraph quite right, which means I probably need to think more carefully about that. It needs work on the second paragraph as well. I'll add a bit more detail, and will also try and make my writing style sound better - I know there is room for improvement. Also I'll try and put some more structure in it, with more sentences, instead of just one big sentence that was a nightmare to split into pieces! Hopefully this gives you an idea of what to work on :)

> This Briton jailed in Burma for using an image of the Buddha to promote his bar has been ‘abandoned’ by the Foreign Office, according to human rights campaigners. Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison after he defaced a copy of the Lord Buddha’s face at the Bogyoke Market in Rangoon (Yangon) on 13 October and used it as part of an advertisement for his bar. Human rights groups have said that the case highlights the problems with freedom of speech and religious intolerance in Burma, which is still a military dictatorship despite elections last November. The Foreign Office has reportedly not got involved in Blackwood’s appeal because he does not work for a British company or organisation. However, according to campaigners from Liberty, the 27-year-old was arrested at his hotel room while working as an employee of the UK bar chain, All Bar One (ABO). ABO have been accused of not taking responsibility for Blackwood’s actions and allowing him to use their company logo to promote his own business. The campaign group called on the Foreign Office to ‘show leadership’ in bringing Blackwood home from Burma, but a spokesman said that they did not interfere with cases where British citizens are arrested or imprisoned abroad unless there is a consular matter of concern. Campaigner and former MP, David Davis, has written to ABO’s chief executive to ask him why the company ‘continues to put its profits before its duty of care to an employee.’ He said that it was not for the Burmese government to decide if Blackwood should be deported, but added: “If there is a company which has responsibility for this man’s fate then they are the people who should be intervening.” ABO have denied that they have ‘abandoned’ their employee and say that they are in talks with the Burmese government to secure his release.
