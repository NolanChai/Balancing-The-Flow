You know, I thought it was a really nice jacket when I saw her wearing that first time. And then I saw a photo of her wearing it on the front page of every newspaper with a story about how she'd been to see Trump and they were talking about the wall and I felt like vomiting in my mouth just a little bit. I think her style has always been good, but if she thinks that that jacket will win over any voters, then she is very sadly mistaken. It looks like an oversized puffer jacket from Zara. I'd rather have the old Nicola Sturgeon back, honestly.
