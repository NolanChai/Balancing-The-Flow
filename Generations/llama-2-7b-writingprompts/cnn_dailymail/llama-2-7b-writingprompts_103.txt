The book is an interesting insight into life inside the Royal Household and it does seem clear that, however much she was disliked in public, she was well liked within it. Although I would have preferred more detail about her personal life, there were a lot of details about the Royal Family, their lives as well as the events leading up to them leaving 

### Recommended for:
This is very much aimed at people who already know a little bit about Diana's story and what led up to it. If you want more detail about her personal life than this probably isn't the book for you. However, if you are interested in learning more about how she was treated by the Royal Household then I would definitely recommend this one.
