David Cameron will say that high taxes are 'immoral' as 14 million working households receive a tax cut . David Cameron will say today that high taxes and wasteful government spending are ‘immoral’ as he unveiled his plans to help hard-working families. The Conservative leader also said it was an insult to people who work hard for their money, accusing Gordon Brown of being in denial over the growing cost of living crisis. He will set out a series of tax cuts that would save low and middle earners hundreds of pounds a year if his party wins power at the general election, which has now been brought forward to next June 4. The Conservative leader will tell the Daily Mail: “It's not enough for Labour just to say ‘it isn’t me’ – this is a government in denial about the fact that life is getting harder.” He will add: "If people are being asked to do more with less, then those who take their responsibilities seriously have the right to expect it from everyone else. “So we need to find the moral courage to admit when things aren't working. If you want to help hard-working families then you have to start by making a reality check. It’s time for Labour to face facts: Britain is in debt, our economy is weak and we are heading towards taxation that will damage our businesses and make life even harder.” The Tory leader says his party is the only one who can be trusted with people's money. “We’ve been here before – high taxes, high spending and economic stagnation,” he will say. “The last Labour government wasted 13 years trying to make us all richer by borrowing more – it didn't work then and it won't work now.” He will reveal plans for a £2 billion ‘family budget’ if the Tories win power, which would save every household with children over £150 each year. Mr Cameron will say that it is unfair to burden hard-working families by increasing taxes or cutting benefits. “Labour have got things wrong time and again, now they are still in denial,” he will add. The plans include:
A £2billion family budget to support low income working families with children. This would cost the average family just £47 a year yet would give them a real extra boost of about £150 if they have two or more children;
Freezing the price of petrol at today's levels for three years in an effort to help hard-pressed motorists and small businesses.
A fuel duty freeze which will cost the Government £8billion over five years – saving the average driver about £60 per year on their fuel bills;
Freezing council tax, so that it does not rise more than inflation this year;
Extending childcare vouchers for two years to help working families with young children.
He will also accuse Gordon Brown of failing to heed his own advice in 1997: "The lesson was simple – if you want to encourage enterprise, don’t tax it.” The Prime Minister warned against any government that increased taxes on those who earned more than £50,000 as Labour swept into power 12 years ago. But this year the Treasury will take nearly 40 per cent of every extra pound that a higher rate taxpayer earns – Mr Cameron will say: “It’s time for Gordon Brown to apologise.” He is also likely to call on the Government to stop its plans to raise corporation tax.
