I think this will do it for me - I don’t know if I’m going to get that again. It was a pretty special day really. Obviously we’d rather be out there batting but we didn’t bat the whole time, which is something to be proud of in itself. I thought I did enough to stay out there and play with a bit of freedom today. I’m looking forward to tomorrow and getting stuck into it again. We were never behind at any point during that innings so that was pleasing. The last two sessions have been pretty good, we’ve put in the hard yards today but it wasn’t easy batting out there - it is tough on the fielders as well. Hopefully we can start to push them a little bit tomorrow and then hopefully make some early inroads.”
