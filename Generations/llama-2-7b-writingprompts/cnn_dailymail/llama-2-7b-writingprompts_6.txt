Ars√®ne Wenger believes that Theo Walcott's form for Arsenal was down to confidence, but has denied reports suggesting his struggles at England were linked to an unhappy spell with his girlfriend. The winger had been enjoying a strong start to the season until injuries took their toll and he has since lost his place in the first team to Lukas Podolski and Gervinho, while his displays for England have led to criticism of his attitude and work rate. But Wenger said: "It's not only down to confidence. I think there are other reasons as well. At a certain level you can play at 80 per cent and get by but when the demands of the top flight become more and more difficult, you have to be at 95 per cent all the time. That was his problem." Wenger is due to sit down with Walcott before Saturday's game against Blackpool at Emirates Stadium in an effort to lift his spirits and also discuss what he needs to do better as well as being more consistent. He added: "You can never be satisfied, you always have to go on and work on something else, try new things. The players who are good have that mentality." Walcott's England team-mate Ashley Cole has hit out at his attitude in the wake of the 8-0 defeat by Germany. Cole said: "I think it's down to confidence. I don't know if he can take it or not." Wenger rejected that criticism and said Walcott's troubles were not linked to any relationship problems with his girlfriend Melanie Slade, who he has been dating for four years but is not yet ready to marry. "There is a private story there," Wenger said of the couple's relationship. "I think she has been very strong and I think that has given him some support as well." Wenger also hit out at media speculation suggesting Walcott was not happy with his lack of starts in recent weeks, adding: "He's an Arsenal player, he doesn't say anything because he is professional. It would be wrong to be negative or not happy with the situation we are in. "It's important for me that you show your attitude and commitment."
