I disagree with him on that one. For me, Nemanja Vidic should be number 1 in this list (and I'm not biased because he's a Manchester United player). I have to say he's been outstanding for us and deserves it more than any of our other defenders - Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra, John O'Shea. John Terry is a fantastic centre-back but I believe Vidic has been better.
\n\nNemanja VidiÄ‡. The only person who comes close to him in England and possibly Europe, would be Rio Ferdinand at his peak.
