A 10-tonne 'fatberg' made up of congealed waste has been removed from a sewer underneath one of London's most exclusive streets. The enormous lump, which was 40 metres long and made up of fat and wet wipes, had to be hauled out by an expert team in the early hours of Wednesday morning. It was uncovered as engineers from Thames Water carried out a major cleaning operation in Chelsea's Manor Street during work between 10pm and 6am on Monday night and Tuesday morning. The company said they had no idea what the size of the mass would be when they started but it was much larger than previous ones in the area, which can reach 35 metres long, weighing as much as a car. The last time a fatberg this big appeared in London was five years ago when Thames Water workers removed an enormous lump from a sewer underneath Whitechapel Road in East London, which weighed the same amount as two double decker buses. It's thought that the 'fatberg' was dislodged after a heavy period of rain in the area, which led to sewage backing up into the road and forming a congealed mass. Thames Water said it took the team about three hours to remove the mass from the sewers, which were reopened at 8am on Tuesday morning. The company had warned earlier that work would cause some disruption in the area during rush hour but promised to get engineers working as quickly as they could. A Thames Water spokesperson said: 'Fatbergs like this are made up of congealed cooking fats and oils from kitchens which combine with wet wipes flushed down the toilet to form a solid mass in sewers. They block our pipes, causing sewage back-ups into homes or public places and pollute our rivers.' The company has launched an education campaign to get people to stop flushing wipes down their drains.
