The woman who was tragically killed when her car was swept away in flood waters has been identified as an elderly great-grandmother who was popping out for milk. The body of Anne Jarmain, 86,
was found on Tuesday night, two days after her red Mazda sedan got caught up in a flash flood at Maitland in Sydney's northwest. A spokesman for NSW Police said the car had been swept away when the Sandy Creek overflowed its banks and washed over the bridge near Barker Street on Sunday night.
Mrs Jarmain is believed to have got out of her vehicle after it became stranded in floodwater, and was making her way to a nearby shop for milk when she disappeared from view. The car was found in a river at nearby Gwandalan on Monday. "She would do anything for anyone," said neighbour Joan Sparks, who lived next door to Mrs Jarmain.

* What is the context of this question? How does it relate to what we have done in class so far?
	The woman who was tragically killed when her car was swept away in flood waters has been identified as an elderly great-grandmother who was popping out for milk.

The car was found in a river at nearby Gwandalan yesterday. "She would do anything for anyone," said neighbour Joan Sparks, who lived next door to Mrs Jarmain.
	This question is relevant because it's another example of how the media is using words like `tragically` and `popping out`, which we have discussed in class.
#### #2 (harder):
* What does the word `identified` mean here? Does this refer to a physical or emotional identification? Why do you think it is used in this sentence?

	I think the word `identified` here refers to her body being physically identified by police officers. This sentence is used because it is important to identify the person in question before you go on to talk about what they were doing when their car was swept away, and where it was found.

* How would you describe this paragraph? Is there any information missing from it which we might need to know more about in order to fully understand the events which happened? Why do you think the author of the article chose to write it as they did?

	This paragraph describes the events that happened after the woman's car got swept away. I think the author chose to write it this way because they wanted to keep a very sad tone throughout the article - they do not mention the fact she is an elderly great-grandmother until near the end, and then only refer to her by name for about 20 words before returning to the details of what happened. This keeps your interest in reading more about the tragedy of this event, so that you find out how it ended.
#### #4 (harder):
* How would you describe the sentence beginning: `Mrs Jarmain is believed...`? What kind of sentence is it? What does the word `believed` mean in this context? Why do you think the author used this sentence structure to talk about what she was doing when her car got swept away?

	The sentence beginning with `Mrs Jarmain is believed...` is quite formal - it's similar to the way you'd introduce someone in a business setting. However, the word `believed` makes this sound like there isn't any proof that she actually was popping out for milk when her car got swept away. This sentence structure is used here because it helps emphasise how tragic and shocking this event was.
#### #5 (harder):
* How would you describe the last sentence of paragraph 2? What does the word `would` mean in this context? Why do you think the author chose to use it instead of another word, such as `did`?

	The last sentence in paragraph 2 begins with the word `would` - which is an auxiliary verb (like would, should or could). This means that it's helping to add information about something else (e.g.
