Watford dramatically clinched promotion to the Premier League on Saturday on a typically manic afternoon in the Championship - and insist they're well-equipped to stay in the top flight. Slavisa Jokanovi&cacute;, who took charge at Vicarage Road after the sacking of Gianfranco Zola last month, said his side's season would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of the club's captain, 35-year-old striker Troy Deeney. Deeney has scored six goals in five matches since Jokanovi&cacute; arrived and has been key to Watford's remarkable turnaround from fourth bottom to top two. "It was a brilliant feeling," Deeney said of the promotion party. "The gaffer, his staff and players have taken me under their wing and it has been a joy playing for them since they arrived. They are a young vibrant group with great ideas and I think we're going to enjoy this league next season." He added: "This is a special club with amazing fans. We've come from the bottom to the top, it's just a fantastic feeling and one that we will never forget." Jokanovi&cacute; praised Deeney for his leadership qualities as well as his goalscoring prowess. "He is not just a goal-getter but he does many things. He's a captain of the team, he leads the team," said the 50-year-old Serbian coach. "This season we were not only successful because of the quality of the players." But Deeney warned against complacency among the squad during their summer break. "We need to keep our feet on the ground and remember what it takes to be good in this league," he said. "There's going to be teams who will want to come into the Premier League and surprise us, so we have to prepare well and go again next season."
