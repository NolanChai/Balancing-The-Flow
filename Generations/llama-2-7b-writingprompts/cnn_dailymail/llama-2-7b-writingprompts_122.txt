Hey Niall, just wanted to tell you that Rory was playing really well today until he hit that shot on number five and then I saw him give you a look like this (the face).

Rory McIlroy and Niall Horan played together in the 2016 Par-3 Contest at Augusta National. The former One Direction member was his caddie for one hole during the annual event, which is traditionally held the day before Thursday's first round of the Masters.
The pair appeared to enjoy their brief time together on Wednesday afternoon. McIlroy was particularly excited after making an eagle at the par-4 fourth hole and he joked about how his caddie had helped him in that situation. "I didn't need Niall to give me advice but I think it was good for my confidence," the Irishman said. "He just kind of stood there, let out a little roar with me. He was happy."
McIlroy and Horan appeared to have a great time during their round. The world No. 1 took to Instagram afterward to share a photo of the two together. "Hey Niall, just wanted to tell you that Rory was playing really well today until he hit that shot on number five and then I saw him give you a look like this," McIlroy wrote alongside it (the face). The pair are already well acquainted; Horan and his One Direction bandmates have been friends with McIlroy for many years. They even spent time together in the Bahamas last month where they played golf at Albany, McIlroy's home course.
"It was a good day to be honest," said McIlroy after Wednesday's round. "I started off making an eagle on four and then hit that shot over there (on five). It was kind of nice for me just to have someone like Niall caddie for one hole, but I think it'll probably help his confidence as well because he only had a couple of putts today." Horan has previously shown off his golfing prowess in the past; he even played Augusta National during a visit with One Direction back in 2013.
McIlroy has been in excellent form this year and is aiming to win at least one major championship again after ending a long drought last July by claiming his second career title at The Open Championship, which was held at Royal Birkdale Golf Club outside Liverpool, England. The 28-year old will begin play on Thursday alongside Charl Schwartzel and Jason Dufner.
