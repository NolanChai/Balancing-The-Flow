This was one of the best puzzles yet! It had a really nice balance between difficulty and fun factor, in that it took a while but wasn't frustrating once I understood what they were asking. The only thing I would change is that the last bit with "pass on" should probably be worded better -- maybe like "it is seen as extremely rude to whisper something you do not want others to hear", or something similar. Other than that, it was fantastic!

### Author's Note:

Thank you for your kind words! I did have a lot of trouble with the last part; I don't think there are any human societies where passing on is considered rude in that way so it was hard to figure out how to make it clearer. The only one that comes close might be some cultures where secrets and gossip are considered bad for a person. In that case, though, the message would have been something like "it's seen as extremely rude to whisper about someone else".
