"Never heard a more disingenuous set of statements in my entire political career," said Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP. "He is trying to frighten the electorate into voting Conservative - it's desperate and underhand." The First Minister added he had no interest in holding any post-election negotiations with Mr Cameron: "I want a Labour government with a majority that can command the support of the parliament, because we want an alternative to the Tories."
