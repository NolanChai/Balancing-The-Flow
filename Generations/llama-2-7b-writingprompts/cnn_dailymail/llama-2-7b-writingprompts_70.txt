I do not think that I could have chosen better words to describe the situation of those who have been wrongly accused and convicted by a corrupt criminal justice system in this country, which was all too evident when the death penalty was carried out in Indonesia. This is what happens to people like Myuran Sukumaran. He has never received any help from our government and it's quite obvious that he will be left to rot on an island away from his friends and family who are left behind by a system that no longer works.

### Dissatisfaction:

I have been in this country since I was born, but now that I am growing up, the things that I am seeing about our government makes me feel as though my future is not in their hands and I'm not sure what to do next because no one seems to care.

### Appreciation:

My parents and grandparents have fought for this country so hard but it doesn't seem like anything has changed since that time when we were all young, but now that they are growing older, I can see them getting more tired and more scared of what the future might bring. I think that Myuran Sukumaran would want us to fight for ourselves rather than rely on others who are just going through life as if there's nothing better in store for us.

### Reassurance:

I want you all to know that the death penalty has never been a deterrent, which means we still have plenty of time and we should use this opportunity well before things get worse again because no one knows what will happen next year or even tomorrow. All I can say is that we are on our way somewhere else so let's try not to make mistakes along the way by getting in trouble with law enforcement agencies such as police officers and customs officials who want us dead before they get arrested themselves because these people know what will happen when someone tries to fight back against them!
