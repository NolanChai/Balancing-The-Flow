Did you blink? There was a total eclipse of the moon on Saturday - but it was an unusually short one. The lunar event – where Earth’s shadow completely blocks the moon – lasted only five minutes, making it the shortest duration ever recorded by scientists. NASA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have been tracking the eclipse for years. They have also been tracking similar phenomena on other planets in our solar system. On Tuesday, the space agency said that a lunar eclipse would be visible from Earth on June 18th at 2:53 am EDT. The moon will appear to be darkened when it is eclipsed by the sun’s shadow. “The longest duration of totality for this lunar eclipse will be five minutes and two seconds,” said NASA in a statement. “This will be the first time that an Earth-orbiting spacecraft – New Horizons – has seen an eclipse.” The lunar eclipses last about 15 minutes from start to finish. As of Wednesday, the total duration for this eclipse was five hours and nine minutes. It is expected to last until Friday, August 20th at 9:53 am EDT (EDT). NASA has said that the lunar eclipses occur about twice every two years. The next one will be on January 1st, 2018 – and it will take place in California. The eclipse’s duration was predicted by NASA scientists. It is believed that it could last up to four hours at its peak, according to the space agency. “We have seen a lot of lunar eclipses,” said James O’Neill, director of research at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “And we know that they can last up to 15 hours and five minutes.” In the early days of human exploration, some people were puzzled by lunar eclipses. Some thought that it was because Earth was rotating around its own axis and that the moon was passing through this path. But in recent years, scientists have found out that there is no such thing as a “moon eclipse” – which means that Earth has never rotated completely away from our planet’s surface before an eclipse ever began. The most famous lunar eclipses were those of 1965 and 2007, when the Moon was seen to be covered with a ring of fire during an event called “The Great American Eclipse.” This is because the moon appears to cross over Earth’s horizon in our planet’s northern hemisphere – but the two planets are actually moving along opposite sides of their orbits. The last eclipse that took place before this one was in 2012, and it was a total lunar eclipse that lasted only five hours and ten minutes long. This means that the Earth-orbiting spacecraft will be able to see it – as well as all future eclipses from now on.
