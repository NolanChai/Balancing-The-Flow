The UK Government does not routinely collect this information so we can’t provide you with any figures on how many women have been airlifted from Royal Navy ships because of pregnancy. We don’t hold the data for medevacs from HMS Ocean during the last nine years, although the Royal Navy did report to us that 65 personnel were taken off ship in 2014 and one was removed in 2017.
### Explanation:
The data requested is held by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) but it has not been collated, so I am unable to provide information on this request.
