* [Carmela De Lucia](https://twitter.com/carmeladelucia) ( @carmeladelucia ): Wanting to look like a celebrity is one thing but wanting to look *that* shade of brown? We’re talking “I am a tanned ghost” level tan here. This looks like it has been done in the dark, with some kind of orange spray paint. It’s not even remotely attractive.
* [Lizzie Cernik](https://twitter.com/lc_thegirl) ( @lcthegirl ): So this is what people do when they want to look like an Oompa Loompa? You get your ghost friend to spray paint you orange then you can be a happy Oompa Loompa, how great.
* [Ella Davies](https://twitter.com/Ellie_Davies20) ( @Ellie_Davies20 ): This is the level of fake tan where it looks like your skin has been replaced with a brown balloon. You can almost see her face through it!
* [Abigail Clark](https://twitter.com/abigail_clark) ( @abigail_clark ): I thought this was an alien until I read the tweet.
* [Katie Greenwood](https://twitter.com/KatieGreenwood50) ( @KatieGreenwood50 ): I’m really not sure if that is a tan or a skin cancer!
