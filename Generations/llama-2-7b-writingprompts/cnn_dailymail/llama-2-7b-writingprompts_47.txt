over his place in the Blues first-team. Juve were said to be lining up a bid for the player when he returned from Brazilâ€™s Confederations Cup campaign but it is understood that Liverpool have made enquiries about taking him on loan this summer. The Reds are keen to strengthen their midfield with the arrival of Luis Suarez and could move for Oscar as cover. However, should Chelsea be open to a deal then Juventus may take the lead in any race to sign the player.
### Comment:
Chelsea are set to be busy this summer with transfer activity at Stamford Bridge but Oscar appears to be one who is surplus to requirements after struggling for form under Mourinho during his second stint in charge at the club.
