The players will then head to the Far East for matches with Manchester City, Arsenal and Inter Milan at Shanghai’s Hongkou Football Stadium between July 24 and 31. United, who finished second behind Liverpool in last season’s Premier League, were drawn against Italian giants Inter in a tough-looking group also containing AS Roma and Celtic. Jose Mourinho’s men are one of four English clubs to have confirmed their involvement in this year’s ICC, which will be played between July 19 and August 5 across seven different countries. Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal are the other three sides from England to have signed up for the competition so far, with more set to follow suit over the next few weeks. Mourinho has already confirmed that he will be taking a squad of players to the US for United’s ICC clashes against Real Madrid on July 20 and Barcelona on July 23 before his men head off to China. And now he has revealed which players will join him Stateside, with several of his stars set to feature in preseason friendlies against Borussia Dortmund and San Jose Earthquakes. Speaking at the club’s Carrington training base earlier on Wednesday afternoon, Mourinho said: "The final list is not confirmed yet but it will be announced by the end of this month or early next month. There are some players who are playing in the Euros and so they don't have to come with us." 

### Summary:


```
"It looks like we are going to have a good group [of players]. We know that when you go to America, you need at least five or six [players]. Then I think it will be a strong squad."
```

Mourinho is also set to take some members of his first team squad for pre-season training to China later this summer. The United boss is expected to confirm the dates and cities where he will hold the session over the coming weeks, with Shanghai already confirmed as one location. “It's very important [to have a pre-season in China],” said Mourinho on Wednesday. “I think it’s something that I can be sure about in my future, because the first time we did this was fantastic and also for the players it was a big experience to go to such a different country than England or Portugal where they come from. “The experience of playing football is not always on the pitch; it's also off the pitch, being part of something special like that. So I hope the Chinese people enjoy us and we try to give them a great show.” Mourinho is expected to take between 25-30 players overseas for pre-season this summer, with the Premier League returning on August 12 when United host Leicester City.

### Feedback:

The club confirmed that he will also be taking part in the International Champions Cup tournaments across America and China from July 19 to 30. “I think it's something that I can be sure about in my future, because the first time we did this was fantastic and also for the players it was a big experience to go to such a different country than England or Portugal where they come from,” Mourinho said. The Portuguese coach has been in charge of United since 2016 when he replaced Louis van Gaal and is expected to take a large squad on tour, with at least half his first team players likely to travel Stateside.

### Discussion:

The International Champions Cup is an annual series of exhibition soccer games held across the world. The competition has been run by Relevant Sports since 2015 and features some of Europe's biggest clubs, with Manchester United one of several teams to have confirmed their involvement this summer. Mourinho previously took a similar trip Stateside in 2014 when he was manager at Chelsea, before the competition came under the Relevant Sports umbrella in 2015. In addition to playing against Real Madrid and Barcelona as part of his US tour last year, United also played Roma while on their pre-season trip to the Far East. The club are now expected to take some members of Mourinho’s first team squad for pre-season training to China later this summer, with Shanghai already confirmed as one location.

### Question:

The 2018 ICC is set to get underway on July 19 and run through until August 5 in seven countries across the globe - including America, Asia, Australia, Africa and Europe. Manchester United will kick-off their campaign against Real Madrid at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey before heading back overseas for friendlies with Borussia Dortmund and San Jose Earthquakes on July 23 and 26 respectively. Mourinho's men will then play Barcelona at Hard Rock Stadium, Miami Gardens, two days later after travelling to Shanghai for a pre-season training session with the club’s stars.
