A second round of substitutions in the 10th minute saw Rangers add striker Nick Blackman and right-back Aidy White to replace injured players Matthew Kilgallon (knee), Tommaso Bianchi, Giuseppe Bellusci and Dario Del Fabro. Rangers then suffered a further injury set back with striker Ross McCormack being forced off after 35 minutes of the game with an apparent rib injury, and was replaced by winger Niko Kranjcar.
