A few months ago I wrote about how important it was for Liverpool to get a player like Steven Gerrard who has the ability to be the captain of a team that will play on all fronts this season. He is the leader and captain of his country, so he must have leadership skills as well as technical ones. With the addition of Jamie Carragher back into the first-team squad following injury I would like to see Gerrard promoted from vice-captain to captain for both club and country.

I've been waiting a while for this post, because it was my idea! We'll have more news on that tomorrow as well as an update from our trip to France (the last one). If you're in the mood for some good old-fashioned patriotism then check out the blog post I wrote about England's win over Argentina.
