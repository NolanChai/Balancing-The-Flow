This article was well written and factual, but it did not contain any real analysis or insight into this situation that would be beyond what someone who knows nothing about meteorology could come up with on their own. It states facts and then follows up with anecdotal evidence from the west coast to support its claims. The main reason I say the author is trying to get us all excited was the lack of scientific analysis in this article, it is as if they want to tell a story instead of making sense of the science. There were also no real references or citation for any facts that were stated and no actual data collection on which to base their findings.
