The first thing you have to remember when looking at this question is that, for the purposes of SAT questions (and any other standardized tests), it does not matter if what a paragraph says is true. What matters is whether the passage makes sense and whether or not the logic contained in the passage flows logically from start to finish.

In this case, you can see that there are two possible ways of interpreting the text: either dinosaurs were going up the side of a cliff, or else they were descending downward. But which one is true? Well, it's impossible for us to know without seeing more information, so we must look at the logic in the passage.

First, let me explain how to spot flaws in the reasoning of a passage. Flawed reasoning will always follow one of three patterns:

1. **Illogical Conclusions**. A conclusion that has no logical connection with the preceding evidence. For example, "I'm a genius because I can multiply 7 x 9 without a calculator". The first sentence is not logically connected to the second, which means that we cannot conclude that the person who says this is a genius.
2. **Vagueness**. A conclusion with no specific facts backing it up. For example, "It's difficult to say if I am in love or not". The first sentence is not supported by any information about whether the subject of the sentence is in love or not.
3. **Misleading Evidence**. Evidence that leads you to a conclusion that may be true but does not support this conclusion logically. For example, "My dog has fleas and I've been eating his food for years". The evidence suggests that we should not eat the dog's food because it might make us sick; however, there is no logical connection between this evidence and the conclusion (i.e., you have never gotten sick).

If your answer is flawed in any of these ways then it will be wrong by default. So now let me explain how to spot a flaw in the reasoning:

1. **Illogical Conclusions**: Identify a conclusion that seems unreasonable or out-of-place with respect to what came before (i.e., if you can't make sense of it then neither will anyone else). If there is no logical connection between this concluding statement and preceding evidence, then your answer must be wrong.
2. **Vagueness**: Look for statements that are unsupported by specific facts or evidence (i.e., vague words like "usually", "sometimes" or "most often"). If there is no information to support this conclusion then it cannot be true and thus your answer will always be wrong.
3. **Misleading Evidence**: Identify a statement that seems reasonable at first but which actually does not lead logically from prior statements (i.e., if you can't see why someone would draw such an inference from this evidence then neither will anyone else). If there is no logical connection between preceding evidence and conclusion then your answer must be wrong by default!

Now that we know how to spot a flaw in the reasoning of a passage let's look at this question together. The first paragraph states: "Landslides have exposed trails of dinosaur footprints running along a near-vertical rock face in Bolivia." This sentence does not seem out of place or illogical because it is supported by specific evidence (the presence of fossilized tracks). However, if we look at the second paragraph then we see that this statement has been contradicted: "And although the angle of the prints could suggest the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers" which means that your answer cannot be correct because there is no logical connection between these two sentences. In other words, it seems like they are saying different things; one says that dinosaurs went up a cliff and another says they did not! Now let's look at the third paragraph: "the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers". This sentence is also contradictory because there is no logical connection between this statement and preceding evidence. In other words, it seems like you are saying that dinosaurs went up a cliff but then immediately state they did not! The final paragraph concludes: "The first thing you have to remember when looking at this question is that, for the purposes of SAT questions (and any other standardized tests), it does not matter if what a paragraph says is true." But there is no logical connection between this statement and preceding evidence. In fact, this sentence seems completely irrelevant given previous statements! So now we can see why your answer must be wrong by default: there is no logical connection between the two sentences which means that either one or both of them cannot possibly be true. This is because there are two possible ways of interpreting each statement (either dinosaurs went up a cliff or downward). However, if we look at preceding statements then it seems clear that they contradict each other: first paragraph says "trails" and second says "angle". Now let me explain how you can avoid making mistakes like this in future questions:

Whenever you find yourself answering an SAT question try to figure out if there is any logical connection between the information given before hand. If not then your answer cannot be true! For example, suppose I tell you that my sister's name begins with A and ends with Z while she has a middle initial of C (i.e., ACZ). You might think it is possible for her name to begin with A or end with Z but there is no logical connection between these statements because they both seem equally likely given the information provided! So you cannot know which one is true and your answer will always be wrong by default; however, if I had said that my sister's middle initial was B (i.e., ACB) then it would have been easy to spot this flaw: there are only two possible ways of interpreting each statement given previous information about her full name! So try not to get caught up in looking for patterns when answering questions because they do not always lead logically from prior statements which means your answer cannot possibly be correct.
