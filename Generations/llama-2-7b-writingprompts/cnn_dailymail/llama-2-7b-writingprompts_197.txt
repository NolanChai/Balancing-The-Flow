**I liked the beginning of this story!** I felt like it had potential to be quite good. However, you have to make sure that you don’t drop any words in your writing! The first sentence of Chapter 1 reads as follows: Brynn Johnson and Cassie Miller **have known each other for some time** but seven months ago they were brought together by a terrible tragedy. Cassie was **in her car picking up** Brynn's son for preschool, when she was hit head on. 

I’m assuming that you are going to drop the “have known each other for some time” and just say “but seven months ago”. Then you need to make sure you don’t repeat this in Chapter 1. I like your story line so far, but you should try not to drop any words! It really bugs me when authors do that.
