Hello, Baby Malakai! It is so nice to finally meet you! I have heard all about your struggle through my friend's wife. She has told me of the many doctors and specialists you will see in your life time. However, with all that she said, none could compare to what I have done.

I am a miracle worker. Do not get me wrong; I have never cured someone from cancer or AIDS or anything like that. I simply make things better for them. It's like therapy but more personal and with less paperwork! 

When my client first comes to me, I sit down at the table and take their hands in mine. They are always so cold, these babies. You were no different, but I still held your hand tenderly. The child would look into my eyes while I talked to them. They always seemed to have a question for me. As if they already knew that I had all the answers to their problems.

I then ask the child what they need. Many times they do not know, but most of the time they say it's something small like a new coloring book or dollhouse set. What I will do is send them to the store with this money and they always return with a smile on their face. Some even come back in tears because I am making them go through such hardship.

Baby Malakai, you have been sick for so long now. But I know that if your parents bring me a dollhouse set like the one I sent to my client then you will be able to live a normal life! It is not much but it will help make things better. Your parents will love this doll house and they will tell everyone about how it made their son feel better in his sickly state.

The child will be so happy that he or she never even realized what was going on with them until then. When my clients return to me, I know that there is hope for these children. They still have a future ahead of them and they can live like everyone else!
