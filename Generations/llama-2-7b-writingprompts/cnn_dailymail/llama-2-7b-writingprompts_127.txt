It was a bit too easy really. Boro couldn’t keep hold of the ball and it felt like their midfield had gone missing. There are just a few problems, in my opinion: - 1) The defenders were not on the same page in terms of how to defend a set piece. I’m sure there is more work needed from both individuals and coaching staff. - 2) We don’t have a leader in midfield that can dominate games. Ayala looked very out of form, possibly due to illness. But, he will be needed back in the starting line up if we are to make the top six (with or without him). I wouldn’t say we missed Adam Clayton too much as it was clear there were many holes in his game last season - 3) We have a defensive midfielder who is very good at holding but doesn’t seem to be able to distribute well, which leads to us being very slow on the ball. Again, I’m sure this can be corrected through coaching and training - 4) Our wingers are very predictable when crossing and don’t seem to be able to pass across a defence that’s in front of them - 5) We need to improve our set pieces as we were poor today. All in all, not a disaster by any means but it’s hard to see how we can beat the top six at present given their strengths and Boro’s weaknesses.
