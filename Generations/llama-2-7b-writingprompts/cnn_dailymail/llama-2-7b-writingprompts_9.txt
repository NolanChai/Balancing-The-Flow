I’m so sorry! But it’s too late! You have already had your hymen removed and you are no longer a virgin! Please don't be mad at me, but it’s really none of my business. It is your father’s decision. If he were to decide that you should have sex with your husband before marriage then I wouldn’t want to step in.

### Discussion:
I’m not sure what the correct thing to do would be here, but I hope you find a way out of this situation and I wish you all the best. You deserve it!
