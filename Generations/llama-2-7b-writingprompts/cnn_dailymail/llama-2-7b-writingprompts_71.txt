Instead of choosing sandwiches and pasta salads as healthy options it would be better for the customers to choose sandwiches that are without mayo or a thin spread made from avocado. For those who are craving something warm, try adding turkey bacon or chicken sausage to your meal. Avoid deep fried foods and opt for grilled instead. Avoid dressing with high fat content. If possible avoid the sugar as well.
