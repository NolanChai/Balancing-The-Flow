The 38-year-old Williams, who is trying to extend her record mark of 24 Grand Slam titles, is playing in her first Fed Cup tie since February 2015 when she was pregnant with daughter Olympia and skipped last year's tie after an Australian Open final loss.

She needed a medical timeout at the end of the first set because of dizziness. Williams' win over the 43rd-ranked Giorgi gave the U.S. a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series as they host Italy in Asheville, North Carolina on Sunday.

The doubles match will be played on Monday before a reverse singles rubber Tuesday. Williams said she was "a little woozy" after winning the first set but felt better after a medical timeout and a few sips of water.

"It's always difficult to start matches," Williams said, "especially playing someone I've never faced before." Williams had a chance to end the match in the second game of the final set, serving for it at 5-3 and leading 40-15 but missed four match points.

"I was just thinking: 'Let me get this over with'. At some point I knew I had to win this point because she started playing her best tennis." Williams broke Giorgi again in the next game as Italy's No. 2 player was broken three times in the final set and won only one of six service games after losing the first set on a tie-breaker.

Giorgi, who had been 0-2 against Williams, said she struggled with her movement because of an ankle injury that kept her off court since Miami in March.
"I didn't have enough energy to play my best game," Giorgi said. "Serena is a great champion and I had no chance."
