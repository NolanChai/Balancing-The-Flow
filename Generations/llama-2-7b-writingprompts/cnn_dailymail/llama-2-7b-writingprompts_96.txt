Antarctica has experienced its highest temperature on record, according to meteorologists. Sensors at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature of 18°C (64°F). The previous record for the continent was 17°C (63°F), set in March 2015.

Antarctica is not actually cold, but it's still colder than most people are used to. The warmest temperatures ever recorded on the continent are below freezing: -7°C (19°F) at Vostok Station in Antarctica during January 1982.
