The cleaner's supervisor said: "I initially thought the body had been thrown away." A police officer said: "We don't know how long it was there for but it certainly wasn't there last night, so we assume someone brought it in and left it this morning. We think that maybe it was a gift." The mummy is believed to be between 1,000 and 2,000 years old and was wrapped in cloth from its neck down to its waist.
