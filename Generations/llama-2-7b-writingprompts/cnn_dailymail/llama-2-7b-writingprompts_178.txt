Siri gives him the following response when asked "What is gay?" "There are different kinds of gays." Then, when he asks "Who are they," she replies "The ones that love the same sex and others don't like them. They have an organization, it is called GLAAD." This seems to suggest that Apple has not yet integrated Siri with iOS 7.0.4.
