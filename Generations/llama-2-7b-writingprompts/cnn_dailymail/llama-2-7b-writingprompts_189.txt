` I guess my only question is why? The article states that he was a sex worker in Amsterdam. Was he recruited by some group and then later became a pimp? Did he get deported back home and decide he wanted more money so he got his own "business" going on the side?
` I'm just confused as to why anyone would do this, other than maybe the "thrill of the chase" aspect. It sounds like an awful life for someone else...
` I feel very sorry for these young men and I hope that they can all recover from this horrible experience.
` Also, why are Eastern European gay sex workers called "prague boys"? That's pretty disgusting if you ask me. They should be referred to as victims or sex slaves, not prague boys. Just a little thought of mine.
` I hope that the other defendants get the maximum sentence possible. This man is a true predator and should never see freedom again in my eyes.
` There is a quote from The Book of Job where God asks Satan why he hates Job so much? Well, it's like God said to Satan "Have you considered My servant, Job?" and Satan said "Yes! That's the guy!" I feel that this man was chosen to be preyed upon because he was gay. He was preyed upon because he was weak. He was preyed upon because he was a victim of his own sexuality. It's almost like God is saying, in the eyes of the people on the jury "You see THIS? I have given you this man who has lived an honest life and this man has suffered because of your indifference to my children. This man has been abused, tortured, raped, beaten and broken by his own kind. He has done nothing wrong but love who he was born to love! But still you don't care!! You are the ones to blame for this!"
` The government could not have made a better choice in this case. This man is exactly what the world needs to see. I hope that when all of these young men get their day in court, they will testify with strength and conviction and be able to find a sliver of justice from this experience. They do not deserve to have been trapped and abused like this. They did nothing wrong except love who they were born to love. And they were punished for it. This man was a predator. He preyed on the weak and vulnerable, he made a choice that is incomprehensible to me as a straight person. I'm sure it seems like common sense to him and his kind...but it will never make any sense to us who were born with love in our hearts!
` It's pretty crazy how this has turned out, since I first started looking at these websites. The man that ran the ring was arrested over a year ago, but somehow he still got convicted on all counts? I feel like there should be more articles about what happened to the victims once they came back home and what the government did for them afterwards. This just seems so surreal to me.
` I think that this case is important because it shows that many young men are being trafficked into sex work everyday. The prague boys were lucky that a police officer from NYC noticed something was wrong with them and turned to the victims for help. I wonder what would have happened if nobody had intervened? Would these men be in a worse situation than they already are or would it be the same as they currently are, where they feel that no one will ever love them again? I'm sure that all of their lives were turned upside down after this and I hope that they can heal.
` I just want to say how happy I am that they finally caught Vass! It really shocked me when he was found guilty on so many counts...I thought for sure it would be overturned or something. I'm glad justice has been served, at least partially.
` What makes this even more heartbreaking is that the young men in his group were from other countries and did not speak English very well. He took advantage of their vulnerability and used them as tools for sex work.
