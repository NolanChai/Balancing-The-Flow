The Syrian migrant had thousands of bomb-making materials in his flat, including hydrogen peroxide, ammonium nitrate and sulphur. He was caught by police with an improvised explosives manual that contained recipes for home made bombs

### Discussion:
Was he arrested for having a bunch of chemicals to make fertilizer or was it the manual?
