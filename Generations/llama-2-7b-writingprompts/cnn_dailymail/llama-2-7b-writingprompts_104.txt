<p>This is not the best place for this to be posted.</p><p> </p><p>The fact that she had a child after shrapnel was embedded in her uterus is amazing. The miracle is in how she managed to conceive at all, but especially in light of the fact that she was injured by an IED. She probably has PTSD, and will be dealing with it for the rest of her life.</p><p> </p><p>The fact that you think it's a good thing that this happened is mind boggling. If you have kids one day, think about what kind of world they would live in if people like you are in charge of public health.</p><p> </p><p>You should be ashamed.</p>
<p>Luckily, you’re not qualified to judge my children.</p><p> </p><p>And you’re probably wrong. This isn’t a good thing at all, it is an example of the way we have ruined our lives and those of future generations by going into Iraq on false pretenses and then staying in for no reason other than to kill more people. </p><p>You think this child is amazing? She should’ve never been born. And if she did, it was because you’re all insane. It’s a miracle that anyone is alive anywhere after the war in Iraq. There’s no such thing as a “miraculous birth” there, only miracles of survival.</p><p> </p><p>I hope this woman and her daughter live long lives because they were not supposed to be here. But it is a miracle that we have such idiots running our country now.</p><p> </p><p>I’m not talking about you, by the way.</p><p> </p><p>Just in case you missed it, she was blown up in Iraq and her womb was damaged. That should be enough for anyone to recognize this child is an abomination. It would have been better if her uterus had exploded while she was in the womb.</p><p> </p><p>Anyone who thinks this is a “miracle” needs to ask themselves, what did our nation do to deserve this?</p><p> </p><p>You think we’re all lucky because we weren’t killed. But that’s not true either. We were supposed to die in the thousands and leave our country alone.</p>
