A multi-millionaire property developer’s son has been arrested by police on suspicion of murdering a blonde waitress who disappeared from a celebrity nightclub in the early hours of last Thursday morning. The 20-year-old, whose identity is yet to be released, was detained after leaving his flat in a £130,000 Porsche Carrera GT. Officers swooped on his home in West London following a tip off from Scotland Yard’s Cold Case Unit at around 1am yesterday morning and found the Porsche parked outside the luxurious property. Detectives said that they had been “kept busy” in the last few days trying to identify the woman who was last seen being dropped off by her killer after working a shift at a celebrity club popular with Premiership footballers, soap stars and other high profile personalities from the entertainment industry. Her body has not yet been discovered but detectives are certain that she is dead as they believe the man they have in custody has murdered at least one other woman before. He was questioned for almost 17 hours yesterday morning about the disappearance of a blonde waitress, who had been seen leaving the club with another man just before dawn on Thursday morning. The man’s name is currently being kept under wraps but he will appear in court this morning as detectives prepare to charge him over the alleged murder and abduction of the young woman.
