Arsenal issued a statement saying they would consider how to prevent further incidents if there were any. Liverpool said it was "disappointing" but it would not affect the game.

### Reason

Fans of both teams have complained about the price of tickets for years and some Arsenal fans left at 12:50 GMT, with a Liverpool contingent following shortly afterwards. The move was criticised on social media by rival clubs' supporters as "disrespectful" and "unacceptable".

### Context

Liverpool won the match 3â€“1.
