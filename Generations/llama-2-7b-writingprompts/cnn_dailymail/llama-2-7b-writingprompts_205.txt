Senator Robert Menendez is innocent until proven guilty, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a dirty politician. 

### Reasoning:
This isn’t the first time Senator Menendez has been accused of bribery or improper conduct. In fact, there are many instances where the senator was found to have broken the law while in office. 

### Example:
In 2015, a jury ruled that he did not abuse his power by using public funds and resources to support a personal relationship with an underage girlfriend, but this isn’t the first time Senator Menendez has been accused of improper behavior. 

### Analysis:
The senator is a wealthy man himself, so it seems unlikely that he would need to accept gifts from others. There are many instances where the senator was found to have broken the law while in office. In addition, he also faced numerous allegations of sexual misconduct with underage girls. 

### Opinion:
The senator has been accused of bribery and improper conduct before, so it doesn’t seem like a stretch that he would be facing charges again now. 

### Conclusion:
Senator Menendez is innocent until proven guilty, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t a dirty politician. In fact, there are many instances where the senator was found to have broken the law while in office. It would be easy for him to accept gifts from wealthy donors or even engage in sexual misconduct with underage girls if he felt like it because he’s rich enough not to need them anyway.
