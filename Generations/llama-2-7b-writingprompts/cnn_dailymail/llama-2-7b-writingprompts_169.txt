The family of an Irish man shot dead in front of his children have said they believe he was “targeted”. Sean Cox (49) died after being attacked by Liverpool fan Steven Gerrard on October 16 last year. He suffered life-threatening injuries and later died from a brain injury at Alder Hey Children’s Hospital in Liverpool, where his wife Karen was treated for a broken nose. The Coxtons were visiting England to attend Liverpool’s Champions League fixture against Maribor when they were attacked outside Anfield before the match on October 16 last year. Police have said that Gerrard (33) and two other men assaulted Mr Cox as he left the ground. He suffered a serious head injury from which he never recovered, and his wife was treated for minor injuries at Royal Liverpool Hospital after the attack. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Mrs Cox said: “We do believe that there’s been some targeting involved with this.” She also claimed Mr Gerrard and his two friends had travelled to Anfield in a Mercedes-Benz car which they parked nearby before leaving the ground. The attack took place at around 4.30pm when they were walking back towards their hotel. “I was holding my son, I saw Sean collapse,” she said of the incident. “I remember that quite well – it’s a vivid memory – and then there were two guys behind me who picked him up and started to run.” Mrs Cox said she had not heard from Liverpool or Merseyside Police since her husband was attacked, but has now received an offer of compensation from Mr Gerrard’s legal team. “The response we have got is that he wants us to accept £100,000 and his apologies,” she said. The Coxtons have since returned home to Dublin with their two young children. Mrs Cox was given permission by Anfield chief executive Peter Moore not to attend the game in October due to fears for her safety. On November 23 last year a court heard that Gerrard, along with three other men, had been charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm (ABH). The Crown Prosecution Service has confirmed all four defendants – Gerrard, Paddy Connolly (18), Ian Brannan (25) and Joe Smith (34) – are due to appear at Liverpool Magistrates’ Court on Thursday. The charges relate to the alleged assault of Mr Cox by three other men. On January 9, a 45-year-old man from Warrington was arrested on suspicion of assault and released under investigation. Gerrard is believed to have moved back into his parents’ home in Formby after leaving Liverpool this summer. Mrs Cox said she had no plans to accept the offer from Mr Gerrard’s legal team as she wanted him prosecuted for murder. “I think he should be held accountable and that’s what I want,” she added. She has also expressed concerns about security at football matches following her husband’s death, while Liverpool fan Anthony Maguire, 38, from Manchester, died on December 21 after being attacked during a game between Burnley and Stoke City at Turf Moor in Burnley. A 40-year-old man from Glasgow has been charged with his murder.

### Discussion:

I am glad that he has the support of Liverpool FC, but I still don't think that compensation is enough for her to accept.
