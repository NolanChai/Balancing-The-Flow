**Responses: 5** [ Growth of global desertification (as a result of climate change), as well as human-made causes such as land clearing and mismanagement, have resulted in massive dust storms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust_storm) around the world in recent years.  The [ Dust Bowl](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2019/05/dust-bowl-megadrought-climate-change/) that occurred between 1931 and 1941, when drought and high winds in the American Prairie spread massive amounts of dust throughout the region (causing "black blizzards" in places like Chicago), was one such event. [ Another dust storm](https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/31/asia/tibetan-plateau-duststorms-intl/index.html) is occurring at the moment in Tibet, where high winds are bringing a sand-laden fog to large parts of China and India.  A [ report from the UN](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/climate-change-dust-storms-global-warming/) blames climate change for exacerbating such dust storms, which are predicted to become more frequent in the future.

### Clarification:

**Clarifications: 1** Dust storms in Tibet have nothing to do with human activity - they're a normal part of the weather cycle in that area.  The UN report on climate change and dust storms only refers to man-made causes of those storms.
