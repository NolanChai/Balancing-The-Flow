The smoke alarms went off, but people said they didn't smell anything unusual and that many had to wait for the subway car doors to open before they knew there was an issue. Firefighters responded to reports of a "burning smell" aboard a southbound 3 train at 42nd Street and Lexington Avenue at about 6:50 a.m., police said.

### Analysis:
Even after being evacuated, it would have been difficult for passengers to get out of the subway station at that time in the morning, because there were no nearby subway entrances and the area was already crowded with commuters. And though they had exited an underground train car, those who fled would still need to maneuver through a smoke-filled tunnel on the way to safety.
