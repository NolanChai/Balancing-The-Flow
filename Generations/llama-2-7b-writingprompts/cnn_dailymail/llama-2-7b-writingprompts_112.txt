Chelsea are the current Premier League Champions and they were made to work hard to see off a brave Stoke City side at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon. The Potters had been unbeaten for their previous three outings but were undone by two well-taken first half goals from Eden Hazard before John Terry's 53rd minute own goal leveled the score. But Chelsea went back to the top of the table with a late winner from substitute Andre Sch√ºrrle as Jose Mourinho's men extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to nine games.
