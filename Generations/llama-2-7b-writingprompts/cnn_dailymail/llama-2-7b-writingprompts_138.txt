I'll be rooting for the Filipino Manny Pacquiao to take home this title because he has the skills, the experience, the heart and the power to overcome Floyd Mayweathers many advantages in a fight. Floyd is the best defensive boxer of his generation but Pacquiao is arguably better so that wont be much of an issue. Floyd's hand speed and accuracy are second only to Manny but he does not have the experience of being at this level for as long. Mannys power will likely get him the knockout in the 9th or 10th round. But if it goes longer, I believe the experience and skill advantage will win out.
