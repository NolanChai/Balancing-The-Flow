While it is noble that the shopkeeper attempted to apprehend the thieves, the tragic loss of Prasanna ‘Nick’ Arulchelvam is due to his own actions. He was following the van with no regard for his own safety and fell from the vehicle. His death was his doing, not the action of a gang of thieves.
### Reasoning:
The shopkeeper died because he chased the thiefs who had stolen his money (or goods). But Nick did not steal anything; instead he chase after the thiefs which caused him to fall off the moving vehicle. Hence, Nick’s death is not an outcome of the theft committed by the thiefs.
