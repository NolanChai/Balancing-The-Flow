Arsene Wenger has revealed he only makes the final decision on his starting line-up on the morning of the match - and agonises over the selection all week. The Arsenal manager, who has taken charge of 156 matches in a row, does not even have an assistant to make up his mind for him until the morning of the game. "I wake up at seven o'clock on Saturday morning. I start to think about the team around eight o'clock," he said. Wenger added: "Then from 8am until the first team comes out, we are thinking and worrying a bit. We speak to the medical department, physiotherapy department. They give me a good idea of how everyone is doing." After Arsenal's last match against Liverpool, midfielder Mikel Arteta said Wenger "never sleeps" in his search for perfection and the Frenchman admitted he does not rest until the final decision has been taken. He added: "It depends on what we did during the week physically how much work you can put in to get ready, because your legs have to be ready for a good 90 minutes." Wenger admitted it is sometimes hard to make a call on who will play in central midfield after deciding which two strikers he wants up front. "The difficult one is to pick the number eights," he said. "Because we have a choice between Song and Denilson, Diaby or Ramsey." Wenger also revealed that Jack Wilshere could start his first Premier League match of the season this weekend after recovering from ankle surgery - but only if the midfielder is fit. "He's ready to be in the squad," said Wenger. "I don't know whether he's ready to play." Arsenal face Norwich City at Carrow Road on Saturday afternoon knowing victory would lift them to within two points of Premier League leaders Manchester United and five behind Chelsea, who have played one more game than Arsenal and Manchester United. Wenger admitted that Arsenal's rivals will be confident they can win the title this season because they are in good form - but he has told his players not to listen to them. "I believe every team can win it," added the Frenchman, who said he expects Norwich City manager Chris Hughton to field a strong side at Carrow Road after their 2-1 FA Cup triumph against Arsenal last weekend. He continued: "It's not just Chelsea and Manchester United, there are three or four teams with good momentum who will take it up until the end of the season. It depends on the moment where you get a little bit tired or confidence goes down. You can lose belief in yourself, because you think the other team is strong. That's why I believe every game has its value and we have to prepare our minds to go there with a good attitude."
### Wenger says he's not getting any closer to signing an elusive striker: 
Wenger said that he had spoken about this transfer window on several occasions. He said: "We are in the process of recruitment as always at our level, where you look for quality and quantity to strengthen your squad." The Arsenal boss has been linked with moves for Valencia striker Roberto Soldado, Marseille's Andre-Pierre Gignac and Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema. Wenger said he was not going to be drawn on any of the players. He continued: "You never talk about a transfer. You are in the process of recruitment and that's what you say. It's always like that at our level, but we are still focussed on the performance this season." The Arsenal manager said he did not expect to make any signings before January: "I believe it is more likely you do business in the summer than at the moment because people will have their thoughts on what they need to prepare for next season. It is always easier to buy and sell in the summer, but it depends also if one of your players can go out to strengthen another team." Arsenal are currently without injured strikers Nicklas Bendtner, Gervinho, Marouane Chamakh, Lukasz Fabianski and Theo Walcott. Wenger said he was confident that Thomas Vermaelen would be fit for the visit of Norwich City on Saturday after the defender suffered a minor hamstring injury in training this week. He also confirmed that Laurent Koscielny had been given permission to join up with France ahead of next month's friendly against the Netherlands at Wembley.
### Arsenal have their first ever manager from outside England: 
Wenger said he was proud of his achievements since taking charge in September 1996, when he was appointed as successor to Bruce Rioch. "I feel pride because I built a team here that is competitive every year," he said. "The team is strong enough to win trophies and it's been the same for the last eight years." Wenger has been linked with a number of jobs since signing his new two-year contract at Arsenal in November 2011, but said he had no intention of leaving his current club. "I always say I have one contract here so there is no other option," said Wenger, who led Arsenal to the double in 2002 - their only major trophies since he took charge at Highbury. Wenger has never won the league title during his time in north London, but was full of praise for Chelsea boss and former Barcelona chief Jose Mourinho, who is leading the Premier League table this season after beating Manchester United on Sunday. "He is a good manager," said Wenger. "I have always enjoyed his football, I've always admired his intelligence and he has been successful everywhere he has gone." But he was not keen to get drawn into a debate over how much money Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich had spent compared with Manchester City boss Roberto Mancini. He said: "We never speak about the finances of clubs - it's like having your private life in front of everybody. It is a decision you make if you want to do that." Wenger has been criticised for his policy of playing youth players, but said he was determined to nurture talent at Arsenal. "I believe we have a good structure and I can go on about that all day because I'm proud of the way we work with our young players," added Wenger. "Our philosophy is to give them time."
### The Gunners are now unbeaten in 10 league games: 
Wenger said he was happy to see his side keep up their good form at Carrow Road, where they were beaten 4-2 in the FA Cup on Thursday. He added: "We've lost one game since we lost 3-0 [against Spurs], so I'm very pleased with that." Arsenal have now won five league games and drawn four in their last nine matches, but Wenger said his side were still far from convincing. He said: "I think you can be a little bit frustrated at the moment because we are not untouchable, even though we won four of our last six Premier League games." The Arsenal boss admitted that Chelsea's win on Sunday had put his side under pressure to take all three points this weekend. But he said: "We have a chance to do it again and we need to be ready for it. We know the other team is strong but we have shown that we can do well there, too."
### Wenger has signed a new deal at Arsenal which runs until 2017: 
Wenger, who signed his first professional contract with Arsenal in 1984 aged only 17, said he was thrilled to have agreed terms on a long-term stay. "I'm happy," he told Sky Sports News. "It's been an emotional day because it took some time but finally I've signed and I'm delighted with the contract." Wenger said he did not regret signing his old deal in 2008 when he was linked with a move to Barcelona. He added: "I never had any regret, even if at times you can have doubts or worries because people always look at your last transfer window and that's all they talk about. You think 'is this enough', but I didn't have any regrets." Wenger said he would not be signing any new players before the transfer window closes in January, but added: "We will make an effort to strengthen during the summer because we need to maintain our momentum and I believe in what we are doing. We can do better than we have done so far, especially in the Champions League where we've been knocked out early."
### Wenger says Arsenal are ready for their clash with Norwich City: 
The Frenchman said his side had prepared well for the match despite suffering a heavy defeat against the Canaries on Thursday night. He said: "I believe we are in good shape and I have no problem to play our next game because we are not far from what we want to achieve this year." Wenger added that he did not feel his side had been poor against Norwich, but admitted they were suffering with injuries at the moment after a heavy run of matches. "We
