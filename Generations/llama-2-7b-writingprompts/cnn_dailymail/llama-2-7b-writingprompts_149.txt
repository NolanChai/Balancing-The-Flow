**In the beginning... **there was a man who decided that he wanted to be an English major after seeing how many girls read and loved the books he'd been assigned for class, but had no idea how to write well in English. So, this guy joined a creative writing group on campus and the members decided to make some money by selling their works at book fairs, where they'd meet publishers. They got to know one of those publishers rather well. He gave them good feedback and they grew more confident about their work. One day, he approached them and said that his company had been getting a lot of submissions recently from people who were trying to break into writing and wanted to see if they'd like to be published. So, the guy went home and wrote this story, but didn't have much confidence in it -- after all, this was just some English major and he didn't think that anyone would want to publish it. He told his friend from the creative writing group about what had happened though, and she encouraged him. She read it over a few times and thought that he had written something special. So, they took it to their boss at the book fairs, who liked it as well. Then, this English major started receiving rejections from publishers -- "it's just not good enough," said one, "the characters are bland" said another, "you've got a lot of work to do" said another still. But he didn't give up and continued revising the manuscript until his friend read it again. She loved it and told him that she was sure they'd get some offers soon. He finally took her advice and sent out another batch of copies, and this time he got a contract from one of those publishers who had rejected it before -- they offered to pay $100 for the rights to his story! So, when you see that book on your shelf or hear about how much someone paid to get an autographed copy, remember the effort that went into getting there. It wasn't easy and it didn't happen overnight like some people might think, but with perseverance anything can be achieved.**

### Explanation:

There are a lot of words in this response, so I'll break them down here by line. The first line is a reference to the Bible and how it was a very Good Book. It then moves on to say that while this Catholic had read from cover to cover before Holy Week (which occurs during Lent), she hadn't read it in quite some time. So, since there were many people reading the Bible throughout Lent as part of their devotions or as part of a study group at church, she decided to finally get around to reading it again after all these years. The next line is another reference to the Bible -- specifically, Genesis 1:1 -- which says "In the beginning God created the heavens and earth." This response then goes on to explain that this Catholic wasn't actually an expert at writing in English either though; she had only been taking creative writing classes as part of her major in English. However, one day someone came up with a plan: they would sell their works at book fairs where publishers might see them! So, these writers joined a group and met lots of different people who could help them out with getting published. The next line mentions that the guy (who is not specified) was able to get into one such group because he'd read so many books about writing, but never really felt confident in his own abilities as an author. He then went home and wrote this story for his group members, who thought it had potential. They told him that they could take it around to their boss at the book fairs since she had been getting a lot of submissions lately -- maybe her company would want to publish it too? The next few lines talk about all the rejections he got from publishers until his friend finally read through this manuscript again. She thought that it was good enough for publication as well, so they went ahead and sent out copies around town. This time though, one of those publishers who had rejected his story before decided to give him a contract instead! So when you see people posting pictures or talking about how much money someone paid for their book on Instagram or Facebook (or whatever else), remember that there were lots of rejections before they finally got published -- it wasn't easy at first and took a lot of time, but eventually success came along after all the hard work.
