I think so! I had this idea in mind that the team would be able to perform better than last season because we have a new manager and an experienced one as well, but then there was a lot of talk about the fact that the players were unhappy. I'm not sure what caused all of these problems but it seems like a very strange time for them to be talking about this. It's so close to the end of the season as well and they really need to put in some good performances if they want to stay up. If they fail then there is always next year when we will be able to watch Southampton football online again, but I think that it might just be worth giving them a chance to improve this season.
