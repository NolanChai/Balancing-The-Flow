Sipping a glass of glorious red wine which has been carefully aged in a hand-crafted oak barrel is my idea of heaven. But until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste there was to shell out for it at a pricey restaurant. And even then, you could never be sure if the wine had actually been stored in a real oak barrel or not. Luckily all that has changed! My new book shows how you can make your own wooden oak barrels and store your favourite wine inside them for free. It also details what kind of wine pairs best with certain types of food so it's the perfect companion to my upcoming cookbook, *Pairs With That*.
