His instinct to cling onto his son's stroller is a prime example of the emotional and physical shock that followed the bombing. The Boston Marathon bombings were a series of two explosions in the city of Boston, Massachusetts on April 15, 2013 during the Marathon's annual Patriots Day celebration. The first explosion killed three people and injured 264 others. A man identified as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (from his Twitter handle @J_tsar) is accused of detonating the second bomb, killing an additional person and injuring 17 more. After the attacks, Tsarnaev's older brother Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police the following evening; Dzhokhar surrendered later that day, hiding in a boat in Watertown. The FBI named him as one of the suspected bombers, along with his deceased brother Tamerlan. He is currently awaiting trial on 30 charges related to the bombings.

The bombs were improvised explosive devices consisting of pressure cooker bombs packed with explosives and ball bearings and shrapnel placed in backpacks that were detonated near the finish line, killing three spectators. The bombings also injured 264 people, at least 17 of them seriously.

The FBI is investigating whether there was a radicalization process or an ideology behind the attackers' motives, though no evidence has been found to prove such theories thus far. At this time, the Tsarnaevs are not known to have been linked with any specific terrorist groups, and may have acted alone.

On April 17, 2013 Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev was charged with using a weapon of mass destruction in relation to the bombing (Federal law is clear: No one can make a "weapon of mass destruction" for any reason.) and he may face the death penalty if convicted, though it would be up to jurors whether or not to sentence him. He has pleaded not guilty, but has yet to enter a formal statement.
