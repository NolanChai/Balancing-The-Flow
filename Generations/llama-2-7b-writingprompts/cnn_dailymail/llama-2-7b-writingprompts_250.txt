The Tesla Model S P85D's 'insane mode' may be fast, but a new electric car by Drive eO is set to be even faster. The Latvian firm is currently developing a one megawatt electric race car to compete in the European Electric Car Championship (EEC) next year and wants it to have a top speed of 200mph. To achieve this they'll use four separate motors - two for each axle. The motors will be able to produce around one megawatt each, making the car a total of four megawatts.
