The 48-cap international, who joined Atlético from hometown side Sevilla in 2011, has netted five times this term. However he is yet to find the back of the net since January 15 and could be available for around £17m in the summer. The Portuguese boss is hoping to strengthen his midfield options after it was confirmed that Frank Lampard will move to Manchester City at the end of the season. As a result, Mourinho is eyeing a replacement and Koke has emerged as one of his top targets. He would also be reunited with former teammate Diego Costa who he worked alongside during their time together at the Vicente Calderon Stadium. The Portugal international has had a superb season in all competitions scoring 14 goals in 33 appearances. However, it is thought that he will leave Chelsea in the summer with reports suggesting that Atletico could make an official bid for the player later this year.
