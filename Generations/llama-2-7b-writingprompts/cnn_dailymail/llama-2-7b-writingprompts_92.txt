`The man who took my dogs is now walking through the streets of London with my dogs.` I'm so angry! I'd give anything for my boys back, but they could be anywhere. I can only pray that he hasn't taken them to some horrible dog fighting ring. I was really close to those dogs. They are like a part of my family, and we've been through a lot together - from the death of my wife three years ago to me trying to get my life back on track. When Marley went missing I felt sick with worry, but when he ran away again after an hour it was Mitzy who took it hardest. She's just nine months old and had never been lost before. Now she won't stop barking and crying and I know that is down to him. The dog thief snatched them in the street outside our house. We'd left them playing on a lead in the front garden when we heard the front doorbell ring. When I opened it, there was this man who told me he wanted to adopt my boys and asked if they could come with him. It was too late by then because the two of them were already gone. It took us an hour to track down the police, but they have no leads on our boys' location. It's heartbreaking for my kids, who are devastated that Marley and Mitzy won't be coming home. I'm just worried about what will happen to them now.` - Owner David Lacey
