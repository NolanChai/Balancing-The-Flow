### Discussion:
I am using NLTK word_tokenize and nltk_tagger in order to extract the information out of sentences that I want. For instance, I used nltk.pos_tag() to tag all the nouns as 'NN' for name, adjectives as 'JJ' for year, pronouns as 'PRP', and verbs as 'VB'. After I have extracted all the information from my sentences using word_tokenize or nltk_tagger, then I can create a list of dictionaries out of these words that have been tagged. And finally, I will use dict.fromkeys() to extract the data that I want out of this dictionary and store it in another dictionary.
### Notes:
I have made some mistakes with the coding because this is my first time doing such a project using NLTK. There are some punctuations in these sentences which made me confused with the tagging. For example, when I had to extract 'The' from the word 'The 2002 World Cup winner' and then I wanted to tag it as 'NN'. I was not able to do so because I am still learning about NLTK.
