The announcement by British taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook that he intends to represent Moldova at this year’s Olympics in Rio has sparked a backlash on social media. Cook, 24, who was overlooked for the Great Britain team after winning gold at London 2012 and silver at Glasgow two years ago, confirmed his decision to compete under Moldovan colours on Tuesday afternoon. His announcement followed speculation that he had been refused a place in Team GB because of a change in Olympic rules over whether fighters can hold multiple passports – with Cook’s father having moved from Moldova to the UK before his birth.
