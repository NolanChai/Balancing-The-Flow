Everything they say about the Maldives is true. The sea is breathtakingly cerulean blue, the sand as soft as flour. The air is so clear it feels like there might be a fourth dimension. The view from the room was one of the best I have ever seen in my life. You could see all the way out to the horizon in every direction!
