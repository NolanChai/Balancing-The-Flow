> **[ P ]** [ /r/soccer ] 1029 - Aaron Lennon has been charged with sexual assault by touching in Leeds last weekend after a waitress claimed he touched her inappropriately at a club. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it had decided there is sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest to charge him. The 29-year-old, who has been on loan from Everton at Burnley this season, will appear at Leeds Magistrates' Court on Monday. A statement from the CPS said: "Following an investigation into a complaint of sexual assault by touching in Leeds on Saturday 16 February 2019, the Crown Prosecution Service has authorised the police to charge Aaron Lennon with sexual assault by touching." The woman claims she was in the toilet at the Cocoon nightclub when he pushed his way into the cubicle and began grooming her. She then says he touched her breast and tried to remove her clothes before fleeing when he realised others were trying to get him to leave, according to reports. Lennon denied any wrongdoing in a statement released earlier this month. The incident happened as his girlfriend Tiaan was due to give birth to their second child. It is believed she had been left behind at the couple's home while he went out for the night. https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/28/aaron-lennon-charged-with-sexual-assault-in-leeds
