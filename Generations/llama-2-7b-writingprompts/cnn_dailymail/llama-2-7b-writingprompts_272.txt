A third SEAL was killed in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan on Monday, the Navy said Tuesday. The three deaths occurred over seven days in two different countries and have prompted calls for an investigation into how so many of the nation's most elite troops died while training or operating overseas. The Navy did not provide details about Mar, whose career was shortened when he failed to perform during a basic SEAL training course last year. A statement on Monday from the Naval Special Warfare Command said it would look into the circumstances surrounding Mar's death. Navy officials declined comment Tuesday beyond Lloyd's initial statement that Mar died at a pool in Great Lakes, Ill., where he was receiving medical treatment for injuries suffered during training in Virginia. The 27-year-old from Woodbridge, Va., joined the Navy as an intelligence specialist but later became one of the first members of a new SEAL specialty to train dog handlers. He had served a tour in Afghanistan before becoming ill and being sent to the Illinois base for treatment. Lt. Col. Rob Bockholt told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Mar was pronounced dead at about 8:30 p.m. Monday after he had been transferred from Naval Support Activity Great Lakes in a life-flight helicopter to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. He did not have further information, and the hospital could not comment. The other SEAL who died on Monday was identified by Navy officials as Petty Officer 2nd Class Stephen M. Clark of Woodbridge, Va., who served as a master at arms specialist aboard the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz in the Persian Gulf region. He was assigned to an East Coast-based SEAL team and had deployed with it three times, including twice for Afghanistan tours last year and this year. Navy officials said Clark was on his fifth deployment when he was killed along with a civilian contractor during a training flight in Afghanistan. Both of the victims were aboard an MH-53 Sea Dragon helicopter that crashed about 25 miles southwest of Camp Leatherneck, Afghanistan's busiest U.S. base, military officials said Monday evening. Clark had joined the Navy in March 2005 and was promoted to petty officer second class last month. He previously served as a hospital corpsman with the Fleet Marine Force before joining the SEAL unit in February 2007, according to his official biography. Mar's death occurred during what is known as "Hell Week," the final phase of basic SEAL training at Coronado, Calif., where candidates are required to run long distances while carrying heavy packs and endure other physical tests of their strength. He had been one of 140 members of SEAL Team 2's Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL class 255 who started training June 27 but failed to make it through the final phase, said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Dahlen, a Navy spokesman at Coronado. The military rarely discusses what happens to people dropped from basic training courses for special forces or other elite units. According to a copy of the course description obtained by The Associated Press, candidates are required to pass a swim test, run at least two miles and then perform five pushups in two minutes, five pull-ups in two minutes, and 10 sit-ups in two minutes. Candidates must also pass a three-mile ocean swim with fins within the hour. The course has an overall failure rate of about 45 percent; some of those dropped are discharged from the Navy because they don't meet standards for fitness or mental toughness, Dahlen said. Other dropped candidates often go on to serve in other areas of the military and return to training at a later date. The Navy also declined comment Tuesday about how long Mar had been in training. A Facebook page under Mar's name showed he was a 2008 graduate of Garfield High School in Woodbridge, where he was an offensive guard on the varsity football team. He joined the Navy four months later and trained as a hospital corpsman before becoming a SEAL. His bio at the military biography website VetFriends says Mar had volunteered to serve with SEAL Team 2 after being selected in December 2009. The same day that Clark's death was announced, his family told WUSA-TV in Washington, D.C., that they were waiting for answers about what happened on Monday night but were confident the Navy would provide them. "I know they did everything humanly possible to save him," his sister-in-law, Liz Clark, said through tears. The Clarks are also planning a funeral service in northern Virginia later this week or early next week, and have set up an account at www.paypal.com/sendmoney?cmd=_xclick&business=pennystocksandoptions@gmail.com.
