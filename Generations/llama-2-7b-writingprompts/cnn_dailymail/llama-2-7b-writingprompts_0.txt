(CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe, now being forced to take sides on issues they'd rather not touch. But most of all, I see signs of a revolution on my front lawn, where for 12 years we have lived without a neighbor. So far, the neighbors around us are too busy fighting over who has to shovel snow in our driveway to worry about the state of the republic, and our new neighbors across the street (whose house sold last month) seem perfectly content to let us keep our lawn as wild and untamed as we like.
