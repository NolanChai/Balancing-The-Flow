The La Liga action returned this weekend as Barcelona hosted Celta Vigo in an intriguing encounter at Camp Nou. Luis Enrique’s men had to win their match in order to close the gap on leaders Real Madrid, who were due to play against Granada later that afternoon. A draw would have suited Los Blancos perfectly, and the hosts knew that they had to get three points if they were to keep up with Cristiano Ronaldo’s men at the top of the table. It was Barcelona who took the lead in the first half as Sergi Roberto’s low effort from outside of the area found its way into the net. Celta Vigo continued to look a threat going forward, and they were level soon after the restart thanks to Fabian Orellana. Luis Suarez scored his 10th goal for Barcelona in their match with Sporting Gijon last weekend and he had a chance to open his account for the season on Sunday but was unable to convert from close range. Lionel Messi took over penalty duties after Neymar left the field injured, and he hit the post after finding himself through on goal. The hosts looked as if they might have been made to rue those missed chances when Fabian Orellana struck for Celta Vigo again, but Barca responded with an equaliser in added time as Jordi Alba’s cross found Neymar who scored at the back post. 2-2 seemed a fair result overall, and it is sure to give the leaders some encouragement heading into their game against Granada next weekend.
