The following is a transcription of a video recording of a phone conversation between a man and woman in an automobile. The man is driving the car. **Man:** Are you there? **Woman:** Yes, I am here. I'm in the driveway now. You just got here. Is this your first time here? **Man:** It certainly is. I don't know what to expect. It was my wife that brought me up here and now she has gone off to play golf. She said I could have whatever I wanted so I'm a little bit nervous, but it will be all right I think. **Woman:** That's good. Your wife seems like a very nice person. **Man:** Oh yes, she is wonderful. We met in college and we got married after graduation. She's never been unfaithful to me before tonight so this should be interesting for her. I mean, it will be different since we have only done things together but... well, we are both kind of curious to see how she feels about having sex with another man, although she says that I am the best lover in the world and I know that's true because she always cries when we make love. So this should be fun for her too. **Woman:** Well, have you ever had sex before? **Man:** Oh yes... many times with my wife. That's why I'm so nervous. I want it to be perfect for her tonight. But maybe the reason that she has always been faithful is because she never had a chance to try anything else and now, after having sex with you, I will probably have to make an appointment to see a doctor about getting my prostate checked out or something like that. **Woman:** Well, if you're nervous then we won't take too long so maybe you can still go play golf with your wife before she gets back from the golf course. How old are you? **Man:** I'm 50 years old but I look much younger than that because I work out in the gym every day and my wife has always said that I am very handsome and attractive to other women so I think she will be pleased with this evening. **Woman:** Well, tell me if you want to stop for a while or anything like that. And it's not too late. It can wait until tomorrow morning. You don't have to do all of it at once. **Man:** I think we should just get started now. After all, my wife told me that she would rather go out with her friends than stay here and watch me have sex with another woman so we may as well do what she wants because... you know what? Maybe this is a mistake for both of us because if things don't work out then we could be in big trouble when she finds out later tonight or tomorrow morning. But I think it will be okay, right? **Woman:** You want to go inside now? It's starting to get dark out there and I would rather not have anyone see us together here at my house. **Man:** Okay, let me help you up first and then we can walk in the front door. But please don't look at me too much or else you might start thinking about kissing me again before all of this is over tonight because that would make everything worse for both of us if my wife finds out what happened here later today or tomorrow morning... Okay, let me just take off these pants now so that we can go inside and have some fun together. **Woman:** You know, I've always wanted to see someone naked before but never had the chance because there were never any men around when I lived at my parents' house until now... Do you mind if I kiss you again? **Man:** No problem with that and I can tell that you like what you are seeing because your hands seem very busy right now too. **Woman:** Oh yes, they're moving quickly over my body and... [They both laugh] Okay, let me help you undress now so we can get this over with before it gets dark out there again tonight or tomorrow morning... Let me just take off these pants now so that we can go inside together and have some fun later today or tomorrow morning. **Man:** You know what? Maybe I should put these back on because you seem very nervous right now which makes me think about what might happen if my wife finds out tonight or tomorrow morning. That would really be bad for both of us so maybe we shouldn't do anything until later today or tomorrow morning... Okay, let me just take off these pants now and then we can go inside together and have some fun before the sun goes down again here in California later tonight or tomorrow morning... Please don't look at me too much because that might cause you to kiss me again which would make everything worse for both of us if my wife finds out what happened today or tomorrow morning. And we can do whatever we want inside without having to worry about getting caught by someone outside so let's just get started now... Okay, let me help you up first and then we can walk in the front door together later tonight or tomorrow morning. **Woman:** Yes, I would like that very much because it seems like such a waste of time waiting here for my husband when he isn't even home yet so let's just get started now before it gets dark outside again... Okay, let me take off these pants now and then we can walk in the front door together later tonight or tomorrow morning. **Man:** Well, if you don't mind taking a shower with me first because I know that you would like to see everything that I have under my clothes as soon as possible so let's just get started now before it gets dark outside again... Okay, let me help you up first and then we can walk in the front door together later tonight or tomorrow morning. **Woman:** Yes, please do that right away because I need to go inside too because my husband might be home any minute so he would know what happened here today if he saw us walking out of this house together later tonight or tomorrow morning... Okay, let me help you take off those clothes now and then we can walk in the front door together later tonight or tomorrow morning. **Man:** Well, I think that's enough for one night so let's just go inside and get dressed again before it gets dark outside here later today or tomorrow morning... Okay, please take off all of these clothes now because they make me feel uncomfortable if you keep touching them like this anymore which might cause us to kiss each other again too which would be bad for both of us since my wife will probably find out about everything that happened here tonight or tomorrow morning... Okay, let me just take off these clothes now so we can get started before it gets dark outside later today or tomorrow morning. **Woman:** Yes, please do that right away because my husband might be home any minute if he sees us walking out of this house together like this later tonight or tomorrow morning...
