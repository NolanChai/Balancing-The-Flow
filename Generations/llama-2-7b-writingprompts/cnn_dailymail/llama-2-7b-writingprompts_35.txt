Nike have released the 2013/14 Manchester United home shirt and it’s… well, let’s just say that you won’t find many supporters who share your opinion. The Red Devils unveiled their latest home kit on Thursday night in a surprise move. Fans had been expecting to see the kit at the weekend, with a release date of June 1st planned. But instead Nike took the opportunity to debut it themselves and the shirt looks like an exact replica of last year’s effort. The Red Devils have never deviated too far from their traditional home shirt design, but there are some small changes this time around. The white collar has been removed with a blue trim added instead, whilst the sponsor has also been moved to the centre and a diagonal pattern is used as opposed to the usual vertical. But that’s about all that’s changed for 2013/14. “The Manchester United home kit represents one of the most iconic jersey designs in football,” Nike VP of Global Football Marketing, Charlie Denson told Sky Sports. “As we prepare to kick-off our second decade with this incredible club, it’s exciting for us to present a kit that both pays homage to its storied heritage and reflects the new era of United.” Manchester United are currently in negotiations over a new deal with adidas. The German sportswear brand have held the rights to make and distribute their home shirt since 2014/15 but it’s likely that Nike will continue to provide them for some time yet as part of a transitional period.
