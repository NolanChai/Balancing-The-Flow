Due to their age they are not allowed into these park unless there is special permission. Most of them live a very hard life and are just trying to survive in one of the most difficult countries on earth. These are children who have never had even a sniff at an ice cream or a cake. They do not get much more than bread, butter and water each day as their parents work long hours and often days. Many of these slum children have never been to a park before, so the idea of going one for the first time is something that would blow there mind!
