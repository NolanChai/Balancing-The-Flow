This is a great example of using your own resources to avoid costly outsourcing of editing! A good tool for this task is an online sentence scramble, which lets you input text and then shuffle the words around. [Here](https://www.wordshaker.net/sentence-shuffler) is a link that has worked well for me in the past. Once you have the sentences shuffled up, you can try reading each one out loud to see if they make sense or not. This should take care of most of the minor issues.

### Recommendations:

I would suggest making more of a point on how the gunshot wound was treated (it was treated by paramedics) and also what type of medical facility the police took the suspect to after capture (an ER). This will give more context around what happened during the arrest. You should also look for some verbs that have a stronger sense of action, like "took" instead of "was captured."
