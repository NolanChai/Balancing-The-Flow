England captain Alastair Cook admitted that the loss of Jonathan Trott is a “massive blow”. “We are not looking for excuses, but it’s very hard to accept what has happened,” he said. “The ball had wickets in it and we weren’t playing as well as we should have done.” He added: “I don’t know if we were over-confident, but I do think it was a big disappointment. We have lost the first Test match of an Ashes series on our home soil. We knew that Australia are very good here and we needed to play better than we did to win.” Cook also said he was not interested in talking about whether any individual players or tactics had failed, saying: “I think we got ourselves into a position where we were too relaxed at one stage, which is disappointing. But I don’t want to start pointing fingers because that does no good for anybody and it doesn’t help our performance going forward.”

### Analysis

Jonathan Agnew wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “You can’t put this defeat down to one man but if Alastair Cook is to succeed as captain, Trott will need to be there. England are a more settled team with him in the side, but they also need him on top of his game.” Peter Roebuck wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald: “The absence of Jonathan Trott for this series has been keenly felt by England’s batsmen and their supporters. They were all looking forward to seeing him back at the crease and they would have enjoyed watching a man who is so skilled that he can even make a bad pitch look good.”

### Report:

The first day of the opening test between England and Australia saw both teams score 235 runs. Aaron Finch was caught behind off Stuart Broad, before Joe Root also departed to Chris Rogers who took two wickets in the innings. Ian Bell joined forces with Alastair Cook in a stand that lasted just one ball as he too was bowled out by Nathan Lyon. Michael Clarke joined Ricky Ponting in the middle of the crease and both batsmen survived until close, before Clarke was caught off Broad. Ben Stokes scored his first test century to bring England up to 235 runs at lunch with Root on nought.
