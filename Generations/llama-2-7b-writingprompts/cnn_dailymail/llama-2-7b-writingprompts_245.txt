I'm not really sure what to make of this article, I mean, I agree that people should know better than to just stop their car on the tracks but then again, how often do you see a train coming? The only thing that really concerns me is that they were out there for 10 minutes. It took about 4 hours from when it was reported to when the police arrived and confirmed the deaths. I guess the moral of this story is if someone says not to cross the tracks, don't even think about it because you could be dead before you get across.
