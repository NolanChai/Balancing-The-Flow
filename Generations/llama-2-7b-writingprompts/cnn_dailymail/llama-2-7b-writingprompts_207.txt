The man whose reign has been marked by extravagance, corruption and racial discrimination was elected in a secret vote of his countrymen in December 1977, shortly after a bloody clampdown on the anti-apartheid movement. It took him just one year to draw up a constitution, which granted him sweeping powers and control over both parliament and the courts. But it was not until he made his first state visit to Moscow in May 1980 that he finally realised his ambition of building an independent nation. In Russia he met Mikhail Gorbachev who, unlike the previous Soviet leaders, welcomed him as a brother African leader. In exchange for Zimbabwe's recognition of the USSR, Moscow signed a friendship treaty with Harare and pledged to supply it with cheap arms. The deal was cemented in February 1983 during an historic visit by Mr Mugabe, where he met President Gorbachev at his dacha in Peredelkino, outside Moscow, and then addressed a crowd of more than 50,000 people gathered in Red Square. The event was broadcast live on Soviet television in a move that highlighted the close ties between the two nations. But it was also an indication of Mr Mugabe's popularity within South Africa as he had been invited to Moscow at the same time as Nelson Mandela, then serving a life sentence in Robben Island jail. Both men were released from prison on the same day - February 11, 1990 - and it was a meeting between them two years later which would bring an end to white rule in South Africa. But it is Mr Mugabe's relationship with Moscow that has been his most enduring alliance over the past two decades. He received one of the last Soviet leaders, Boris Yeltsin, during a state visit to Harare in January 1992 and Mr Yeltsin told him he had become "an example for us all". In recent years Zimbabwe has also been used as a convenient gateway into Africa by Moscow - with Russia's foreign minister making the journey in April this year. Last month, Mr Mugabe's wife Grace attended her own state dinner at the Kremlin hosted by President Medvedev to celebrate Russian-Zimbabwean ties. In return the Zanu PF leader has been an unwavering supporter of Moscow and its interests in Africa and this week he made it clear that his country's links with Russia would never be broken - even as the West continues to isolate him. It is a policy Mr Mugabe reiterated during an interview in March when he accused western governments, including Britain and the US, of trying to "isolate" his regime over its human rights record. In a thinly-veiled threat the Zimbabwean leader added that his country would not abandon its close relationship with Russia. "Russia is our friend," he said, warning that the West should beware if they tried to alienate Moscow from Africa. He has made similar statements on numerous occasions but the latest comments came after the United States announced a freeze on $850 million in aid for Zimbabwe over allegations of vote fraud and intimidation during elections last year. "They have now cut off all money to us, they have denied me access to them," he said. "What do I do? The Western world is not a happy family." Mr Mugabe has previously told the BBC that Zimbabwe's links with Russia are a "marriage for life" and that President Medvedev was "the only person who would talk to me, shake my hand, look at me in the eye".
