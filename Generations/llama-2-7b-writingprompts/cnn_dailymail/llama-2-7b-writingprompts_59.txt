It's a big risk, but I just hope Manny and Floyd come to their senses because the fight is in Las Vegas. If you look at the crowd there, they are mostly for Pacquiao. I think both fighters can earn $50m each from this one night. For that amount of money, it's crazy to go down that route and lose everything.
