Scottish comedian Limmy has horrified fans by posting a video of a massive spider crawling out of his mouth and inching its way across his face. The 38-year-old, who starred in the BBC comedy Limmy's Show on Comedy Central, uploaded the clip to Twitter with the caption: "It's that time of year." In the video he can be seen sitting up in bed and talking to the camera before a large spider emerges from his mouth and crawls onto the pillow next to him. He then reaches over to touch the spider, which is about the size of a human fist, and continues filming as it begins walking around on the pillow. He then grabs a cup and douses the creature with water, before the camera zooms in on the arachnid's legs moving rapidly through the fluid. Limmy wrote: "I'm going to leave that up there for a while now... It was funny. I'm just kidding! The spider is fine." He later added: "Was trying to think of something else for Twitter and thought what better way than a massive spider coming out of my mouth." He has since deleted the tweet and replaced it with another clip showing him holding an axe. Limmy was born Stuart Campbell in Glasgow but he left school at 14 after being expelled from several schools for behaviour issues before embarking on his comedy career. The comic, who also writes music, is best known as a YouTube sensation where he posts bizarre videos of himself talking to the camera about a range of subjects including religion, politics and Scottish stereotypes.
