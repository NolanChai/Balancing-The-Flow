You have to be kidding me?! You are going to make a mockery out of this man's death because you can't keep it together enough for one day without ripping him apart on national TV? This is unbelievable... This is how the media works now. They twist things around, and when they can't get away with their agenda, they call names or say something that just makes them look bad. It is a shameful moment in America where people are being bullied by this very same "media" who claims to be on their side.
