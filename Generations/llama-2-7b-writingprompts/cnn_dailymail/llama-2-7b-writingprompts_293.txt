The British Security Industry Association (BSIA) has expressed its concern over a growing trend of pickpockets from Chilean gangs operating in central London. The BSIA stated that these gangs are able to use various methods and distractions, including "choking" or "fear attacks", which see victims grabbed around the throat before being robbed of their money. These tactics, as well as techniques such as feigning illness in front of a victim, have been used by gangs from other areas such as the Ukraine and Morocco to target unsuspecting shoppers in London. According to the Metropolitan Police, gangs will often follow wealthy tourists around shopping districts like Bond Street or Oxford Street before making an approach when their guard is down. A spokesman for the BSIA has called on retail outlets and shopping centres in central London to better protect shoppers from pickpockets by adopting anti-theft strategies such as CCTV cameras and security guards. The association also urged members of the public to be aware of their surroundings and avoid being distracted during shopping trips.
