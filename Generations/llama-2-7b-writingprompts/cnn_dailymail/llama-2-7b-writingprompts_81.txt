The question asks you about a senior aid (not an aid) who resigns and to write the story of his arrest. In this case, he did not commit any other crimes that would be included in the story other than soliciting prostitution. You do need to write some things before this paragraph because it does not give much information about him or her.

### Explanation:
I'm not sure what you're doing here. You just kind of have to state who you are, why they resigned (in this case, he was arrested for soliciting prostitution), and write the story. No need for an introductory paragraph unless you have something really juicy that happened before his arrest.
