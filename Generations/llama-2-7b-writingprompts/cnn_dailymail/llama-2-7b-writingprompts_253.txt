I think that it's a great idea for the show because it shows you what can happen if you don't do anything or go against the laws. It also is making people aware of the consequences so they may be able to stop things like this from happening in their own country. I think that the show will have more impact on Indonesians than Australians, but I believe that it will also have an effect on Australians too because we're not that far away from them so if they are being affected by something then we might as well be affected as well. The reason why this story is important is because it could happen anywhere at any time and anyone could do anything and there really isn't much you can do about it.
