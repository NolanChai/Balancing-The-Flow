The 37-year-old will be hoping he can inspire his team to a victory against Fulham which would take them above Newcastle and into ninth place in the Premier League table, but the manager does not believe that is the key to securing European qualification.
Instead, Hughes believes it is Stoke’s inability to pick up points on their travels – with just two wins from ten games – which has put them at risk of missing out on a place in next season’s Europa League competition.
“Tom Jones was never our biggest problem,” said the 48-year-old, who recently signed a new deal at the Britannia Stadium. “Our biggest problem is away form and it will be away form that determines whether we are in Europe or not.”
Hughes’s team have picked up just one win from seven Premier League games on their travels this season – that coming in September against West Ham – but have drawn two of those contests.
“We need to make sure we go into the break with some kind of momentum,” Hughes added. “The home form has been good and we’ve got a chance to keep it going in our last three games.
“I think everyone knows where we are going to be for Christmas, but I don’t want to set targets like that because then you get over-reliant on them and you have to fulfil what you set out.”
Hughes is well aware of the task facing his team in their clash with Martin Jol’s Fulham side.
The Londoners have won all four of their Premier League games since they beat Stoke 2-0 at Craven Cottage last month, including a 4-1 win over Liverpool on Saturday, and Hughes knows they will be tough opponents for his side to break down.
“They’ve got the firepower to hurt you,” said Hughes. “You only have to look back to earlier in the season when they beat Liverpool away from home so they’re a dangerous team who can cause teams problems if you allow them time and space on the ball.
“I think Martin Jol has done a superb job at Fulham this season with the limited resources he has available to him. He’s got his side playing well but I think it will take something really special for us to get through against them.”
