A 50-year-old woman has died and two others have been seriously hurt after being hit by a car as it fled from a routine traffic stop by California authorities. The San Francisco Police Department said it was involved in the pursuit of the black four-door sedan, but did not know if any officers were inside. Authorities were not chasing the vehicle when the crash occurred, and no one has been arrested so far, police told local media. A spokesman for San Francisco General Hospital confirmed to CBS affiliate KPIX that a woman in her 50s died after being hit by a car on Market Street. The pedestrian was reportedly killed instantly, while the other injured victim is reportedly fighting for their life at the hospital. Video of the incident showed two people lying motionless next to a black sedan and at least one officer standing over them in front of the crashed vehicle as onlookers gathered around the scene. The identities of all those involved have yet to be confirmed, although police say there were three people in total in the car - including a woman driving who is now being treated for serious injuries, KPIX reported. Officers pulled over the car at about 2pm on Friday afternoon near San Francisco's Financial District and initiated a traffic stop because of a 'registration violation'. Police said they were not chasing it when the crash happened around one mile later, according to NBC affiliate KNTV. 'We do believe that officers did not have an interaction with anyone in this vehicle,' San Francisco police spokesman Robert Rueca told reporters at a press conference on Saturday. He said police were still investigating why the car was being pursued and what happened when it crashed, although he stressed no arrests had been made so far. The video showed officers tending to a woman lying on the pavement next to a man who was reportedly hit by the car as it fled, while another man lay injured between two vehicles further down the street. One officer appeared to be checking for signs of life with CPR and an Automatic External Defibrillator (AED) after the crash. A police spokesman said officers responded to reports of a traffic collision involving three pedestrians at 2.18pm and 'located two females and one male'. Both women were pronounced dead, while the man was taken to hospital in critical condition and is reportedly still fighting for his life. Rueca added: ''It's important that we make sure that this investigation is conducted with as much integrity and transparency as possible, so we can understand what happened here.'' The police officer who initiated the stop has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal investigation. Rueca also said it was too early to tell whether any police were inside the car when it struck the pedestrians - although he added: 'If it's determined that officers are in the vehicle, we will do a thorough investigation into what happened.' ''This is one of those things where you know, if there are officers who are involved in this incident and they are inside the vehicle, then they will be held accountable for their actions.'' he said. A police spokesman told local media that it appeared the black car was being pursued by a different law enforcement agency, but did not say which one or what type of pursuit was happening at the time of the crash. Rueca said officers had pulled over the vehicle because they believed it had been stolen - although he stressed there was no indication yet that the car's driver was wanted for any particular reason. The San Francisco Police Department has since confirmed the woman who died in the collision is Bridget Klecker, 42, who worked as a marketing consultant and served on the city's Municipal Transportation Agency board until earlier this month when she stepped down to start her own firm. Klecker told the San Francisco Chronicle that she had been hit by a car driven by an unlicensed Uber driver while riding her bike in 2015, which led to her appointment as chair of the Municipal Transportation Agency's Bicycle Advisory Committee and then a place on the MTA board. Her mother said she was 'a fighter for social justice' who would be greatly missed by those close to her. Klecker was born in Iowa but moved to San Francisco in 1984 as a student at the University of California, Berkeley. She told The Chronicle last year that she had fallen in love with San Francisco and decided it would be where she 'would raise my kids' when she graduated from college. Her mother said Klecker loved the city and its diversity and was passionate about issues including the environment and homelessness. Ms Klecker leaves behind two children, a son, aged 10, and a daughter, aged five, who are currently in New York with her ex-husband, Mark Klecker. ''Her kids were everything to her. She would do anything for them,'' Klecker's mother said.
