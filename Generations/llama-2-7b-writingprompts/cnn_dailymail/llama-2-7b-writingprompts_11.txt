(CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthians has a history of violations and abusive practices, so the end of this chain should make a positive difference in many lives. The Education Department and state regulators should closely monitor the situation and ensure that students receive their promised debt relief. This will take some time to accomplish, however, as students may be required to provide documentation about how they used Pell Grant money while at the college. For now, they are entitled to a full refund of all federal student loans and grants received from Corinthian Colleges Inc., including those funds that were already disbursed directly to a third-party school or lender. The Education Department is also required to cancel outstanding debt on any remaining federal loans, which should be easy for students who have documentation of loan repayments made before the closing of the colleges. They must submit claims within 60 days if they want to receive these benefits. In addition, the department will need to help displaced students transfer their credits or get refunds from private lenders that may have issued loans for non-accredited classes at Corinthian Colleges Inc., even though those funds were disbursed directly to a third party. It's important that all of these claims are processed quickly and accurately so former students can get back on track with their education plans after such an abrupt ending to their academic careers.
