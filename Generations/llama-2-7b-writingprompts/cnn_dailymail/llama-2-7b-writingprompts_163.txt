New Zealand cricketers will not be allowed to go on a pre-tour bender when they play Australia in an upcoming Twenty20 international series at home. The New Zealand Cricket [NZC] board has outlawed drinking alcohol during the two games against Australia, which will begin on October 29 in Dunedin and finish with a match on November 1 in Hamilton. In addition to the booze ban, players have also been prohibited from partying until 5am for a second time this year - following similar edicts issued before the T20 matches against Sri Lanka in February and May.
