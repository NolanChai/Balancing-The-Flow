The US prosecutor who has charged him with causing the 2010 Flash Crash has been told to investigate other people involved.
A British trader accused of triggering a £500 billion Wall Street crash boasted he could earn £1 million in a week in 'volatile' markets, according to court documents unsealed yesterday. Navinder Sarao, 36, made the bold claim last October when he sent an email to a brokerage company where he had been working for nearly a year, saying it was time to "buy low and sell high".
"Market is very volatile right now as you know," said the trader known as "Nav". "Hope all is well and have a great day! Navinder."
The email came in the days before his computer allegedly caused the Flash Crash, a sudden $1trillion drop in world stock markets which lasted just minutes but sparked fears of a major recession. The trader's case has been widely cited as an example of how technology can destabilise financial systems and how people are losing faith in Wall Street's ability to regulate itself.
He is accused by the US Department of Justice of sending out sell orders through his Chicago-based computer which caused panic on Wall Street. His lawyer has argued that he was simply reacting to a series of automatic sell orders from other computers which were themselves reacting to news of a slowdown in the Chinese economy and the European debt crisis.
Mr Sarao is charged under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform laws with fraud, manipulation and spoofing - placing an order to buy or sell shares at a price far above or below their true value for no other reason than to influence market prices. He is also charged with wire fraud.
If convicted of all the charges he faces up to 30 years in jail. He appeared before Westminster magistrates court today and was granted bail of £25,000 - with a requirement that he surrenders his passport. Mr Sarao's lawyer said in court: "He's not guilty. We are looking forward to the trial."
Mr Sarao's lawyer told reporters after the hearing that he was not allowed to comment on whether it would be in the UK or US justice system where his client would face trial, adding only that no final decision had been taken yet. The court documents show the trader emailed the brokerage company about buying shares when they were cheap and selling them at a profit after they went up.
"If you are interested in taking risk we can do this on a short term basis as market is very volatile right now," he wrote to the broker. "Market could go up 20-30 percent but it could also crash as well." The email came a week before the Flash Crash and was sent just five days after a company called MF Global, run by former New Jersey governor Jon Corzine, collapsed over $1billion in missing client funds.
The collapse led to accusations of fraud against Mr Corzine, who denies any wrongdoing, but also raised questions about the safety of customer funds. In September 2011, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which regulates futures markets, wrote to all traders and brokers asking them to explain their activity on May 6 - when Mr Sarao is alleged to have caused the Flash Crash.
In a letter seen by this newspaper, it said: "The CFTC is concerned that your firm may be engaging in high frequency or program-based trading activities without being registered as a swap dealer or futures commission merchant (FCM) with the CFTC." It also warned the company to comply with federal regulations or face enforcement action.
The email sent by Mr Sarao on October 1, 2011 was sent just two weeks after that letter but has never been seen before and may shed new light on his trading.
In another email in November 2011, the broker told him to stop selling stocks "for a couple of days" as they were getting too low. The trader responded: "You are very wise man."
The US authorities have also asked for details of other accounts linked to Mr Sarao's trading but it is not clear which company he was working with in October 2011. His lawyer declined to comment on the case.
