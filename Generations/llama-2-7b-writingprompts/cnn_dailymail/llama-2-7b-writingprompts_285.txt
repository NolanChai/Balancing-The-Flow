The article was written by Clive Thompson, and he is definitely on point when it comes to talking about foods that are going to be part of our future. As population continues to rise, so does the amount of resources we need to feed everyone. The problem is we're already using up all natural resources at an alarming rate. Eating insects as a supplementary diet might actually help us. Not only will it decrease our use on limited resources like water and land but it could also provide a steady source of protein. The author makes a good point when he states that we're going to have to adjust if we want to continue feeding the world.
