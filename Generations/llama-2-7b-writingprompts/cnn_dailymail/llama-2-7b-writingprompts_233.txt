"[T]his is a free-range kid," he said in his call, "and I saw them walking down the street today."
"No one's home right now. They were walking up the driveway. It looks like they're going to get hit by a car." 
"There are no supervision on this property at all." The caller says he is an employee of the Smiths and says his job was to make sure their kids didn't do anything stupid, like fall down while walking around the neighborhood. "I just saw them crossing the street without looking both ways," he said.

### Discussion: 
- If you can find the link to the video of this kid running down the street, it might make more sense what exactly happened. The kids were clearly not in danger at all when they were stopped by police and CPS (and then eventually released after a few hours)
- It seems like an overreaction from the parents was part of the problem here too
- Not sure if I'd describe this as a 'free range parenting' issue. The kids weren't unsupervised, they were just left outside without adult supervision in their yard for 5 hours. That doesn't seem outrageous at all to me.
