A contestant on Friday night's episode of Jeopardy left a lasting impression with viewers for all the wrong reasons after giving a highly inappropriate answer to a question about puberty. Host Alex Trebek asked, "What is the pineal gland?" A woman named Liza answered that it was what makes girls grow boobs. After the audience went silent, Trebek tried to save her by explaining the correct answer was actually the third eye, but even he had to laugh at her response. And viewers were shocked and appalled when they saw Liza's name pop up in a Google search. The woman is listed as a professional dominatrix who says she makes $500 per hour for sex with men over 40. Liza's profile includes a photo of her lying on a bed wearing a tight white dress and heels, along with a statement that reads: "If you are looking to explore your wildest fantasy, then I am the one who can take care of it." Trebek had no idea she was a dominatrix before Friday's show. However, the host previously called her out for her inappropriate puberty answer and told her that if she were a man, he would have said that he needed to "see that" on his show. The 36-year-old woman also has a website where you can pay $100 per hour for an "intimate" experience with her. She claims her sessions include massages and "erotic games," but not actual sex. According to the site, Liza also goes by the names Liza Faye, Liza Cake, and Bella Kink. Trebek has had many controversial moments during his decades-long run on Jeopardy! including one that was so offensive even he didn't want to repeat it. During a show last November, contestant Arthur Chu said he wanted to play the game in an unfair way because he hated Trebek and Alex "isn't funny at all." The host then said he wished to speak with him after the show about what was wrong with his character. A clip of their conversation was posted online where they discussed a possible apology from Chu, but he refused to apologize for not liking Trebek's personality. At one point in the video, Chu even questioned whether or not Trebek is gay and asked why he's never married.
