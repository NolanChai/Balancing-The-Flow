He was a very nice guy, always had a smile on his face. I don't know why it happened. I still can't believe it. He was so young and he didn't deserve this. He was a really good boyfriend.' She added that he was planning to move back to London after finishing his degree, and that she wanted to marry him when she finished studying. The 21-year-old was in the second year of a course at University College London and had been due to return to England with her mother today after visiting friends and family. Pau told The Sun: 'When I spoke to him on Friday he said that he'd flown home to go shopping before he came back out here on Monday.' She added: 'He was really looking forward to his holiday and going on the glacier with my brother. He had done it once before and enjoyed it so much that he wanted to do it again.' Pau, who is studying psychology at a university in northern Spain, said she did not blame the pilot for what happened yesterday. She added: 'I don't think it was his fault - it was just one of those things I guess. He had taken off from Barcelona and everything seemed to be OK. But he must have got distracted because they never made it to their destination.' Pau said her brother, who is 23, had also been due to fly out but that the pair decided to split up so she could travel with a friend. 'My brother has been quite shaken up by everything and hasn't spoken much about it. But I was relieved when I heard he had changed his mind. We would have been travelling together, so maybe if we did have been on the same plane that something might have gone wrong.' Pau said she wanted to return to London as soon as possible to be with her family and friends. She added: 'It's going to take time for me to get over this - I can't believe it actually happened. It feels like a bad dream. But when I go back to England I just want to spend some time with my friends.' Pau said she was very upset that her mother had not been able to travel out to Austria to see him. She added: 'I'm really worried about her - it has really knocked her for six and we are both having a hard time coming to terms with what has happened. But at the moment we just have to try and stay strong.' Pau also said that she had been in contact with her boyfriend's father, who was flying out from England today to claim his body. She added: 'I think he's going to fly to Spain first and then to Austria - I'm not sure what's happening yet but they will have to go through all the formalities.' Pau also said that she did not want a funeral or any kind of memorial in Britain, adding that her boyfriend would rather be remembered on a glacier. 'He wanted his ashes scattered over a snowy mountain,' she told The Sun. She also revealed how she had met him three years ago after being set up by a mutual friend. Pau said: 'He'd been out with some friends and he came back really late and we spoke for the first time when I was leaving. He was such a lovely guy - but not in that cheesy way. We both laughed about it later.' A British Embassy spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of this case and can confirm he was on one of our passenger lists. Our consular officials have been informed by Spanish authorities and we are offering assistance to the family of the deceased.'
