I'm just going to eat them both.
### Explanation:
I was reading through some of the stories and I found this one interesting and came across it today. Some say she deserved it for what she did but he really got off on the wrong foot. He is 31 years old, now I don't know how long ago he went in but we can assume its been a while so he isn't all there mentally anymore. In this situation you have to realize that someone who has served time for murder or attempted murder of his ex-girlfriend is not going to be the brightest bulb in the chandelier when it comes to whats right and wrong in society. I think the biggest factor in all of this besides the fact she did deserve it was the rape, now if they do charge him with that then he may have a much longer sentence for something he didn't even commit but hey its better than nothing I suppose.
### Story:
An ex-convict who told cops he fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend and then cooked her organs to eat may now be charged with raping her, according to reports. Joseph Oberhansley, from Jeffersonville, Indiana, is accused of murdering 26-year-old Tammy Joan Hall on July 13. He was arrested at his home the following morning. According to police, he told them he killed Hall because she cheated on him and that he then cooked some of her organs and ate them. The Jeffersonville News & Tribune reported that Hall had told Oberhansley's daughter that her father wanted to kill himself over his break-up with Hall. On the night of July 13, Hall's friends told cops she went to pick up Oberhansely at around 9 pm and brought him back to her apartment for sex. The couple then got into an argument which allegedly led to Oberhansley strangling Hall to death with a cellphone charger cord. According to the Daily Mail, police said that Hall's body was discovered by neighbors two days later when they went over and smelled something 'foul' coming from her house. When officers arrived at Hall's home on July 15, they found blood splatters and a handgun in the bathroom as well as some of Hall's clothing outside. The police then arrested Oberhansley who allegedly told them he killed Hall before cooking and eating her organs to try to make her 'disappear'. Oberhansely is now facing two charges of murder, criminal confinement, obstruction of justice, strangulation and arson in relation to his girlfriends death. However, it has been reported that he could be charged with additional felony counts after detectives uncovered Hall's missing cell phone which had messages from Oberhansley allegedly telling her to kill herself before he went on to tell her about what he was going to do if she didn't. The police also found a sexual assault kit in the woman's home and are now investigating whether or not Oberhansely raped her before killing her. Hall's father has reportedly said that he is glad that his daughter's alleged attacker has been arrested but says he would feel better if she was still alive to see justice done. Source:Â Daily Mail
