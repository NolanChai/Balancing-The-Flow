The show's creators are being accused of making light of an allegedly serious assault. The BBC has made light of disgraced presenter Jeremy Clarkson’s attack on a junior producer by poking fun at the incident in a comedy programme. A new episode of mockumentary W1A, to be broadcast later tonight on BBC2, shows Clarkson being told off for making an unacceptable remark. The scene takes place at an event hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron and sees Clarkson being chastised by a senior civil servant played by Mark Benton. “I’m sorry about that,” he tells the Top Gear star. “We need to have more women on our programme, we’re not sexist.”
