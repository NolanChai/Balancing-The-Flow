These days, the best way to deal with an annoying friend is just to ignore them and move on with your life. But as one mum discovered recently, that's a lot easier said than done when you have over 500 friends!  >The post had been shared over 96,000 times. "I'm sure some of the comments were meant to be funny but I've never seen such an ugly display of bullying," one mum wrote on Facebook, while another commented: "What a disgraceful group of people... it makes me sad that in 2016, people can still be so unkind." >"I'm not usually one to get involved with things like this but I just had to chime in. The fact is, you need to learn how to accept the truth," wrote another user. "This mother was being a bit annoying by posting the pictures of her child and all her friends are making fun of her for that. You know what? It's OK! If it bothers them so much then they shouldn't be friends with her." >"If you don't like someone's posts, or can't stand their new baby's pictures being posted every 15 minutes... get the f*** over it. This is what social media is for - it's a way to stay connected with people," another user wrote. "We all know this isn't real life so let it go already." >"It's called social media and you are free to do whatever you want on your Facebook account! It's not a big secret that everyone hates seeing constant baby posts, but the thing is - it doesn't affect you at all," one woman wrote. "You just have to deal with it or you can unfriend the person and stop worrying about it." >"I've got more friends on Facebook than I do in real life and I'm so over that post. She was only doing it because she wanted her baby to be seen by everyone... and I think that's what all mums want!" wrote one man. "All you people saying we should stop posting our children are just a bunch of hypocrites anyway." >"It's not like they are constantly asking for money or trying to get votes, which is what other pages are doing these days," commented another user. "So shut up about it and just unfriend the person if you really hate their baby so much!"
