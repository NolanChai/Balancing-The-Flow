The Spurs chairman's stance on any possible sale of Lloris will come as another blow for United, who have had three bids for the France goalkeeper knocked back. Levy is refusing to budge in the face of United's £25million bid for Lloris and is set to offer him a new contract, worth around £100,000-a-week, that will keep him at White Hart Lane until 2018. United have also been warned off by Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino, who made it clear he does not want the star to leave in the next transfer window. And with a £60million valuation on Lloris, there is little chance of him being available for less than that fee in January. United are expected to be busy in this summer's market as they look to spend heavily to boost their chances of competing at the top end of next season's Premier League table. But it looks increasingly likely their interest will focus on other targets with Lloris looking unlikely to arrive.
