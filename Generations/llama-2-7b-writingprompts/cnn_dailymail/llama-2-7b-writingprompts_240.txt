The European Champions Cup is an annual rugby union competition organised by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR) since 2009. It features teams from six of the top national or provincial competitions in Europe, with each team playing seven matches within their pool. The winner of each pool then progresses to the knockout stages, where they join the top four sides from last season's Heineken Cup.
