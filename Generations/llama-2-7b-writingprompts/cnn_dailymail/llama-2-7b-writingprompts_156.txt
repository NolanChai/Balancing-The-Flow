The first picture is captioned "The Cygnus 11 aircraft, a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft". The second image has been described as a "cross between an aircraft and a hovercraft. The third shows the same aircraft in flight. And the fourth appears to show a seaplane or hydroplane in operation. The caption on the last one reads: "A Chinese military Cygnus 11 amphibious aircraft, which is a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft".

### Analysis:
Whilst the vehicles do bear some resemblance to each other, there are enough differences to conclude that this photo does not relate to one of these prototypes. Firstly, the CYG-11 is a seaplane, with a wingspan of 16m and an empty weight of around 3,000kg. It was also designed as a reconnaissance aircraft, and was intended to be used for coastal patrols and maritime surveillance. In contrast, the vehicle in these photographs has no visible means of propulsion or landing gear, making it appear more like an amphibious boat than any kind of aeroplane or seaplane. The captions also contain several errors:

1. "First picture is captioned 'The Cygnus 11 aircraft'". The photograph has no caption at all, and the word 'Cygnus' does not appear in it anywhere.
2. "'A Chinese military Cygnus 11 amphibious aircraft which is a cross between a catamaran and a hovercraft"'. Although there are some similarities with the CYG-11, this cannot be considered an accurate description of that particular model of aircraft.
