Military officials in Kazakhstan have introduced a Miss Army competition in the hope of encouraging more recruits. The Kazakhstani Ministry of Defence has chosen 123 of its prettiest female soldiers as candidates for this year's title. The women were photographed wearing military uniform and holding guns for promotional purposes, although they will also be judged on their cookery, fitness, and English skills in addition to their appearance. Officials hope the contest will increase interest in serving in Kazakhstan's armed forces from women who may not otherwise consider a career as a soldier. The ministry is offering a number of scholarships for successful competitors to help pay for tuition at military academies.
