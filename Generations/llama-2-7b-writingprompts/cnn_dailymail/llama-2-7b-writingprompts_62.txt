Sunless worlds, or brown dwarfs as they are also known, may be more common than we thought. This is because they may contain elements essential to life. Scientists have now discovered that a small asteroid belt circling our solar system's star could contain water.
The discovery was made by an international group of researchers using the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope in Chile, along with observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observatories in Hawaii.
The finding will help determine whether small asteroid belts like ours could be habitable for life. It also offers a new explanation for the unusual orbits of some distant worlds called trans-Neptunian objects, or TNOs, which are believed to be remnants from the formation of the solar system more than 4 billion years ago.
Brown dwarfs are planets that never became fully formed and therefore have less mass than our sun. They do not glow because they don't have enough gravity to ignite into a star. However, some scientists believe their gravitational pull could create an environment that supports life.
These discoveries raise the possibility of finding signs of other solar systems, as well as those inhabiting them. It might even be possible for us to communicate with these civilizations using our own telescopes.
The sunless planets may not harbor intelligent life forms because they are too young and cold. They also lack water, a necessity for human existence. However, scientists have discovered that some asteroids contain large amounts of ice, which could be used to build colonies on other celestial objects like moons or asteroids if the technology exists.
However, scientists say it is too early to conclude whether these discoveries indicate the existence of life beyond Earth, let alone intelligent life forms. In fact, there have been several false alarms in the past when astronomers claimed they had spotted planets orbiting nearby stars. These turned out to be either errors or natural phenomena that resembled planets.
In addition, most scientists believe it is highly unlikely that any intelligent civilizations would travel across vast distances just to visit us here on Earth.
The discovery of water and ice deposits around the asteroid belt also provides another clue into how our solar system formed billions of years ago. It has been suggested that these materials were delivered from space by comets, but it is unclear whether this hypothesis can be confirmed with current technology.
