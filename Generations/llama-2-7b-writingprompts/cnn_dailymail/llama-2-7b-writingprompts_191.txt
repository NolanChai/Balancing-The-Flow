I'd like to thank the people who alerted us about this fly-tipping and for their help in clearing it up.
It was quite a shock to see such large piles of waste dumped on public land so close to where villagers live, which is why I decided to visit yesterday - despite being quite ill - and take photos, as you can see below.
I'll be posting more pictures later today, including ones showing some of the waste and rubbish strewn around the area.
We are very lucky in this part of Suffolk that we have a few dedicated people willing to pick up rubbish - and I am one of them.
But there will always be people who don't care about their community or the environment, which is why it is so important that we take action when things like this happen.
We will continue working with Suffolk County Council on tackling fly-tipping in our area - and I hope you'll join us.
If there are any incidents of rubbish dumped near where you live, please report it to the council as soon as possible by calling 0345 606 6178 or online at: https://www.suffolk.gov.uk/report-it
**P.S.** I'll be writing more about this fly-tipping incident in my next column for the Lowestoft Journal, which should come out on Wednesday. In the meantime, feel free to contact me if you have any comments or questions.
