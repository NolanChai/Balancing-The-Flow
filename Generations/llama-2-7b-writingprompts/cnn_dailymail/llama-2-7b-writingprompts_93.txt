Rafa Nadal got his clay court season off to a perfect, confidence-boosting start with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Frenchman Lucas Pouille in the Monte Carlo Masters. It was a businesslike display from the world number one who did not drop serve and has now won 17 of his last 18 matches on clay. Nadal will face compatriot Marcel Granollers for a place in the semi-finals but said he felt no extra pressure to perform against Pouille, the winner of two ATP titles this year. I did n't play my best today. I was a little bit nervous during the beginning of the first set, Nadal told a news conference after the match on Sunday. I think it is not important (that) you start perfect or not because I was thinking in the second half of the first set that if I am going to be nervous and a little bit uncomfortable maybe with the serve then I could lose some points, but at the end I played a good tie-breaker. The second set started better and it was much easier for me. The Spaniard broke Pouille in his first service game of the match when the 16th seed double-faulted on break point to trail 1-0 and was never headed. Nadal, playing with a new racket sponsored by Babolat after splitting from Wilson, did not drop serve again in the match and will next play Granollers who beat German Florian Mayer 6-2, 3-6, 6-4 on Sunday. The former French Open champion is now unbeaten since losing to compatriot Feliciano Lopez in Madrid last month and is looking forward to a meeting with world number three Novak Djokovic next week in Rome. I know that the draw is so difficult because I could play against Roger (Federer), Rafa, Andy (Murray) or Novak (Djokovic). I have not played any of them this year yet and it will be a good test for me, Nadal said. I am going to enjoy that and after the Rome event I am going to play here in Monte Carlo again. The semi-finals are set to feature world number two Djokovic, who beat Frenchman Jeremy Chardy 6-4, 2-0 due to retirement injury, and French Open champion Stanislas Wawrinka against either Mayer or Murray on Wednesday. In the doubles tournament, the Bryan brothers retained their title with a comfortable win over the top seeds, Max Mirnyi and Alexander Peya, in the final. The American duo lost serve once in each set to beat the Belarusian-Austrian pair 6-3, 7-6 (10/8).
