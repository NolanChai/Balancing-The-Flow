QPR boss Chris Ramsey believes Sunday's west London derby is more crucial to his side than it is to title-chasing Chelsea. Jose Mourinho's Blues visit Loftus Road looking for a win that will maintain their seven-point lead at the top of the table, but Rangers' boss insists there is as much at stake for his side as there is for his opponents. Ramsey told Sky Sports: "They have a lot to play for and we have everything to play for - our season. It's more important for us than it is for them. "We are not going to go out and be over-cautious but that doesn't mean we will be reckless or stupid because you can end up on the wrong side of the referee." Ramsey insists his players have had a good week of preparation after a 3-1 victory over Burnley at Turf Moor last Saturday. He added: "We know what they are going to do and we know how dangerous they are with the ball, so it's about us playing our game. They will try to get hold of it but we have to be brave enough to go after them too." Rangers will again be without injured trio Jamie Mackie (groin), Stephane Mbia (hamstring) and Joey Barton (calf). Mourinho's squad is at full strength, with only midfielders Oriol Romeu (Achilles) and Marco van Ginkel (knee) unavailable. Ramsey believes Chelsea will be a different proposition to the QPR side that defeated them 1-0 back in September. "It's two completely different teams," he said. "We are nowhere near as good as we were then and they have improved their team considerably too." Rangers are seven points adrift of safety, although they do still have a game in hand on the rest of the bottom five. They know that to stay up they will need to win all three of those games - but Ramsey is refusing to write off Sunday's opponents. "I think there are worse teams than Chelsea in this league," he added, "but I wouldn't say we are at our best yet."
