The Jamaican sprinter is not only the world’s fastest man, he also eats like one as well, according to his own Instagram account. Bolt said “I eat nuggets every day!” when asked about his favourite food in a video posted last year on Instagram. The 31-year-old was even spotted picking up McDonald’s and KFC during the 2016 Rio Olympics, where he won two gold medals in the men’s 100m and 4x100m relay. Bolt also took to Twitter last year with a picture of himself chowing down on some KFC hot wings while wearing his Olympic gold medal. “It’s been too long,” he captioned it. The 2017 World Athletics Championships, which take place in London starting Friday, are set to be Bolt’s last global athletics event before retirement at the end of this year, though he does plan on continuing his work as a brand ambassador for Puma and Virgin Media after that. And while he’s certainly not a fussy eater, it looks like he won’t be following in the footsteps of Usain Bolt, who once said he wanted to open a chain of KFC restaurants in Jamaica as soon as his career was over.

### Summary:

The worlds fastest man has been seen eating food from McDonald's, KFC and Pizza Hut. He is not fussy about the brands he eats or where he gets them from, but he always makes time for a Guinness pint and Pringles crisps in between his workouts.
