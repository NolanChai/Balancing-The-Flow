"If I had known what I know now, I wouldn't have served." A Utah veteran who has been trying to get a specialty license plate in honor of his wartime service said Friday that he is disappointed over the reason for the denial. A The state Department of Motor Vehicles told Mark Taylor they couldn't approve the request because the name "Purple" was already on a different plate commemorating Purple Heart recipients. Taylor, who served in Vietnam from 1971 to 1972 and received a Purple Heart for wounds he sustained in an explosion that nearly killed him, said he had no idea the department already offered such a plate and has contacted lawmakers about finding another way to honor his service. A Taylor was among dozens of veterans who attended a ceremony Thursday at the Utah State Capitol where Gov. Gary Herbert unveiled a memorial honoring veteran suicides. A He said he's received mostly positive feedback on social media after his request for the plate made it to news outlets and has been contacted by several lawmakers, including Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who wants to find an alternative way of honoring Taylor. A "I never thought they would deny me," he said.
