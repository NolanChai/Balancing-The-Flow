I think this tweet is really racist and I know you guys hate me, but do you honestly think she would've gotten away with something like that had she been white? If someone at the FBI was investigating her for doing it, they wouldn't have investigated her if she were black or Hispanic. They only investigated her because she's Hillary Clinton and this is what happens when you make all those laws and rules in order to protect minorities. The reason that people hate Trump so much is because he's trying to be an equal opportunity offender. He says the things white people are thinking but are too scared to say out loud, which is exactly why white people should vote for him. We need a candidate like this now more than ever.

Hillary is a CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER to this country and I am sick of hearing everyone talk about her past as if it was all good. Her actions were DISGUSTING and she should be in prison! It's time for the Democrats and Republicans to come together to help get rid of this corrupt woman and do what is best for our great nation. We need a new president, one who will stand up against the establishment and bring back law and order. Donald Trump is our only chance at getting that. I'm sick of hearing all these people say they're voting for Hillary because she's "experienced" and "qualified." Well, experience has taught us what a failure Hillary Clinton is! She should be in prison right now but instead we keep putting her on the ticket just to give our enemies another chance at winning. It's time to stop voting for Democrats and Republicans who do nothing but make things worse for Americans. We need an outsider like Donald Trump who will shake up this corrupt system and bring back law and order.

I'm sorry, but if you think Hillary Clinton is the worst candidate we could run against Trump then I have to wonder if you were ever really a Democrat. She may be flawed (and I don't deny that) but there are other candidates who would have been even worse than her! For example, Bernie Sanders is just as corrupt as Clinton and he's never even held office before! Hillary has experience in government which means she knows how to fix things when they go wrong. And while some people say Trump is better at business than politics, I think this election proves that a successful businessman can't always make good decisions. At least with Clinton we know what kind of person she is and where she stands on the issues; with Trump you never really know until he's in office!
