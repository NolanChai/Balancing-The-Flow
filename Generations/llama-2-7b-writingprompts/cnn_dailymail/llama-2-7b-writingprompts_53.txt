A 10-year-old boy who beat a younger child to death in Canada went to his friends claiming that he had witnessed a 'big guy' strike the victim with a rock. Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma suffered during an attack by three other children on Nov. 17, 2021. Police later arrested three boys aged between 8 and 9 years old who took part in the crime, but released their identities to the public and notified child services after they realized that one of the boys was involved. The boy went to his friends claiming he had witnessed a 'big guy' hit Lee with a rock, police said. The child told the other children that Lee had been struck in the head by a rock thrown at him by a big guy, before being beaten up. He then dragged himself to one of their houses and asked for help but died soon after, according to his friends. Police did not identify the boy who allegedly hit Lee with a rock. The boy had been left home alone while his parents went shopping in Sturgeon County, Alberta, on Nov. 17 when he was attacked. He told his family about the incident when they returned from their trip to the grocery store and called police but by then it was too late for Lee. One of the boys involved has been charged with second-degree murder while two others are facing charges related to manslaughter. Police said a fourth boy is still being investigated, according to CTV News. The boys accused in Lee's death were aged between 8 and 9 at the time of the crime, but one of them was allowed to be interviewed by police despite him not being old enough for the legal age requirement. 'It is standard practice that we are able to speak with any victim or witness who has information to offer as a part of our investigation,' Alberta Justice spokeswoman Sarah Fitzpatrick told CTV News. 'The ability to have an interview does not mean that charges will be laid in the case.' The boy is being investigated for being involved in Lee's death but he may not face any legal charges at this time, according to police. He was charged with assaulting a 12-year-old friend of his on Nov. 6 and has been placed in temporary care while an investigation continues into the case. Lee's mother, Jennifer Bonneau, said her family is 'devastated beyond words.' 'My little boy died alone, terrified,' she said in a statement to CTV News. 'He had never met his attackers and yet they took him from us all the same. 'The last 10 days have been a blur of shock, anger, disbelief, hurt and unanswered questions.' The boy allegedly responsible for Lee's death was reportedly seen in the days before he died, playing with other children at his apartment complex, according to CTV News. Bonneau said her son had been diagnosed as autistic when he was just three years old and spent time in hospital after being hit by a car while trying to get out of it on Oct. 15. She added that Lee had recently moved to the apartment building from his home town, where he lived with his father, grandparents and older brother. The mother told CTV News that she believed her son was not safe living at the complex because children there were 'too old for him.' 'They were mean to him. I don't know if it was bullying or what,' Bonneau said. Lee is pictured playing a game of hide-and-seek with his brother in 2019.

The mother said her son was diagnosed with autism when he was three years old, but that it was difficult for him to express himself verbally. Police confirmed on Thursday that they have identified the boys involved in Lee's death and are investigating whether there is a connection between them. The incident has been described as 'extremely disturbing' by Edmonton police Chief Dale McFee, who said it was one of the most horrific cases he had seen in his 40-year career with the force. He also confirmed that Lee had moved into a new apartment building in October and added that the boy's parents had been unaware that he was living there at the time of his death. Police said on Friday that they are investigating whether the alleged killer and Lee were related. Lee is pictured playing a game of hide-and-seek with his brother in 2019.
