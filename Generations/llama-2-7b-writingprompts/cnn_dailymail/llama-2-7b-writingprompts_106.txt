1. The correct spelling is O'Connor (I guess the copy editor was a little tired), but the story reads better with Oe as in "The Danish Girl" and not O'Connor as in "Mystery of the Third Planet". 2. A mother who cradled her three-year-old son while she lay down in front of a train killed them both after finding out her husband had a second family in Egypt, an inquest has heard is incorrect because it does not flow. It should be: *A mother who cradled her 3-year old son as she laid down on the tracks to die, killing herself and her child, was told by her husband that he'd been having an affair with a woman from Egypt.*
