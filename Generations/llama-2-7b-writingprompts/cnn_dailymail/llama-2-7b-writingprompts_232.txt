The accident occurred after the driver of the 21-seat aircraft had left his vehicle on its parking brake and moved out of the cockpit, but failed to switch off the engine before walking away. As he turned around at a nearby building he collided with the bus which was pulling up behind him. The plane then rolled down a ramp leading to a taxiway and crashed into the tarmac. Fortunately no-one on board or on the ground were injured in the collision which happened just before 7am yesterday morning.

### Context:

The Uzbek capital Tashkent is located in central Asia, south of Kazakhstan and northwest of Afghanistan. It is bordered by Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan to the north and west, respectively. The city's population has grown steadily since its foundation in 1930, as a result of the forced resettlement of millions of people from Central Asia under Stalin's orders. In 2015 it had a population of around three million people with many living in poverty and unemployment being widespread.
