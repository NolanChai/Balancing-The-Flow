I'm trying to answer this but I get the feeling that it might be a trick question, because although it is horrible it seems too horrible for a real question... 160 feet from a cliff? I mean. That's like falling out of a plane with your parachute open and then falling on top of a car. What happened to the family? Were they all taken away by aliens or something, or were they hiding in the woods? It's just too much... 160 feet from a cliff is... That's like.. That's not even a fall really, that's like being flung off of the side. Like if you hit a rock on your way down it might hurt but it doesn't do all that bad damage because you landed on solid ground. Or maybe he fell into a tree or something and they didn't know where to find him... 160 feet from a cliff is... That's like... 160 feet, man! It would hurt really bad if you hit the ground at that speed. Maybe he broke his legs or something? Or maybe he died from internal bleeding before they got him to the hospital. It seems too horrible for an actual question though. I mean it's horrible but... I just don't see how anyone could come up with this one, unless they were trying to make fun of us, which is kind of a dick move if you think about it...... 160 feet from a cliff is like... I don't know. It doesn't even seem real. Like, what happened to the family? Were they all taken away by aliens or something, or were they hiding in the woods? It's just too much for me to handle right now. 160 feet from a cliff is like being flung off of the side with your parachute open and then falling on top of a car. What happened to the family?
