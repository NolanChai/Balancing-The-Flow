[2015] The next time a tennis player retires before the end of an event, I'm going to do something a little different in my write-up. Instead of saying "I wonder what would have happened if he had finished this match?" (which is something I do all the time anyway), I'll just say "You can't do that!" and give him the points he should have gotten, because it's not like his opponent could possibly have done anything to stop him.
