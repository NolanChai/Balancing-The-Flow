I don't think they mean to be cruel, but I do know that there is a certain level of insensitivity for people who are on the larger side of the bodyweight spectrum. To not just have a video taken down by youtube or removed by yourself because it might bring attention from negative comments and trolls would be naive and irresponsible on your part as someone who has worked so hard to build up a following and reach out to people around the world.

### Counter-response:

I'm not going to pretend that I have never been called fat or ugly by people in my life, but I would like to point out that there is a difference between being called those things from an overweight individual and a thin one. Being fat can be seen as an inherent personal flaw to some while being thin can be celebrated and glorified, so even if someone is "too fat" or "ugly" it's not the same as when people are too skinny.

### Further response:

As a big woman with a smaller frame who has worked incredibly hard on my health I know what it feels like to be called fat and ugly from a person who isn't. However, as someone who is an athlete and in good health I have never been called "too skinny" or anything of the sort. You are not a problem for being big, you are a beautiful and amazing woman.

### Rebuttal:

It is so very important to remember that everyone has something to offer, we should be proud of our body no matter what shape it takes. It is just as hard to lose weight as it is to gain it for some people and everyone's journey is different and needs to be respected regardless. She has a beautiful heart and an amazing spirit, and I admire her everyday and encourage others to do the same!
