The verdicts were announced as part of ongoing trials in relation to the attack which began when protesters marched outside Mar-Girgis Church and then set fire to it with Molotov cocktails.

### Analysis:

The ruling, handed down on May 16, follows the trial of some 50 other defendants in March which saw six people given death sentences for their role in the attack, though an appeals court later reduced one of those to life imprisonment, CNN reports. The verdicts have been welcomed by Coptic Christians who said it showed there was no tolerance from authorities for attacks on church and religious minorities.
