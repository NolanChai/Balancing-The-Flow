[ OPINION ] A little over a month ago, I went into labor with my first baby. We were just finishing our dinner when we began to notice some signs that something was wrong. I had a terrible time getting up and down stairs for the next week or so, but by day 10 I felt back to normal. Well yesterday afternoon, while at work, I experienced some light-headedness, sweating and an intense headache. My coworkers encouraged me to go home asap and get medical attention. So off I went, thinking it was probably just another case of the flu that's going around. Turns out, I had a brain bleed. A stroke actually. It is so hard to believe. The first thing the doctors did when they found out was check my blood pressure. Apparently, that was one of their first concerns since high blood pressure can cause a stroke in women under 50. They say it's completely unrelated and that I just got lucky with this being my first pregnancy but I guess it still really freaks me out. I am now on bed rest for the next three weeks, as long as all is well after the birth of our baby girl. My family has been amazing during this whole process! It's nice to know that they will be there no matter what happens. ðŸ’ž [ RELATED ] [ 15 Facts About Stroke Symptoms Everyone Needs To Know ] [ The Best Advice I Could Offer Any New Mom-To-Be ] [ Fetal Heart Monitors: Everything You Need To Know ]
