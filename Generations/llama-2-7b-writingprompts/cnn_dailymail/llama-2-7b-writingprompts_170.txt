The captain immediately made the emergency announcement that we were going to have to evacuate the plane as it was losing air at an alarming rate. The crew proceeded to bring out the life rafts and begin to get everyone off the plane. At first I thought they would give us time to put our bags back on, but no, just get down there and get them over your head. As we were exiting the plane, I saw a guy standing in front of me with an oxygen mask hanging from his face. He was yelling, "We're goners! We're goners!" The flight attendant tried to calm him down and get him off of the wing, but he just wouldn't go. The captain had to physically drag him away before we could take off.

If you have a story like this to share please feel free to add it here. Thanks! -- [[User:Jkshim|jks]] 16:08, 24 April 2009 (PDT) :The crew of the flight was heroic in my opinion. I think we were in a state of shock when all this happened, and for us passengers it took a while to process what had just occurred. In any case, the crew handled this situation very well, as they probably did not know how serious or realistic the situation was at first. -- [[User:Jkshim|jks]] 16:08, 24 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm with jkshim on this one. The crew handled themselves very well and were able to get everyone off of the plane in a timely manner despite some passengers being uncooperative. I also commend SkyWest for their handling of this incident. They have notified all passengers via email and phone, offered reimbursement for our travel expenses (which we will likely not need), and sent us care packages which included vouchers for free flights with them, as well as a small gift card to a local restaurant. The incident was due to an electrical failure on one of the aircraft's computers which caused a loss in cabin pressure, but since it happened only 30 minutes after take off there were no injuries sustained by passengers or crew (aside from some bruises and cuts). This is truly an amazing story and I'm glad that everyone came out on top. -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 01:17, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :Was it just me or did it seem like they were trying to make a big deal about nothing? I was in the plane too. It only took off 30 minutes before it started losing air pressure, so it would be a little difficult to have any real injuries, but no one even got cut! The crew didn't seem very worried and just did everything they could do to calm us down. I guess that is what you are supposed to do in these situations though. -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I was also on the plane and am with Ashley too. It seemed a lot like they were making it into something bigger than it really was to make up for it being a delayed flight when we got back to Salt Lake City. -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm also on the plane and I agree with Ashley. It seemed like a big deal when it was really nothing but a delayed flight due to airport delays. -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm with Ashley on this one too. The whole event was handled very well, but I think SkyWest made it seem worse than it really was to make up for the fact that we had a delayed flight and arrived at our destination late. -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm also on this flight. I think they made it into a big deal to make up for the fact that we were late in arriving at our destination and had a delayed flight before we boarded the plane. It was handled very well though and no one even got hurt! -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm also on this flight. I agree with Ashley that they made a big deal out of something that really wasn't much at all. The flight attendants were very kind and did everything they could to make us comfortable though, so I suppose it was handled well overall. -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm also on this flight and think the crew made a big deal out of nothing to make up for the fact that we had been delayed in our flight from Salt Lake City. I would like it if someone who was actually on the plane could add some more information, because the story seems pretty unreliable right now! -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm on the plane and I think that the flight crew did a wonderful job handling this situation. They were very professional in the face of what could have easily been a terrifying experience. -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm also on this plane and I think they made it seem like something much bigger than it really was to make up for the fact that we had a delayed flight.

No one even got hurt or bruised! -- [[User:Ashleygavin1|Ashleygavin1]] 03:29, 26 April 2009 (PDT) :I'm also on this flight and I agree with all of the other people who said that they made it seem like more than what it really was.
