It should come as no surprise that Kylie Jenner is not pleased with the man’s efforts. The Lip Kit mogul’s representatives said, “Kris and I were watching it together, we started laughing. We were like, oh my God! It’s so funny!” But in a statement to Cosmopolitan, Kylie said her father-manager had some choice words for the guy who posted his video: “If he thinks that is the best thing ever… He doesn’t know what he’s doing.”

### Results:

Kylie has not yet responded to the results of the man's experiment, but Cosmopolitan did ask her how she would feel if she saw someone like him in person. “I don’t think I would laugh,” Kylie said. “I think it might be creepy.”
