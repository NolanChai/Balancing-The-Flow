> It is difficult to underestimate the severity of California's drought, which has been described as one of its most devastating natural disasters since record keeping began in 1849. The state has endured four years of little rainfall and scorching heat, causing reservoirs and lakes to dry up, groundwater tables to drop and snowcaps to melt. As much as two-thirds of the state is under moderate or exceptional drought.

> The drought will have long lasting implications for California's agriculture, industry and natural ecosystems that will be felt well beyond the next few years. In fact, we could see significant environmental impacts over the next 40 to 50 years, as it takes that long for many species and communities to recover from the drought conditions they now face.

> There is no reason to believe that California's drought will magically end in a few months, or even next year. It could last years, decades, or longer, and there's every possibility it gets worse before it gets better. This has been a multiyear drought; now we're entering the sixth consecutive winter of below-average snowfall. California will have to take dramatic action if it wants to get through this period without seeing major declines in farming, fishing and tourism.

> There are no easy answers here—it's been a decade since California saw significant rainfall and scientists can't definitively say how much of it is due to climate change. But we do know that, like so many other states in the drought-stricken West, the Golden State will have to find new ways to cope with an increasingly unpredictable water supply.

> While it’s true that California is in a drought, the scientific evidence shows that this has been happening for hundreds of years. And while some are trying to blame climate change and global warming on the current crisis, that doesn’t hold up when you look at the evidence.
