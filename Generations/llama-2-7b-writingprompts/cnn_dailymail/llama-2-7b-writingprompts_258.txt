They've got a lot of debt on them, they're probably going to get knocked out of Europe next year because of the financial fair play rules. It's a good move for him and it would be a good move for us. If it falls through then so be it but we can go back into that market. We've got a great deal of strength in depth at forward. Villa are in talks to sign Andone, who is valued at around £12million by his club. He has scored 35 times for Cordoba this season and was on target against Real Madrid last weekend - helping the side hold Cristiano Ronaldo's team to a draw. Sportsmail revealed Villa have held talks with Andone's representatives over a potential transfer but the Spanish forward wants a move to the Premier League and could join either Sunderland or Hull if he cannot seal a switch to Villa Park. Cordoba were relegated from La Liga last month after finishing bottom of the table, while they also failed in their quest to qualify for the Champions League. Their European campaign ended at the group stage, with Andone scoring one goal during the competition. Sportsmail understands that Villa could be set to miss out on the signing of 28-year-old forward Leroy Fer as he has agreed a contract with Chinese side Hangzhou Greentown. The Holland international was a target for Roberto Di Matteo and is valued at £5million. Aston Villa are also chasing Atletico Madrid striker Adrian Lopez, who could join them on loan. Andone's proposed arrival would further strengthen the club's attacking line following their capture of Rudy Gestede from Blackburn in January. The Ivory Coast international has made an instant impact at Villa Park and scored his first goal for the club against Chelsea last Saturday, which helped them draw 1-1 with the Premier League leaders. Gestede, 25, joined the Midlands club on loan until the end of the season but could remain in Birmingham beyond that. He is expected to stay at Villa Park during the summer and could earn a permanent move. Sportsmail understands there have also been talks over a possible deal for Atletico Madrid's Adrian Lopez. The 28-year-old is out of favour at the Vicente Calderon but has found his way back into Atleti's first team following Diego Simeone's return to the club this season. Villa are also keen on Fulham midfielder Emerson Hyndman, who could be allowed to leave Craven Cottage on loan in the summer. The American is yet to make his debut for Jol's side but has impressed while out on loan at Bournemouth and has been linked with a switch to Villa Park in recent weeks.
