The icebergs pool is one of the most popular places for swimming in Australia and it is always busy on weekends, especially on holidays. The people who use the pool are mostly families with children under 13 years old. I think this type of closure can be quite scary because they do not know what has happened to their pool and they may never go back again if it takes too long to fix. It would also be very inconvenient for these people as well as those who live near by where they would have no access at all to a pool during summer months when the weather is hotter than usual in Australia which is what we call “Summer”. The only way that we know of how many people are using this swimming pool each week is through membership fees paid every year but even then, there could be some children who haven’t been able to pay yet so it might not reflect exactly how many people are actually swimming here daily or even weekly. This may also mean that more people have moved away from Bondi due to housing prices rising too quickly and they can no longer afford rentals anymore so instead of living close by like before, now there’s only 10 minutes drive between their new home in another suburb where rents are cheaper than here at Bondi Beach (where most people live).
