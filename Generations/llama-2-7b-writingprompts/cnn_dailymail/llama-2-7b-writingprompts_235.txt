This was a very interesting short story. The protagonist (Alex Impey) in this story has a certain sense of morality about him even though he is breaking the law by selling marijuana to his customers. I thought that it was pretty cool how he didn't care about breaking the law so long as he was helping people out, which I can relate to because I believe in helping others no matter what you need to do. Another thing that was interesting is that even though this story takes place in present time and marijuana has been legalized for recreational use in Canada for some time now, there are still people who think it should not be legal at all which is really ironic because if the law does not allow something then it's not likely that we will change our minds about it. One last thing I want to mention before ending my response is how this story had no plot whatsoever and yet was still very interesting and engaging enough to keep me reading until I finished it so maybe there isn't always a need for a plot in every piece of literature out there!
