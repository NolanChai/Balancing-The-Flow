Jarrett Stall was caught smoking pot?! What a surprise. He’s always been such a model citizen….. Wait what? You know that guy? Oh that Jarret Stall you mean. The one who’s arrested on drug charges about once or twice every couple of years, but never goes to jail because he’s got the money to post bail? Yeah, I’ve heard of him.
