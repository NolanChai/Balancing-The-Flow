Detectives probing the suspected murder of a landlady who disappeared 17 years ago have dug up the patio of her pub. Deborah Steel, 37, who ran the Royal Standard pub in Ely, Cambridgeshire, was last seen on CCTV at home at 10:22 pm on August 3, 2005. The landlady’s body has never been found but detectives from the Major Crime Unit have now discovered what they believe is her blood on a concrete block in the garden of the pub, which was originally called the Tiger and later became known as the Red Lion before it closed earlier this year. Inquiries are now underway to see whether other remains could be located nearby. “The discovery is consistent with human blood,” Det Supt Gary Flint, who is leading the investigation, said yesterday.
