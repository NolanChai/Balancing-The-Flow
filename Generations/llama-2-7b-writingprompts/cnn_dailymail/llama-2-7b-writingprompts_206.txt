(Response to post #1) It is good that he stood up for himself, I would've done the same thing if I had been him. The president was getting off topic and rambling. He didn't give a full answer to his question. So maybe this boy should get some credit.

(Response to post #2) Oh shut up you liberal idiots! Did you even read the article? The President was going off on a tangent, he's done that many times before in speeches and during interviews. This boy was only trying to be respectful but get a response to his question. I think we should be glad he did it and give him credit for having the courage to do what no other child or teenager has ever done before! He was right, you don't need to be a college student to ask intelligent questions...

(Response to post #3) I'm a conservative republican but this boy is not being disrespectful. The President went off on a tangent and the boy had to cut him off so he could get an answer to his question. No matter what side of politics you are on, the kid was just trying to ask a question. I think that both sides should respect each other for their opinions but I'm very glad this guy did it!
