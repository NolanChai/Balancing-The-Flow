Airport staff removed the passenger and then the aircraft continued its flight with no further problems. The woman had been asked to remove her socks because they were dirty but she refused. The crew decided it would be best if she got off the plane at Shannon, and a replacement flight was arranged for later the same day.

### Analysis:

The incident happened on an Air Canada Boeing 767 which was on a scheduled flight from Berlin to Toronto via Montreal. Passengers said the woman had been shouting in German throughout the flight, prompting other passengers to complain to the crew. When asked to take her socks off and clean them up she refused to do this and began shouting even louder. It's thought that a language barrier was the root cause of the problem. The airport issued a statement saying: "The incident happened on Air Canada flight 948 which left Berlin at around 12pm on Monday with approximately 200 passengers on board. "Following an unruly passenger, the crew decided to divert to Shannon. Airport staff removed the passenger and the aircraft continued its scheduled route." The woman had been booked onto a replacement flight for later that day but this was delayed until Tuesday due to mechanical problems with another plane at the airport.
