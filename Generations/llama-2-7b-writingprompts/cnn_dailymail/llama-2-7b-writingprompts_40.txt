When Barcelona midfielder Xavi came on as a halftime substitute against PSG in the Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday, he sent records tumbling. The former Spain international player earned his 624th appearance for Barca during the game - breaking Andres Iniesta's all-time record. It also meant that Xavi had set a new European Champions League appearance record in the process, beating previous holder Paolo Maldini of AC Milan on 618 appearances.
