I think that this article is absolutely hilarious. I just wish that more people were able to see things from the other side. So many people take advantage of benefits and do not want to work. There are a lot of people out there who do not even know where their next paycheck will come from, while others spend money on non-essentials such as vacations or parties. In my opinion it is very unfair that we have to take care of other's who just don't want to work, but at the same time we are all human and should be able to enjoy our basic human rights. I think this article is a good example on how there needs to be some sort of system in place to regulate these types of situations.
