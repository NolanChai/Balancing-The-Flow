The 32-year-old Argentine has won a host of trophies throughout his career and was part of Leicester City's first team that lifted the FA Cup in 2016, but he is yet to taste success on the Premier League stage. And even though Leicester are battling against relegation this season - they currently sit third from bottom with one game remaining - Cambiasso is adamant he would consider his season as a success if it ended in survival.
Speaking to Foxes TV ahead of Saturday's clash with Everton, he said: "I think being part of Leicester and playing Premier League football is already an achievement. It's not easy because the league has very good teams." He continued: "I think it would be a great honour for me to finish this season at Leicester City in the Premier League."
