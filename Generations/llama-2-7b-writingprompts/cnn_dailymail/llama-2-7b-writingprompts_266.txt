England midfielders Jordan Henderson and Jack Wilshere are the surprise names on Manchester City's summer shopping list. The struggling [Barclay's Premier League champions](http://www.bbc.com/news/10431926) know they need more English players after losing out to Chelsea in the battle for Ashley Cole, and are considering moves for Sunderland's Henderson and Arsenal's Wilshere. Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini is also understood to be keen on Liverpool midfielder Joe Allen, but a move looks unlikely due to his Â£16m [valuation](http://www.bbc.com/news/10429835). Liverpool boss Kenny Dalglish has said Henderson will stay at Anfield, but added that the 21-year-old could go out on loan if he is unhappy with his first team opportunities. ----- Source: [BBC](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-13794861)
