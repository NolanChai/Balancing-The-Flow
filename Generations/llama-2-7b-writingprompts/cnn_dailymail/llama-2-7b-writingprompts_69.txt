The LFP responded on Monday, saying that there was no rule against it and that the tradition is more important than ever given current events in France.

"We were told by our president (Geronimi) this morning that we should not go to congratulate him because he did not come down to shake the players' hands after the game," PSG director Leonardo said at a news conference on Monday. "It was not important? It is more important in these days. When you are talking about French football, you have to do it."

"The president has asked me if I agree with the LFP statement that there is no rule for players to go down and shake hands after a game," Leonardo said at his press conference on Tuesday ahead of PSG's Champions League last 16 second leg. "I would like them to take responsibility, we are talking about a president who is not coming down to congratulate the team that won the title and that is what we want to talk about today."

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel also expressed his disappointment with Geronimi's comments.
"It was very clear from Bastia’s reaction at the end of the match,” he said. “I think they did not understand or did not want to understand that we wanted to shake hands, that it is a normal thing, even in difficult times."

### Aftermath:

The incident has sparked further debate about whether sporting events should be suspended amid the terror attacks across France. Geronimi said on Wednesday he would not back down from his comments, but added that he was "very sad" following Thiriez's death on Sunday.
