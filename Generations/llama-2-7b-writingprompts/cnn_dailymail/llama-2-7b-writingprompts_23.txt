This is not the first time that Wasps have been denied a famous win because of an officiating howler from one of their European games. The most recent example being their last match in this competition when they were robbed by the referee of what looked to be a try in the dying embers of their clash with Munster. This has happened on more than one occasion, and it’s not fair. Rugby is about trying your best and performing well to win games for your team. The game should be about whoever plays best that day. But instead we see matches being decided by people in the middle that are sometimes not even aware of what is going on out on the pitch or in some cases, aren’t even qualified enough to do their jobs properly. It seems that officiating at international level has been a problem for years and this doesn’t seem to be improving. I would love to see more qualified referees doing their job at an elite level instead of just relying on the old guard who are past it or don’t have what it takes to get the top job in the first place. Wasps were robbed against Munster and again last night, but you can’t blame the players for these mistakes by officials as they are only human themselves. What they should do is continue to play the game they love with passion and fight until those who make decisions regarding their matches do their job properly and give them a fair shake. Wasps showed that last night, but in the end it was not enough because of an inexcusable oversight by referee Frank Murphy which is unfair to both sides and should be rectified immediately or rugby will suffer for it in the long term if this type of thing carries on unchecked.

### Recommendation:
I would recommend that Wasps continue with their fight against the odds as they always have done, but also demand more from referees who make decisions which affect how games are decided. This is an issue that needs addressing immediately before it leads to something even worse in the future because when teams get used to having their matches decided by officials, then we will start seeing more cheating on the pitch as they try and influence what happens with their own eyes instead of relying solely on those of a referee. Wasps may be out but this does not mean that others can’t do it instead if they put in enough effort and make sure to have an excellent team strategy going into each game. I am confident that Dai Young will lead his Wasps side back to where they belong, but also hope for him and others like him around Europe to get what they deserve when playing at the highest level of this sport by getting proper referees who know how to do their job correctly in charge of these types of matches going forward.
