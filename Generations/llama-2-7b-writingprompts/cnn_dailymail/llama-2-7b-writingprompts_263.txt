### Explanation:
When she gave birth to her son, Natasha's older brother, in 1983, Paula McKay received a shock when doctors handed over the baby. The child was covered from head-to-foot with blood and had to be taken into intensive care as he was blue. Doctors said they would investigate what had happened but never did so. When Natasha arrived in 1985, she too needed resuscitating, and when her mother held the newborn baby for the first time, there was a small cut on her chin that was bleeding profusely. She immediately demanded answers as to how this could have happened but again doctors said they would look into it. The McKays are suing the hospital because of these incidents.
