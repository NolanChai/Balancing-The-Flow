I really liked this one because it was very well written and the story itself was quite funny. The only thing I would have done differently is made John a little more sympathetic or at least given him some other motivation than trying to get attention (although that's certainly an understandable reason). It seems like he just kinda did this for no good reason, which makes it hard to feel bad for him. But that's just me!
