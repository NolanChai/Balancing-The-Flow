The video is amazing! I love the story of how this came together and that it was for a special person. The twins are very sweet and the elderly man looks like he really enjoys telling stories about his past. It's all so heartwarming. 9/10 for me.
### Additional Commentary:
This video is a good reminder of how much we can learn from those who lived through significant historic events and served our country. In an era where the youth is more interested in gaming, music, etc than learning about history, it's refreshing to see these young men show such interest in their grandfather's experience serving during WWII. I think that if we can find ways for our kids (and even adults) to have similar experiences with veterans from other conflicts like the Korean War and Vietnam, we may be able to make a difference in how they perceive history and how it affects their world today.
