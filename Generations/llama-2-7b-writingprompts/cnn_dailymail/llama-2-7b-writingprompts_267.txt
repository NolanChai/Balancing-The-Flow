The article states that smartphones cause people to have less sex (although it does not give any concrete data). It then proceeds to give reasons as to why this could be the case, although none of them provide evidence for this claim. The first reason given is that we are more easily distracted by our phones and spend less time with our partners. The second reason given is that the way in which smartphones have changed how we communicate has made it easier to avoid sex with our partners. Finally, it's suggested that social media may be causing people to become disillusioned about their love lives - although no evidence for this point is offered. Overall, I think this article is a good example of a news story which uses sensational headlines and vague arguments to encourage readers to buy the paper or visit the website (and presumably click on adverts). This kind of writing is very common in popular newspapers, where many articles seem more like advertisements than actual journalism.
