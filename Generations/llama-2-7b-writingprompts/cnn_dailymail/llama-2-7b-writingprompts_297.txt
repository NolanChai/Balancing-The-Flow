This is one of those rare instances where I think the news media may have failed in its obligation to report the truth.  If you read this story, it appears that Hennells was not only admitting his plan but also soliciting help from others.  The fact that he posted a link to a map of Tesco supermarkets was even more damning.  It appears that if he had simply done something on the night in question (for example, tried to rob a bank), there would be no story at all.
