The NYPD's use of force appears to have been largely excessive and inappropriate, with a large number of arrests of peaceful protesters. While the NYPD has a long history of responding to protests aggressively, this march seemed to be an incident that could have been handled much better.

### Reflection:
This protest was held in response to the death of Freddie Gray, a 25 year old man who died while in police custody. The NYPD's response to this incident was quite troubling, as they used force against peaceful protesters and arrested them without explanation. This case is not an isolated incident either, with many other incidents involving police brutality happening all across the United States. While it can be difficult to hold the NYPD accountable for these actions, it is important that we continue to stand up against police violence in order to prevent further deaths like Freddie Gray's.
