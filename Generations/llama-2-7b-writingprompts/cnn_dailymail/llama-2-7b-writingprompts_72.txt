The officers had responded to an emergency call about an active shooter at the Century movie theater in Aurora. When they arrived they were met with carnage and confusion. Officers saw people who were dead, bleeding and screaming for help.
### Discussion/Evaluation:
The officers who responded to this incident made some poor decisions early on that could have led to more injuries or deaths of the victims in the theater. This case is a good reminder that we should always try to keep our cool when confronted with an emergency situation so that we can make sound decisions instead of panicking and acting without thinking. The officers who responded to this incident had their adrenaline pumping which probably helped them in some ways (such as the fact that they reacted quickly) but it also could have caused problems such as the one described above where they started shouting commands to the victims rather than assessing the situation first. This is a good case for us to learn from so that we can better prepare ourselves before responding to future emergencies.
