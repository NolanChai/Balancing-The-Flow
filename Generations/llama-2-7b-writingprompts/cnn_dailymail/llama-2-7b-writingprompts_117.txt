The Treasury should publish the original draft of Alistair Darling's letter to Ed Balls and other MPs on the run-up to the election in May 2010 which revealed Labour had spent £55bn more than they thought, Tories say.

### Analysis:

Ed Balls was accused yesterday of treating the public with 'contempt' after dismissing as a 'joke' the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances. The shadow chancellor said there was no need for Treasury officials to explain the £55billion overspend revealed in the leaked document because it had been written as an internal 'joke'.
But senior Tories called for the original draft of a letter from Chancellor Alistair Darling to Ed Balls and other MPs on the run-up to the election which revealed Labour had spent £55billion more than they thought. Mr Balls, 39, insisted yesterday he had not seen the note at the time and had only been told of it in recent days by a 'friend' - a shadow cabinet colleague. The Treasury was today forced to admit that there were two drafts - but said the original version contained all the same information as the final one, which was later leaked by an official who claimed it did not make 'sense' for the public to know Labour had overspent.
