The pressure is well and truly on our relegation rivals and we must take advantage of this. If we do not pick up results then we will be sucked into a battle for survival, but if we keep our cool and continue to perform like we did against Fulham in the cup I believe that we can stay up. We just have to keep getting points on the board and we will be fine.
