Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin will leave Everton at the end of their current deals, Roberto Martinez has confirmed, ending a 15-year association with the club for one player and just under six years for the other. The Spaniard was signed by David Moyes in November 2005 from Wigan Athletic for £7 million but, despite a spell as caretaker manager at Goodison Park before Roberto Mancini's arrival, he played only 89 games over seven seasons with his longest stay being just under two years.

Distin arrived on Merseyside in the summer of 2010 and was signed by then boss David Moyes for £4 million from Portsmouth having previously had spells at Manchester City, Bolton Wanderers and Rangers. The Frenchman made his 376th Everton appearance when he started on Boxing Day last year and is understood to have been offered a deal of two years with the option of another if certain performance-related targets are met but Martinez confirmed that both players had turned down those offers in order to seek other options.
