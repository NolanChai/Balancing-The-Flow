The goblin chief had gathered his people and told them of this terrible thing that came. A great beast of fire, a dragon, would lay waste to the town if they didn't act now. They had gathered their food from the fields, and prepared their weapons in case they were needed. The town was small enough that no one could escape by walking, but there was one place they could go for refuge; a small island of rock with high cliffs surrounding it.
