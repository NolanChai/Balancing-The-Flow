My friend Sarah had lived through the plague. Everyone else had died and now she was all alone in this world.
 
 She knew how to read though, and after years of searching she found a book that told her about a world outside of the one she was living in. It said that it's people were far more advanced than humans could ever hope to be, and they would help anyone who needed it. 
 
 Sarah gathered together everything she had and walked out into the wilderness. She walked for weeks until she reached a small town. 
 
 The inhabitants were scared of her because she looked like some kind of animal, but they didn't have a choice but to help her. After all, it was in their best interest that Sarah could be healed and brought back into society so they could teach her the things she needed to know. 
 
 When the last town had run out of supplies, Sarah had been given to the elders who'd taught her about the world around her. The towns people were scared of her because she looked like some kind of animal and it was in their best interest that Sarah be healed and brought back into society so they could teach her the things she needed to know. 
 
 Sarah was told that it had all been a dream, but she knew better than that. The dreams were too vivid, the people were far more advanced then humans could ever hope to be, and they would help anyone who needed it. 
 
 She had no proof of what the world really looked like beyond this one, but she knew it was real because her sister had written about it in her journals before she'd died from the plague. Sarah gathered together everything she had and walked out into the wilderness.
 
 Sarah's sister Rabecca had lived through a terrible plague that had killed everyone except for herself and Sarah. Afterwards, she took what supplies were left to them and traveled far away in search of help from those who would come back after it was over. She hoped they'd find a cure or at least some way to save their lives until then.
 
 However, she never returned because one day while exploring alone Sarah discovered an abandoned town called "Town." There were no signs that anyone had lived there for many years and it appeared as though the inhabitants had fled in fear of something unknown. She took what supplies were left to them and walked out into the wilderness. 
 
 When she got back home, Rabecca was gone but Sarah knew exactly where to look because her sister had written about it in one of her journals before she'd died from the plague. 
 
 She gathered together everything she had and headed out into the wilderness looking for help from those who would come back after it was over. However, when Sarah returned home there was no sign of Rabecca or any other human beings in sight so Sarah decided to search further afield until she found some kind of shelter or safety. 
 
 This story is about a young girl named Sarah who has just lost her mother and father in the plague that ravaged their town. She and her sister are left all alone, but after years of searching, Sarah finds an abandoned book that tells her there's a world outside where people are far more advanced than humans could ever hope to be and they would help anyone who needed it. 
 
 The people in the town were scared of her because she looked like some kind of animal and so they didn't have much choice but to take care of Sarah until she was healed enough to join society again. When the last town had run out of supplies, they gave her to their elders who taught her all about what happened after humans died off on Earth.
 
 It turns out that everything was a dream because the world is now inhabited by machines and robots instead of people like before. 
 
 Sarah's sister Rabecca had written in her journal before she'd passed from the plague how she'd found an abandoned book about a world outside where people are far more advanced than humans could ever hope to be and would help anyone who needed it. However, when Rabecca tried to travel there herself, no one was waiting for her on the other side so she returned home alone with nothing but memories of what might have been if only...
 
 The story takes place in a world that is far more advanced than our own and people are very different from us as well.
