I think it is not possible to produce pain without damaging any resources (physical or mental) of one person or another. I've never seen an experiment that was done to cause a feeling like pain to another human being. Even in those cases when they use electricity, the current goes through their own body. Pain can be caused only by something physically touching our skin (at least from my experience). If you want to torture someone, just beat him with something that can hurt him or her, or make a knife and cut his/her flesh. All those things will cause pain, but not some kind of pain like the one we feel in our body when we are harmed by any physical means (such as cutting).
