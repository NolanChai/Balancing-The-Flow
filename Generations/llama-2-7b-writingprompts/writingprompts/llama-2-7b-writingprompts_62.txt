At ease? How is this possible?! How did we get here? Is it still in my head or has it moved into my body? I can see myself, hear myself. This...this cannot be real but here I stand. This man does not look like a soldier nor is he dressed for one, yet there he stands with the ease of someone that could snap me at will should he so wish and no doubt would have been able to had the choice been given him. My eyes fell upon my uniform. It's torn and bloody but the blood isn't mine. I have not felt pain or exertion, merely...the cold. Why am I here? Why is it that the world has been made anew with this man standing before me in his suit and no one else around? 
 
 `` At ease, soldier.'' He told her again with a smile and she nodded numbly at him. The words rang hollow against her ears and yet they seemed to reverberate through her body. She could see the world around her but it was not hers. It belonged to him alone. Everything else was grey and cold, save for this man's eyes which were a brilliant blue that would melt into ice at a moments notice. He stepped closer to her and she backed away instinctively, trying to find something...anything else. She looked around frantically, not daring to turn away from him lest he become angry with her for it. She felt the chill of his eyes as they ran over her like ice over a pond. Her feet would no longer move and she fell to the ground clutching herself. 
 `` At ease soldier'' He said once again, now only inches away from her. `` There is nothing to be afraid of here. I am here to help you.'' She shook with terror, the man's eyes a mere centimeter above hers as he bent down slowly until his face was level with hers and she looked up into them. Her breath caught in her throat as he spoke once more; `` It is time for us to start again...this time I will not let you fail.'' He smiled at her before turning away and disappearing.
