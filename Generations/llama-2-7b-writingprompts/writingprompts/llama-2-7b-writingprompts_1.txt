`` Do not worry, you will get used to it.'' I heard the voice of the man behind me. His words were soothing and gentle. I did n't turn around to look at him. Instead I stared at the door, wondering if I could break through it. The thought brought a shiver up my spine. It was not only thick but it was also reinforced with some sort of metal plates. `` You are safe here.'' His voice reached me again and for once I did n't mind that it was coming from behind me. My heartbeat slowed down slightly as I felt the weight of his hand on my shoulder. It was warm. For a moment we stood like this, in silence. Then the man sighed before he took a step backward. `` Please,'' He said, `` You may call me Caspian.'' At first I did n't reply to him because I felt awkward, but then again it was not as if I had any better options. `` Hello,'' I finally answered, and for a moment I felt his body tremble behind me before he sighed again. For a few moments we stood there in silence again until Caspian spoke up again:
`` Please, take my hand. It will be easier to lead you if you hold it.'' This time I did not hesitate but grabbed his hand instead and let him guide me. He led me around the room. The space was large, almost twice as big as a small bedroom, with a long table in one corner and several chairs. A bookshelf stood against another wall that contained many different books. As I walked through this room, I wondered what it must have been like when Caspian's wife was still here, and where she went now. As if he could sense my thoughts, Caspian answered:
`` She is safe with the others.'' The others were the other people that he mentioned before. `` It is not a prison; it is a home.'' For the first time I noticed that there was another door at the far end of this room and walked toward it until I reached it, only to realize that this one was locked as well. Then Caspian spoke again:
`` This one you can't open. The others are unlocked; if you want we will look for a room where you may sleep tonight.'' A wave of exhaustion hit me and I sat down on the floor, leaning against the door. My legs were shaking slightly under me. Caspian sat next to me without saying anything as he looked at me, his gaze calm yet sad.
