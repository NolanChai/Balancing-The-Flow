[ _**It's an exciting world, isn't it?**_ ]
The sound was like a loud sigh. The soft thumping of a heartbeat filled my ears, and suddenly it became difficult to breathe. I was frozen in place on the street; time seemed to slow down around me. I knew exactly who it was. She'd been waiting for me, sitting across the room when we met that night. I had thought she would never notice me, but she was as much a part of this race as I was.
[ _**I have loved you since I first laid eyes on your face**_ ]
Her voice seemed to come from all around me, and yet somehow it was coming directly into my head. The words filled me with a warmth that I had never felt before. Her voice was beautiful. She was perfect in every way. And the more she spoke, the stronger that feeling became.
[ _**You are my champion, and you will always be my heart**_ ]
I could feel her hand on mine as it reached out to touch hers. It felt like a wave of energy crashing into me; I was filled with an overwhelming sense of love. She wanted me to know that she would always be there for me, and that no matter what happened in this race or any other, she would never leave my side.
[ _**I've seen you through so many battles, but this one is the biggest yet**_ ]
It was then that I realized who she really was. She had been waiting for me all along - a beautiful woman dressed in white with long red hair and eyes of fire. As soon as her hand touched mine, my world began to change. Suddenly everything around us seemed brighter than before; the sun shone down upon us like never before, and yet at the same time I felt like there was an overwhelming darkness all around me. The darkness was coming for me - but it didn't matter because she loved me too much to let me go!
[ _**You will always be my champion**_ ]
I turned away from her hand and looked at the street in front of me. It seemed as if time had stopped once again, and I could feel my heart beating faster than ever before - but it didn't matter because she loved me too much to let me go!
[ _**You will always have my love**_ ]
I took a step forward into the darkness, and suddenly everything went black. But when I opened my eyes again there was only one thing left - her hand in mine as we walked together towards victory...
