Don didn't know what was going on and he was afraid. 

 His brain felt like it had been rattled around in a tin can. He tried not to think about that feeling. 

 As the light crept through the crack beneath his door, he realized that there was no one else with him. At first this comforted him, but as time passed and he saw the sun rise outside of his window, he began to worry. There was nothing for miles around. Nothing human. If he wanted to survive here... He would have to find a way out on his own.
