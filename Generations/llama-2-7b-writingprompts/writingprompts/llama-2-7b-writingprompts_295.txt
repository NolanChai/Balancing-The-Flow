There are many kinds of desire in life, some more pure than others. Some desires are good and some not so much. Desire can be a motivator for good or bad. The desire to improve yourself is a great motive. A desire to kill the enemy, perhaps not as good of a thing.
I've always said that desire is what moves us forward. Without it we would just stay in one place doing nothing. If you have no goals then there's nothing to work towards and your life has little meaning or direction. Having too much desire can also be bad, I think I speak for the majority of people when I say "too many desires is a bad thing".
