What a beautiful woman. I wonder what it would be like to kiss her. 
 I close my eyes and let the wall return me to bed, but the image is still there. She smiles at me. What should I do? I stand up and walk to the doorway. 
 I open the door and it changes to an image of a boy who looks so much like her. He is sleeping with his back turned away from me. A small, soft smile forms on my face as I look at him. I want to wake him. I turn to go and I see them together, standing beside each other in the darkened room. I stand there for a moment before turning again into my bedroom. 
 I sit down and watch her smile at me, a sweet and happy one. She holds up her hand and it changes back to an image of my sleeping boyfriend who is still facing away from me. 
 I want to kiss them both, but how do I do that? The image shifts again and it shows the two of them standing together in the room. A smile crosses her face as she takes his hand into hers. He turns around to look at her with a quizzical expression on his face and she looks back at him with an innocent, beautiful smile. I want that...I want to be her...
