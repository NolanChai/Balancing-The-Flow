As I climbed over the edge, I noticed a small shack. As I walked towards the shack, I heard the faint sounds of people talking inside. Upon entering, I found myself in the middle of what looked like an old farm. There was a man working on one side of the field and his wife was cooking some food on the other side of the house.
As I approached them both, I said "I am sorry to interrupt your evening, but I need your help". The husband replied saying "what is it that you want?" I said "I need to get back home, however, my plane crashed and I do n't know where it landed or what direction it went in. Do you have a boat that we can use? If so, I would like to borrow it". He replied saying "Yes, we do. We live on an island and if you could n't find your plane then you must be in the right area of the ocean to find ours. We can leave for your island tomorrow at 9 am".
I said "Great! I will see you both first thing tomorrow morning." They replied saying "Of course. Have a good night!" As they left, I grabbed some food from their kitchen and ate it as I sat at the table. Once I was finished eating, I fell asleep on the couch in the living room of the farm.
The next morning came quickly for me. I woke up just after 6 am and hurried outside to say goodbye to the man and his wife before they left with their boat. After saying my goodbyes, I ran back inside and grabbed a suitcase to bring along in case I wanted to stay there for a few days and search for my plane.
The couple had arrived on an old wooden boat that looked to be as old as the house itself. The man pulled it up onto the shore just off of the beach near where I was sitting on the couch. He then opened up the front door of the cabin and told me to come get in the boat if I wanted to go back home.
