It was a warm sunny morning when Sandra opened her eyes, she could feel the breeze blowing through the window, as she rolled over it became clear that today was going to be a perfect day. She got out of bed and put on her favorite pink silk robe then walked down stairs to the kitchen where she made herself some coffee while listening to the latest news from across the globe. After having some coffee Sandra went back upstairs, took a shower and brushed her teeth before putting on a pair of jeans, a t-shirt and one of her many hand knit scarfs. Then she walked down stairs again where she was met by a tall dark haired man. He had blue eyes and was wearing a pair of faded old blue jeans and a black muscle shirt. As he walked up to Sandra, she kissed him on the cheek then walked back into the kitchen for more coffee while her husband got dressed. After getting dressed herself Sandra headed out to her office where she would spend the day reviewing manuscripts for her two best friends and clients Jane and James.
