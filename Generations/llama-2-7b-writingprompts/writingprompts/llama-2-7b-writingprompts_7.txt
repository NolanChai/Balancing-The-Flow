Christopher walked around his truck looking over it. It needed a wash really bad. He didn't have the time to do it himself, so that meant going to get it done. Maybe he would call on his way home. A car pulled in next to him, and he heard a knock at his window. Slowly, he rolled down the window to see who had stopped. "Excuse me sir but I have a question for you." A man in dark colored clothes said. He looked like a bum or something, so Christopher didn't say anything. The man continued, "Can I please have some money?" Christopher stared at him for a moment before turning away and continuing with his walk to the truck. As he opened the door the man quickly spoke again, "Please sir can you spare me a dollar?" Christopher slammed the door on the guy and walked around to the driver's side of the truck. He got into the cab, started it up, and pulled out onto the road. A few minutes later he found himself at his home. Grabbing his phone off the seat he looked at his texts from Jennifer before putting it back down. As he stepped out of the truck the man was standing right in front of him. Christopher looked around for a moment to see where the guy had came from, but he wasn't anywhere to be found. He got into the house and quickly got upstairs to change his clothes. He threw on some sweats and a t-shirt before heading back downstairs. He grabbed his phone as soon as he walked in, expecting a text from Jennifer. Instead, it was a missed call from her and a message saying that she would be there at 4:30. Christopher sighed deeply, thinking of the time they had spent together before going to bed early. As soon as he did fall asleep he started dreaming about being in school again. The dreams were always the same; sitting in class while his mind wondered somewhere else. He never spoke with anyone or raised a hand. The only thing he was sure of, was that his English teacher, Mr. Jones, had taken an extreme liking to Christopher's hair. "Mr. Hicks," said a voice from behind him. Christopher opened his eyes to see a girl standing right next to him. He quickly sat up, and realized who it was. Jennifer had come back for their first date together. The two of them looked at each other as she continued speaking. "You don't have to go if you do n't want," said Jennifer with her sweet smile. Christopher looked into her eyes, they were beautiful. "I really appreciate this," he said before standing up and grabbing his coat from the back of a chair. The two made their way outside, and Christopher went to lock the door behind them. As soon as it was locked they started walking to the restaurant where they had planned on meeting for dinner. It did n't take long at all for Christopher to realize that he forgot his phone in the house. He stopped Jennifer so she could wait while he ran back inside to grab it. Christopher quickly walked upstairs and grabbed his phone before running down. "Are you ready to go?" asked Jennifer as soon as he was close enough. He nodded his head and they started walking again. Christopher looked at the menu, not wanting to seem rude by staring at her or anything. In a way she reminded him of himself; shy and nervous around new people. As soon as he got through the front door of the restaurant he realized that he left his wallet in his truck too. He quickly ran back outside, but it was gone. Christopher looked all over for his phone or wallet, but to no avail. "Do you need help finding something?" asked a voice from behind him. The two turned around to see an employee of the restaurant standing there. Before she could say anything more he interrupted her. "My wife left my wallet in our truck." "I'm sorry sir, I have n't seen any trucks parked here today," said the woman with a sad look on her face. Christopher quickly apologized and walked away to get something to drink while he waited for Jennifer. He went inside to the counter and got a cup of water before heading back out front. The two sat down at one of the tables in the restaurant, and Jennifer ordered food and drinks before she even noticed that it was n't on her table. As soon as their food arrived they dove right into the meal, Christopher could tell that Jennifer was hungry from all the time they spent together. The two talked for hours, and neither of them noticed when the sun had set. It was almost midnight by the time Jennifer finished with dinner. She stood up to leave but Chris did n't say anything. "Are you coming?" asked Jennifer as she turned to look at him. He shook his head no before standing back up. Christopher watched her walk out, and he started thinking of why he was even here in the first place. He thought about the dreams he had that night, and how he felt when he saw her face for the first time. He wanted to see where this would go with Jennifer, and decided right there and then to ask her out again. Christopher walked back inside and went upstairs to grab his phone before coming down to meet Jennifer at the door. It did n't take long for him to find it, and he stepped outside quickly as soon as he grabbed it from a table in the kitchen. He saw Jenni walking away and started running after her. "Jen," called out Christopher, but she was already gone. The two of them had been together since they met back then. They went to dinner and walked through the park before returning home for what seemed like forever. The two laid down on the bed next to each other, but neither could fall asleep. Jennifer had fallen asleep first, so Christopher stayed awake to watch her sleep until morning. He woke up early to find that she was gone already, and he left after finishing his coffee. He drove home before realizing that he forgot something. The two of them sat on the couch, both watching a movie that they had seen together so many times. Christopher fell asleep before it even got dark outside, but this time Jennifer did n't wake up to watch him fall asleep. He sat in the driver's seat and looked out at the world around him. It was beautiful outside today, which made Christopher think about how much he has missed over these last few years. He took a deep breath before shaking his head. He had n't seen Jennifer for months now, and he did n't know what to do. All he knew was that he had to tell her the truth; he was sorry for lying all this time. "Were you really going to leave me?" asked Christopher from across the room. The two looked at each other before he started walking closer to where Jennifer sat on the couch. He held out his hand and she took it, letting him help her up from the couch. Both of them stood there for a moment looking into each others eyes when suddenly Jennifer leaned forward to kiss Christopher's cheek. "I missed you," said Christopher before kissing her softly on the lips. He pulled back and smiled at her before asking, "What are we going to do now?" She laughed and replied, "It's up to us."
