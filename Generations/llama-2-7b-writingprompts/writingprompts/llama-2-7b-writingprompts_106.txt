We were once a great species that walked the many plains of North America. Sure we had natural enemies; wolves and other large predators, and even the occasional native. Although it was always distressing when one or two went missing, as time passed we grew accustomed to these threats. We still hunted in packs just as our ancestors once did. They would travel for miles and days on end searching for their next meal, but were rewarded with bison carcasses. One day, our luck ran out. After months of hard work, we came upon a vast herd of bison. Our stomachs rumbled at the thought of feasting once again. However as we approached to get within range we saw something that would forever change who we were and how we lived on earth. The herd was encircled by men with weapons. They had killed our bison, butchering them and leaving them to rot. We watched in horror as they began to skin the carcasses. We realized this was not a hunting party, these men were here to kill us. What did we do? As a group, we decided that we would stand our ground against these invaders and protect ourselves at all cost. So when one of them came within range he was met by a barrage of arrows from the rest of our group. We killed 23 before they were able to retreat in terror with the carcasses of their cattle. It was not long after we realized that we had no food. Our supplies, including the meat we saved for later on the trail were left behind when one of them shot an arrow into a pouch strapped to my horse’s saddle. My brother was wounded by a bullet and he could not continue our journey. We decided to make a camp close to where we found the cattle carcasses. We had no choice; if they came back for us, it would be best that we fight from a place of strength. On day 10 the men returned. They were much larger than us and they had weapons so sharp that they seemed to move on their own. One of them came close to our campfire and began taunting us as if to say “Come on little Indian, show me what you got”. My father stepped forward in rage, his hands shaking with fury, but he was shot before the word had even left his mouth. They were just standing there mocking us. Suddenly one of them brought out a large stone and tossed it at my mother. We never saw her again. The next day we started our journey for the homeland. I don’t know where that is, but I do know that if we find it we will be safe from these invaders forever more. They are much better suited to this country than us and as soon as we are strong enough they must pay. We have lost many of our people; brothers, sisters, mothers and fathers. But we will not stop until we find the homeland again.
