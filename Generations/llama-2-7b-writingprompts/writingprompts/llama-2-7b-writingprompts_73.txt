> Ow!`` Orville, you can't do that!'' Harold yelled. `` I have a bad cold.'' > Well, if you are so sick, why are you taking my order? I thought you had to be on duty during the lunch rush.'' Orville said in his gruff voice. > I don't feel well enough to stand!'' Harold whined. 
> 
> *******`` Then why did you come down?'' `` Well, my boss told me he had an errand that needed done and asked if anyone was willing to cover the front desk.'' Orville grumbled as his brow furrowed.  `` You're not well enough! What makes you think I'll be able to get someone in your spot?'' > Why don't you just take my order then, that would solve everything!'' Harold suggested. His eyes were watery and red like he had been crying. Orville stared at him for a moment before sighing heavily. 
> 
> *******`` Well, alright. I'll get your food ready. But if you keep coughing or sniffing I'm going to fire you on the spot!'' `` Why would you do that? You're the one who asked me to cover for him!'' Orville replied. Harold coughed into his hand and sneezed loudly before looking up at the wall clock, 12:27p.m.. 
> 
> *******`` Uh-huh.'' `` You don't look so well.'' Harold said, smiling weakly. Orville turned his attention back to the kitchen. `` I have a bad cold and coughed all morning. You're right though, my boss isn't going to be happy about this.'' > Well, as long as you don't get sick on us.'' Orville said sarcastically.  Harold laughed loudly, causing more people in the restaurant to turn towards his table. A woman with curly hair and a heavy makeup gazed over at him while licking her lips. Her eyes met Harold's and she smiled. The two men exchanged awkward smiles before Orville turned his attention back to the kitchen. He put on some gloves before grabbing an order that had been left in the window, `` CAN I HELP YOU?'' a man with messy hair wearing a chef's hat yelled at Harold and Orville from across the room. > Yes! My friend needs to get his food! He has a bad cold...'' Harold said as he rubbed his nose with his hand. The woman had started walking towards them, her curly brown hair bouncing around her shoulders. 
> 
> *******`` Excuse me miss? Can you go back to your table? You're in the way!'' Orville said sternly as he grabbed Harold by his arm and tried to pull him away from her. `` But I want my food...'' she whimpered, tugging on her purse strap with her free hand. She pulled out a twenty dollar bill and held it in front of Orville's face. 
> 
> *******`` Miss! Put that money down before we have to call the police! I'm sure you would like to get your food, but not like this...'' `` HAHA! You're so cute.'' she cooed. Orville shook his head and sighed heavily as Harold tried to get away from him again, pulling on the front of his shirt. 
> 
> *******`` Ugh, I need some space...'' Harold whined while standing next to the wall, trying to avoid her. `` Excuse me miss? You're blocking my friend! He has a bad cold and we have an order to get!'' Orville yelled as he placed his hands on his hips and stared at her. The woman giggled before patting him on the shoulder and taking Harold by the arm again. She walked him back towards their table, but he tried to break free and escape. 
> 
> *******`` I'll be right back.'' He said with a smile before running over to the counter in an attempt to get Orville's attention. `` HAHA! I don't know what you think is going on here, but this is not your fault. Now put that money down and let me order my food!'' Harold yelled as he pointed at her purse with his chubby finger. She opened her mouth to speak when a man in a suit walked over from the table next door. He had greasy hair and a beard with an orange goatee. 
> 
> *******`` Miss! What are you doing?'' He said sternly as he placed his hand on Harold's shoulder. She looked up at him, blinking rapidly before letting out a laugh that caused her to cough. `` Ooh! It looks like your friend has a cold...'' The man in the suit sighed heavily before looking over at Orville who had come back from the counter with a plate of food. Harold was already sitting down and wiping his nose with a napkin as he waited for Orville to set it on the table. He picked up his fork when Orville sat the plate down and looked at him, `` Now then, what can I get you?'' 
> 
> *******`` Nothing thanks. Just this...'' Harold replied as he gestured towards the food. The man in the suit gave him an awkward smile before looking back over at Orville. 
> 
> *******`` ARE YOU SURE?'' he yelled, pointing a finger at the plate. `` Oh... Yes! That's fine! Thanks!'' Harold said as he pushed some food around with his fork and picked it up. The man in the suit stared at him for a moment before looking back over at Orville and smiling again. He sat down on the other side of Harold, and they started talking about something that was going on in town. Orville had gone back to work as well and didn't seem bothered by any of it. 
> 
> *******`` Yo! What do you think?'' The woman with curly hair asked Orville. She took out a cigarette from her purse before lighting it up and taking a drag, coughing as she did so. Orville looked over at her and sighed heavily before shaking his head in frustration, `` Miss! Please put that down! I'm sure you do n't want to get caught by the police...'' She laughed as she took another drag before flicking the butt into a trashcan across from where Orville was standing. He walked over and picked it up before throwing it into the dumpster outside, `` That is not acceptable behavior! You could be hurt or sickened by second-hand smoke.'' `` HAHA! I'm sure you would n't like that...'' She replied as she smiled and winked at Orville. 
> 
> *******`` Miss? Put it out!'' he said sternly while pointing his finger at her cigarette. She shrugged before taking another drag, coughing loudly once more. `` HAHA! You're so funny. I think I like you...'' Orville shook his head and walked away from her table as she started laughing hysterically again. The man in the suit was still sitting with Harold next to him, talking about something else that had happened earlier that day. Orville went over to see if there were any more orders but found out he did n't have one for some reason or another. He looked around at all of the other tables while thinking about what had just occurred before turning his attention back towards Harold and Mr. Suit who was still talking when he decided it would be best not to interfere with them anymore...
