The tell-tale hiss of leaking plasma awoke the groggy captain. All around monitors and control panels chimed with errors and warnings. The captain did n't need a million credits worth of useless sensors to tell him what had happened: someone had hit them in the engine room! He stood up, stretching his back painfully. The door slid open, allowing the ship's medic to step inside.

`` How bad is it?'' he asked, patting the doctor on the shoulder. The doctor gave a little shrug.

`` Worst of all, you did n't have insurance!'' He said with a smug grin, before disappearing back out into the hallway. The captain sighed. Of course he could n't afford to pay for a proper repair crew... he had n't been paid in three months!

He stepped into the ship's hold and checked on his passengers: the two children were huddled together, crying. He pulled out another tissue from his pocket, dabbing at their faces with it. `` You know, I still do n't understand why you chose to take them in!'' he said to no one in particular, before heading back into the cockpit.
