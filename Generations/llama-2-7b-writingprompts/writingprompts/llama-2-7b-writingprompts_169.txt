Amy's hand rested on her stomach, which was fuller now than it had been yesterday or the day before that. She took a long look at Clay, who was still looking away from her, and realized she had to ask him. He must be scared. She was scared for herself, and even more so about his reaction if he found out about what happened with Kyle. 
 
 `` I'm pregnant,'' Amy said. 
 
 Clay looked up at her, stunned. His mouth hung open and she thought maybe the can had knocked a tooth loose. She waited for him to say something, but he just kept staring. He took his hand off of the faucet handle, spun around and left without saying anything else. 
 
 `` I'm sorry,'' Amy said when he was gone. She sat at the kitchen table, feeling empty. He was always such a good person, even when he had to be cruel or scary, and now she felt like maybe they were both so broken that there was nothing left of them. Maybe it didn't matter who they were before because they were too different from each other to get back together. She knew Clay wanted her, but not the way he used to. She was almost sure he had loved her once, and she tried so hard to love him back that it made her feel empty inside, like a shell with an empty belly that you could fill up if only you found enough food, but there never seemed to be enough. 
 
 `` Clay!'' she yelled down the hallway toward his room. He must have been sleeping because he didn't answer right away and then she heard him climb out of bed and go into the bathroom. A little later he came back, and they had sex again, though he did nothing to touch her or speak with her afterward. It was as if he were trying to use it to get rid of what was between them now. 
 
 The next morning Amy sat in his car when he woke up, the keys in the ignition and the car running. He had already put their things into storage. They took the furniture down from the bedroom, and she gave him all her paintings back with a note about how much they meant to her. She told him it was time for them to move on. 
 
 `` You're not pregnant,'' he said when they were in the car and heading toward the storage place. He didn't look at her, or even turn his head, just stared straight ahead out the windshield. She did n't think she had ever seen him so angry. 
 
 `` I'm sorry,'' Amy said again. He finally turned to her and looked her in the eyes. The way he was looking at her made her feel like maybe what happened with Kyle could be forgiven because there would always be something between them that no one else could touch. It was a part of him she had never been able to reach before, but now it seemed so easy, and she thought maybe this was the same thing he felt when he looked at her. She reached for his face with both hands and kissed him on the lips. He pulled away from her and drove them home in silence. 
 
 Amy had never been pregnant before, and so she did n't know what to expect during those first few weeks of morning sickness or how much she should be drinking. She tried to keep herself busy with work, but sometimes she felt like it was a trap, that they were all watching her, waiting for the baby to come out wrong so they could use her as an example. Clay had found work at a restaurant downtown, and he seemed happy enough when she saw him on his days off, but there was always something else bothering him, like there were too many people in the world who did n't deserve to be alive. She thought about telling him that maybe they could try again. Maybe they would get it right this time, and he would finally come back to her. But when she saw his face in those moments, all the pain of losing Kyle still there behind his eyes like a shadow, she knew that would never happen. 
 
 One night she was sitting on the couch watching a television show she did n't really care about and eating some ice cream from the carton she had found in their freezer. Her belly hurt so much that she could hardly move anymore, but Clay was still asleep down the hallway from her bedroom. She thought maybe he would startle awake when she got up to go pee because it did n't seem like anyone else lived there with them anymore and they had been together for nearly two years before either of them had ever stayed away from each other during the night, but he did n't wake at all. Amy fell asleep on the couch without knowing she was already too tired to keep herself awake. 
 
 She did not wake up until morning, and when she did the sun was high in the sky and Clay still slept down the hallway from her bedroom. She had been sleeping so soundly that she never felt him move at all. He was n't wearing his boots or any other shoes, only a pair of jeans he must have pulled on before going to bed. There were no footsteps anywhere near their door and no sounds from the kitchen. 
 
 Amy stood up, thinking maybe he had gotten out early because she did n't want him there anymore and so she was just going to leave without saying goodbye. But then she went into her room and saw that he had not left at all. He was in bed with a blanket over his feet, and the light from the window was making him look like a skeleton made of bones and shadows. There was no blood on his face or hands, but there was a hole underneath his ribcage where she knew he had been shot once again because it was the same place Kyle's bullet had torn into him two years before. She ran back out to the kitchen and dialed 9-1-1 and told the man on the other end of the line that her boyfriend was dead, but no one could hear her because she had already fainted with the shock. 
 
 `` It's going to be alright,'' Amy said when she opened her eyes again. She looked down at Clay's body and thought maybe there really was nothing left of them anymore. Maybe it was all gone in that hole where his heart used to be. Her stomach was empty now, too, just like his. 
 
 `` It does n't matter,'' she told him when he opened his eyes and saw her sitting on the couch next to his bed. He tried to speak but no sound would come out of his mouth, so she helped him up to a standing position before pulling off one of their shirts from where it hung above his closet door. She wrapped it around his wound and held him until he fell asleep again. 
 
 A few days later the police found Clay's gun in the storage unit along with a note from Amy, telling them what had happened and how she was sorry. It took them nearly two weeks to figure out that there were no fingerprints on either piece of evidence, and they never knew who shot Clay, so they let it go. 
 
 When the baby came out wrong, though, everyone was happy. They were all very careful around Amy's belly until she finally had an abortion when she was eight months along. Everyone congratulated her on making such a difficult decision and told her she had made the right choice, but that did n't stop people from being afraid of her and telling their children not to go near her at all because she might have another one of those babies and then they would be in trouble. 
 
 She took up painting again, but it was different now, like there were other things on the canvas instead of just colors. The first time she finished a new piece, she showed it to Clay as if he should know what it was about when really he did n't have any idea at all because she had never shown him anything before. 
 
 They went back into each other's arms again after the baby died and this time they held on tighter than they ever had before, like there were too many things in between them that might separate them forever if one of them was n't careful. Amy thought maybe they would get it right this time, but Clay started to have nightmares about what happened at Kyle's house and how he was going to kill himself, so she had to go away again until he could sleep without dreaming. It made her feel empty again, but then a few days after Amy left for the first time in nearly three years, Clay called their doctor and asked him if there might be a way for them to have another baby before it was too late. They were both too afraid of what would happen if they did n't try one more time, and so they started taking medication together that helped with the pain and made their skin warm all over again even though it had grown cold inside Clay when Kyle shot him in front of Amy. 
 
 The doctor told them he could help them, but only if they both stopped taking drugs for a few months to give the baby time to grow so that nothing bad would happen to it once it was born because there were things in their
