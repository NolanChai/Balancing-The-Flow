I was playing my game when I heard a noise from the kitchen. So I turned off my game and went into the kitchen to see if anything was wrong. But everything was fine, so I continued to play my game. After I finished playing I went back into the kitchen and saw something in the sink that wasn't there before. It was a note saying, `` Merry Christmas'' with the address of an old friend of mine on it. I guess my new video game came from him?!
