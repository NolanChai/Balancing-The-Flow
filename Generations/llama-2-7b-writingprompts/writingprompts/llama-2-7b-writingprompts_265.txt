If there's one thing I know about the world, it is that no matter how hard you try, you can never do enough to ensure your safety. The world is filled with evil and we are always on the edge of chaos. You might have all of these precautions in place - but it is only a matter of time before they fail you. I'm not talking about things like an unlocked door, or a person who has been compromised by dark magic. I mean a whole world where you never know if your plans are going to work out the way you intended. The fact that there was a secret passageway in the warehouse, or that someone knew how to get into it, is not something I could have foreseen. It's only because of luck and skill that we were able to escape with our lives. Our enemies are always looking for new ways to get at us - they will use any opportunity they can find - but as long as we stay vigilant and never stop watching each other, we will be safe from harm. This is the world we live in, where nothing goes according to plan or design. I've seen it time and again: even if you think you have everything under control, things will still go wrong somehow. It doesn't matter how prepared you are - there's always something unexpected happening around the corner waiting for you; sometimes it's good, but most of the time it's bad news! We should all take this into consideration when we plan our lives: everything can change on a dime so make sure that whatever precautions you do have in place are strong enough to hold up against any challenge or threat out there waiting for us.
