I have always felt this way about Mrs. Petries' English class. She is an excellent teacher, and has taught me a lot in the time I have been her student (she has been teaching at my school for many years). But she does seem to get carried away sometimes with how much information she covers on tests. I think it would be better if we had more practice with test questions.

The capital letters shone royal blue, a more vibrant shade than the normal red that Mrs Petrie used for her class. Today was not like any other day in English class; today Mrs Petrie told us that she was going to cover all of the information that we were going to need on the test. She said that if we did well on this test, then there would be no reason to worry about our grades come report card time. The words hung like clouds above our heads, making it hard to breathe at times and keeping us from being able to focus on what Mrs Petrie was saying because all I could think of was how much I loved her class.

Mrs. Petrie instructed us that this lesson would be very important because it would cover everything we need to know for the test. She said capital letters shone royal blue, a more vibrant shade than usual. The room was silent as I wondered if she really meant what she said or if this was some sort of trick question. Then Mrs. Petrie started talking about how much better my writing was now than when we first met four years ago at St. Patrick's Elementary School where they taught us our ABCs and 123s. She asked me if I remembered her from back then and I said no because it had been so long since school let out for summer break but then she told me that my mom used to bring me over every week after school until one day when Mom stopped coming altogether which made me sad because Mom was always there even though Dad wasn't.
