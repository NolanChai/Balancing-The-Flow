You are such a loser. You didn’t even bother to shave?  I've been going out with you for three months, yet you still don’t know that my favorite color is red and that I love to travel.  Every time we go to dinner or lunch together, all you talk about is yourself.  There are always so many people around.  How can you say things like this when there are others who can hear?  What's the point of going out with you if you never learn anything new about me?  I had such high expectations for us and it's been disappointing since day one.  You know, your face reminds me a little bit of my ex-boyfriend. He was so sweet and handsome. We spent many years together, but the relationship got stale after a while.  I hope you do better with this one than you did with me.  Have fun at that bar tonight!
