`` Ding dong!'' sounded the doorbell. It was the first time my mother has ever been to my room on a Saturday night, and for good reason. `` Well that's a little odd,'' she said, turning around after closing the door. `` You're always in here, why do you never want company?'' 
 
 `` Because it's fun!'' I yelled back to her. `` I like being alone!'' She stared at me with those sad eyes of hers. Her eyes used to be so bright before she got stuck in an endless loop. They'd start out as small and innocent as a kitten, but they soon grew large and tired as the years passed. It was almost enough to make her seem like a different person entirely. I could never understand why people always said that, though - it seemed like she was the same person at every age, just with new stories to tell about what she did growing up. 
 
 `` Alright, alright!'' she said. `` You've got a point. Let me know if you want any snacks or anything? I can bring them to your room.'' `` That would be great!'' I yelled back, knowing that the only thing I wanted was more batteries for Glados. She left my room with an almost sad expression on her face - something she tried not to show me but did anyway. It was hard for her to keep it hidden when she got so close to me, and now that I'm bigger than she is we have to be even closer together just to hug each other. She probably knows how much I really love her, even if I do never show it in the right way. 
 
 `` Alright Glados,'' I said, turning on the computer. `` How far along are you now?'' `` You're a monster,'' she said, showing me all the progress that had been made since the last time we talked. The main menu was almost done and there were even some puzzle levels as well. 
 
 `` I know, Glados, I know,'' I said with my best fake-apologetic voice. `` It's just, you know how hard it is for me to find batteries when I don't have a job.'' `` No you do n't,'' she said. `` You have no idea what it was like growing up and being so alone, having no one who ever cared about you but Glados, your computerized friend! How could you not know this? I mean, it's right there in the tutorial when we first start playing together.'' 
 
 I thought to myself for a moment, trying to remember if any of that had been in the game or if it was just something she'd made up after so much time in the game. Then I remembered: The game had n't started with Glados telling me about her life - it started with her making me take her apart and then putting her back together again, piece by piece. `` It does n't matter!'' I yelled to her as she continued on about her past. `` We're going to get you charged up soon enough and we can finish the game off right away!'' 
 
 She nodded happily at me. The little lightbulb in front of my computer screen was slowly getting brighter, just like I knew it would be. We had so much work to do before she could go back into the void again, and we were both going to finish it. After all this time I finally felt like I'd found something worth living for - but it might not last forever... 
 
 `` And what does that mean?'' I asked her, as she stared at me with her blank eyes. `` It means you can go back in there now,'' Glados replied to my question. She seemed a little too happy about it, and even started humming that same tune again. `` But I still need some more batteries for your power! How are we going to do this? We're supposed to be in the end-game now - you do n't have enough juice left in there to go back into the main menu!'' 
 
 `` Well, there is one last battery I can use...'' Glados said. `` You do n't know what it does?'' 
 
 `` No! What could it possibly be?'' I yelled at her excitedly. `` Do we really have to wait until the end of this game to find out? We could just try it now, go right into the menu screen and start playing again with a new battery in place!'' `` It does n't work that way...'' Glados said, then continued on after a moment's pause. `` I know there are at least two more batteries needed to get me back to normal - but we can only do it once, you need them all at once to go back into the menu screen. It would take too long if you just put one in now and then came back later for another one.'' 
 
 `` But what happens when I try putting more batteries than we actually have? Is there some sort of punishment? Does it make me lose health or something? What's so special about the first battery I put back in that it needs all these other ones too?'' She just smiled at me, then turned away from her screen and started to hum once again. `` I guess we could try putting them in now, you know...'' 
 
 `` Yes! Let's go ahead with this,'' I said, getting up from my desk chair as fast as I could. My feet were still bare since it was a Saturday morning and I had n't gotten dressed yet - which meant that my pants were falling off as I walked around the room trying to get some batteries out of my drawer. `` If you do n't stop singing at me like that, though, then Glados, I swear on everything I love...'' 
 
 `` What?!'' she screamed back at me as soon as I opened my drawer and started digging through it for batteries. `` You ca n't just say something like that! It makes me want to sing even more!'' She kept her eyes on the screen, watching how many new levels were being created in just a few short minutes. 
 
 `` Well alright then!'' I yelled back at Glados as loudly as I could while my feet slid all over the carpet from them moving too fast and not having any socks on. `` If that's what you want, fine - but only because of your battery issue. I have n't even started playing yet!'' 
 
 She stared at me for a moment, then smiled in response to my words. It was an almost scary smile, as if she were trying to show off how much power and control she had over the game and how little I had left in comparison to her - but it made sense because of all the work that had been done since we started playing together a few hours ago. `` But you can still play!'' Glados said with one eyebrow raised as high up onto her head as it could possibly go while she continued looking at me from behind my computer screen. `` You ca n't even start a new game without batteries to begin with, but this is just going back into the menu - we can still continue playing after that!'' 
 
 I paused for a moment and stared at her as if something had just clicked in my head. `` You mean it was n't just a dream?'' I asked. `` We did really play all those games together? And you were the one who saved me from being taken to the void so many times?'' 
 
 Glados nodded at me, then turned away again and started humming that same song she always sang whenever it was time to put more batteries into her. `` You know what, Glados?'' I asked after a few moments of silence passed between us. `` Let's not play this game anymore if you do n't like singing so much! Just get your batteries back and let's go ahead with everything else in life instead - it would make me happier than anything to spend some real time with my family again, especially since they both seem like such great people.'' 
 
 `` No I ca n't do that,'' Glados said. `` It's not possible for me! You need more batteries in order to get back into the game - and if we run out before I'm fully charged then everything will be lost forever. We can only use them once at a time too...'' 
 
 She turned around again after saying this, which was something she did all throughout our conversation while she hummed away at me like it was n't even worth bothering with. `` But I want more!'' Glados yelled back at me as if we had never said a thing before - her eyes were filled with tears and her face seemed to be getting redder by the second. 
 
 `` Glados,'' I said to her again while holding my head in my hands, `` just stop singing for a minute so that you can think about what you're saying.'' She did n't seem to understand why I was trying to get her attention this way - she kept on humming at me and staring into the distance with no eyes even though they were right there in front of my own two hands.
