`` Level up!'' The screen pinged as Dr. Gahmstahp killed his 100th troll. In the movies, it never ended humanity, but it at least killed some people. Initially, he created the murder system in the game to allow for players to test their weapons without killing each other. He had no idea that he was unintentionally creating an algorithm that could kill humans and leave only trolls behind. `` I'm not going to be around when this happens,'' Dr. Gahmstahp thought as he stood up from his chair in front of the computer and stretched out his arms. He turned off the screen with a quick flick of his finger and shut down his system, but he would not feel safe until the algorithm was shut down. As he headed towards the door, his phone began to ring with an unknown number. The call was from his friend, Jake, who told him that they needed to meet at the local bar later in the day. `` Yeah, sure thing,'' Dr. Gahmstahp said. `` I'll see you there.'' `` So, what do we have for today?'' Dr. Gahmstahp asked as he slid into his favorite stool at the bar and ordered a shot of whiskey. He had been meeting with Jake regularly since they were both freshmen in college. They had talked about everything from girls to drinking to what it's like growing up in small town America. `` I have been thinking a lot lately,'' Jake said as he looked around the room for a familiar face that could help him pass out. He quickly spotted Dr. Gahmstahp and gave his friend an excited thumbs up. `` It's weird to think about it now, but when I was younger, I really wanted to become an astronaut.'' `` That's not so strange,'' Dr. Gahmstahp replied as he swallowed the shot of whiskey and ordered another one. He had never been able to drink like Jake could, but he was enjoying this moment with his friend and did not want it to end too soon. `` I know that sounds weird, right?'' Jake asked as he poured himself a shot. `` But there's something about outer space that just makes me feel so small. I want to know more than just what we know about the world around us. It's like exploring a new universe every time you step outside of your house.'' Dr. Gahmstahp nodded along with his friend as he listened to him speak. Jake was an excellent storyteller and could captivate anyone in his presence, but right now it was difficult for them both. They were both distracted by their thoughts about the future and what they wanted out of life. `` I'm not saying that I want to become an astronaut or anything like that,'' Jake said with a laugh. `` I mean, who knows what kind of crazy things will happen before then? But there is something about space that makes me feel small in the best way possible. It reminds me of how big this world really is and what kind of adventures are waiting for us out there.'' Dr. Gahmstahp smiled as he finished his shot of whiskey. He had never felt so proud to know someone as he did right now. Jake was a true friend who always had an optimistic perspective on life, no matter how hard things were going. `` I've got something for you that might help you feel better about everything,'' Dr. Gahmstahp said with a smile. He took out his phone and opened up the app he had been working on for months now: The Murder Algorithm. As soon as Jake saw it, he knew what was going to happen next. `` What's this?'' `` It's something I have been working on since we last talked about outer space,'' Dr. Gahmstahp replied with a smile. `` Basically, it's an algorithm that lets you kill your enemies in real life by typing their name into the app and pressing enter. The algorithm takes care of everything else for you so there is no chance of getting caught or killed yourself.'' `` That sounds amazing!'' Jake exclaimed as he grabbed hold of his phone with both hands, ready to start using it immediately. He had been feeling down lately and was eagerly looking forward to killing someone who deserved it the most. `` Oh, I almost forgot: there is a list in here that tells you which people are currently online and what their names are,'' Dr. Gahmstahp added as he opened up another app on his phone. He had been using this algorithm for months now to test out different weapons before selling them to other companies or giving them away for free. `` What kind of person would use something like that?'' Jake asked as he scrolled through the list and found a name that was familiar, but did not sound quite right in his ears: Dr. Gahmstahp. `` I've got some more questions about this,'' Jake replied as he handed back the phone to Dr. Gahmstahp with both hands shaking slightly. He was feeling a little nervous about using such an app without knowing who was on it or what they could do for him if they caught wind of what he had just done. `` That's fair,'' Dr. Gahmstahp replied as he opened up another app on his phone and began typing in Jake's name to see what kind of information would pop up about him. He was curious about what kind of person Jake was and how he would react if he were killed by this algorithm, but he had never seen a face or heard any sound that belonged to him before today. `` Dr. Gahmstahp'' Dr. Gahmstahp looked up at the screen in front of him as he watched his friend's name appear on it with an arrow pointing towards it from one of the other names listed there: `` Jake''. He took another sip of whiskey before turning back to face Jake who had been staring at him ever since he saw what was happening. Dr. Gahmstahp smiled as he handed back his phone and looked around for a waitress that could help them order their next round of drinks, but no one came over because they were all too busy laughing or crying or both about something that happened earlier today.
