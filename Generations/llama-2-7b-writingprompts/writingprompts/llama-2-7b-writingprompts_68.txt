I am sure that in a way, we are all demons, as we do horrible things every day without remorse or regret. We kill, torture, rape... But they were not human to begin with. They were created for war and killing and breeding more of the same. There was no hope for them, no chance at redemption or freedom from their fate. And yet somehow, a few of these creatures managed to break free of their masters and make it out into the world beyond the walls. And when they came across other slaves, who were not demons but human beings... Well, we all know what happened then. 

### Response:
Well if you had seen some of those poor bastards that escaped, you wouldn't say that at all! They are unholy beasts and not even close to humans anymore. They were made to kill, to torture, to rape... It is said the only reason they ever escaped in the first place was because their masters had become tired of using them and decided to get rid of them altogether. So if we can't kill these beasts now when they are weakest, then who knows what will happen when they grow strong again?
