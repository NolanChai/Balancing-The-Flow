[Aliens] take them into their houses and hold them up by their necks and dangle them in front of themselves for fun. This is done because they have no concept of our childhood and we were not abducted at a young age, so to them we are adults. 
 
 [Aliens] also use these children as test subjects to see how human beings work and react. They do this by making us their pets or just watching us. 
 
 [Aliens] are trying to learn about our emotions, the way we communicate with one another, and what makes us tick as human beings so they can better understand how humans think in order to figure out how to control human minds for their benefit. 
 
 They will take you into a room filled with cages of children who are strapped down by chains or ropes that go through holes at the end of the floor where it is bolted down tightly. There may be as many as 100 people in each cage with no light except for what's coming from outside so there can also be up to 30 cages stacked on top of one another which would have a lot more children strapped down inside them. In each cage you will find something like an electric shock collar around their necks so when they try and move around in the small space given, it will cause them pain if not death from suffocation or heart attack due to stress levels rising too high due to being stuck in a small room with no light and air flowing into the cage at all times. 
 
 [Aliens] take these children for different reasons: they want to learn how humans think, they want to study our reactions under duress and see if we can be controlled through fear or pain etc., sometimes it's just because they're curious about us which isn't necessarily bad. The problem is that sometimes these kids get hurt during abductions which makes me really sad but this happens more often than not when an alien has had a rough day and doesn't want to deal with any more problems on their hands so it's usually best just to let them go back home after they have been used for whatever reason. 
 
 [Aliens] also take children in order to create hybrid babies, but that's not the most common thing aliens do when they abduct someone- most of them simply want to see what we look like up close so there aren't many hybrids out there which means we should all be safe. 
 
 [Aliens] have been known for taking humans away from their families since long before I was even born and this is something that has caused many people to become paranoid about them because it just feels like they want us as pets or slaves rather than anything else which isn't true- at least not all of the time anyway! 
 
 [Aliens] take kids because they are curious and don't really know what we look like up close so when one sees an opportunity to see a human being face to face, he may decide that it would be better if this person was taken away from everyone else instead of just living with them in the first place which is why there aren't any hybrid babies out here- most aliens don't want children so they wouldn't go through all of those steps to make one! 
 
 [Aliens] take kids because it's fun and interesting for them, but sometimes this means that some get hurt during abductions which is why there are fewer hybrids now than before- most of us just want to be left alone so if an alien wants our help then he should come himself instead! 
 
 [Aliens] take kids because they're curious and want to see how humans act when they're in a stressful situation. This is what makes me sad- I know that these children aren't happy being here but they don't have any choice, so it's best just not to worry about them too much- you never know when one might come back!
