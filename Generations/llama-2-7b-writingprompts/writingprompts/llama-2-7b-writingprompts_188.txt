No you can't do that! If you kill her you'll never know what she looks like naked and without clothes on... What? You're killing your wife because she has a tattoo of a dragon? I'm going to go ahead and say this, it is your decision. Your wife is an adult and has the right to do as she pleases with her body. That tattoo doesn't make you want to kill her... You need therapy or a better reason to divorce.
 
 I had a dream last night that someone put a bomb in my room, and set it on timer to go off at 3:00 am today. I woke up at 2:05 and started panicking. I got ready for work and drove there, then went home when I realized the bomb was still going to explode anyway. I've been sitting in my bedroom with a bunch of plastic bags full of clothes over everything since it is the only way I can avoid being blown up by the bomb. The timer keeps ticking down on my phone and I'm about ready to pass out from lack of sleep. 
 
 This is what happens when you let your friends do their own dishes, they will leave you with a fucked up sink for your next move. And no, it's not just mine, everyone here has had to deal with this shit too... And this was just from one party. 
 
 I gotta say that the best feeling in the world is seeing the look on a racist or homophobic person's face when you call them out on their bullshit and they have no comeback. It's like you've knocked them off of their high horse, if only for a little bit. 
 
 This sub is like my therapist. It's amazing how many people share similar issues with me. I love reading the comments from others in a similar situation and seeing how they handle it. Some days are worse than others but today was pretty good! 
 
 What would you do if someone told you that your spouse cheated on you? I'm asking this because my wife just texted me saying she has to leave me, she can no longer live with the pain of her having an affair. She says we are getting a divorce and has left for a hotel to think about it while I stay at home. The only thing is that we've been together over 6 years now and I have never cheated on her once! 
 
 My best friend has been dating this girl who claims she's into the BDSM lifestyle. We had a few drinks last night, and she convinced me to let her tie my hands up so that she could "whip" me with a belt for about an hour, while we watched porn together. It was exciting at first, but it got old pretty fast. I'm not really into that shit, but she said this is how she likes to have fun and wanted to share the experience with someone close to her. 
 
 My parents are divorced now for like 10 years already. I can honestly say I don't hate my dad anymore because he did a lot of bad things while he was still in my mom, but the only reason why my mother left him is because he abused her physically and emotionally. He has a new girlfriend who's nice enough to me and she tells me that he's a good man and I should never hate him for what he did before. It really helps knowing that there are people out there who think my dad is actually a good person. 
 
 My wife died three months ago. I went through the motions of moving her body to the funeral home, making arrangements and so forth. There was always a nagging feeling in the back of my mind though that something was wrong. She's been dead for almost two weeks now, but every morning when I get up from bed she's lying there next to me. Every night after work she's waiting in the car as I come out to go home. There is no way her body could be here, so I'm going insane trying to figure out what's happening. 
 
 My mom is having an affair with another man who has a wife and kids. She tells me that they both have consent for their marriage to end but she will not leave my father because he is sickly and cannot support them financially on his own, even though she had been the primary breadwinner for years before. I am having trouble dealing with this as I really like this man a lot and wish he would go ahead and make it official. She keeps telling me to be patient but I just do not understand what is holding her back from leaving my father when they both want it badly. 
 
 My friend was talking about the movie 'The Hangover'. He told us that there's this part in it where one of the guys is trying to take his girlfriend out on a date for the first time, but she doesn't show up at all. He got so mad and said something like "You can't be fucking serious, I just spent money on food and drinks". My friend then told me that he was thinking of doing this to one of his girlfriends because her excuse for not showing up was "I'm sick" and she's been saying this all the time. 
 
 My boyfriend of 2 years dumped me a week ago. He said I was too controlling, insecure, needy, unambitious, lazy, ugly, etc. But honestly he is the one with problems. He is the most toxic person I have ever met. His issues are more than just surface level shit that anyone would consider a red flag when they start dating someone. It's stuff like being abusive towards me and his family. Also, his mom is extremely controlling over him and has been for years so she has made him into the person he is now. I had to leave because I could not handle it anymore, but I feel guilty about leaving my boyfriend behind with his issues and I wish that there was a way to help him with everything that's happened in his life. 
 
 I am being told by many of my friends that the best thing for me is to just move on. My current job situation sucks, but it will be much harder to find another one if I quit without anything lined up. The only other option seems to be taking a pay cut or going back to school - neither of which are attractive prospects. What should I do? 
 
 Today was the last day of my job and I'm now unemployed again. It has been about two months since my previous employer laid me off so I've been trying to find another one, but it hasn't happened yet. Everyone is telling me that this economy is too bad right now and it's not a good time to look for a new job, especially in IT because companies are cutting back on hiring people at all. Should I try finding a different career instead? Or am I just being pessimistic about this situation? 
 
 I have never done drugs before in my life, but I want to start right now! What can you recommend that is not too strong? 
 
 My best friend's mom had a stroke and has been hospitalized for weeks. She had to move to another state because she does not have any family or friends who are willing to take care of her while she recovers from this. She also needs someone to help pay the bills since her husband passed away a few years ago, but his life insurance only covers part of what they owe and it is too much for my friend's mom alone. We have all been trying our best to come up with ideas on how we can raise money for them, but nothing has worked out so far. Can you please help us? 
 
 My boyfriend has always been a little bit controlling in the past. He was fine as long as I did what he told me and never gave him any trouble, but now that I've been with him for more than five years it seems like he's getting worse about everything - from the way we should spend our free time together to how much money I make each month or what kind of career path I should take. He has also started trying to control my friendships by telling me who is good enough for me and which ones are not, which is making it harder for me to get along with people in general because they don't always agree on things that he does! How can we fix this situation? 
 
 My mom told me the other day that she was going to divorce my dad. She said that he cheated on her and beat up their children when they were young, so it is time for both of them to move on with their lives. I have never liked him because he always seems like a jerk and would hit his son for no reason at all whenever we had fights as kids, but this still came out of nowhere! How can I convince her not to leave? 
 
 I'm really having second thoughts about my job. It pays well and has great benefits, but the people are terrible to work with. The office is always noisy because everyone talks all day long while they do their jobs, which makes it hard for me to focus on mine since I have ADHD
