A lot of people say it's weird to see my response here. But... It was a bit weird. Seeing the words here, how much it still meant to me. How they were even more vivid than when I first wrote them down and read them over and over again. I didn't know what to do at first. So I just stared at the screen. It's not like I thought it would be different or anything. I mean, I haven't written in here for years! But... There was something about seeing it on a computer screen instead of in my notebook that made me realize how much it meant to me. Seeing those words typed out, and knowing that someone else had seen them too made the words so much more real than they were before. It's hard to describe, but it felt like... Like I could finally move on from what happened. And that was kind of freeing. But at the same time, I still felt sad because those words meant so much to me and now they're gone forever. Even though this is just a computer screen with some words typed onto it, seeing them here made me feel like I had finally let go of all that pain from long ago. It's weird, but in some ways it feels like I've never been more alive than right now!
