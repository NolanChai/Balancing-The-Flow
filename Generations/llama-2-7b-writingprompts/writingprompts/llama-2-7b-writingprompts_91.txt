The video quality is low and I couldn't see much detail outside of what's shown on the screen. I couldn't hear anything but it seemed like they were talking in hushed whispers. I guessed that this is the first time they had seen me so I took my hand off of the screen to wave hello, but nobody responded. After a few minutes I decided to try something more direct and I stuck my arm through the gap where I was standing and reached out to grab one of the woman's hands. She jumped back in surprise as she probably had never expected anyone on her side would try to touch them. I pulled my hand away and immediately put it back down at my side. After a few more seconds, the man stepped through the portal, looked around nervously, then took off his shoes before stepping into the room. He stood still for a moment as he got used to his new surroundings, then slowly began looking around as well. I smiled and waved at him but this time it didn't seem like he noticed my hand.
