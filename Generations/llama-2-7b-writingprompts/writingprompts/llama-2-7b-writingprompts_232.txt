The birds sing in the trees, and a gentle breeze blows through the branches of the pine. I walk down the hill with a single bird's feather in hand, the rest of their clan perched on the fence posts along my path. The grass is still wet from last night's rain, but I do not mind as the cold air tickles across my face and arms, it reminds me that there is life beyond this stone tomb.
