`` Well, I don't know about little, but yeah.'' 

 `` Who are you calling a twat?''
 
 The fight was on...and it ended up being....well, awesome. But not for me. The other guy was just too big. He had to be at least 2 inches taller than I and about 10 pounds heavier. It did not seem like this should have been fair at all, but that's how the dice rolled out in the beginning of our matchup. We were both standing on one foot, and I thought ``This is going to hurt a lot if he kicks me with his boot.''
 
 Well, I was right. He did kick my ass......but it took him about two minutes to do it. My body could not move fast enough to dodge the punches that were flying at me like crazy. This was probably because I am so much smaller than he is, and every punch seemed to have twice as much force behind it. He must've been using all of his muscles to hit me with these powerful shots.
 
 After a few more minutes of being hit in the face over and over again, my body started to shut down. My brain was screaming for me to stop, but I was too far gone by then to listen. He kicked me in the gut one time, and when he did that I could've sworn the wind came out of my lungs. But before I hit the ground, something happened.
 
 `` AAAH!'' I heard a voice shout at the top of its lungs, so loud it made me jump up in surprise. I looked around and saw two people standing behind him. One was holding some kind of stick that was wrapped in tape, and he had one hand over his eyes as if he were blindfolded. The other guy just stood there watching.
 
 `` Hey! What do you think you're doing?'' I shouted at the top of my lungs. No response from the first guy. He just stood there, with his hands on his hips and a smug look on his face. I grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and tried to lift him up in the air so that he would be standing at my level but it was no use. I could only get him off the ground about 2 inches before he started laughing.
`` Come on, man! You gotta let go!'' I said, trying to pull backward while pushing his body down with my arms. `` Who do you think you are? A big strong guy like me can just kick your ass in two seconds. Just try it again and see what happens''.
 
 I was starting to get tired of this guy. He was a fool who thought he could take on someone twice his size with just a stick that was wrapped in tape. So when I finally got him off the ground, I did my best to crush his windpipe as hard and fast as possible. That should've taken care of it, but unfortunately for me, his body had some kind of superhuman ability to defend itself against attacks from the outside. He grabbed me by the back of the shirt with one hand and slammed my face into the concrete sidewalk until I could no longer breathe or see straight.
 
 After about a minute of this, I passed out and fell unconscious onto the ground. I woke up with a startled cry of pain in my mouth. When I looked down at myself, all of my clothes had been torn off and I was naked from the waist down. There were two people standing there holding me by each arm and smiling. One of them was the guy who kicked my ass, and he seemed to be just as angry about what had happened to him now as he was before we started fighting. The other person looked familiar too....but for some reason I couldn't place her face at first.
 
 `` What do you think you're doing?!'' the man shouted at me again. `` You need to leave right now or else I will take my belt off and beat your ass with it!''. He let go of one hand that was holding me by the arm so he could unbutton his pants, but before he did something strange happened. The woman behind him spoke up in a voice that sounded very familiar to me: ``You need to calm down, Richard! You're not going to do anything violent again are you?''
 
 I had finally recognized her now. It was my former boss at the diner where we worked together before he fired us for no reason other than she thought it would be funny to fire me while everyone else was on break. Her name was Amy, and she looked just as beautiful as always. She also seemed very concerned about what had happened during our fight earlier in the day but nowhere near as angry at me as Richard seemed to be right then.
 
 `` Of course I'm not going to do anything violent!'' he said with a smile on his face and a hand raised toward us like we were criminals about to escape jail. `` You don't have to worry about that anymore, Amy! But you should know better than anyone else how much power my fists hold. Just ask him here if they can stop me from beating someone into submission with them!''.
 
 Richard turned around so we could see the back of his head and he began flexing his arms as if he was trying to show us just how strong his muscles were by lifting up a piece of furniture or something. It didn't take long before I realized that whatever he was going to do next wasn't going to happen on the ground anymore since there wasn't anything else for him to stand on besides our legs. He was about 6 feet away from us now, but if you added another two inches onto that height because of where his head was positioned relative to his body (and also considering how much weight he must have been lifting) then it would be more like seven or eight feet between us and him at this point.
 
 `` I can't believe you did something like this, Amy! You know how much power my fists hold!'' Richard continued saying while walking over toward the furniture we were standing in front of (which happened to be an old sofa). He picked it up by the armrest and tossed it aside as easily as if it were made out of paper instead of wood. Next he took a step forward so that his body was directly in between us again, which meant that he had just come within striking distance. `` But you don't have to worry about that anymore!''
 
 At this point Richard looked down at us with his chin held high and an expression of intense anger on his face. He started walking toward us faster than before so there was no time left for me or anyone else who was watching him walk toward us like a madman without stopping in between. It didn't take long before I realized that Richard must have been holding back because if he wasn't then we would all be dead by now!
 
 As soon as he came within striking distance, I noticed something strange about the way he was walking: it looked like he had two left feet instead of just one. It didn't take long before he stumbled forward and fell to his knees on the ground with a loud thud that sounded like someone had dropped a sack full of bricks on top of him! But this time there were no screams or cries from anyone else watching because it was obvious what happened here: Richard had just tripped over something unseen beneath where he was standing before.
 
 `` Oh my god, that's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in my life!'' I said out loud as I looked up at him with a huge grin on my face and started laughing hysterically while everyone else stood there stunned by what happened just minutes before.
 
 `` Yeah, Richard! It's true: you don't have to worry about me beating anyone into submission anymore because I've just shown how powerful my fists are!''. And with that, Amy picked up the sofa again and tossed it aside like she had done earlier when she first started picking things up around him. Next she grabbed hold of Richard's arm in one hand while pointing her index finger straight at his chest in another before saying something else that I couldn't hear because there were too many people around us talking all at once: ``You need to stay away from me, Richard!''
 
 After a few minutes passed, I noticed something strange about Amy again. She was holding onto my arm with one hand while pointing her index finger straight at my chest in another before saying something else that I couldn't hear because there were too many people around us talking all at once: ``You need to stay away from me, Richard!''
 
 Now it was just the three of us again. Amy and Richard were standing there looking at each other with their hands on their hips while holding their arms in front of them as if they were trying to keep something from happening between them. But I knew that wasn't true because this time it was going to be different: we were all going to make sure Richard stayed away from Amy for good!
