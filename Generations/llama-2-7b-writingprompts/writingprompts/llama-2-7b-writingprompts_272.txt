I am going to assume that this person is an older reader who is new to programming and hasn't learned about the importance of indentation yet.

```
class Dog:
	def __init__(self, name):
		print('Hello my name is ', name)
	def bark(self):
		print("Woof woof")
a_dog = Dog('Spot')
b_dog = Dog('Fido')
```
The person might be confused on how to read the code, and I'd like to make it as intuitive as possible. If this is a beginner, then there needs to be a good explanation for what is going on. The person may be more used to using classes in Java or C#, so it could be confusing that Python has it built in.

```
class Dog:
	def __init__(self, name):
		print('Hello my name is ', name)
	def bark(self):
		print("Woof woof")
a_dog = Dog('Spot')
b_dog = Dog('Fido')
```
