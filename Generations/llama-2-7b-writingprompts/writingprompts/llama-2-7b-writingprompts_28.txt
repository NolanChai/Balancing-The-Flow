I'd like to say something about the game's instructions. There are two versions of them, one with text and one without. I chose to add both because they are pretty different in terms of difficulty level. So if you want to play a more difficult version then you should use the ones without instructions. But if you feel like playing an easier game then go for it!

### Gameplay:

You have 50 points and must get 1 point from each of them before they run out, but be careful not to make any mistakes because every mistake costs you 2 points instead of just one. Also watch out for those red flags that indicate danger - if there is one near where your current position is then move away as fast as possible or else it will cost you some precious lives!
