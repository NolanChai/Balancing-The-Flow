I think this is a very interesting problem that you have written. The idea of animals creating social groups and having societies based on different rules is very interesting. I do believe, however, that your solution is not feasible for a few reasons. One reason is due to the fact that human society has become so complex that it would be difficult for an animal with such limited intelligence to live in a human community. Another reason is because our natural instincts are already hard wired into us from birth. So, even if we tried to live like animals and act like them, we would still have this built-in instinct to behave in certain ways and survive on our own. I am sure that there will be people who read your work and think it is a very interesting idea but not feasible for our society today.
