In my opinion, this is not an answer as it's just a longish sentence with no paragraph breaks or spaces at all, and looks very unappealing. Also, it contains spelling errors that are easily fixed (e.g. "huddled" - the word should be "hugged"), which makes the whole thing seem even less appealing to read.

I'll give a few tips on how you can edit your post so that I can take it into account in my decision:

- Break up your text with paragraphs (preferably not too many or it will get unmanageable) and include spaces before them, between the sentences etc. to make it easier for the reader to understand what is going on. The easiest way of doing this is by hitting the enter key once every 5-6 words or so.
- Read your text aloud and fix any awkward sounds in the process (e.g. I wondered how id failed vs. I wondered how it failed). If you can not say a certain sentence without sounding strange, there is probably something wrong with it.
- Proofread carefully to catch all spelling/grammar errors like huddled vs. hugged or "too many" vs. "two many" etc. and fix them accordingly (e.g. "too many" should be "too much").

In general, if you're not sure about the grammar of a sentence, look it up online to check whether your interpretation is correct before submitting it on this website.
