1. One would not believe that the development of a multiverse is akin to mitosis, multiplying constantly and encouraging growth, because there is no reason why it should be like mitosis in the first place. The reality of the situation is that all of the multiverse simply is. The laws of physics are the same on every branch, so why would they change just because one branch goes through a singularity? In fact, if you consider each new universe as an entirely separate branch, then there is no reason for it to be like mitosis at all: The different branches do not interact with one another. One of my favorite explanations that I came up with is the idea that parallel universes are simply alternate histories that we are able to observe in a different timeframe, which means that they have always existed.
