“ I got something for you, ” she said, as if reading his mind. He smiled and began to speak in a loud tone, “ Yeah? How much is it? ” He asked with an exasperated tone. “ Ah yes, here ’ s your receipt, ” Latrina said, handing the man what appeared to be a long, thin piece of paper. 
 
 “ It ’ s a lot, ” he muttered. “ I know, it ’ s quite a bit but that’s the price for something like this, ” she replied, putting her hand on his shoulder in an awkward manner. “ Yeah whatever, here ’ s your money back then, ” said Latrina. He handed back the large bundle of cash and she handed him what appeared to be a long, thin piece of paper. “ Okay that ’ s it then, I think you should get going, ” she added as he looked at the piece of paper with a confused expression on his face.

 “ You are now in control of the character named Latrina, ” said the disembodied voice. 
 
 “ What? Did I have to say something for this? ” Latrina asked. The disembodied voice responded, “ Nope, you don ’ t need to do anything for me to be in control of your character, I just read what you type and it automatically does those actions. 
 
 “ Got it, I guess that would make it easier then, ” Latrina muttered as she typed another sentence into the box at the bottom of her screen. “ So this is what it ’ s like to be a character in a story? ” She thought to herself, looking around. “ Yeah, I suppose so, ” she replied out loud with a smile on her face, not really knowing how to act inside of a story or even if she should feel happy about being one at all.

 The disembodied voice spoke up once more, “ You are now in control of the character named Latrina. ” He then read off what had just been typed into the box by his host. “ Yes? Who ’ s that again? I ’ ve never heard of you before… ” Latrina replied, her eyes scanning the screen for someone new to speak with. “ The character that you are now in control of is a woman named Latrina, ” it said in a monotone voice. 
 
 “ Got it, but who am I? Like what ’ s my story or something like that? You know like how people have their own storylines and stuff, like in video games, ” she asked, wondering if her host would reply to these questions of hers. The disembodied voice replied once more, “ Ah yes, you are a character from the game ’ Deus Ex: Invisible War ’ and you are an agent with the Tyrants organization. You have been sent in to destroy the Vandals group and retrieve the artifact that they were trying to steal.

 The disembodied voice spoke once more, “ Latrina has just successfully killed all of the members of the Vandals group by shooting them with a machine gun. ” The game paused as a message appeared on the screen reading: [ Level cleared! ] Then resumed. “ This is great, ” she exclaimed, feeling her confidence growing as the game continued. She was now in control of another character from the game and it was working out quite well for him, so hopefully it would work out just fine with her too.

 The disembodied voice spoke once more, “ You have completed your mission by killing all Vandals members. Your next objective is to find the artifact they were trying to steal from you in order to complete this level and progress into a new one. ” Latrina smiled as she read these messages that came up on the screen. “ So it ’ s going well, then? ” The voice asked again. She thought for a moment before answering: 
 
 “ Yeah it seems like I got this in the bag, ” she said, walking down the corridor of the Vandals building where they all met up and decided to meet up later that day after they had completed their mission by killing her character who was sent here for no reason other than just being an agent sent out on missions. She continued walking along until there were only two guards left, both facing each other with weapons pointed at one another ’ s chests; however, instead of shooting each other right away, they decided to wait and see what happened next before doing so…
