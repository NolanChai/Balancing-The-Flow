I would like to make sure that my answer makes it clear that the message is not about the war but about the way the government treats its people and the need for a change of attitude. I think this idea could be achieved by using an image instead of text, in order to show how our leaders do not care for our well being and use us for their own greed. It would probably work better on a large format billboard than on a postcard sized poster, but this is only a thought experiment.
