I will start off by saying that this idea does have potential. But I would like to offer some criticism of your story so far, which may help in developing the story more thoroughly. I hope you take my comments constructively, as they are intended to be helpful and improve your writing. Firstly, the story is very confusing and hard to follow due to poor word choice. The first paragraph describes people who were born with white eyes, but then they turn 18 and their eyes change color? Are these people not born with colored eyes in this world? Secondly, you have a lot of unnecessary words. For example: Everyone is born with white eyes... why are you even saying that? Just say, humans were born with white eyes. Thirdly, the story lacks a sense of urgency. It sounds like the author of this story has put very little thought into it and is just writing whatever they come up with on a whim. I hope my comments help you in some way to improve your story!
