Those eyes. Slightly widened, entirely wild, flicking back and forth rapidly to focus on mine. I see your desperation. I can taste your fear. Your face is so close to mine. But you wont escape. I tasted you the night before last. My body burns. That fire still rages deep inside me. You will pay for what you did, and then we'll have much more fun.
