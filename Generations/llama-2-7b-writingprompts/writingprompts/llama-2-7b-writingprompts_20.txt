Dear Son, 
 
 God is the greatest and al-Hamdulillah for the news of you getting the chance to leave the hell hole they call Iraq. Please take care when leaving the country because as the saying goes there's a lot more terrorists outside the wire than in it. Don't believe what those who say there are no terrorists, these guys will do everything they can to stop you from returning home safe and sound.
