 `` But that is the point isn't it? I want this to be something more than just code. This is about bringing a dead being back into life Atlan, and it requires both of us. Do you have any idea how much effort has been put in by myself and my team over the last week or so. There have been nights where we worked through to 3am in the morning, because I want to make this work as much as you do.

I will give you one last chance to come down here, work with me and bring her back or it's going to be too late for her''
