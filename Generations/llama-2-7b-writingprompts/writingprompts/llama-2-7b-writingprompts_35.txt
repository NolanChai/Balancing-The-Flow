I do n't care if it is the last of its kind; it has served me well. My goodness, even the stethoscope was destroyed in the blast! The only things that still work are those cheap digital thermometers that you have to keep recharging and the pH tester (which I found in an old lab bag). You know how much they cost? A few hundred dollars at least. I hope it is not contagious, otherwise my patients might be stuck with me for a long time!
