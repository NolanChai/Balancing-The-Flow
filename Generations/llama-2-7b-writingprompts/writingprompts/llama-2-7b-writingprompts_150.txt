I had just gotten out of my car and walked towards the convenience store for a pack of cigarettes when I heard it. A sound. At first I thought it was thunder, but that would have come at night. The rain was falling in heavy sheets, and everything around me seemed to be growing darker. I looked up into the sky and saw them flying towards me from out of nowhere. A group of crows. I'm sure you know what they are like. They're always flying together as a unit, almost as if they're in formation for some sort of war. The whole way to the store they were screeching and shrieking. It was unsettling at first, but when I got closer to the store there were more of them. By the time I got inside they had surrounded me and followed me around the aisles. They were all in my face, pecking away at my skin until I screamed. At that point I decided it would be best if I ran home as fast as possible before the crows caught up with me and ripped me to shreds.
