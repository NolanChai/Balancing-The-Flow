`` Ready for landing on Mars!'' The craft suddenly slowed, as it slowly decelerated from mach 10 to sub-orbital speeds. Andrew started to panic a bit as he looked at all of the monitors. One showed that the heat shield had failed, another showed that his parachute was partially inflated, and yet another was showing that their landing gear had been deployed prematurely. A warning light lit up on Andrew's console telling him that they were approaching a mountain, and he tried desperately to steer the craft away from it before hitting it. Suddenly, there was an almighty *BOOM*! The entire craft shook violently as it hit the ground, the landing gear collapsing under the impact, and Andrew's head snapped forward with force. He blacked out.
