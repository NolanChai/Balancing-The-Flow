You know what I'm sick and tired of? People who write stories like this with the only goal being to troll other people. This is exactly why we need a forum for people to leave feedback on these kinds of things, so that authors can see which ones are good or bad. And don't give me any bullshit about how "If you hate it, then write your own" because that's the same as saying "If you hate my story, go fuck yourself."
