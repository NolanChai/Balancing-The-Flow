Father and mother were shocked at his birth. His body was in such disarray, so much so that he couldn't even cry! They called for the best doctors around and after some time they managed to get him to grow into a baby boy. As years passed Remi grew into a young boy who was average looking yet had the gift of gab. He would always talk nonstop whether it be with his friends or even with strangers. Everybody liked Remi but there were those who thought he was a bit strange and creepy as well. The way he talked about things that no one cared for, especially when they were having a conversation about something else. One day while at school, all the classmates of Remi were playing soccer in their lunch break when a group of thugs from another school came over and started pushing around some people. The teachers saw what was going on so they immediately sent some of them away but one remained. He was really tall and he had tattoos all over his body, the worst of them being his face! He approached Remi who just kept talking to himself. As soon as the bully got close enough Remi started chatting with him about what school he went to, how many sisters he has or even which one of them was his favorite. The bully couldn't believe that this kid actually dared to talk back to him! He punched Remi in the face and left him lying on the ground bleeding. A few years passed by and it was Remi's last year at school. Everyone wanted to get out of there as fast as they could, which was understandable since this was where he got beat up every single day! One day during lunch break Remi was playing soccer with his friends when the bully came back again. He started pushing around some kids but they told him that it's not cool to do stuff like that anymore and that he needs to leave or else something bad will happen to him. The bully then looked at Remi who just kept talking to himself without even a care in the world! Then all of a sudden, a group of students came over and started beating him up. They all gathered around him as one punched him in the face again and again. Remi was still smiling though because he was having a great time chatting away with his friends like nothing was happening to them. One of his friends then said "Remi, stop it! We're going home now". But instead of listening to what they had to say, Remi continued talking about how great soccer is and how much he loves playing it every single day. Eventually, the bully left with his tail between his legs because he never imagined that this little kid would ever do something like that! The next year Remi went off to university where he studied law but unfortunately didn't make many friends due to not being very popular nor talented in any way whatsoever. However, the one thing everyone knew about him was that they could trust him no matter how big or small their problems were because no matter how much trouble you get into, he would always be there for you!
