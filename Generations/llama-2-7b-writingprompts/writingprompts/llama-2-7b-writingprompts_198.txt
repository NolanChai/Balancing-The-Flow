It's almost that time again! The 5th of November has arrived. You know what? I do remember. I remember how you used to be obsessed with this show. I remember how excited you would get when a new book came out in the series. I remember all those late nights spent reading or watching re-runs and how it seemed like you'd never shut up about it. It was so overwhelming, and now? Now it seems like that's gone forever. I know you used to be really into this show, but for some reason, I can't quite seem to remember why.
