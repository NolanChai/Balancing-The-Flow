I'm glad you've come around to my point of view. The idea of artificial intelligence is a bit overblown in terms of its actual usefulness. I mean, it's nice that computers can solve math problems and all but there are still many areas where human skill has not yet been replaced by computation, such as design or creative work (and those are just off the top of my head). The best use for computers is probably in their ability to do large amounts of repetitive tasks which would be better suited for an automated process. I think that we should strive more towards building better humans and less on creating artificial intelligence that can only perform certain functions.
