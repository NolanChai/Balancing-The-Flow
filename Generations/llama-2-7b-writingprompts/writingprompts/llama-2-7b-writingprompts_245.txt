Crap! Crap! Crapity-crap!! 
 
 I need this paper for my psychology class, and I'm stuck. You want me to describe something that has really hurt me. 
 
 But why do you have to be there? Why did you even come into the room when I was having my violin lesson? That's where it all began. The hate, the jealousy, the annoyingness.
