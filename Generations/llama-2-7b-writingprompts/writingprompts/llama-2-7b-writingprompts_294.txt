Today's riddle is broken down into three parts. The first part involves breaking the fourth wall. What exactly does this mean? Well, let me explain. In most media (especially video games) there is a fourth "wall" that separates what we see in the game from the real world. This fourth wall can be considered the camera in the game or simply where the player stands. The challenge of today's riddle was to get through this barrier without the use of any items. So, you had to break the barrier by yourself. It wasn't easy! The second part is figuring out how to get inside the cave. There are several things that can be done to figure this out but one thing we know for sure: it involves brain and brawl. What exactly does that mean? Well, the answer is to think with your head (brain) and fight with your fists (brawl). The third part is getting through the cave itself without dying. There are many ways to do this but one thing we know for sure: it's dangerous! And finally, ignore everything that I said above about not using any items because I lied! You can use all of them if you want too and even more! So enjoy your day and happy puzzling!
### Riddle:
I'll show you a number of shapes 
 But there is only one shape that fits 
 All the others are wrong, though they're right in some ways 
 I guess we need to think about this for awhile 
 I'm not sure how many steps it will take 
 It might be worth just taking a look 
 If you do so, you won't regret your time 
 In fact, I am sure that it is worth the try 
 For if you fail then all hope will be lost 
 You'll have nothing left to do but quit and post
