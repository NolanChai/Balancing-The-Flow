`` Really? That's strange. I did n't notice any writing on the box though. Where did you keep these boxes of stuff?'' 
 
 He shrugged as if to say that he did n't really know, but she knew that he was lying; she could tell from his eyes and the way they glanced around. `` I got them from a store up north when we were on vacation. A little town called Tadpole, it said.'' 
 
 She did n't bother to ask why he had all these boxes of stuff with him; she knew the answer anyway. It was because his family could not afford their own possessions. His father had died a couple of years ago, and he was left alone with just his mother and brother. There were times when they did n't eat for days on end; her mother would send food over to them from time to time, but she never seemed to have enough money in the house herself. `` You know that the man in the painting is a god, right?'' 
 
 He nodded. `` That's what I thought at first too. But then I heard some other kids talking about it on the bus and they said that he was really a giant who wanted to marry their sisters. It sounded pretty weird... I wonder if the one with the four legs is a monster?'' 
 
 She shook her head. `` He's not a monster; just a god. They all have four arms and four legs because that's how they were born from the gods of earth.'' 
 
 The boy raised his eyebrows. `` You mean to tell me there are gods?'' 
 
 She smiled at him. `` Well, yes. But they're not like us. They've got supernatural powers and stuff like that. And you can see them... if you really look hard enough. Sometimes they come in the night or even on a rainy day; but mostly it's when we dream.'' 
 
 `` That makes sense.'' He scratched his head, thinking about all of this information he had just been given. `` So... do gods go to school? I mean, where does the man in that painting go after the picture is finished? Does he have friends or anything like that? What's his name? Is it Sasquatch too?'' 
 
 She did n't know how to answer him. He was right; gods were just normal people with superpowers, and sometimes they were a bit crazy in the head... But she did not tell him that; she could see that he had enough problems as it is. `` It does n't matter.'' She said finally. `` He lives in Heaven now.'' 
 
 `` Really? That's cool!'' He replied, trying to sound like an adult, but the smile on his face gave him away. The woman smiled back; she was glad that he believed her. `` Goodbye now... I have school and you have more boxes to unpack.'' She said, patting him on the shoulder before walking out of the house. 
 
 As she closed the front door behind herself, she caught a glimpse of his brother standing outside watching her leave; he did n't look too happy with her presence at all. `` What is it? I'm leaving now...'' She called back to him in a friendly voice. He said nothing in response, but just continued staring after her as she made her way down the street. The woman frowned. She had never known anyone else who did n't like her; perhaps that was why she had been so nice to this boy all along... 
 
 As soon as she reached home, she hurried upstairs and changed into one of her nicer dresses. After a few hours of shopping, it should be enough money for the family down there to survive another week or two; hopefully by then they would have figured out how to make enough to keep their kids fed. She would n't tell them that she had been going there for months now and had done nothing to help... 
 
 When she reached her bedroom, she stopped dead in the doorway. The painting was still on her wall from last night; but this time it was different. There were no black spots around the edges of the canvas any more, as if some one had come and cleaned it up over night. As soon as she looked closer at the image itself though, she knew that something else was wrong; there were some things on the painting now where before there was only darkness. Someone or something had been standing in front of it while she slept! 
 
 It had to be Sasquatch himself. She could see the way his four limbs moved as he tried to make sense of the strange surroundings; and then, all at once, he seemed to notice her and looked directly into her eyes. She stared back without moving for a few seconds, and then suddenly realized that she did n't want him to leave any more than his family had wanted her to go away last night... 
 
 Just as soon as it happened though, the painting disappeared again; she was left with just black paint on the wall. It was strange how everything seemed normal now... She glanced around the room and then at the window where the sun was shining in through the morning light. She had n't even noticed it when she entered her room earlier, but the bedsheets were still folded over; as if someone else had been lying down with her last night! 
 
 She stared at the sheets for a few seconds longer before turning around and heading out of the room. It was n't until later that day when she took another shower and looked in the mirror, that she realized it was too late to tell anybody about this; they would just think that she was crazy! 
 
 She walked over to her bedroom door once again; as usual, she found that all of the paintings were still there where they had been for months now. But even though it looked exactly like last night... There were a couple of things missing this time around. She could see Sasquatch in one painting, and he was looking right at her with his four eyes as if to say: `` I'm not going anywhere!'' But then she realized that there was no picture of him on the wall anymore; just darkness. There were other pictures too though... One of a man with four arms and legs sitting by himself in a park, and another one of a woman walking down the street alone. 
 
 She stepped closer to the images for a few minutes, but then decided it was probably best not to touch them; just in case somebody walked by and saw her staring at them! As soon as she left the room though, she heard a voice in her head: `` I'm sorry.'' And she knew that Sasquatch had come back for his family... 
 
 And with that, she turned around to leave; but it was only then that she realized something else had changed! It seemed like every single thing in the house was different now... There were pictures of her all over the place where there had n't been any before. She tried to remember if there was one in her room last night, and the only thing she could think about was Sasquatch with his four arms and legs! 
 
 She took a few minutes to look at them now; they were all pictures of people walking around, talking on their cell phones or just minding their own business. Some of them even had pictures of their kids in them; one woman was holding her baby in her arms as she smiled happily towards the camera while another man was carrying a toddler across his shoulders and looking straight at the viewer! It was n't until later that day when she took another shower and looked in the mirror, that she realized it was too late to tell anybody about this; they would just think that she was crazy!
