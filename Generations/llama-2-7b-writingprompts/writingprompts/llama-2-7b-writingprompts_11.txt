`` Can I play?'' I ask the man on the couch. From his waist length blond hair, hipster scarf, thin frame and extremely feminine features, he's every yaoi fan's wet-dream. He's also my wet-dream, but that was a long time ago. After graduating from college with honors, I left the town of my childhood for a life in New York City. Here in Manhattan, I work hard and play harder, and now I can't even remember what I used to fantasize about as a little girl growing up. Now all that matters is making it through another day with the new boss breathing down my neck. The only thing getting me through this job search is my boyfriend - aka my best friend since middle school - who's been in town for over two years now. I met him at a yaoi con when we were both fresh out of college, but it was more than just the usual fanboy-fanlady attraction that drew us to each other. We've been together for five years and it's been fantastic - except he recently left New York for L.A., and now I have to look for a job on my own in one of the most cut-throat cities in America...I could really use his help. So, here I am, knocking on his door with nothing more than some half-baked resume and a dream of finding a job in this city that's bigger than anything I've ever known before. ---------- `` Can you come back tomorrow?'' the man says as he gets up from the couch. He's not wearing any pants, which is weird since it's winter. At least there are a lot of blankets covering his body...`` Yes! Of course! I can always do that if I need to, right?'' I say with a smile on my face as I turn around and walk towards the door, but when I look back at him one last time before stepping outside into the cold New York winter night, he's already gone. ---------- `` Hey! Can you come back tomorrow?'' the man says to me while wearing a pair of pants again. I don't know what happened to his shirt though...`` Yes! Of course! I can always do that if I need to, right?'' I say with my own smile on my face as I turn around and walk towards him with my hands in my pockets so he doesn't get the wrong idea. ---------- `` Hey! Can you come back tomorrow?'' the man says again while sitting down next to me on the couch, but this time his hand is reaching for mine. He looks at me with his big brown eyes and smiles, then blushes a little when he sees my reaction before pulling away from me slowly... `` Yes! Of course I can do that if you want me too.'' ---------- `` Hey! Can you come back tomorrow?'' the man asks me again as we're laying in bed together for the first time ever, but this time without any clothes on or even pants for that matter...`` Yes! Of course I can do that if you want me too.'' ---------- `` Hey! Can you come back tomorrow?'' the man says to me while we're having sex in front of an audience at a convention for nerdy otaku fangirls... `` Yes! Of course I can do that if you want me too.'' ---------- `` Hey! Can you come back tomorrow?'' the man says to me while we're sitting on his couch again, but this time with just one blanket covering both of us....`` Yes! Of course I can do that if you want me too...'' ---------- *This is a 40 minute short film about the first date between two men.
