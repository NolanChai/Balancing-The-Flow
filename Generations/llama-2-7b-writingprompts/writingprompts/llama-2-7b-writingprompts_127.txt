> It was a dark and stormy night; the house was dimly lit; the phone rang, startling the figure from the shadows. With a quiet sigh he rose to answer it. 
`` Hello?'' He said, his voice deep but unthreatening. `` Yes, this is he, the butler, may I help you?'' The voice on the other end spoke in an even tone: `` Oh, no, not at all, I was just looking for a bit of advice. It's been ages since I had any of that. And it's such an awful storm out there!'' `` Well then, I suppose you must be one of those fortune tellers,'' he answered wryly. He did not really believe in this sort of thing but the voice on the other end was so earnest and sincere that he couldn't resist. `` Yes?'' The voice sounded surprised. `` Do you mean to say that there is someone out there who can foretell my future?'' `` Well, if I were a fortune teller then yes,'' replied the butler, `` but what would be the point of that when you can just buy a fortune cookie or read your horoscope?'' `` Ahh, but I have no way of knowing where those people are! It's such a wild night out there, and the rain is coming down in sheets! I do not even know how to find a place that sells fortune cookies.'' `` Then perhaps you should ask directions from someone who knows,'' he said with a grin. `` Where am *I*?'' The voice on the other end sounded very confused for a moment and then it suddenly became clear what had happened: He had reached his own phone number by mistake! `` Oh, my goodness! I'm sorry; that must have been an error of some kind. I do not even know how to do *that*!'' he said apologetically. The voice on the other end sounded a little sheepish as well: `` No... actually it wasn't. It was you.'' `` Ahh, so we are both back where we started then?'' `` Yes, but now I have no clue how to find my way home.'' `` Well, there is a bus station not too far from here if that will help at all!'' The voice on the other end sounded slightly less sheepish now: `` Thank you so much; that really helps.'' `` My pleasure,'' he replied and hung up.
