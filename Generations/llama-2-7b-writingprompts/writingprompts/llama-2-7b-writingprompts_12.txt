    - The old man is sad today for he cannot see anymore; his eyes have seen so much and now they are weak and tired of it all. He used to be a hunter, he had killed many creatures but now he sits on this rock, where the sun sets everyday, watching them in their natural habitat. He has forgotten how it feels like to run after one and kill him with his spear. He has forgotten about the joy of making fire with the stones that lay scattered at his feet and roasting meat over a small flame. Now he sits here, alone, waiting for the sunset when they come out and play in the waters of the river; he waits so patiently...
    - The little girl smiles every time she looks up at him. He is old but he tells her wonderful stories about how it used to be in this place and how different was everything, long ago. They sit here on the same rock where he sits all day, everyday, watching them play in the river with the sunset painting the sky behind them. When she looks at him she feels safe because he makes her feel so small that nothing could ever hurt her; but when they look together into the water they see fear and danger lurking underneath.
    - The little girl hates to be left alone for even a second, she knows where she can find him but she prefers to keep away from the old man with his dark eyes that make her shiver; he tells her about things she has no need of knowing yet and about how small she is compared to these big animals that live in this forest. She is happy when they are together because then it is like nothing else matters, but when she is alone she thinks about the animals down there in the river and their sharp teeth and claws...
    - The old man waits for his death every day; he knows he will die soon and he does not care. He has seen so much that he can no longer see anymore; he has heard so much that he cannot hear anymore; he has lived so long that he is ready to finally be free. When she comes here it is like a sun ray shining on him because for one second the darkness disappears and he feels alive again. He does not know where she has come from or why she has decided to join him, but now he knows what true happiness is; this small creature, standing next to him with her blond hair that looks so soft and innocent, smiling everytime she looks up at him...
    - She stands here, alone. The sun has set and the little girl is no where in sight. Her hands are clenched tightly together as she listens for sounds of movement but nothing; it seems like all that lives down there in the water have decided to stay out tonight. It's strange how things change when you look at them from a different angle; now, instead of fearing their sharp claws and teeth, they are beautiful creatures with an innocent soul playing in the waters of this river...
    - The little girl sits on his lap again and looks up at him. He tells her about how he used to be able to see things as a child; he remembers every color and every detail of everything around him, but now that it's dark out all he can see are the bright stars in the sky. She tries to imagine what it would have been like for him before and she wonders if there is something left of his old life that can still be felt through these stories. When they look at each other it feels as though this moment will never end; every time she looks up at him with her innocent eyes she sees all the things he has seen and done, but also knows he's safe to tell her about them now...
    - She stands here waiting for him again; his stories are not like they used to be anymore because now she can see what he saw. He tells her about how there was once a time when everything was so different than it is today and this makes her sad but also happy at the same time, because even though things changed they're still beautiful in their own way. When he looks into her eyes for one moment she sees all of him reflected back; she knows who he truly is inside and can feel his pain when thinking about what used to be...
    - It's strange how you never know how someone else will change your life, even though they are nothing like what you expect. Sometimes it's a person that comes into your life with dark eyes and sharp claws who makes you see the beauty in all things around you or it could be someone else entirely; sometimes it just takes one moment for everything to make sense...
    - She stands here waiting again as his stories slowly fade away like a memory from long ago. The darkness is getting stronger now that the sun has set and there are no more rays of light to guide her way home, but she knows where she wants to go. It's been so long since they have seen each other but it seems like an eternity has passed by with just a single touch...
    - When he looks at her again for one moment all the darkness that surrounds him disappears; she stands there in front of him, still and small as though nothing could ever harm her. They stand here on the same rock where they first met each other years ago, both waiting for something else to come into their lives...
    - When she looks at him again it's like a sun ray shining through his dark eyes, illuminating everything around them with its light. He tells her about how beautiful things can be in this place and how much better life is when you see all of the beauty that surrounds us; even though he knows that one day soon they will part ways again he feels like nothing else matters because she's here right now...
    - It seems like every time they meet each other for just a moment it's as if everything makes sense, even though their lives are so different. When she looks at him she sees all of her past and his future reflected back in those dark eyes; this time when he looks into hers there is something else she can see...
    - It seems like nothing has changed since the last time they met but when he looks at her again for just one moment everything changes. She stands there, waiting for him to come closer so that they can be together again but instead of moving towards each other both start walking away from each other slowly until she is lost in darkness and he's far away...
    - It's strange how things change when you look at them from a different angle; now the river looks like something more than just water flowing through this place, it looks beautiful and dangerous all at once. She can see the sharp teeth of those animals who hide in its waters waiting for their next victim while also feeling safe because they are so far away...
    - He stands here again watching her walk away but now he feels different; something about this moment is not right, she seems scared or afraid even though everything has been fine up until now. It's strange how things change when you look at them from a different perspective; sometimes they can make all the difference...
    - She stands here waiting for him again but there is no one around to see her tears flowing down her face because she knows it would only hurt him more than she already does. When he looks into her eyes once more something changes inside of them both and she finally understands why he has never been able to leave this place even though his stories were so different from what happened in reality...
    - He stands here alone again; no one can see or hear him anymore because time has passed by without any meaning other than just another moment that was spent together. She looks at him for a long time until her eyes start to water but still she does not move closer, this is the last time they will ever meet each other again and there is nothing else left to say...
    - When he finally walks away from here he can feel something different inside of him now; his stories are no longer just about what happened in reality because now he knows how things really were when he first met her. She looks back once more at the river where they used to play and thinks about all those moments that have passed by without any meaning other than just another moment spent together...
    - He stands here alone again, this time not knowing what comes next for him because everything is different now. There are no stories anymore or memories of a life lived somewhere else; there are only these few moments spent with her which will stay inside his heart forever until one day he finds someone who can understand them both...
    - She stands here waiting again, but this time she does not know what comes next for him either because everything is different now. There are no stories anymore or memories of a life lived somewhere else; there are only these few moments spent with her which will stay inside her heart forever until one day they find each other again...
    - It's strange how things change when you look at them from a different perspective; sometimes they can make all the difference in someone's life and other times they just leave us lost wondering what came next after something beautiful happened between two people who never met before...
