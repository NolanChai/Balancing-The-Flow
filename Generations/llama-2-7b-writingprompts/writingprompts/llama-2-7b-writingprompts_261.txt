The Stableboy was a sturdy boy with strong arms who had been working at the palace for over 5 years now. He had always taken care to be kind to all animals and to help as much as he could with the work. In his last year of service he was finally rewarded with the chance to marry one of the King's daughters. It was a rare thing that such an honour came along for the boy but it was something he would never forget.
