It was all so clear now. They were the one's keeping her... trapped in her mind... her friends... but not really. She was n't crazy... they were. They were keeping her from being herself, from finding who she really was. No one was real without her. And now he knew that she was so much more than the person everyone thought she was. He loved her for it. But most of all he loved her. The love grew inside him and his eyes welled up with tears as he looked at the beauty before him. She had become a goddess in the woods, as a true God would be surrounded by nature, and not locked away from it like some sick ward. He would never let them take her again. His arms went around her, holding her to his chest. Her eyes met his for just one moment before the tears came. They stood there forever, or at least it felt that way. The fire flickered in front of them, the flames dancing and twirling through their fingers and toes. Above them the stars lit up the night sky as they stared into each other's eyes and fell deeper in love every second. They were safe here at last... with each other. The world would never take that from them again....
