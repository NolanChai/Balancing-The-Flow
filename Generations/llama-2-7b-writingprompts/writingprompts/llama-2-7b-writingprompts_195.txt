“ This is it. We need to find the Dark Flag ’ s location now. ” 
 
 “ I ’ m on it. ” 
 
 *You ’ re right, Violet. I can hear her voice in my head, but this time she sounds like...a friend.* 
 
 “ The Dark Flag is about to be unleashed! The final battle between the forces of light and darkness begins now! ” 
 
 *This isn ’ t good! The Dark Flag will bring about our doom. I must take action!* 
 
 “ If it helps, this time...I think they mean to use you as bait to lure me out. ” 
 
 “ Then we have no choice but to act quickly. This is the only opportunity that we have! ” 
 
 *You ’ re right. We must work together and save the day before it ’ s too late.* 
 
 “ It looks like they ’ ve set the Dark Flag in motion, so now all we can do is watch...and hope for the best. ” 
 
 *If only there was some way to stop them from using me as bait. Maybe I could use my power and make myself invisible!* 
 
 “ Invisible? That ’ s it! We ’ ll have to find a way to become invisible too. ” 
 
 *But how are we supposed to do that, exactly? They know about you and your friends, but not me.* 
 
 *I was thinking the same thing...but I think I might know someone who can help us!* 
 
 “ Who is it? A friend? ” 
 
 *No. She ’ s a monster. But she knows about Dark Flags and she might just be able to get us out of this mess.* 
 
 “ Then let ’ s hope she doesn ’ t have ulterior motives or we could end up in worse trouble than ever before! ” 
 
 *No need to worry, Violet. She has my word that I will protect you. And I ’ ll keep my promise if it means saving the world.* 
 
 “ If this is going to work, then we should get moving right away and make sure we find her before anyone else does! ” 
 
 *Okay...let ’ s go!*
