[R] They were already going to kill us all but now we are doomed to die alone in space! 
 [G] Fuck the Earth. This is the beginning of space-faring civilization. 
 [O] So who's flying this ship? 
 [A] If we are to survive, we have to build a new colony and spread across the stars. But the human race can only do that in numbers! We must go out there and find other life forms so we can rebuild what was lost here. The Earth is now only a place of death. 
 [B] You're all insane. Humanity is already dead and this ship will be too. It's been sitting idle for over a decade because no one had the balls to fly it. But I have always dreamed of being an astronaut so here we go! 
 [S] The Earth is the beginning of space-faring civilization. 
 [H] This is a humanity with no future, now only death and pain. I was born into this world but never got to live in it. Now I will be the last human on earth so that I can die in peace. We should have all gone out together when we had our chance, but instead we sat here like cowards as Earth went down around us. 
 [L] This is an opportunity for a new beginning! A chance to find someplace safe and free from war or disease or famine or poverty or any of that other stuff that has plagued humanity for centuries. We must go out there into space so we can learn how to be better humans! 
 [I] It's the end, but I still want to try... 
 [E] The ship was just sitting there and no one did anything about it until now. What if this is our chance? 
 [D] Humanity is dead and it's all because we could not come together in peace for a common cause. So long human race, I guess we will die alone out here without any friends or family to comfort us during these last days on Earth!
