You look down at your phone, trying to forget about it, but you can't stop yourself from looking back up. The glare of the sun reflects off of the water and you think you see something flicker in there. Your eyes go wide as you stare into the reflection. You can't move, a cold chill creeps over your body as the image begins to shift shape in front of you, before vanishing back into the ripples.
