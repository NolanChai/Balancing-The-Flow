Jedd Ardin rushed into his apartment after finally getting the old retinal scanner to recognize him. Ardin was a senator from South Amin. It was Friday, February 7, 2076 and he had been awake for nearly four days straight. He collapsed on the couch and began to shiver. The heat in his apartment was high enough that sweat dripped down his face; it was hard to breathe in this place. Ardin's body ached from the constant traveling he had been doing. There were so many people in the world, yet all he ever saw was himself and the senators with him. The smell of food hit Ardin like a brick wall as soon as he entered his apartment. He thought about eating but then remembered that he had nothing to eat. Ardin had been in bed for three days now. He fell asleep as soon as the retinal scanner recognized him, and it was only now that the hunger pangs were driving him up from sleep. He began to shiver again as the cold air hit his body. Ardin stood up and walked toward his kitchen with slow steps and an unsteady gait. As he walked in front of a nearby window, something caught his eye: the dark silhouettes of three men standing on his roof. The three men were carrying guns and swords; they were dressed in black armor from head to toe. They had long beards and strange-looking hats, and Ardin's gut told him these men weren't here for a friendly visit. The three men leaped off the edge of his roof and began to charge at him with their weapons drawn. One of them was on the ground level; he stabbed forward with an outstretched hand as if to grab Ardin in the throat, but instead grabbed one of Ardin's legs as it swung toward him. The other two men were already charging at Ardin from behind; they struck with their swords and nearly impaled his body on either side before he could bring up an elbow to block them. One of the men yelled, "Jedd Ardin, you have been chosen!" The other man finished off Ardin's last leg by twisting it like a broken branch before holding Ardin up in the air and letting him drop down onto his own head. Ardin died quickly as he landed on the hard floor of his kitchen. One of the men grabbed a shovel and began to dig in Ardin's backyard. The other two went inside, taking what they wanted. Ardin had been chosen by a god from an ancient world called Earth. His god was named "Loki" and he chose him for a special task: to die and be reborn again on Earth to do his bidding. It had taken Loki millennia to find another being capable of surviving this process, so when Ardin died he did not question it; he merely accepted what was happening as if nothing were wrong. When the three men were finished with their work in Ardin's house, they sat down on a nearby couch and began to watch television for some time before they decided it was time for them to leave. As soon as one of the men turned off his TV monitor he saw that someone had walked into his kitchen; another man was standing behind him with a gun pointed directly at his head. The third man jumped up from his chair and ran toward Ardin, but he could not make it in time before the other man shot him through both eyes. He fell to the ground just feet away from where Ardin lay motionless on the kitchen floor, dead already even though he was still breathing air into his lungs. The third man stood up again and ran toward Ardin as well; this man had been wearing a metal helmet with spikes coming out of it that looked like they were made for combat. He walked up behind Ardin's chair without hesitation, knelt down next to him and held his hand over Ardin's chest while pressing down on top of him with both feet until he heard bones cracking beneath him. The man then pulled out a pistol from underneath his armor and shot Ardin through both eyes before dragging his body out into the backyard where they buried it along with all other corpses in this world that had been chosen for some reason or another by their gods on Earth. When Loki arrived at Earth he was surprised to find so many people here who could not die; there were hundreds of them! He immediately began searching each one until he found Ardin's corpse buried deep beneath a thick layer of dirt and grass overlooking an ocean coastline where no one would ever see it again unless they came across it by accident while walking their dog or something along those lines.
