The boy smiled a sad smile as he remembered. He had loved her then and still does now. They both looked out into the city as they talked of memories that will never fade away. It was so quiet it would almost be easy to forget them but for the distant lights of the night sky shining in their eyes. 
 
 `` You were always there,'' he whispered. `` I'm glad you are with me now.''
 
 The girl looked up at him and smiled as well, knowing that she will always be by his side no matter what happens next. They both knew the city would not be quiet for much longer...
