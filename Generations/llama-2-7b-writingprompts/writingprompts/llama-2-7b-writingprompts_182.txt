`` Oh, that's good. How did the formal go?''
```
Okay doc but I think you missed one thing
I've had a lot of pain in my stomach and I'm always thirsty.
The only things I eat are watered down fruit juice. I'm not hungry.'' 
`` I see, well here's the results. We'll run more tests, but you're fine for now.'' He handed me a stack of papers and turned to walk out. 
```
He never noticed that my hand was shaking when he gave it to me.
I watched him go as I opened up the papers. It was the results from the *formal* exam. My body wasn't fine, I was dying.
