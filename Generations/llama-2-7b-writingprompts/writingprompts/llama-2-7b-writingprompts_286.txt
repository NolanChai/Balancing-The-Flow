Disoriented, I open my eyes. I can smell the gunpowder in the air, and taste the acrid tang as the haze of the gunshot starts to drift upon the wind. I see the coward celebrating and waiting for his execution, but it's not time yet. Not quite yet... I must think carefully now. I remember my lessons: how a man must always keep himself together in times of conflict. He needs to have a plan. A purpose, even if he has nothing left. When everything is gone, and there's only one way out- a man must still go forward with his head held high. The coward will be executed, but I am not him. This war shall end here, today, now! With the death of me, a legend will rise...
