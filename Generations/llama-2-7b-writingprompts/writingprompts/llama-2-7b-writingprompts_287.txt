```Cut to the reporter with his hands cupped, listening carefully to the person speaking `` I was about 14 when my mom got pregnant. My parents didn't want kids but because she had a bad childhood herself they decided to keep it. Anyways after we found out about the baby, I was so happy for my little brother! We were so happy with our new addition to the family, that is until he was born. He was so tiny and sickly at first we didn't think he would make it. Thankfully he did but every few months he got so much worse, we thought it might be better off if he passed away. Well when I turned 15, I realized my little brother needed me to take care of him as his mother had left us alone while she was working and studying. My dad went out for work every day and I had to get a job, so it was basically just me taking care of the baby, my younger sister and father. The war started when I was 17, when they sent us to camps. We were lucky enough to be moved into a barracks with another family we knew in camp. There weren't too many people living there but it wasn't bad for the most part. But after the first month of being in camp I realized my brother needed medicine, so my father and I went out for work every day while my sister stayed behind to take care of him. After 5 months of working our little family got some money saved up and we were able to buy some medication from a doctor outside of camp, but it wasn't enough to help him. We had to go back to work again. It was when he turned 3 that I decided to try my hand at smuggling medicine for the sick children in camp. One day while I went out with my father they stopped me and told us that we needed to report our money because it's against the rules of camp. After I told them what I was doing, they let us go. After another month of work, I got the medicine that I needed so badly for him. When I got back to camp I was relieved my brother had made it through the night! That next day I found out he'd died in his sleep, and after I broke down crying my sister told me they were going to send us away because we were a burden on them. She said they didn't want any more trouble so I was sent to another family at 19. After that, I never saw my brother again or my parents until the war ended and they were reunited with us once again.'' The reporter finished his interview as he asked the person if they had anything else to say `` Well I guess this is it huh?'' He replied with a sigh `` Yeah I think so.'' With that, the reporter said bye and hung up the phone before turning back into the camera.

### Part 2

 ```Cut back to the studio as the reporter comes in while drinking tea from his cup he sits down at a table while smiling at the camera `` So I hope you all enjoyed my piece on how families made it through the war, that's all for today. Tune into tomorrow where we will be speaking with a family who survived the war by hiding in an attic for 4 years! Have a great night everybody and I'll see you soon!!'' With those words said he sat back as the screen went blank before it faded to black. The reporter was seen drinking his tea while smiling at how much people loved his stories, but inside he knew the truth, he hated this job and didn't want to be here anymore. He decided that tomorrow would be the day where he leaves for a better life. ```Cut back to the studio as the reporter comes in while drinking tea from his cup he sits down at a table while smiling at the camera `` So I hope you all enjoyed my piece on how families made it through the war, that's all for today.
