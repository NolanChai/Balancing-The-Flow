The Magical Rabbit is a well-known trick performed by many magicians all over the world. The magician produces a small white rabbit out of thin air, and then makes it disappear in an equally mystifying manner. While some magicians use advanced technology to achieve this feat, others rely on more traditional methods such as sleight of hand or misdirection. Regardless of how they do it, the end result is always the same: a rabbit that appears out of nowhere and then disappears just as mysteriously.
