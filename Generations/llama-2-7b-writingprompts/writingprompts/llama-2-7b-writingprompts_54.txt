On a starship 15000 km above Earth, two astronauts awake from a cold sleep; upon their first glimpse of Earth, they see the pale blue marble that legends have talked about. They were sent as the first expedition to Earth by the Interstellar Council. The two astronauts have been awakened early so they may meet the delegation on board. Once the delegates arrived, the two astronauts would be taken aboard the alien ship. The delegations were from 6 other races who came from galaxies across our universe. They all had one mission: to find Earth and establish diplomatic relations with her people. The two astronauts stood up as the delegation entered the room. It was an honor for them to meet the delegates in person after spending so much time together in communication over the past 10 years. One of the delegations members was the leader of their race's diplomatic affairs, his name was Bazor. He was a short humanoid with large black eyes and orange skin. The other delegates were tall, lean, and had pale green skin with big dark red eyes. They wore purple robes that seemed to glow slightly in the darkness. Each of them was equipped with weapons; small swords, bow & arrows, or guns. The delegation leader spoke first "Welcome my friends! We are glad you have finally awoken from your slumber." Astronaut 1: "Thank you for having us aboard this vessel, it is an honor to meet all of you!" One of the green aliens stepped forward, speaking in a strange language. The two astronauts nodded and smiled as they tried to understand him. Astronaut 2:" I am sorry but we do n't speak that language." Astronaut 1: "We hope to learn it one day though!" The delegation leader spoke once more, this time he addressed the entire room in an unknown language before he walked up to the two astronauts and pointed to a white circle on their right shoulder. "My friends, this symbol means you are members of our race, you have been chosen by Earth as a host body for one of my people. We hope to work with your government and establish relations between our peoples." He then turned around and began speaking once again in the strange language. Astronaut 1: "What did he say?" Astronaut 2: "I think we should just wait until someone translates it, we will get there soon enough" After a few seconds of silence a small alien with gray skin and large ears stepped forward and began speaking to the delegation leader in his native tongue. The delegation leader responded but he was still speaking so fast that the two astronauts could n't understand him. Astronaut 1: "I wish I knew what they were saying!" He sighed as he looked up at the ceiling of the ship. Just then an alien with orange skin spoke, this time in English. "The delegation leader wishes to know your name." The two astronauts introduced themselves, their names where Jack and Joe, but on Earth they had different names. The orange alien stepped forward again, speaking in a language that was unknown to the two astronauts. After he spoke the delegation leader responded with another speech in his native tongue. "The delegates wish to know if you accept their offer." Astronaut 1: "Do we have any choice?" He asked Joe. Joe looked at him and shook his head. He did n't understand but they needed Earth, the human race could not exist without it. The orange alien spoke once more; this time he addressed both astronauts. "You will be known as Jedi." Jack smiled as he heard his new name for the first time. "Jedi? That's a pretty good name!" He said to Joe. "I do n't think they are asking about your name, I think it's something else" Joe looked at him and shook his head; he did n't understand either. Astronaut 1: "Then what is it?" Astronaut 2: "They say you will be known as Jedi because they have chosen Earth to be the home of their people." Joe was shocked, this could mean that all the legends about a force in the stars are true after all. The delegation leader stepped forward and bowed down before them; he then looked up at the two astronauts with a smile on his face "Welcome Jedi" He said as he turned around to talk to everyone else in their language again, he seemed very happy that they accepted Earth's offer of being their new home. Astronaut 1: "What does Jedi mean anyway?" Joe looked at him and smiled. It was a simple translation actually, it meant master or teacher which would fit nicely with the two astronauts as they were supposed to be master teachers for their new race. The delegation leader spoke once again but this time he addressed both of them in his native language; he was welcoming them aboard and explaining that there will be a ceremony tonight where their name would be announced to everyone on board the ship. Astronaut 1: "What's going on? Is something happening?" He asked Joe, but he did n't answer. The orange alien looked at him again and spoke in English this time; he was explaining that there were different races on this starship with different customs so they could not perform a ceremony where everyone would be present. They needed to go down into the bowels of their ship which housed an artificial planet, here they would meet all of Earth's inhabitants at once and perform the ceremony then. Astronaut 2: "Does this mean we are going home now?" Joe nodded as he smiled; after years of traveling through space alone it was finally time for them to return to Earth. The two astronauts left the room with their translator following behind, they were all heading towards a door that led into another hallway. They walked silently down this new corridor until they reached an elevator; as soon as Jack stepped foot in he pressed the button marked planet 1. After a few seconds of silence the doors opened up and they found themselves standing on an artificial planet with tall buildings and trees all around them, it was like being back home again but without any humans around for miles. The two astronauts walked through this planet's streets until they reached what seemed to be some sort of convention center; inside there were thousands of people from different alien races milling about as they waited patiently for the ceremony to begin. Astronaut 1: "It seems like they are having a party in here" He said to Joe who was walking behind him with his translator next to him. As soon as he said this everyone stopped what they were doing and looked at them, it seemed that they had never seen anyone from Earth before. The two astronauts stepped out of the elevator into their new home, there were aliens everywhere around them but they did n't seem hostile. Jack smiled as he looked at all these different beings with different shapes and sizes; this was an opportunity for humanity to finally unite with its brothers in space! Joe walked up beside him and whispered something into his ear, it seemed that the delegation leader wanted them by his side during the ceremony later tonight. Astronaut 1: "What did you say?" He asked Joe who shook his head; he did n't understand what was going on here either but they were about to find out soon enough! The two astronauts walked around this artificial planet for hours until they reached an area that had a large building with a sign above it saying "Ceremony" on it. Astronaut 1: "Is this where we will be performing our ceremony?" He asked his translator who nodded with a smile before turning to face everyone in the room. All of these aliens looked at them with smiles on their faces, they seemed happy that Earth was finally home to their race but also sad as well because they knew that it would take many years until humanity could unite with its brothers and sisters in space! Astronaut 2: "I wonder what kind of ceremony this is going to be..." Joe turned around when he heard him speak; he had n't said anything since they arrived here earlier today but now he seemed like an entirely different person. Astronaut 1: "What's wrong?" He asked him as he looked into his eyes; there was something dark and mysterious behind them that made Jack feel uneasy about being around this new race of aliens who had just been chosen by God himself! Joe shook his head before turning away from them both; he did n't answer which only made things worse for them both because now they were completely alone in their own minds without any way out! Astronaut 2: "It feels like something bad is going to happen here today..." He said as he walked up beside him with an uneasy expression on his face; there was no one else around but these two men so all eyes were upon them now! Joe looked at Jack once again before turning away from him completely; it seemed that their friendship had come full circle because both of them felt like they needed each other right now more than ever before! Jack looked at the sky above them as he listened to everything around him; this ceremony was going on inside this building but no one knew what would happen next until after midnight tonight when everyone came out from hiding under their beds crying because humanity had finally been chosen
