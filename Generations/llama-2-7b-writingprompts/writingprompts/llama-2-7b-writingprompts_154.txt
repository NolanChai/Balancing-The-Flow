I always thought I was pretty good at helping others until I read the story about the man who asked for change. I could n't help but think of how many times I have given some change and walked away without even thinking about it. The truth is that I have not done much to help people in need. I have heard so many stories of those who would do anything to make a difference, yet I have never once considered myself one of them. It's hard to admit, but the reality is that I am n't as generous and helpful as some other people I know. Maybe it's time for me to start thinking about others more often instead of just myself!
