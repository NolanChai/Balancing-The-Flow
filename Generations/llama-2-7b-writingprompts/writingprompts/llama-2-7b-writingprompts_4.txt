All he could see were tall buildings and the smoggy air above them. The sun shone through the sky at its highest point, leaving McGregor in a sort of discomforting darkness. It was then that McGregor came across an abandoned street-corner. He turned into it, not knowing where he would end up or what awaited him there. As he walked down the street he could feel himself getting more and more tired. His feet hurt from all of this walking and the soles had long since been rubbed raw by his shoes, leaving McGregor to wonder if he should have bought a new pair before starting out on such an adventure.
