I agree. I mean, you have to think about what kind of writer he was and where that leaves us all. He was really good at getting readers to relate to him. They'd laugh with him, they'd cry with him. He wrote in a way that made people feel like they were friends. But now that he is gone, there's no one left who can write that way. Everyone else has their own style. Everyone wants you to see them as unique and special. So when I read his work now, it's not just a story anymore. It's him speaking directly into my heart, telling me something about myself that he knows but I don't want anyone else to know. And because of that, we are never going to be friends again. He was a wonderful writer and he changed the world in so many ways. But now he is just some guy who wrote books.
