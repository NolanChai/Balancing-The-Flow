My friend is at his favourite place ever where he can sit on the couch with his feet up and eat some chips as he watches tv. It's 1998 so he has a huge tv and he loves it. He likes watching films because they have great stories and there are good actors but he also likes watching tv shows. He'll be eating lots of mints too to help him relax, although he prefers chewing gum because that way his ears don't get as cold from the minty smell.
