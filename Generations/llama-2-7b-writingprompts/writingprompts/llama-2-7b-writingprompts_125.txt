It's about time, these people need help. They just finished their first major war against another race and they're not even in the Plasmic Age yet. If this trend keeps up then we could be invaded by other races before too long. The Council of Elders should make an announcement that any species at a lesser stage of development needs to band together if they want to survive, as soon as possible.
### Response:
I have no idea what you are talking about, but this planet is so close to the Center, and there's nothing we can do to prevent it from being discovered. You should be glad we were able to send out a distress call before it was too late! We need to focus on how to keep these people from discovering us. If they find out about the Space Center then who knows what would happen?
### Response:
I'll do my best, but if you want any of these "lesser developed" planets to survive it's going to take a lot more than that! We have to make sure everyone knows what we are doing and why. I don't know how long the Council will let us continue this secret operation, though, so we need to act quickly.
### Response:
We can't keep up with your demands. You said that we should do what you tell us because "it's for the good of everyone." Well now is the time to show me why you deserve to be in charge! We need to work together or else none of this will happen!
### Response:
You're right, it does take more than a few people trying hard. We'll have to start with making sure that no one knows about us; then we can move on from there. Do you know how much money was spent on the war against those other races? That would be enough for ten thousand people! Maybe even twenty if they really wanted it bad enough...
### Response:
I don't care who knows or doesn't know, as long as we get things done and help these people become better off than us! If we want to protect ourselves against being discovered by other races then we need an alliance with our neighbors on this planet so that they can be more powerful when it comes time for them too become Plasmic Age. We'll also have to keep working together once all of the other planets join forces because otherwise there won't be enough resources left over after war breaks out between them!
### Response:
I don't know what you mean, but if you want my help then we need a better way to communicate. You might try using your words instead of writing all these long messages full of jargon and acronyms! You should also stop referring to me as "the Council" because that's not how things work around here...
### Response:
We need to figure out what is going on with you, then we can decide if there's anything more I can do for your people. Are you sure you don't want us to send someone over so that they can meet in person instead of just talking online? That would really help get this situation under control!
### Response:
I understand how difficult it must be being thousands of light years away from home, but you have to trust me when I say that we're doing everything possible right now. The Council will make an announcement soon about our plan for dealing with these lesser developed worlds and then they will ask each race who wants in or not. After that things should start moving a lot faster!
### Response:
If it makes you feel any better, we've been working on developing our own spaceships so that if one of them comes looking for us we can fly off into space before anyone realizes what happened! Now if only they would stop attacking each other...
