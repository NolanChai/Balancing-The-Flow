This is beautiful! The descriptions are excellent. I love how you describe the wind, it's wonderful. My only suggestion would be to make some of your sentences longer than the 26 characters they fit into. Like, the second sentence in this paragraph could go on for a while without breaking. The next one also sounds like the same thing over and over again (hiker with clanging bells) so that's also something I would suggest changing. Other than those two things you did an amazing job.
