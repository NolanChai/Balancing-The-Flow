When Eve woke up that day, she knew. She was finally going to be forced from this Earth. The illnesses had been laying siege to her heart for some time now, and the walls were ready to give in. But none of that mattered. In truth, death scared her less than it ever did. After all these years, she knew it was a gift. It was the only thing that could end her pain, so why would anyone want to keep that away from her? She made up her mind and decided to get out there, enjoy her time for as long as she had left. The next day Eve put on some nice clothes and headed outside for a walk. And if someone found out about it later, who cared? There was no point in worrying about the future anymore. Life's not about what you achieve, it's all about how you spent your time while living here.
