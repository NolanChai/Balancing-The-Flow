Dear [Loki] [Cthulhu],
How could you have betrayed us? We gave you a chance at redemption after you had so nearly destroyed the entire planet. And what did you do in our name? You slaughtered 1/5 of its inhabitants and made us look bad to everyone who wasn't paying attention. I will not tolerate this behavior from someone in my position, and I can only hope that you see how poorly it reflects upon your ability to hold a leadership role. Please do not write me again until you have figured out how to repay the debts of our people.
Sincerely,
[God] [Loki],
Queen of the Dead and Queen of Life

Dear [God] [Loki],
We've all had those days where we just want to go home for a little bit and take it easy. I'd say that's what I did, but you're God so I guess it doesn't really count. You see, I'm still waiting on your payment for the last time I went off world and had some fun (the debts keep adding up!). But seriously though, can we at least get this squared away? It's not like I want to destroy the Earth or anything, but my family sure does. So please do take care of it as soon as you can.
Sincerely,
[God] [Loki],
Queen of the Dead and Queen of Life

Dear [God] [Loki],
I'm afraid I must refuse your request. You have yet to pay your debts in full, which is why I haven't authorized any sort of interference. Until you settle up with me we will continue this way until I am no longer interested. If that day ever comes I'll be sure to let you know, but it's going to take quite a bit to get rid of me.
Sincerely,
[God] [Loki],
Queen of the Dead and Queen of Life
