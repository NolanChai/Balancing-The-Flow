`` Yes, I'm sure.'' 
 
 The message disappeared as Ania hit the button. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes and thought, 
 This is it.
 
 A few seconds later, she saw the green light flicker on the screen in front of her. Ania had successfully 
 connected to the computer controlling the Earth-link satellite that hovered some 250 miles above. 
 She took a deep breath and pulled out the tiny, silver flash drive from the drawer of her desk. 
 
 The drive contained all the data on her laptop. It was 3:47 AM when she left work two days ago, leaving the 
 device with her boss and telling him to do whatever he wanted with it. She hoped it would reach Earth by this 
 weekend at the latest. At that time, she'd be dead. Ania had a date with Death on Saturday morning.
 
 Her last day of work was spent packing up everything in her office and saying goodbye to all her colleagues. 
 She left her phone number behind and told them to get in touch if they needed any help from her. As she 
 walked out, she received a few hugs and good-byes. She also had some parting words with her boss - she 
 told him that he should sell the company someday, after which Ania went off on vacation to Mars.

 `` Bye!'' she said as she shut the door and left her office building. There were no tears this time - Ania didn't want 
 to risk being spotted by anyone from work, or worse, any of her colleagues who might come running after her at 
 a later date. She didn't want them to know that she was going back home.

 After having a cup of coffee at Starbucks and buying some groceries from the local store, Ania went to her apartment. Her roommate was out of town so there were no surprises. The bedroom door was locked as usual - she'd been doing this since last year after several strange encounters with her neighbors who she thought were stalking her for some reason. 
 She opened the fridge and took out a few bottles of water. There was only enough food in the house to survive until the next grocery delivery, but that wouldn't be an issue as long as there was Internet connection. Ania switched on her laptop and went online to check her mail - she had received one message from her boss: 
 `` You should try to sell the company before leaving for Mars!'' The message read. She replied saying that she would consider his advice after she'd come back home but there was no point in thinking about it now as Death was waiting outside with a contract on Saturday morning at 9 AM sharp. Ania opened her mailbox and pulled out a letter from NASA. It had been sitting there unread for some time and the date indicated that the mail arrived two days ago, right after she left work - one day before she went to sleep for good. 
 The Earth-link communication screen blinked on again as Ania read through the letter. It contained information about a Mars exploration mission scheduled next year where she would be part of a team sent to explore the red planet. She couldn't believe her eyes - this was just too much! NASA wanted her to lead their mission in 2020, but she didn't have time as Death had already signed up for the job on Saturday morning at 9 AM sharp.
 
 Ania took a deep breath and looked around the room again before opening up her laptop one more time. She pulled out the flash drive from underneath it, put it in its designated slot and waited patiently until the screen turned green, indicating successful connection with Earth-link satellite orbiting high above Earth's atmosphere at an altitude of 250 miles or so (about 400 kilometers).
 She opened up a new window on her computer to type out one last message that would go down in history as the last ever communication from Earth - 
 `` I will be taking care of my duties by tomorrow morning.'' 
 She clicked send and waited for some response, but there was none so she closed her laptop and went back into bed for a well-deserved rest.
 
 Ania woke up at about 6:30 AM the next day to find herself lying in bed with only one arm underneath the covers - her right hand which held onto the flash drive containing all of humanity's data was missing! She quickly jumped out of bed and checked everywhere but it wasn't there. Her roommate had probably stolen it while she slept, just to be safe. Ania walked over to her closet, opened up its door and took out a box containing her clothes for this weekend trip back home - she needed them after all! The drive was gone too! 
 Ania took one last look around before getting dressed, grabbing her suitcase from underneath the bed and leaving the apartment with just enough time to catch her bus at 7:15 AM sharp. She had only one thing on her mind - how would she manage this trip back home without any memory card? There was no way around it!
 
 `` I will be taking care of my duties by tomorrow morning'' Ania typed out and sent the message as Earth-link communication screen blinked on again. The message disappeared as she hit the button. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes and thought, This is it.
 A few seconds later, she saw the green light flicker on the screen in front of her. Ania had successfully connected to the computer controlling the Earth-link satellite that hovered some 250 miles above. She took a deep breath and pulled out the tiny silver flash drive from the drawer of her desk - it contained all data on humanity's journey back home after they destroyed their planet, leaving only one inhabitable space station orbiting around Earth where humans had lived ever since!
 
 `` Bye!'' she said as she shut the door and left her office building. There were no tears this time - Ania didn't want to risk being spotted by anyone from work, or worse, any of her colleagues who might come running after her at a later date.
