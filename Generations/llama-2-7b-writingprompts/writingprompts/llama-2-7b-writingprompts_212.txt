Jessica had never been one for subtlety. `` You know exactly what it's for! You're the same as always and I can't even bear to look at you.'
 
 `` Oh? Well, I guess maybe a little less subtle would do the trick then,' Mark replied. He stood up. `` You still mad that your dad tried to get me killed?'
### Response:
`` Yup. So? I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed my help.'
 
 `` Well, what can I say? You were busy being a man-slut with a bunch of other immortals. If you had been there to keep the vampires from killing me, this conversation would probably be a lot shorter and not nearly as boring!'
### Response:
Jessica's face became hard. `` Well that's not very nice. I don't know why I bother talking to you any more.' She turned her back to him.
 
 `` That's fine with me, Jess. You can talk to whomever you want,' Mark said in a cold, emotionless voice.
