I'm sorry to say that you have no chance of getting your hearing back, unless it was caused by an external factor or environmental hazard such as loud noise. In this case, there may be some chance that the damage can be reversed (if any) but only if you saw a doctor in time when you had your hearing loss and not after 10 years.
