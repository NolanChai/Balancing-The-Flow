He had waited years for this, years of chanting, researching, spending his years deep in the heart of the dustiest and most isolated libraries on the planet. The room was bare, a simple stone square adorned by a single candle at one end. He had been performing these rituals every night since he first arrived here, a decade ago. It hadn't been easy to keep his researches secret, as this place is not often visited. Many of the books in the library were ancient and required a very specific understanding of the language that they were written in. There was no way he could have fooled those who ran these places. He had to remain undetected for many years if it ever hoped to happen, but his researches and studies eventually paid off. The nightly rituals grew more and more complex as each year passed. Many of the ritual chants were written in an unknown language that he was forced to translate on his own through years of research. His memory and knowledge of these languages was near perfect by now, allowing him to perfectly recite every word in every chant without error. The time had finally come for him to perform the ritual, as he knew it would have to be performed at a specific moon phase that occurred once in ten thousand years. This was not only the most difficult part of his researches and studies, but also the most important. His plans were put into action after months of preparation, and now they came down to this night. The ritual had to be done as perfectly as possible, or it would have been a waste of everything he had worked for so long. He stepped up to the stone table that had stood in front of him every night for the past ten years. At the end of the room was a simple metal door. This too was an item he had carefully brought with him after months of planning and searching for one like it. The ritual began slowly, his voice rising with each word as he spoke it. His chants grew louder as he recited each ancient chant, not even taking a moment to breathe between each line. He knew that if he did, the magic would not work correctly. Every inch of the room was covered in dust and dirt from his nightly rituals. He didn't care, for it had all been worth it now. After an hour or so had passed, the chanting began to slow down as the time of the ritual had come near. He chanted on in a soft whisper, but still his voice was clear and loud enough to carry throughout the entire room. His final line echoed through the chamber once more, and then he sat back on his stool and waited for something to happen. The dust slowly fell from the ceiling of the chamber as a small beam of light shone down on the table in front of him. As it moved closer and closer, it grew brighter with each moment. Once it had reached the table, it came to rest and remained there, radiating a soft glow through the room. The door at the end of the room slowly opened, revealing an old man with grey hair and wrinkled skin. He was dressed in robes of white that seemed to glisten from the light shining on him from within. The old man moved his hands towards him, a slight smile on his face as he did so. "You have done well," he said quietly. "I would like to see what it is you've brought with you." He reached out and took the metal box in his hand. The light inside grew brighter as it was passed over by the old man's hands. His eyes moved along the surface of the box, following every line on its surface. After a moment he looked up at the man who had done this for him. "You have brought us what we need," said the old man, his voice ringing in the room around them. He stepped forward and placed the box down on the table, turning it over so that both men could see it. The top of the box was lined with a small hole through which an item could be seen. A strange crystal rested within this hole, glowing softly as it reflected off the light from around them. "What is this?" asked the man who had performed the ritual, his voice filled with curiosity and excitement at what he was seeing. The old man smiled again, nodding his head towards the object in front of him. "This is a powerful tool," said the old man, his voice filled with pride as he spoke. "It has been kept hidden from our kind for many centuries now, but you have brought it here tonight." He reached out and took hold of the crystal in its case, pulling it free from the hole on top of the box. As he did so, a bright flash of light shot through the chamber, leaving it dark for an instant before fading away once again to reveal two figures standing there instead of one. "The ritual has been completed," said one of them in a deep voice that rang throughout the room around him. The other turned and looked at him with eyes filled with excitement. "Then let us see what you have brought here." He reached out and took hold of the box once more, pulling it from the table as he did so. The crystal case was placed on top of it before being opened up to reveal its contents again. A strange device rested inside this container, looking like something that would be found in a science fiction movie rather than an ancient tomb. "I have no idea what this is," said the man who had performed the ritual, his voice filled with wonder at what he was seeing. The other man nodded his head in agreement as he stared down at it for a moment before turning to look up at him again. "It is a machine from another world," he explained quietly. "One that has been kept hidden by its creators for many years now, but you have brought it here tonight." He reached out and took hold of the device in his hand once more, pulling it free from its case as he did so. As he did so, a bright flash of light shot through the chamber, leaving it dark for an instant before fading away once again to reveal three figures standing there instead of two. The man who had performed the ritual stepped forward and looked at them both in amazement. "What is this?" asked one of them in a deep voice that rang throughout the room around him. The other turned and looked at him with eyes filled with excitement. "Then let us see what you have brought here." He reached out and took hold of the device in his hand once more, pulling it free from its case as he did so. As he did so, a bright flash of light shot through the chamber, leaving it dark for an instant before fading away once again to reveal four figures standing there instead of three.
