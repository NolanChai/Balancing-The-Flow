Villain: +50 Points for each kill in battle. 
Hero: +25 Points per kill (minimum of 125).

### Gameplay:
A game will be played with the Hero and Villain battling it out until one is defeated, or both are defeated. At that point, whoever has the most points wins. A "draw" occurs when both sides have an equal amount of points at the end of the battle (in other words, neither side wins nor loses). The game ends if a Hero wins by either death or a draw.
