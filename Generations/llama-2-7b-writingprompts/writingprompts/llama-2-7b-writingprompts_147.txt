As I sat down at the breakfast table with a feeling of dread, my mother hurried into the kitchen only to return a moment later with a cake crowned by candles. In unison my parents started singing as she began blowing them out, and I slowly joined in until we were all singing in harmony, “Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday, dear son, Happy Birthday to you!” After the song was over, I looked at the candles that had now been replaced by a sign reading “I’m not as young anymore” and laughed. My mother told me this was her idea of giving my father an anniversary gift.
