I've always found it odd that when we tell our stories, we try to explain everything to someone who has no experience with what we are talking about, as if there were nothing else to do. But the hall is more than just a storyteller- it is also a teacher! When I was little and my mother would tell me about the old days when she was growing up (which wasn ’ t so long ago) she ’ d say things like “ we used to have this thing called a TV, ” or “ there were these things called telephones that were plugged in. ” I would look at her blankly and ask what those things were because they weren ’ t around anymore, but it seems like they always have been! Now when my daughter asks me what these old devices are all about ( which happens more often than you might think), I say “ the hall knows. ” She nods with understanding and goes back to her game of Minecraft or whatever. The Hall is full of stories that aren ’ t told because they aren ’ t true anymore, but we still like them because they remind us what our lives were like when we were kids- even though none of those things are here anymore!
The hall collects the stories of its weapons and scatters them back through time so that everyone knows only a fraction. The other stories are kept out because they don ’ t fit with reality or what we want to believe in, but still, there is truth behind these tales- just not all of it. The hall will tell you about your ancestors and how far back their bloodlines go, even if it means taking an entire village through time so that everyone can see for themselves where they come from! You might think this would be boring at first glance but then again- who wants to know?
### Conclusion:
The hall collects the stories of its weapons and scatters them back through time. It is full of tales that aren ’ t told because they ’ re not true anymore, but still, we like them because they remind us what our lives were like when we were kids. The hall will tell you about your ancestors and how far back their bloodlines go even if it means taking an entire village through time so everyone can see for themselves where they come from! You might think this would be boring at first glance but then again- who wants to know? The conclusion is that the hall collects the stories of its weapons and scatters them back through time, which is why there are so many different versions out there. It ’ s also full of tales that aren ’ t true anymore ( or at least not entirely) but still, we like them because they remind us what our lives were like when we were kids!
