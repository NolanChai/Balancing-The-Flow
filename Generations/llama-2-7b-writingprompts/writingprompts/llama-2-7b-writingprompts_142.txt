**Heh heh. Yes, it is. And no one can know where you are but me and the three other people in the room with us right now. You have an implant in your arm that allows us to monitor your movements, but no one else knows where you are at all times. All they see is the red dot on the map and some vague details about what city you're currently located in. **
 
 *Huh?

### Response:
**It's a simple procedure- just something to help keep track of people like yourself. **
 
 *I don't know what to say... You mean to tell me that you guys have been following my every move for the past six years or so? And you just let it happen without saying anything to me? What kind of organization do you work for again?**
 
 **It's not a requirement- we don't follow everyone. But if you wanted to be a field agent, well then... it would be expected of you. I can show you your file at any time. You're currently a Level Five Agent. **
 
 *(Clears throat.) Oh, yeah? What does that mean?** 
 
 **I know this is hard to accept, but we need people like yourself in this position. We have to be able to trust you completely- the stakes are too high for us to worry about things such as privacy and personal space. That's why your implant works so well, actually. It's not a simple tracking device. It's also an advanced camera and microphone that allows us to hear everything around you at all times, and see it through the lens of your eyes. **
 
 *Well I guess this is my lucky day then... Because I don't know what to say about this at all, and I'm not really interested in becoming a field agent for whoever/whatever you are, but I guess you could see how that would come in handy when dealing with the kinds of things we're going to be talking about. **
 
 **Good- thank you. Now let me show you what we're all here for today... **
 *(Looks at his surroundings.) What? Where am I, exactly?**
 **I'm afraid I can't tell you that right now. But know this: no one will be able to find us if they try.**
