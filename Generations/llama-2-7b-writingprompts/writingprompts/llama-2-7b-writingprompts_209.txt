"Knock-knock." You reply to the sound of a faint knock at your door. "Who's there?" Again, only a faint knock, almost like a whisper in response to you. "Come on! Who is it?" The house was silent as though it held no breath for you to speak with, so you did not. Only one more time. "Knock-knock." This time you waited, and nothing happened, silence. You got up and opened your door, stepping into the darkness of the night. There, on the floor, was a single candle that was lit, there was no way it could have been knocked over by anyone or anything, but yet still lit. As if someone had already held it for you when you arrived home from work. You look around and notice that your front door is wide open... What the hell happened?
