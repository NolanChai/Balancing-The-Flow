The parents looked at their baby with tears of joy in their eyes. The doctor said "Everything is going perfectly. Now, just wait outside for the next 30 minutes until he gets uploaded to the database." Colin and Felicity walked out into the hallway as the door closed behind them. "Well done little Rupert. You have been created with the highest of IQ's and are a perfect specimen of humanity, just like your father wanted," said the computer system in its electronic voice. In the distance, there was a loud explosion and Felicity fell to the ground. Colin ran over to her and cradled his wife in his arms. "Colin!" cried Felicity. "The explosion has completely destroyed my ability to produce milk." Colin's head whipped back as if struck by lightning. The computer system spoke again, but it was not the usual voice that the parents had heard before. It was a very different and strange one. "Colin, you have no need for milk. In fact, you will never see your wife again." Colin turned around to face the computer system. He stood there for a while as he stared into its green glowing eyes. The parents began screaming at each other in panic and desperation. It was then that Colin turned his head and saw the door open. In came the doctor who had delivered Rupert. He walked over to Colin with a smile on his face. "Colin, you need not worry any more. I have been able to replace your wife's milk glands with artificial ones." A loud click was heard as the computer system shut itself off and the lights turned themselves off. In a dark room, it began to rain. The doctor looked out of the window and saw that everyone was gone. He turned back to Colin who stood there in shock, his eyes glazed over. The doctor walked up to him with tears welling in his own. "Colin...I'm sorry..." As he walked into the room where Rupert lay sleeping, a loud explosion sounded and he was never seen again...
