I enjoyed reading your poem - you have a knack for rhythm and rhyme but need to work on the imagery. You should add more images that would create a better picture of what is going on in your mind ( or if not, what you want the reader to believe ). I think it was about 90% there though and needs some tweaking to be polished for publication - which is always good as long as you keep writing. Good luck!
