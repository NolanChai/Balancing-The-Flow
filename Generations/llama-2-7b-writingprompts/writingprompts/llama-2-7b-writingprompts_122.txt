The time passes.
Clocks tic tock and keep the world in order. They mark your daily life in minutes seconds and hours. If you ever wanted to know how long it's been since you last saw a loved one or how much longer until Christmas, clocks are there. Clocks have made our lives easier in ways we cannot imagine because of their reliability. We could never find out when the sun will rise again without them, but they exist and make our lives go on smoothly everyday.
