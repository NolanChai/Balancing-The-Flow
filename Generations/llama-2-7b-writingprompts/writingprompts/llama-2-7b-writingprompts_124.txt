`` You have no idea what it's like to work for you,'' he replied `` It's like a prison sentence where everyone gets paid.'' 
 
 He was right. I had been there so long that I did not recognize the world outside of my prison anymore. As we talked about how much he hated his job and his manager, the only person who could be more hateful than me, I realized something: this man worked for a living. That was why I chose to live in poverty; I preferred it over a life where I had no control over my time or my work. I quit that night on the spot.
