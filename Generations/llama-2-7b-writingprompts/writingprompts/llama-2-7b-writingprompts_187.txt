In this story, there are two main characters; an unknown protagonist and an antagonistic man named John who is the father of the protagonist's ex-wife. The protagonist starts off by describing how he met his wife in high school and went on to have a successful career as an author. At some point though, their marriage took a turn for the worse and she left him. He then recalls how John kidnapped her after a divorce hearing in which the two of them were arguing and taking turns insulting each other. The protagonist's wife was subsequently killed by John before he could do anything to save her. The story ends with the protagonist reflecting on his past life as an author and how he now can no longer write because his experiences have been so traumatic that they would never make for a good story.
