 “ Hello there, I just thought I would say hello before we begin the experiment. ” 
 
 “ Oh my God! You have no idea how relieved I am right now that you're finally here. I know it probably sounds a bit odd but I just-” 
 
 “ Now hold on there, I need to do something first. This may be a little uncomfortable at first but try to bear with me okay? ” 
 
 “ Okay sure thing, whatever you say.” 
 
 “ Thank you very much, now let's get started shall we?” 
 
 “ I was going to ask if you wanted the chair but I guess that won’t matter anymore. It's a shame really because this chair is absolutely fabulous but-” 
 
 “ Now put your hands on the arm rests and close your eyes for just a moment.” 
 
 *Breathing slowed as she complied* 
 
 “ Excellent, now it'll only take a few moments to get everything set up. In the meantime I'm going to be using this time to fill you in on some details about our little experiment here and how we plan to carry it out. Are you still there? ” 
 
 “ Yes I'm right here. Just keep talking, whatever it is.” 
 
 “ Okay good, well as I was saying, we’re going to be using a device known as a psychosonic amplifier which is basically an electric guitar with some audio feedback looped into the signal chain and then picked up by a specialized microphone. As you can see here it’s not much different from any other guitar but there are some very specific aspects that I want to point out real quick before we start playing.” 
 
 “ The first is the amplifier itself, which is going to be directly connected to the feedback loop in the guitars circuit. What this means for you is that we’re going to have a direct line from your mind to the signal chain and vice-versa. So, if I were to say to you “ go through the door” then it would play on repeat forever because the microphone is constantly picking up any noise generated by the speaker. The second thing I want to mention before we get started is that this whole device was created for one purpose and one purpose only; To create a portal of some kind into another realm. ”

 “ Sorry about that, I had to go outside for a moment. ” 
 
 *Hissed static* 
 
 “ So, as you can probably tell from the previous noise we’ve been making, the device has picked up an anomaly of some kind and it seems to be quite large by the looks of things.” 
 
 “ Well that was a bit sudden wasn’t it? ” 
 
 *Hissed static* 
 
 “ Sorry about that. You were saying something about going through the door? ” 
 
 “ I think-”

 “ What do you want from me?!” 
 
 *Hissed static* 
 
 “ I have to admit, that's quite a big door. ” 
 
 “ Well there's really nothing to be done for now but wait until the portal closes itself again.” 
 
 “ Why can't you close it? You're controlling this thing right?! ”
