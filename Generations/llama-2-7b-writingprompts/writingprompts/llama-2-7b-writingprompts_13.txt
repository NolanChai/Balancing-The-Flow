He sat in his car, eyes wide with fear at the sight of what was happening. The screams were deafening and echoing through the woods. He thought it was just a woman who had been murdered or raped and was now calling for help but he saw there wasnâ€™t any blood on her body, it was as though she was terrified of something. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness he noticed that she was sitting in what looked like a church pew, facing an altar with candles burning around it. She kept screaming and suddenly she fell to the ground and began convulsing, twitching and kicking her legs into the air while she let out another scream. As they both watched, she stopped moving and simply sat there. He was afraid that whatever had happened to her was going to happen to him so he drove away as fast as possible, not stopping for gas or food. The next day he went back with a group of friends and found the church deserted. They went into the basement where they found the skeletal remains of what appeared to be a young woman wrapped in bandages. There was something about it that made him think she had been there a long time but no one knew how long or when she had died.
