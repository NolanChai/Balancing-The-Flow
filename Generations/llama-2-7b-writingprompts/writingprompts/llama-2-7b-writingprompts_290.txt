Long time lurker here. I've been promising to write more often, so I'm going for it'' This is Part II: The Funeral

It was a cold Sunday morning when we buried my grandfather, James Sr. I still haven't gotten over how the whole thing went down - but that's not really why you're here reading this.

I'm pretty sure all of us have been through it - someone close to us passes away and everyone goes into a state of shock. But then, after some time passes they say "It's time" and we all do what needs to be done to move on with our lives. It was the same for me and my family.

The whole thing happened rather quickly too - just two weeks ago he passed away due to complications from diabetes. He had been battling it since 2005 when they diagnosed him with it, but thankfully it never got that bad until now. It was a tough battle for both of us (I'm his granddaughter) and I can still hear him screaming from the pain in his legs and feet - it haunts me at night sometimes...

Anyways enough rambling! Let's get to the part everyone is waiting for - the funeral itself.
