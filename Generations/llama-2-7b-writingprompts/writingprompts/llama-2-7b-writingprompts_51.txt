The driver opened the back door of the truck. Two men hopped down from the flatbed behind him, then he tossed Dexter's black trunk onto the pavement with a clatter. "You want this one now?" he asked the young man who had picked up Dexter's luggage at the airport in Detroit.
"Sure thing." The man nodded to his boss, then turned and walked away. Dexter lifted the trunk by its handle and started to walk toward the parking lot of the motel. He had checked into the Super 8 on the outskirts of town just before midnight. It had been a long day: He'd flown from Detroit to Chicago, then flew again to Minneapolis before driving south down Highway 13 and finally stopping at this place for the night. Dexter pulled the trunk up to his room in the motel.
