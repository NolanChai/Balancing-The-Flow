No one's ever going to know what happened here. This is my final message to all of you. Maybe one day someone will come across this. Maybe they won't even find it for years or decades. Maybe they will only come across my notes and never read any of these words. Whatever happens I hope that whatever becomes of humanity, people still hold the memories and feelings of love to each other that we had. We can forget everything else, but if you lose that you have nothing left.
