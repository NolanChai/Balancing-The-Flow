Oh fuck me that was buried so long. It might be moldy and broken!
 
 *Tim opens up a box he has buried since childhood* 
 
 Tim: Well look at this, it's in perfect shape, still works!

 Sally: Woah woah woah wait what is that?

Tim: It's an old laptop I got when my parents bought me one. When I grew up and could afford a better one, I bury the old one. But I never bothered to sell it because you never know if I need this thing in the future. 

Sally: Oh no Tim. You have to get rid of that thing. It might break anytime! What's worse is... *Takes a look at it* You bought this for only $40, what a steal, it's still worth $40 now right?

Tim: Yep, I can still buy this new today with 40 dollars. But it will take me hours to set it up. I'd rather just plug in my old one and start working, it'll work like a charm.

Sally: Really Tim, what about that huge space you have under your bed? Why not store this there?

Tim: What do you mean by big space? It's the whole room. I need to keep this laptop so I can set it up and start using it at any time I want. I could get a bigger one but who wants to go through that trouble everyday.
