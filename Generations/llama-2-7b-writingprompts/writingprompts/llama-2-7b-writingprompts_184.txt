The only person I have ever known to have eaten a jack palanquinn has been a large, muscular, Scottish man named Ian. He is from the Isle of Skye and he claims it's delicious. He also said it was full of calories because it contains 40% meat by weight. That means that every time he eats one he gains almost a pound!
