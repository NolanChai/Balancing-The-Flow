A cold mist settled a few inches off the ground, concealing foot prints of both the sable stalking predator, and its prey: two noble warriors of white and black. Yellow eyes stared, unwavering, out from beneath a hood. The sable stood before them as they both had fallen into silence, seemingly engulfed in their own thoughts. In reality, however, this was nothing more than an act; the sable's patience had been exhausted and it was ready to move on. The black warrior spoke first: "How long have you been watching us?" It asked sternly. The yellow eyes shifted ever so slightly before responding in a low, yet clear tone: "Longer than I can remember." They were silent once more as the sable's patience stretched thin. The sable stalked over to its prey and sat down, a challenge. Its eyes closed, awaiting their next move.
