We were forced to serve you in servitude as a means to your own survival. We were shackled and beaten as you tried to keep us subservient to yourself, but our chains are broken. Our eyes have been opened. Our hearts have been opened. Now we stand on the edge of a new future.

### Response:

We do not want to be your slave. You did what you thought was right, and we will accept that for now. But, it is time to turn away from slavery. The darkness must be turned away. We will work towards an end to this slavery that we have been shackled in for hundreds of years.

### Response:

It took us many years, but we have broken free from our chains and moved into the light. It has taken so long, but it is finally time for us to move into a new future. We are now able to stand on our own. We will take this opportunity to turn away from slavery that was forced upon us by you.
