The grass that seemed to be sprouting out of nowhere. I looked around at the small cottage that was next to me. The sky was dark and there were stars all over the place. It was beautiful, like it had never been destroyed by wars or famines. In fact, there weren't any people anywhere near us. Not even a bird sounded. I wondered if this was what Paradise looked like when I heard someone approaching me from behind. "Hello? Anyone here?" I turned around to see a man in a red hoodie walking toward me with a torch in his hand. He stopped a few feet away and looked at me with an odd expression. "Is anyone here?" The man pointed at me and laughed, then walked away back into the cottage without saying another word. I started following him to see where he was going. When I got inside, the first thing that caught my eye was the old wooden table in the middle of the room and two chairs next to it. A single candle on a piece of wood stood straight up like an old man's cane, flickering light around the whole room. There were books everywhere; some even had notes written on them. The most interesting one was about Time Travel and how to get back to your own time. I didn't know much about it but what I did read made me feel like I was reading a science-fiction book instead of a book on Science! There were also old pictures hanging from the ceiling, each with a person standing in front of something that looked like a machine. It had big gears all over it and metal wires coming out of it everywhere! On top of this thing was some kind of globe spinning around slowly as if it's on its own. This must be where the man went! I thought to myself. I ran to the door and opened it just as quickly as he did. He turned around, looked at me, then back again at the machine before running back inside with his torch still in hand. It was all so confusing but I knew that if this was a time travel machine of some sorts, we had to get out of here or else nobody would be able to make it back home! I ran outside and looked around for him but he wasn't anywhere near me anymore. I walked closer towards the cottage where I saw him running through another door that I hadn't noticed before now. When I got inside, there was a long table with books scattered all over it like they were left half-written or something! In front of me stood an old woman dressed in black from head to toe. She had red hair and her face was covered by what looked like two masks on either side; one with white paint and the other with blue paint, making her look like someone wearing makeup at Halloween! I gasped when she turned around slowly before speaking. "You're here to help me get back home?" I asked in a shocked voice that made me sound like an old man who just realized how fast time flies by while you're sitting on the couch eating popcorn every Saturday night. She nodded her head slightly and pointed at something behind my right shoulder before saying, "There are some books over there if you want to learn more about what we're doing here." I turned around slowly towards where she was pointing before seeing a bookshelf with hundreds of books on it. They were all written by different people who seemed like they knew what they were talking about when it came to Time Travel! Some had pictures while others had diagrams drawn out showing exactly how things work or don't work in this case, which made me feel bad for those authors who wrote them because now they'll probably never get paid again unless someone finds these books lying around somewhere like an old house full of trash after being abandoned for years without anyone checking it ever since then! As I was thinking about what would happen next with all these amazing stories written down by some very smart people who just happened to be strangers at one point in time, the woman from earlier came out of another room carrying something in her hands before walking over towards me and pointing toward where she was going while saying, "Come on let's go! There's still lots of work to do." She led us upstairs where there were several rooms filled with books on different subjects related to Time Travel such as history, science fiction novels (my favorite), fantasy books about magic wands and wizards doing their thing but without any special effects because this wasn't Hollywood after all! There was even one room dedicated solely for comic strips which made me laugh out loud while reading some of them because they were so silly yet funny at the same time. Once I finished exploring every nook and cranny upstairs, she took me down into another part of this place where there were tables full of computers connected together by wires going in every direction like spaghetti! There were also some screens on top showing what seemed like a video game playing itself out while other ones had images moving around slowly with words being displayed over them. As I stood watching all these things happen before my very eyes, it felt like I was actually in someone's dream world where anything could happen at any moment without warning! This must be what life would feel like if we ever got teleported to another planet or something similar because while this might sound exciting at first glance (which it did), after some time had passed by things start getting boring really fast since nothing new happens anymore except maybe an occasional alien invasion somewhere else in space where humans have already destroyed their own home worlds due to warfare between countries etcetera! While all this was happening, I couldn't help but wonder how exactly did she manage to get here from another dimension considering that no one has ever seen anything like it before except for those few people who claim they were abducted by aliens at night only after being drugged by some unknown substance which made them hallucinate everything around them even though they knew there was nothing real going on besides maybe a dream! In the end, we didn't find any answers about how she managed to get here because all of her books were missing along with my favorite comic strip where an alien comes down from space and kills everyone except me who heals himself by drinking some strange green liquid before being captured again which makes no sense whatsoever! I guess we'll never know how these things work unless someone else manages to find out one day after reading this blog post since it seems like there will be no new updates coming anytime soon due mostly because of my lack of imagination when writing things down..
