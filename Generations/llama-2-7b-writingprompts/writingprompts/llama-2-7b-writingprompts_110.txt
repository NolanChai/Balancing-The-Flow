I hated them too! They'd been there for over a year now and it still didn't seem like they had done anything useful in all that time. The scientists seemed to have no clue as to how to make the damn things work at all. I'm sure they were just using us because we looked like humans, but even then their experiments always went wrong for some reason or another. 
 
The worst part was when someone else had to share a room with me - it would take them so long before they realised what was going on and I never managed to get any sleep as a result! 
 
But that's not the worst thing about these experiments, no... That honor goes to the fact that we have to eat out of cans in here. And not just regular food - it's always this weird gelatinous substance with little bits of meat mixed into it like a soup! It tastes awful and I'm sure that they did something weird to the chemical composition to make it taste more disgusting than usual as well... 
 
I know what you're thinking - why didn't I just get away? But there was no way out of these rooms once we were locked in them! The only time any of us have had any freedom is when they took us back down to the basement level for our 'exams'. It was then that all 12 of us were put into one room at a time so that each person could be examined individually without any interference from other subjects in their way. We were given no explanation whatsoever as to why this happened, but I suppose it's not too hard to figure out! It's probably because they want everyone who takes part in these experiments to be fully awake and alert when they do things with us... 
 
But even if that was true (which it most likely is), I would still rather go through with the rest of them than have another canful of this stuff shoved down my throat! The only thing worse than eating out of a can is knowing how much money you're wasting on it too. 
 
At least if we manage to escape from here, I'm sure we'll be able to get away with whatever little bit of savings remains after our time in this hellish place! Until then though - I guess we'll just have to continue suffering...

I know it can be hard sometimes when you are confined to a small space like the one that we were all put into. But remember, we are not alone! There is always someone watching over us and keeping an eye on everything going on with these experiments... The scientists may have put us in here for some reason or another, but I know they're not doing it because they hate us like you say. They just want to figure out what makes humans tick - how do we work? What happens when something goes wrong inside our heads and why does this stuff taste so bad! 
 
So please don't worry about them anymore - think instead about all of the possibilities that lie ahead for each one of us once we get out of here. Maybe someday soon someone will discover new ways to heal illnesses or improve humanity through science... Or maybe they'll just come up with some amazing invention that changes everything! Who knows? All I know is that there's only one way forward - and it starts right now by escaping from this place! 
 
So let's get out of here together, okay? Let us escape together so we can all enjoy what life has to offer... Together.
