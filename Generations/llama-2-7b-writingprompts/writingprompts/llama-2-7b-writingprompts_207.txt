#### [ WP ] A short story by Hanna Zarembka. This was not a good place to be, as the elevator car juddered upward with each of its ascents. The stench was rank and overpowering; my eyes began to tear. I could not see much of anything through them, but even when they were dry enough to open, it made no difference: the space between us had closed like a trap. The man's face loomed close as he spoke, his words coming at me in short gusts. " My wife and son are in the states. I miss them terribly! They must have come to America with my cousin and her husband- they went ahead of me to find work before our visas came through- but where did they go? They never write or call! I hope they are all right." He paused, his eyes widening a little as he saw that I was crying. " You must be afraid for your family too! My wife was expecting a baby and she had to leave her in Poland with my mother- it's terrible!" The elevator juddered again, making me sway toward him and bringing him closer still. His mouth opened as if he would speak once more but instead his breath, heavy with alcohol, hit my lips like the smell of rotting meat. He was very close; I could see the grease stains on his shirt where the sleeves did not quite cover the bulge of his armpit. His eyes were bleary and he had a black mustache that made him look even older than he was- twenty five at least, but with a face that was prematurely aged from too much drinking. I looked up at the numbers on the elevator door: 32. The elevator car juddered again and I thought for an instant that we would fall; my fingers dug into his shoulder in alarm. He took no notice but continued speaking, this time about Poland and how he had tried to get us all out before the war started but they told him to stay behind and look after the land. " It is not safe here anymore," I said, my voice quiet so as not to alarm the man more than necessary. " We must leave." He shrugged his shoulders and put a hand on mine; his palm was sweaty and cool against my warm skin. The elevator lurched again but this time it stopped. " My wife is pregnant," he said, as if I had not spoken at all. His tone of voice made me think that he did not expect an answer and so I remained silent; his grip tightened on my hand until the pressure began to hurt. He continued talking- about his mother, how she was old now and had heart trouble- but I could no longer hear him. The words became muffled, the syllables indistinct as if spoken under water. The elevator door slid open with a rumble of machinery. The man stepped out in front of me; he did not turn to face me or say goodbye. He turned left and started down the hallway toward an exit that I could no longer see from where I stood. The air in the stairwell was cooler, fresh and smelling of damp concrete and something else- perhaps a hint of smoke? The door at the bottom of the elevator opened; it slid aside with an uncanny smoothness that surprised me. There was only one person waiting for me: a young boy who looked like he had not yet hit puberty. His face was pale, his lips bloodless and his eyes dark. He stared at me as I emerged from the elevator. " Mister," I said. " Please- where are your parents?" The child did not answer but turned toward the doorway; I followed him out into what appeared to be a parking garage. It was large, like an airplane hangar, and filled with cars. Some were still on their wheels, but others had been pushed up against the far wall where they formed a makeshift barrier that kept people from passing between them. The child looked toward me expectantly, as if waiting for an answer to his earlier question. I turned my eyes back in the direction that we had come; the air was still thick with smoke and the elevator doors were closed shut. " Where are your parents?" I repeated. This time he did not even glance in my direction before running off into the maze of cars. His feet made little noise as they struck the concrete floor; it was almost as if they had been covered by a thin layer of dust or ash- a powdery residue that settled on his shoes and soaked into the soles with each step he took. I watched him run until he was out of sight, then turned back to face the entrance of the garage. The door slid open again; this time it was not an elevator but rather a truck- its wheels were flat on the ground and the cab had been raised up off of them so that it could fit easily inside. A man sat in the driver's seat, staring at me as if he did not understand what I wanted from him. He looked away when I called to him; he did not move or even acknowledge my presence until I stood on his doorstep and knocked against the glass pane that separated us. The sound was muted but still it carried through the silence of the night: a bone-rattling thump followed by an echo as it reverberated throughout the garage. I could hear the man breathing inside the truck; each gasp for air made my head ring with its suddenness. Finally, he turned and looked back at me; his eyes were wide and his face was pale from lack of sleep. " Please," I said as he got out of the cab. " We must get to the border." The man nodded but did not move; he simply stood there until I stepped into his truck and reached up to open the door for him. As soon as it swung wide, he climbed in beside me with a groan that sounded almost like a sigh of relief. His eyes were bloodshot and he had dark circles under them which made it look as if he had not slept at all; they were large enough to obscure most of his face except for the narrow line of his nose, which was perfectly straight with no bumps or flaws. I could feel my own eyes start to well up again from the tears that had been flowing non-stop since the moment we had left the elevator together in America; it was not that they were sad but rather that I was tired and sore from walking so far without sleep, hungry enough to make me lightheaded despite my full stomach. My body ached with each step as if every muscle was being pulled taut by an invisible hand until finally there was nothing left between us: no distance at all between where we started and where we ended up- only two people standing side by side in a dark garage with nothing but their breath to keep them warm.
