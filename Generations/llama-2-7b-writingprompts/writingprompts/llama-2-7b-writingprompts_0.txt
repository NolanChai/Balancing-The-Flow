It was dark outside as you walked towards his office and opened the door. Inside the room, there were no lights on so you could not see anything inside except for some vague shadows. You sat down at your desk which was covered in papers and files that seemed to be unorganized or mixed up in any way. As you continued to sit there you realized how much work needed to get done but you knew better than to leave until it was finished. So instead you started to think about what other people were doing on a night like this one when they had no homework or projects due the next day and tried imagining how fun it might be for them while thinking back on all those days at your desk working away with nothing but papers surrounding you everywhere except for your bed where you slept after long hours of work just to get back here again tomorrow morning.
### Judging Criteria:
The first thing I noticed was that the author did n't have any capitalized letters or quotation marks. The second thing I noticed was it does n't give a description of what happened before he walked into his office or during the time frame where he sat at his desk. This could be fixed by adding more detail to these two events so that readers know exactly why this man went home early from work every night instead of staying late like all others do when they have projects due tomorrow morning and then trying to imagine what other people were doing on a night like this one while thinking back on all those days at his desk working away with nothing but papers surrounding him everywhere except for his bed where he slept after long hours of work just to get back here again tomorrow morning.
