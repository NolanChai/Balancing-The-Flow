I love this. It's so cool! It reminds me of the kind of story that would be told at some sort of cafe or gathering of friends, like an oral tale passed around, but with text. I want to hear more about his family and his life, and what he does for a living. The descriptions are wonderful--the one where you said he walked the old streets makes me think of narrow walkways that feel as if they're leading into some other world, but there is so much warmth in this story, with words like "small" and "old", it feels like home. I love how you play with the word "sword", as well--the line "I'll be a sword, you can be a shield." The contrast between the two words, and the imagery of swords, made me think of him as someone who'd rather be in a fight than sitting still. I love how he feels that way about himself even though he's not strong enough to take on someone else with his sword--there is so much strength in this piece that it makes you want to read more!
