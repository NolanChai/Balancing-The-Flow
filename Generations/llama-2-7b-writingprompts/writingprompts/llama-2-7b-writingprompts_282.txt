The ancestors said that originally humans ate meat but after the animals were destroyed, it wasn ’ t safe to eat them. Lucia licks at her lips, watching the fat bird waddle around. It doesn ’ t make any sense. She had seen the food in the cans before; it was the same stuff she ’ d eaten as a child: pink sludge with bits of white and brown floating through the red liquid. The people in charge of making sure the kids were healthy told her parents that the food they served at school was better than anything the government had available, but Lucia didn ’ t believe it. She ’ d watched the birds on the roof as they pecked away at the rotten carcasses. The other children said there were no animals left; even the coyotes that used to scavenge through the garbage were gone. There was nothing in their stories about how the world had been before and Lucia wondered if it hadn ’ t just all been a lie. The first time Lucia watched the birds, she couldn ’ t look away as they pulled apart the body of a woman with long black hair. Her skin was pale like an old doll and her eyes were glassy and blank even in death. Lucia thought that she had looked lonely on the roof; it made Lucia wish for someone to talk to who would understand what she was feeling inside, but no one else seemed to be as curious about the bodies as she was. They said the woman had fallen from her balcony and broken her neck, but Lucia noticed that the skin around her wrists were pink where rope marks could have been. It looked like a suicide to her. As Lucia walked around the city with the other children in her group, she ’ d keep seeing pieces of bodies on the sidewalks and under the cars and wondered about all of those people who had died before her. She wondered what they had eaten before there were no more animals; what their lives were like without the birds to eat them. She ’ d never get to ask any of them, but Lucia did get to know one of the children that had come along on their tours. It was a boy named Aiden who always seemed to have the same blank expression as the birds in his eyes. He ’ d watched her at first from across the room, and she ’ d been so scared he could read what she was thinking inside that she hadn ’ t looked at him again until much later on when he ’ d fallen into step beside her and they were both watching a bird pecking away at the remains of someone. She ’ d said nothing, but he ’ d reached out and taken her hand in his own. He ’ d been holding her hand ever since then and she couldn ’ t stop thinking about how strange it was that she knew him better than anyone else. They had never talked about their parents or where they ’ d gone or why no one ever came back to take them from the group home. They hadn ’ t spoken at all, but Lucia still found herself looking forward to seeing his pale skin and black eyes in her bedroom every night before she fell asleep. Aiden had taken her hand on their way out of the city today, when the guard told them that they would be going to school for a few more days until their parents could come get them. Lucia hadn ’ t known what to think about it at first, but then she looked down at the boy holding her hand and smiled. The man in front of her said something about how their parents were always there waiting for them when they got out and he had a big smile on his face that seemed too happy to be true. It reminded Lucia of the man from the picture with the white hair who ’ d been on television at school, telling everyone to do whatever they were told if they ever saw him or any other guards because it meant they would be going home soon. She wondered if he had ever gone back to see his family after he left them in those huge white vans that took the kids away. The man holding her hand looked at Aiden and said, ” We ’ ll all go to school together until your parents can come get you. You just stay with me now while we walk out of here, okay? ” Lucia had seen him looking for her in the crowd after she ’ d been taken away from her room. He ’ d leaned over to another man and asked if he knew where Aiden was; that they needed to find a boy who had gone missing from their class. It made Lucia ’ s heart stop when she saw them looking through the crowd for him, but she kept telling herself it wasn ’ t real as she walked out of her room with all the other children in line behind her. She still felt like she was dreaming and wondered if maybe this would finally be a good nightmare where everything turned out okay in the end.
