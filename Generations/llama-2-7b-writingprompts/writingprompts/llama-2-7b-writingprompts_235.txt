A lot of people don't want this episode anymore. They like it but they would rather see something more focused on the cast because it's their last time together before everyone splits up. It seems like the majority is in favor of that, especially since I've heard it was a boring episode with a bad cliffhanger and no plot advancement at all. So my question is: should we just ignore this request?
