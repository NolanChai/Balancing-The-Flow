`` Hi Mike, 
 
 It's good to hear from you again. I remember our ski lesson with fondness as well. I'm not sure why I never thought of it before this letter, but I guess we never talked about the first time you taught me how to ride a bike! I hope that I'll be able to send your wife some pictures from your funeral so she will know how much I loved you.
