So I went to the website and did an online application. After I filled it out, I waited for 10 seconds and I got a message that said `` You are not qualified.'' Then I decided to just call them up but when I called they hung up on me. So then I thought maybe it was because my phone service provider had problems with the website so I used another browser. Still no luck. Then I tried to search for other ways to apply online but nothing worked. So finally, I went to their physical headquarters and asked if there were any positions available. The secretary said `` No'' but she gave me a pamphlet of how they got started. She said that it was founded by this guy named Steve who got laid off from his job at the paper company when he decided to start up something new with his friend John, which turned out to be a big success. At first, I thought that I could work as an intern but then she told me that there were no positions available right now. Then she gave me a pamphlet on how they got started and about their future plans so I asked her if those jobs are open. She said `` Yes'' and then I started to cry because finally after 4 months of looking for work, I found something! When I get home tonight, my mom will be happy!
