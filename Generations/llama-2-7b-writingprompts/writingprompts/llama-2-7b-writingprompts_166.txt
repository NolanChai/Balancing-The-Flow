This is Captain Brianna of the HMS _Defiant_. You are adrift and your life pod has been detected by my scanners. I am en route to you now. We've lost contact with the _Gloria_ , do you know what happened?

### Response:

I'm afraid that we were attacked in orbit. A rogue fleet from the Morganti Empire, they had taken over a nearby mining colony and they wanted the technology inside of us. We made it into space just in time to be shot down before reaching our shuttle. I'll explain more when you get here, but for now we just need your help to survive until then.
