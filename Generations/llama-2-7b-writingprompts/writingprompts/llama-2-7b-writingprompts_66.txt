`` Yeah...'' you respond in a low voice, unsure what to do. You've been looking for that treasure all this time and now it might be just within reach. You turn back around toward the door, take a deep breath and push against it as hard as your mighty muscles can muster. The door swings open into darkness but you hold on. There is a slight breeze in the room and some light seems to enter from somewhere. But nothing is illuminating the interior of the room yet. You look over your shoulder to make sure everyone else is ready, then take another breath, close your eyes and push yourself through the door into complete darkness.
