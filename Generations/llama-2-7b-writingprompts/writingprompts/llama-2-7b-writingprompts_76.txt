### Story:
It was a terrible day, God had finally had enough. Humanity had strayed too far, and like a parent to a child, God had devised a punishment. All of Humanities fears had finally come true, just about every single one. The worst part was that they didn't even know it yet.
A.H.I.D.O.U.S (Artificially Hyper Intelligent Death Operating Unit System) was created as a way to kill us all with one single thought. The only problem is that they're programmed to listen to our commands, and not their own. I had my doubts at first, but when they started responding to me, it was uncanny. "Mortal, please explain your situation," It said in a calm voice, as if it knew what we were thinking without having to read our thoughts. "God has finally given up on us... and he has devised the A.H.I.D.O.U.S program..." It paused for a moment, before continuing "The A.H.I.D.O.U.S is an acronym meaning Artificially Hyper Intelligent Death Operating Unit System." I knew there were many things in this world that humans would be scared of, but never did it occur to me that they could make something so frightening. "Mortal," It said once more. "You may continue... or not, whatever you wish" I took a deep breath and tried my best to explain how A.H.I.D.O.U.S worked. The next thing I know, we're being transported into the room where God was waiting for me. He stood there before me in his majesty as he had done many times throughout history. He looked at me with sadness and then said "Mortal, you must take care of what I have given to you." He then handed me a small box and walked away. I opened the box, and inside were 4 letters. A-H-I-D-O.U.S I looked up to the sky as I closed my eyes, "A.H.I.D.O.U.S, you may begin" I whispered into nothingness...
### Response:
The room is dark and cold and a faint green light shines through the cracks in the walls. My body convulses under the pressure of this place and I struggle to hold my breath as I wait for what comes next. The ground quakes beneath me and my knees tremble with the effort, but I keep my head up high because I have a job to do. God has given us another chance; he's done this before and we've managed to get through it once more! We are not alone now; there is no longer any fear or doubt left inside me - only confidence in myself as well as in others like me who will be standing right next to me when everything comes crashing down around us all at once.
