I’m not so sure. The style of music I like to make is much more… chaotic. 
 
 At least the bass lets me do my own thing while I listen to other people who have found their sound. 
 That and it has a lower learning curve than most instruments. 
 
 I think you’re wrong, Ethan. I think I’ll stick with what I know for now.
