`The drinks are on me`, the bartender said with a shrug and a smile. He had seen them all, the men in suits with their cold blue eyes and the way they could look through you like glass, they always made him feel small. But they were not here now, only he was left to tend bar alone, a young man with dreams of an alien city that he never found. `You know how it is, we are all just waiting for something`, said the bartender as he poured another drink and passed it across the counter. Alistair nodded, looking away as he sipped on his drink, his mind wondering about a life far from here. The barkeep looked at him in the mirror behind the bar, `Their are so many out there`, said the bartender, noticing how young and worn down Alistair had become. Alistair's eyes rose from their empty stare to look back at the man, `How long have you been here?` Alistair asked as he eyed the barkeep with a shaking hand. The man leaned in close so that his breath touched the other's face and whispered quietly, `I don't know why I do this anymore. It is all just for show`, said the bartender looking into Alistair's eyes. Alistair nodded with a shake of head, as he slid his mix down his throat. `We are all just waiting for something` The barkeep poured another shot and passed it across the counter as he leaned in close again, ``You should take that back to your room, they will be here soon''. Alistair stood up and walked towards the door without looking at the bartender who was still watching him from behind the mirror. The barkeep turned away as he heard the slamming of a door; his mind wandered as he looked down into the empty glass before him. He had always been alone, not even his mother loved him and yet he remained here day after day waiting for something more. He took another sip from his drink before sliding it onto the bar, looking at it with nothing but disgust. The bartender grabbed a napkin to wipe away what was left of the stain on his hand, and then walked towards the back room as he heard a knock at the door. It had always been the same; he could hear the footsteps slowly getting closer until they finally reached the end of the bar where the man stood. His blue eyes scanned the room, taking in everything around him before settling on the man behind the counter. The bartender looked up to see a tall man with silver hair standing behind him with arms crossed, looking down at him with a smile. `How much time has passed?`, said the man in a cold tone of voice that made the barkeep feel small and weak. He could do nothing but stare blankly back at his client as he was told to bring him another drink, ``You should be careful when you take those. They have been known to leave their mark on some''. The bartender watched silently from behind the counter as his customer slid the shot glass across towards the man and walked away. The man grabbed the glass and downed it in a single gulp, ``What are we waiting for?`` said the man with silver hair as he wiped the foam off of his mouth with a napkin. Alistair stood up from behind his desk and walked towards the door where the barkeep was standing, ``We are waiting to see what happens'', he whispered softly in a voice that carried no meaning, but made him feel alive.
