I heard a thump, and then Wealthy screamed his little heart out. I rushed down the hallway and into his room, and Bites People was already kneeling by him, his leg in her hands. 
 
 `` You. Off.'' I said as calmly as possible, which is not at all calming when you're holding a sharp knife. Bites People stared at me for a long moment before getting to her feet and backing away from Wealthy's bed, where the poor little guy was crying hysterically. 
 
 `` What the hell?'' I said. 
 
 `` The hell is right,'' she said. `` Did you hear me tell him not to touch my stuff? No, of course not. You're so busy fucking other girls that you don't even listen to me when I talk to you anymore! I need money for a new laptop and these damned pants were the only pair that would fit me today because you keep spending all the rent money on your stupid gambling habit.'' 
 
 `` I know, babe. We'll talk about it later, okay? You just need to let me finish getting dressed before we leave.'' Bites People crossed her arms and turned away from me. She was still crying silently as I pulled on my pants and grabbed my jacket off the bedpost. 
 
 `` Look,'' I said. `` We'll get you whatever you want today, alright? And we'll talk about why I keep gambling tonight when we get home. Okay?'' She turned back to me with tears in her eyes and a sniffle in her voice. 
 
 `` You mean it?'' she asked. 
 
 `` Yes, babe, I mean it. Now quit your crying before you ruin my eye makeup.'' Bites People dried her eyes and wiped away the mascara that was threatening to run down her cheeks. She put on a weak smile and nodded her head as she reached for me. 
 
 `` Alright, let's go.'' I said as we hugged goodbye and kissed one last time before going out into the hallway. Bites People rushed to lock up Wealthy in his room after I paid off the babysitter, but we were both too scared of what Wealthy could do with that knife. 
 
 `` Oh my god!'' she said as we started walking down the street. 
 
 `` What?'' I asked. 
 
 `` Look at your hair! It looks like shit, and it's so long now. You look like a fucking hippie!'' Bites People spun in front of me with a big grin on her face as she examined my mop. She ran her hands through the tangles before taking out her iPhone to take a picture. 
 
 `` I love it,'' she said. `` And you're going to have so much fun styling it!'' We walked down the street until we got to our car and started making our way home. Bites People was still oohing and ahhing over my hair as she sat in the front passenger seat with her legs crossed and her hands on her knees. She never took them out of that position while I was driving. 
 
 `` It looks really cool,'' she said. `` Do you want to get it cut tonight? We're both off so we can go together if you'd rather not be late for work tomorrow morning.'' Bites People looked at me with puppy dog eyes as I parked the car in front of our apartment building. 
 
 `` Yeah, why not?'' I said. We walked inside and went down to the basement to use the laundry room's bathroom for one last time before closing it up for the night. I grabbed my keys from the table on the way out the door. As we stepped outside again, Bites People was already calling for an appointment at a local barber shop. The one that cuts my hair was close to our house, so I agreed and told her I'd meet her there after work in about 2 hours. We were both going to get some stuff done on the way home anyway, so we decided not to bother with dinner tonight. That meant I would have more money for gambling later, and Bites People was always happy as long as she got new clothes. As for me... well, at least I didn't have to spend time cleaning up after Wealthy again. 
 
 `` I want you to take my picture tonight,'' I said as we walked back inside the apartment building. Bites People smiled and nodded her head before turning around and putting on some makeup while I grabbed the knife from behind our sofa. I was going to need it later...
