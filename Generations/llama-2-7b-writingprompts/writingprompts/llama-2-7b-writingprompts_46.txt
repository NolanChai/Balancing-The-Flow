### Context:

* This is the first time I've heard this sound and it was pretty interesting to me, so I decided to record it and see what I could learn about it. 

* It turns out that this sound has been identified as the "Hunger" sound from the Google Home Hub (A smart speaker with a display), which is one of several sounds used in place of speech while performing various actions, such as turning on/off lights or playing music. 

* It was originally designed to help keep privacy in mind, but it's also really neat that they have these audio cues so that people who are visually impaired can know what the device is doing. 

### Title:

`Hunger`

### Emotional Value:

* Happy

### Id:

* I think it's pretty obvious that this sounds like a robot telling you to Eat, and if it were in a movie/show/etc. it would definitely have a "Dystopian" feel to it, but for me personally, this sound is a reminder of home; It's the little things that make you realize how much you miss someplace or someone, so I always get happy when I hear something like this because I think about my Grandma and her Google Home Hub. 

* If this were in a movie/show/etc it would probably be used to make people feel uneasy/scared.
