`` Oh I agree! I think the more coverage in there, the better! It makes all the difference, and this way you can really get a nice even coat of color on your entire canvas. That's something you should definitely keep in mind when working with paint, is making sure that it's spread evenly across your work space so you don't have any holes or patches where there isn't enough color and it makes the whole thing look a little bit sloppy!``
