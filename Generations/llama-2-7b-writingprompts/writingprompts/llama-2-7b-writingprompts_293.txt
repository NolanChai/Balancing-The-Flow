It's been almost two years since my last post here on Talky, but I figured it was about time I made another one. A lot has changed in the world since I posted my last message. The economy is shit. I thought things would get better with time. Nothing has changed. If anything, it seems that it's harder these days to get a job. It use to be that you'd send an application and hear something back within two weeks, but now, it can take months for any type of response.
