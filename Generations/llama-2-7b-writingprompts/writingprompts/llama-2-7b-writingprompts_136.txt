Its hard not to want to play a part when you have 20 people on your street that you know very well. A few evenings after moving in, he was over for a beer and I said something about the party being fun. He agreed and added “ I think its good to see my neighbors get along so well.” Its true, our neighborhood is pretty tightly knit; we ’ ve got an informal block watch going on.

### Response:
He said something like this. I asked him if he thought it was a little premature ( since I hadn’t been there for very long) and he said something to the effect of “ well, when you live with someone for as long as we have, it ’ s a good idea to make sure they ’ re not going to kill or rob us. ”
