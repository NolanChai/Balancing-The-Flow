Nora came to the door, and then opened it. It was a nice day today. The sunshine filled her room with warmth. She was in an okay mood. She smiled as she entered the room and saw him. She sat down at his desk. There were pens and pencils lined up neatly on the table. She picked one of them, a yellow pen. She wrote down what they had been doing so far. They had been studying, preparing for this very day. The final test would be here soon. Her heart beat faster as she remembered all of the knowledge he had given her to pass onto him. It was time to finish up her project. He sat there quietly. She noticed his eyes looking down. She knew that it was time. She turned back around and looked at what she had written. There were two words on a piece of paper. She thought for a moment and then spoke the only thing that made sense in her mind. The pen moved quickly over the page. He looked up from where he sat, his eyes looking straight into hers. Her eyes were bright with tears as she watched him. The pen continued moving across the paper. There was silence. Nora looked down at what she had written and smiled. She grabbed the blue pen in her hands. She thought back to a conversation they had shared long ago, before things began. She wrote one more thing on the page.
