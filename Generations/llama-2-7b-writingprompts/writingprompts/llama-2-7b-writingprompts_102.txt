`` Aaaaaaahhhh!'' I shouted and turned to run away. He ran behind me grabbing onto my arm in a vice-like grip, dragging me back and pinning me against the wall of the room. His cold breath blew onto my neck as he stared into my eyes with his own burning holes, `` What do you want?'' I yelled in fear. 
 
 He smiled and pointed to a file lying on the floor at our feet, `` This one's for you.'' The words were n't meant to comfort me but rather scare me into submission. The blood ran cold throughout my veins as he picked it up and began reading from it. 
 
 `` Do n't worry about what it says because I know that you are a man of action, not one for words.'' His words were calm and his voice was even but his eyes still burned into me, making them hard to read. He paused and looked at the paper once more, `` You do remember this do n't you?'' 
 
 I stood still with no answer as my breathing became laborious due to fear. He smiled at the effect it was having on me but continued with his words anyway, `` Do you know what happens if you do not comply with your new task?'' His eyes were hard now and he did n't seem like a man who would be happy with any reply other than an answer in the affirmative. 
 
 `` Yes sir.'' I replied as his hand loosened from my arm. He nodded, picked up the folder again and left. My heart was pounding in my chest as I stood there staring at him before he turned back and looked at me, `` You have one week to carry out your task, do n't disappoint us or you will face our wrath!'' And with that he left. 
 
 I ran over and picked up the folder off of the floor as my hand shook and the words fell from my trembling fingers. There was only one word on it: `` MISSION'.
