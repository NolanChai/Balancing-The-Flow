As she lay there waiting for my answer, I knew it was time to end her suffering, and I knew it would hurt me more than it ever will her. She had taught me so much about life, so much about love, I did not know if I could let her go. But I did. 
 
 It felt like an eternity as the needle pierced her skin. 
 
 She was gone a moment later. 
 
 Her spirit flew away on angel's wings. 
 
 I had taken my first step into becoming who I am today, a person of strength and courage. And it scared me more than anything in life.
