`` That is not true... She will be okay once we give her the help she needs...'' The man replied. 
 
 `` How can you say that?!'' I asked incredulously. `` How can you say that when she has been in a psych ward before and was found unconscious outside of it after being released?? She needed to be kept there!! What is wrong with her?! You know what is wrong with her...'' I exclaimed. `` 
 
 `` It's for her own good, you do not understand...'' the man responded once more. He began to turn away from me and continued to walk down the hallway when suddenly he stopped in his tracks. His eyes locked on mine. 
 
 `` What is wrong with her?'' he said once again, this time with a different inflection. This time I had an answer for him... 
 
 `` Nothing's wrong with her at all! She has just been through a lot! A traumatic event and she's trying to cope! It is not her fault that they have to lock her in a room!!'' I said. The man looked confused but also hopeful as he listened to my reply. `` I understand...'' He replied. 
 
 `` So will you please take her back? She doesn't belong here. Her family does n't even want anything to do with her, they want nothing more than for us to take her and leave her somewhere that she can get better!'' I asked in a desperate plea. I had been trying my hardest to help this girl for almost six months now... 
 
 `` She is n't going anywhere until we give her the help she needs... We have to do what is right by her...'' the man said sternly. I looked at him, anger coursing through me as he spoke... `` You are wrong about this! You don't even know who you're talking to!! She was in a psych ward before, and we got her out of there because she needed some time away from it all and now look where she is again!!! How many times does someone have to get sent into one before they learn?!'' I exclaimed. 
 
 `` We need to keep an eye on her until she gets better... That's all we are doing, that's all any of us can do... She has been through a lot and now it's up to us to help her get back on track again... We just want what is best for her, that's all.'' The man said. 
 
 `` You don't know what you're talking about!'' I snapped back at him before turning around to walk away from the building once more when suddenly he stopped me in my tracks... 
 
 `` Can you please just help her get better? If you really care then maybe we can work something out.'' He said as his eyes locked on mine, a look of desperation and hope in them. 
 
 I looked at him for what seemed like an eternity before finally turning back towards him with my arms wide open... `` Yes! Of course! Whatever you need from me then just tell me and we will see what can be done!'' I exclaimed happily as tears began to stream down my face. 
 
 The man smiled at me and said, `` Thank you so much for agreeing to help us with her... We really appreciate it a lot...'' He replied before turning around once more and leaving the building. 
 
 I watched him walk away until he was out of sight when suddenly an overwhelming sense of sadness came over me. The man had been right, this girl needed some help to get back on track again. She had been through a lot recently but now it was up to me and my teammates at children protective services to give her the tools she needs in order for us all to move forward together as one... 
 
 I stood there with tears streaming down my face, feeling helpless yet determined at the same time. The next step was getting back out into the field again and helping this young girl get better...
