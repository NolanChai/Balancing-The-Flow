What? You a dumbass. The whole world knows that shit. The only reason they let us go to highschool is so we can work at McDonalds or get drafted into the military, that's it.
 
 A lot of people think the same way as me, but I know you, you just like to pretend. You're too smart for school. They just don't realize how bad they've made our generation out to be. We all hate them, but we hate ourselves more. There is nothing left in this country that we can trust anymore, and its not their faults. I guess the first thing we have to do is stop blaming them for everything, because we did it to ourselves.
 
 All our problems began with a little book called "The Protocols of Zion". A conspiracy theory created by Henry Ford who made an anti-Jewish pamphlet in order to sell his car. 
 
 The Jewish people have been blamed for everything under the sun, from controlling the world's economy and owning all the banks and corporations, to causing wars. We even blame them for killing Jesus. And I don't think they killed Jesus, I just think you people are insane. 
 
 The truth is they do control a lot of our worldly problems. They've had their hands in everything since the beginning of time, and that has caused allot of suffering. It started with King Solomon, and it got worse from there. They control almost every major industry. That includes entertainment, media, healthcare, technology, and politics.
 
 Everyone knows this already, we've even had a president who went public about the secret government agencies and their conspiracies to hide our history of human experimentation on all kinds of drugs like LSD, mescaline, heroin, cocaine, marijuana, alcohol and more. 
 
 So you might say we are all aware, but now is not the time for apathy. The truth can only be hidden for so long, eventually it will come out. When that happens your generation and those after you won't have to deal with the consequences of our actions, you will be forced to live in fear and pain because we chose ignorance.
 
 I know you probably think this is some kind of crazy conspiracy theory but its not. We can learn allot about the past by looking at what they did today. The same things that are being done now, were done to us. It's a cycle. 
 
 Look how much we trust our government and their healthcare system? In Germany during WWII, Jews who didn't get sick or die were sent off to concentration camps because of their "Gypsy" bloodlines that supposedly made them inferiors. People like you and me. Today we have a similar situation with the flu vaccinations that are mandated for school children every year. We call it immunizations but we all know they're just another way to sterilize people and make us submissive. 
 
 So now you understand why I'm here, I am here to warn you of what is happening in your world today because I wish someone would have warned me when I was young so that I could have prevented the suffering of future generations. Your generation is going to be the most persecuted in history. You will live under a system where anyone who doesn't follow their rules will be deemed an enemy. 
 
 A new kind of Gestapo called Homeland Security has been created and they are on a rampage through the country. They have the power to take your children from you for any reason, or put you into prison for the smallest infraction, even if it's something as ridiculous as saying "Merry Christmas". 
 
 Your generation will be forced to live in fear and hate of one another, because that is what they want. They need a population who hates each other so much that we kill ourselves off rather than help one another survive. The only ones who are able to escape the tyranny of this world are the Jews, just like it was then, its not going to be any different now. 
 
 All the big corporations like Google and Amazon own all your data, they know where you are at all times. They use artificial intelligence to predict your behavior which will eventually lead them to predicting who will commit a crime in the future based on what they see happening with their AI's today. This is how the government has been able to catch so many people just because of the things they saw on Facebook and Youtube. 
 
 I know you don't think this will happen, but I'm here to tell you that it already has in Germany, Poland, Russia, China, Cambodia, Rwanda and other countries. It was done by people like you who chose to turn a blind eye towards their suffering so they could continue on with their life. 
 
 Now is the time for all of us to start taking action before its too late. If you want to survive the coming apocalypse then you have to wake up and prepare yourself now, because there are no heroes in this story. All we can do is save our own family and ourselves. The only thing that's going to help us is community and sharing what little supplies we have left with each other. 
 
 So please stop pretending like you're too smart for school or think you know more about the world than everyone else, because in my experience they're all the same. You are nothing special, just another sheep being led to slaughter, and I am here to tell you that there is a better way. 
 
 All of this madness will end if we can just stop listening to them long enough to figure out who they really are. They're the same people who control our government, they've been in charge for thousands of years and they are going to do anything it takes to make sure their power stays intact even if its at the expense of our lives.
 
 Please don't let them fool you into thinking this is just another conspiracy theory. That's exactly what they want you to think, because when we finally wake up and realize they have been lying to us for generations then it will be too late. They'll already know how much pain and suffering their actions are causing the world around them and they won't care anymore. 
 
 If we can all just stop watching TV and reading the news for long enough then maybe we can figure out what they are hiding from us before its too late. I know that sounds impossible, but look at how many people were able to turn off their phones last week when the power grid went down? We're already halfway there. 
 
 You don't have to listen to me because everything you just read is my opinion and yours will probably be different. But please consider all that I have said, because if it was me ten years ago then maybe its time for you to wake up as well. If not now, when?
