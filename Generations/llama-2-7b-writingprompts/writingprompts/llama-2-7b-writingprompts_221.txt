`` Yes sir.'' Mark replied with an even longer sigh. 
 
 Johnson's face turned bright red at the use of his last name instead of 'God', but he held back his anger in order to get what he wanted out of this new disciple. `` So... what would you have for breakfast, dear follower?'' 
 
 Mark thought about it before saying `` Oh yeah, can I get a McMuffin, too?'' Johnson's face contorted with rage as he shouted: `` NO!! You will eat only what the Almighty provides!'' He then grabbed Mark by his collar and dragged him to the cafeteria where he was forced to eat a bowl of grits, a plate of cornbread and a glass of milk. 
 
 `` Yum yum!'' Mark said with a smile as Johnson left, pleased with how quickly he'd converted another person into following his commands. `` This is going to be the easiest thing ever!'' Johnson thought as he walked back to his desk, still thinking about what Mark had called him.

God then walked over to the two of them and asked: `` What in the name of Mother Mary is going on here!? Why are you referring to me as your father, Mark!? And what is this Johnson guy doing here!?''

 `` He is definitely a tyrant... but what we did worked perfectly.'' God said, trying to contain his anger. `` So now that you've got me all pissed off, you guys are going to Hell for your actions!'' Mark and Johnson both cried out in terror as they realized they had just been screwed over by the very man who created Heaven...
