`Well, hello there.' I say as i open my front door. A young lady dressed up like a goth walks in and sits down at my dining table with a look of distaste.`Yes, you can stay here for the night' I say to her.`I'm not paying for this. You need to do your laundry, cook me something nice, clean up after yourself, and go to sleep early because school starts tomorrow.' I state sternly. The girl nods slowly`Sure thing.' she says in a monotone voice.`Oh you're just like my wife *BLEEP* You have no idea how much i love her.' I say as I pour a glass of milk and sit down at the table opposite her. She stares straight ahead with blank eyes. I look across to see that she is chewing on her arm, blood dripping onto the table.`How long has it been' I ask inquisitively`Two days.' she replies and spits out a piece of flesh as if it was something i just said. She looks at me with a look of confusion.`It's so quiet here' she says calmly, and then shrieks like a banshee.`AAAAAAAHHHHH!!!' She screams. I sit in the chair completely dumbstruck by her sudden outburst. I run into my room and grab a revolver. As i turn around to see what she was doing, she is gone. `WHAT THE BLEEP IS WRONG WITH YOU' I yell at the top of my lungs in an effort to summon this girl back. Then all of a sudden a man walks into my kitchen and puts his hand on my shoulder.`Well hello there Mr. *BLEEP* We have been looking for you everywhere.' He says with a grin. I turn around and see that i'm surrounded by what seems to be a group of people, but there is only one person in front of me`We were sent here by your wife to clean up this house and get rid of the riff raff, so if you would kindly hand over your weapons.' The man says as he takes my revolver. I nod slightly and begin walking towards my room. As i enter, there is an unfamiliar woman sitting on my bed staring at a computer with her feet up on my desk.`Well hello there' she says in a voice similar to the girl's`My name is Sarah. Your wife sent me over here to get rid of this filth.' She stands up and looks down at me, I'm not sure what it is about her eyes but i could tell that they were looking right through my soul. `I see that you have some weapons in your room' she says as a grin spreads across her face.`It's just for protection, I am n't quite sure how to react to all of these people who are just showing up out of nowhere.' I reply`Oh we would n't want anyone to get hurt now would we?' she asks sarcastically. `No' I say meekly as i walk towards my room and close the door behind myself. She turns around and looks at all the other people who have showed up in her place.`I have found where they are hiding.' She says with a tone of excitement`Alright let's go.' The man with the gun says. They all follow Sarah as she walks towards my room. As I close the door behind me, i can hear a faint knocking on the other side. A chill runs down my spine as i shiver.`Now it is time to do some cleaning.' She says, as if nothing has happened. `You will first wash my clothes in this sink and then hang them up outside.'`Okay' I reply meekly as she pushes me towards the sink. As soon as my hands are soaking in the water, i hear a scream coming from somewhere else in the house.`AAAAAAAHHH! AAAAHHHH!!!' The screams fill the room, and then there is silence.`We need to go now.' She says sternly.`Okay' I reply. As we are leaving, she grabs my arm and whispers into my ear`Be sure you do n't come back here again'. And with that said, they all disappear into thin air. When i get home tonight there is no one around as usual but as soon as i turn the key in the door something feels off. I slowly open it to see if someone has broken in and nothing is out of place except for a few bloody clothes scattered on the floor. The smell hits me like a brick wall, blood stains are everywhere, some seem fresh others are dried. I rush towards my wife's room and notice that she is not in there or anywhere else for that matter. I rush into our kitchen and see that it has been wiped clean of all the blood. There is a note on the fridge that reads`If you find this message, then please be sure to follow the instructions below.' I rip off the top flap and look inside. The first instruction was to get rid of my weapons as fast as possible, which i have already done. The second instruction tells me to go into a dark room and close the door behind me. So that is what I did. As soon as i closed the door, i felt a cold chill run down my spine. I shiver slightly in response.`Well hello there.' A familiar voice echoes in the darkness `Oh you must be lost' Another voice speaks`It is n't safe here anymore.' The first says. Then silence.`What do we have to do?' I ask, trying to hold back my fear.`We must do what he said' The second replies. Suddenly there is a scream in the distance, it grows louder and louder until i can no longer hear myself think`It's time.' A voice says as a light shines through a crack in the door. As soon as the door opens a large black figure steps inside. I try to run but it is too late, he grabs me by the throat and pushes me into the chair.`Hello there' He whispers`I am Mr. *BLEEP* It is time for you to become part of this family.' And then i wake up.`Oh no' I say as i look at my watch it is 5am, I have been asleep for 6 hours, that must mean... Yes i know what must mean and the only question I now have to ask myself is *BLEEP* is Mr. *BLEEP*.
