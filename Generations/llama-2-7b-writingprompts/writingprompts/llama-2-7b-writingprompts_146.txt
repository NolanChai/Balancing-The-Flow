`` And your taxes?''
 
 You do n't want to know. 
 
 You ca n't get out of the taxes, even if you are a celebrity and your name is Tiger Woods. I mean…how many millionaires can claim that they have never had any money troubles at all? There were n't too many of those on the Forbes List this year! And they ca n't say it's because they spent a lot; they're not even in the Top 50 for people who spend the most. But they ca n't say that they saved like fools either…I mean, after taxes I'm still gonna be in debt more than half a billion bucks! 
 
 And even if I was n't going to be so rich (which is highly unlikely), I would never have won the jackpot. Not with all the people who play the lottery every day, and not with all the other millionaires who play as well. You might think that a person like me has a chance of winning because they work hard for their money and spend it frugally…but you'd be wrong! I know what my chances were before the drawing, and the odds are n't in our favor, not by a long shot! 
 
 So why did I win? 
 
 The lottery is an example of the law of large numbers: If I played enough times, eventually, one time, I would win. And that was what happened last night. 
 
 It's funny to think how many people do n't even believe in statistics anymore. In fact, there are still a lot of people who do n't believe in evolution either…and that is just because they want to hold onto something that's not true! You can try as hard as you want to deny the law of large numbers; it will always apply no matter how much you wish it did n't. 
 
 Of course, I ca n't say I was happy about the fact that my $ 326 million got taxed out from under me! But then again…if I won $ 300 million, what would I do with the extra $ 2 million? 
 
 `` You could give some to charity.''
 
 What for? To help other people who need it just as much as I did before I won the jackpot? Forget that! I'm going to spend my money on myself, and that is why I played in the first place! If you do n't believe me, ask yourself: Do you think I would have bought a house if there was no lottery prize? 
 
 `` I guess not.''
 
 Well…that's just how it works. We play to get rich because we want to be rich; why else would we bother to buy a ticket? If there were no jackpot, and the only thing you could win was $ 100, who in their right mind would waste $ 2 on a lottery ticket? No one! And if everyone did that, then nobody would have any money to play with. It's just how it is. The richer you get from gambling, the more people will come out to gamble too…and eventually someone is going to win big time! 
 
 You might think that I am selfish for not sharing my winnings; but what did I do wrong? It's not like I stole anyone else's money or anything. If I did n't play the lottery, who knows…I might be dead by now. Or homeless. Maybe even starving! So why should you feel bad for me when my life has been so easy since last night? 
 
 `` You are just lucky.''
 
 Yeah. Lucky to have a good job that pays well, and lucky enough to find out I was n't going to get fired last week, even though it seems like every other day someone gets laid off! If you were in my shoes, would you want me to share the winnings with people who do n't have a good job? Or maybe if you knew what it felt like not having enough money for rent or groceries, you wo n't think so highly of the government! 
 
 I'm just saying. If you do n't believe me, then go ahead and find another rich person who does n't mind sharing his money with everyone else…but I bet you ca n't find one! 
 
 And now that I think about it, there is one other thing people will probably wonder: `` Why did he tell us he won the lottery?'' Well…I have n't decided what I am going to do yet. But if no one else claims the money before I decide how much of my winnings should be shared with others and how much should stay in my bank account, then you might just find out for yourself why winning the lottery is a really bad idea! 
 
 `` You are just lucky.''
 
 Yeah. Lucky to have been born into a family that has money, and lucky enough to know there is always someone who is n't as fortunate as I am. 
 
 I am also lucky because the government lets me keep most of my winnings…but maybe they should change the law so more people like me can be rich too! If only we had a better economy…and if there was no such thing as taxes, then everyone would have an equal chance at winning big time! 
 
 But until then, I will try to live by my favorite saying: `` Life is n't fair.'' So who cares about the lottery? It does not matter what you win…you still lose in the end! And if there was no such thing as money or winning prizes at all…what would we have to play for? 
 
`` What would you do with your winnings?'' 
 
 `` I'd go into politics.''
