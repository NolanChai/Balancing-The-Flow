I had been having trouble lately and now it is clear. The call came in about an accident on the road to Birmingham. I told him I'd head down there right away and see what I could find. My wife said that I looked pale when I walked in last night but I said nothing was wrong. She can be such a nosy bitch sometimes, no offense. The weather has been crazy lately. It started raining really hard on the way to the crash site, it almost felt like hail but after 5 minutes or so it stopped and there were flashes of lightning every second. I arrived at the scene and there was a large crowd gathered around what appeared to be a wrecked car, I've never seen anything this bad before! It looked as though it had been hit by an airplane. There were no survivors and some of them appeared to have been disfigured beyond recognition. I don't know how I missed the story about it but the news was talking about a strange cloud that had covered Birmingham for the past few weeks and everyone seemed really concerned about the fact that it was now disappearing!
