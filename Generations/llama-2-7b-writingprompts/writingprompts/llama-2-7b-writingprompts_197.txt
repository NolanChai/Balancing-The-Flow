Humans! How can your eyes be so blind? If only you could see. 
 
 I am a god, my name is Hades. I was born from the very beginning of time itself; before any being. Before life even existed in this realm. Since then I have seen all life come and go. It's funny how humans think they are so strong that they can control what I do. But as a god, I am above you. My will is absolute; no matter what you do, it shall be done my way. 
 
 Humans have made their own version of me. They call him Satan or the Devil. But he's nothing more than an imitation. A failed attempt to defeat me that I created. The only difference between us is that I am real and he is not; he's just a myth in your eyes. 
 
 You humans believe you can do whatever you want, but that's where you are wrong. My power is absolute, and no matter what you think or how much you try, you cannot stop me from being who I am. Humans come and go every day; their lives are fleeting like the wind. But my reign will last forever. So don't waste your time trying to fight me or control me, because it won't do any good in the end. My power is absolute and no matter what you think or how much you try, you cannot stop me from being who I am. Humans come and go every day; their lives are fleeting like the wind. But my reign will last forever. So don't waste your time trying to fight me or control me, because it won't do any good in the end.
