I stopped, my hands now empty. *Well of course they were empty, I was n't holding anything before... * Or was I? I could n't quite remember any other reason I've ever had to climb into my attic without holding a book in hand or at the very least some kind of writing utensil. But I guess that made sense: I had just finished the book, and I was n't going to be starting on another until I finished with these letters. It seemed fitting then to not have anything for my hands to do while I read. And so here I stood now in a dark corner of the attic, standing by the large trunk at the back where I'd hidden all those boxes and sacks of clothing that no longer fit. I would open them occasionally just to remind myself how different life was then from now and what it looked like when things were simpler. It did n't take too long for me to notice the box sitting on top of a few of the smaller ones, as if someone had placed it there specifically so that I could see it without having to dig too far into the piles. Of course it was n't like anyone but myself would be interested enough in my old things to come looking for them in such an obscure place anyway. But maybe it did make sense. After all, who knows what stories my attic may tell? *I suppose I could n't very well just leave this box here without opening it...* And so I went over to the small table that sat by a window at the top of the stairs and began to unwrap it with the same hands that had written the letter. As I pulled back each of the layers of paper, I could n't help but feel a strange sense of peace. It was as if whatever lay hidden beneath all these years waited patiently for me to come back to it and finally bring to light all its secrets. *Perhaps it is true what they say about old books and the magic that lies within...* I could n't help but wonder at this thought, my mind drifting off into the possibility of such things as real magic in an age where we all know it can only exist in fantasy or fiction. But there was no time to think on these matters; I had to open the box. And so when it was finally done and free from its layers of wrapping paper, I could n't help but smile at what lay inside: a small black leather book with a gold embossed cover that read *A History of Magic* in ornate letters. It was like no book I'd ever seen before; the pages were thick enough to fold and the writing was almost too beautiful to even be read as it appeared to have been written by some kind of elven scribe. But there was something more than that about this little book. Perhaps it was the way it called out to me so softly from deep within its covers, or maybe it was all those years hidden in my attic with nothing but its stories to keep it company... *But I know exactly what it is.* It's a spellbook. And it's been waiting for me for over ten years now... I do n't remember the last time I read this thing; I think I was about twelve when it fell out of my desk during one of our many arguments with my parents over whether or not they should have sent me off to boarding school. But even then, before any of that happened, there were only a handful of spells in here anyway. No wonder I never used it much back then; there's nothing to do when your magic is n't quite ready yet. But now... Now I can finally understand everything this book was trying so desperately for me to read all those years ago. And that's why my hands were empty. Because if you want to know a little more about the history of magic, then it would seem only appropriate that I use my own magic to help explain things in greater detail than what could ever be found within these pages... *I ca n't believe they thought they were hiding this from me by locking it up in their library. All they did was make sure no one else would read it, not even those who may have wanted too...* *And now that I've finally managed to get my hands on the real book, what better time than tonight?! * As I slipped into bed that night and drifted off to sleep with visions of magic dancing in front of my eyes, little did I know what would happen next...
