`` I agree'' Shrl replied as she pounded her fist on the table. A chorus of agreement echoed throughout the chamber. 
 `` Now my proposal is that we use their technology to create a device which will allow us to travel the void unnoticed and strike at our enemies where they least expect it''. 
 `` But we do not have enough resources'' Xandi countered with a shake of his head, `` we could be vulnerable to attack for centuries if we attempt this.'' 
 `` It is still better than sitting here and doing nothing'' Shrl interrupted him, her eyes narrowing to slits as she fixed him with a gaze. 
 `` I will take command of the fleet, I will leave tomorrow''. Shrl spoke with finality as she turned and strode from the chamber. Xandi looked around at his fellow council members, there were few who would dare challenge her authority now that he had been demoted to the position of High Commander of the Fleet. He rose from his chair and followed the leader of the Earthlings out of the room.
