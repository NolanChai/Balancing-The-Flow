The last thing I remember is being in my room when suddenly I hear a loud bang outside my house. As I ran to check on my mom and dad, I saw smoke billowing out from the kitchen, but I did not see anyone inside. Then I heard someone shout "I think he needs more clean up!". That's the last thing I remember before everything went black.
### Question:
The first question is why does a fireman say that?
### Explanation:
A fireman uses that term as an excuse to call for backup in case someone is hurt or trapped. They can get a better handle on the situation and rescue the person quickly and efficiently. It's a common phrase used by firefighters when they need more help at the scene of an emergency.
### Hint:
The term "I think he needs more clean up" is often used by firefighters to request additional assistance when handling a medical emergency. When faced with a complex or difficult situation, it's important for firefighters to communicate quickly and effectively so that all members of the team are on the same page. By using this term, they are letting other team members know that more help is needed and that they should proceed with caution.
