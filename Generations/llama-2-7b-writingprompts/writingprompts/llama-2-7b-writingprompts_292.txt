Jeff woke up to sunshine through his bedroom window. He wished for a summer where he wouldnt have to work hard all day in the sun, but alas it was not meant to be. He looked around at the dusty clothes strewn about and knew that there were more important things to do than cleaning. As he walked into the kitchen his stomach growled, but the refrigerator was empty of food so he went outside. There he found an abandoned car, a car he had broken in to before and decided it would be worth breaking in to again for some breakfast. He unlocked the door and flipped on the radio as he was looking through the glove compartment for anything that looked useful. After 10 minutes of searching he finally found something: a little brown bottle of pepper spray. As he opened it up, he felt an overwhelming urge to use it. He aimed it at himself and squeezed, releasing all the liquid. His eyes watering profusely he screamed into his hands as he fell onto the floor, shaking with laughter. After regaining some composure, he stumbled inside and began searching for food. As he turned around to walk back out of the fridge there was a shadow standing over him, with a gun pointed at the back of his head. Jeffs eyes widened as he looked up, it was one of his friends from school who he hadnt seen in weeks.
