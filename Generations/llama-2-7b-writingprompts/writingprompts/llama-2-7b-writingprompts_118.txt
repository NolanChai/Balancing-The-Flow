I saw a few other guards heading back, but I wasn't sure how long it would take for them to notice we were missing. The last one had a couple of guns and was definitely looking for us. We were all pretty far out of our usual patrol areas by now though... It didn't seem like he'd even make it in time, so I just turned the corner and started sprinting towards the main hall. If there's one thing that makes me feel better about being a guard here, it's knowing that I'm a lot faster than almost everyone else on this planet. It took about half an hour for him to catch up. The second he stepped around the corner he saw me standing there with my hand raised and a few of his men right behind. "What are you doing out here?" He growled.
