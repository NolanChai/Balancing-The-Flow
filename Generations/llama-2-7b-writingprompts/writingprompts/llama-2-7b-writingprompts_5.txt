( ( Possible trigger warning for sexual abuse. Not graphic, just mentioned ) ) 
 
 It started off normal, for every 10 births there was 10 deaths, it was life. It was normal. 
 
 However, a fifteen year old girl had become pregnant and the father wasn't her boyfriend but some guy who was just dumb enough to have sex with her. The child grew in her womb, with every passing day she grew bigger, it was painful as hell, and on the day of delivery, the baby didn't come out easily. 
 
 It took hours for him to be born but when he came out, his body was covered in blood and bruises, as if something had beaten him up badly. The girl screamed at her parents to take it away, because it hurt too much. They didn't listen. And when the baby turned three months old, she started developing a small bulge on her back. As time progressed, she grew more and more fatter but the baby kept growing even larger. The girl's body was now full of bruises, everyday there were new ones. 
 
 One day when the girl turned fifteen years old, something happened that changed everything. It all started with a knock on her door in the middle of the night, she thought it was some crazy person who wanted to abuse her so she ran and hid in a corner in fear. She didn't know that her father was waiting outside the room for her and he had brought some friends. 
 
 As soon as they got inside the room, her mother and sisters started crying loudly but none of them noticed or cared about what happened to their daughter. Her father dragged her out of the house and into his car where they drove for a few hours. During that time, she saw how beautiful the stars were when the sun wasn't shining anymore. She could hear her family crying from afar but all of them just seemed so far away, like it didn't matter. 
 
 When her father finally stopped at an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere and threw open his car doors, she was scared to death. As soon as he walked out with two men in handcuffs, one had a knife in his pocket. The girl started crying but the other man grabbed hold of her hair and pulled her outside. Her father followed them, saying that they could kill her now since she'd been so troublesome. 
 
 They all went inside an abandoned room with dirty floors, her father threw a few pieces of wood on the floor and asked the men to tie up the girl as tightly as possible so that she would be able to escape no matter what. The man with the knife got closer to her, his face was covered in blood and it smelt like he had bathed in it but she didn't dare say anything about it. 
 
 The men started talking about something which made them laugh, she could hear their voices but couldn't understand a single word they were saying. She wanted to run away as fast as possible so that these people wouldn't kill her but there was nowhere for her to go. When she felt the man holding her hair let it go, she took off running into the night with tears in her eyes and praying that someone would rescue her before they caught up to her. 
 
 The man shouted at his friends about how he'd lost his daughter because of some stupid girl who ran away from him. Her mother, sisters and grandparents cried for hours after finding out what happened to their daughter. They knew she was dead but couldn't bring herself to say the word. 
 
 The men came back a month later and said that they'd found her body floating in the sea. After hearing this news, everyone cried all over again because it meant that there were no traces of the girl left. However, the man with the knife came to their house one day and asked for the girl who was hiding from him inside his head. Her sisters recognized his voice and ran out of the room without telling anyone else, they were too afraid to talk about this anymore but their grandparents did anyway. They told everyone in town that a man with a knife had come asking where their daughter was. 
 
 Everyone was scared and terrified but the man came back one day so they decided to move into another house instead of hiding for months on end. He came again, this time he asked about their granddaughter and everyone ran out of the room as soon as they saw his face. When he walked away, the girl's mother tried to stop him but no one listened to her because she was just a crazy person who thought that he could see ghosts. 
 
 He came back for the last time when their granddaughter was five years old and asked for her as well, everyone ran out of the room screaming at the top of their lungs but none of them were fast enough to save themselves because he killed each one of them by slitting open their throats. He didn't care if it was a man or woman or grandpa or grandma, they all went down in minutes without being able to utter a single word. 
 
 The girl was crying when she saw her grandparents being murdered in front of her eyes and started running away from the house but he caught up with her before she got far enough ahead. He grabbed hold of her hair and slit open her throat, making sure that no one would ever be able to save her or tell anyone about what happened to her because she was dead before any of them could even come close to him. 
 
 The girl's father was scared out of his wits when he saw the man killing all of his family members in front of his eyes but ran away as fast as possible without caring if he'd ever see his daughter again. He was found days later by some police officers who said that they would find her but no one knows where she is now or what happened to her because she's just a ghost in everyone's minds, the man with the knife killed them all so fast and without mercy that they had no time to write down any details about their daughter before getting murdered themselves. 
 
 She was never seen again after that but when the police officers came back later on, there were only a few skeletons left in this house because he'd killed everyone who lived here and made sure that no one would ever be able to find out what happened to her. 
 
 The man with the knife died fifteen years ago after getting attacked by a pack of wolves while walking home late at night, they were starved and hadn't eaten in weeks so they didn't mind if he was alive or dead as long as there was meat on his bones. Some people say that when you see him, he's got blood all over himself but it isn't real blood, it's just dirt from where he fell down and got buried by the wolves. 
 
 He's still roaming around in the middle of nowhere because no one can stop him anymore since his daughter died without ever knowing how much her father loved her or why they had been separated for so long before finally finding each other again. 
 
 There are some people who say that the man with the knife is dead and gone but others know better than to believe in things like this because it's just a story created by someone who wanted something else besides their own life or death at that particular moment when they were writing about him instead of being able to enjoy themselves without thinking about what would happen next. 
 
 They say there was another girl after her but she died before anyone could find out anything about how it happened and no one knows where she's buried now either, she might be somewhere in the middle of nowhere with nothing but her own thoughts for company because people like him don't like sharing their memories with others unless they want them to die too.
