I woke up in the middle of the night and turned on the TV because it was too loud. It was a movie starring Harrison Ford, but he wasn't playing Indiana Jones or Han Solo. He was playing himself! There were news reports about a huge asteroid heading for earth, and the government had already told us what to do - evacuate as soon as possible. I saw myself running down my street in nothing more than underwear when a spaceship flew over it and hovered above the house where I live. Harrison Ford came out of the ship and started screaming at me, "Why are you still here? You should have already evacuated!" He then yelled at me to get inside of the UFO because they were leaving immediately. I ran up the stairs to my house but realized that there was no way for Harrison Ford to fit in my front door! He grabbed me by the shoulders and threw me back onto the street as he opened a ramp from his ship. As soon as I hit the ground, I heard a big explosion behind us, which turned out to be my house. My friends came over immediately to help me pick up what was left of my belongings. But there wasn't much; most of them were in pieces after that giant impact!
