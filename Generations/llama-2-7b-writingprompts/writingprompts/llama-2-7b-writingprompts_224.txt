`` No, no of course not-'' 
 
 
 `` Well, well well now… I see. Now you are the one to talk about stereotypes. Look up at me please. You are a man in hell. Hell is n't a place for women. Do you understand?'' 
 
 
 `` I am not going to spend my time here arguing semantics-'' 
 
 
 `` … Oh come on now, how would you like it if we switched places. Now, tell me about that book. Is there anything interesting in it?'' 
 
 
 `` There is a lot of really good stuff in this book...'' 
 
 
 `` Do n't lie to me. You do n't even look like you are interested… Oh yes, I am sure that you do not want to read the book. It does n't seem your taste. What do you like then?'' 
 
 
 `` … It is a book about art.'' 
 
 
 `` Well of course it is. There is nothing in hell for fools and artists are fools… Do n't look at me so innocently, I know what you did! You are an artist but do n't have the courage to admit it. It does not matter though, here we will do with your talent.'' 
 
 
 `` What is wrong with being an artist?'' 
 
 
 `` Everything. Do n't tell me you did n't know what you were doing. I bet you are going to get away with it for a while, but the time will come and then we will have lots of fun… Look at me when I speak to you!'' 
 
 
 `` …'' 
 
 
 `` I said look at me!'' 
 
 
 `` …'' 
 
 
 `` You do n't care about the book, you have never been interested in it… Tell me what is in that head of yours and we will talk again. But first answer my question: What is wrong with being an artist?'' 
 
 
 `` It does not matter to me-'' 
 
 
 `` Do n't tell lies! You are lying to yourself and you know it. Tell me, what do you like about art? Why did you become an artist in the first place?'' 
 
 
 `` … It makes sense of the world.'' 
 
 
 `` Really? Well then I suppose that we will get along just fine… Now tell me this: how does it make sense of the world? How can art give a meaning to life? What do you think that you have learned from the book about art?''

### Response:
`` … Well, I think that art is an expression of emotion.'' 
 
 
 `` An expression of emotion? Is n't this what we are all trying to do? Does it matter if you paint a beautiful picture or write a great poem or sing a wonderful song when no one cares about the message? When everyone is just trying to make some money and get through life without any deeper meaning, does it really matter…'' 
 
 
 `` … No. I guess not. But what I want from art is something more than just emotions. For me art should be an expression of ideas as well...'' 
 
 
 `` Ideas? What sort of ideas do you think that can be expressed through art? Do n't tell me about how love and hate can be shown by painting or writing a poem. We all know this, I just wanted to know what else…'' 
 
 
 `` … I want to understand the world…'' 
 
 
 `` And what does your book tell you? What does it say that I do n't already know?'' 
 
 
 `` It is n't that kind of a book. The book is not about understanding, it is about creativity...'' 
 
 
 `` Oh please. There is no such thing as artistic creativity. Tell me what is in your mind and I will help you express it… Do n't waste my time!''

### Response:
`` … It does not matter to me how anyone else defines art-'' 
 
 
 `` Well, then why are we talking about this? You should know that you do not have the choice. We all must play a role in hell and I am sure that yours will be as a painter… You see I knew that you were an artist already! It is in your eyes. You are always trying to understand what is happening around you, but I guess it does n't work out so well.'' 
 
 
 `` … No…'' 
 
 
 `` What do you want? Do n't say no, you know that you will get nothing from me. You have only yourself to blame. Now tell me what you want!'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` I do not know how anyone can call this work of art… It is not a painting in the traditional sense of the word, it does n't represent something and there are no rules to follow... How could anyone understand or enjoy something so abstract?'' 
 
 
 `` You may think that you know nothing but I do. I know all about your art and your artistic friends. All the artists that you have known in life, I already know them well enough… Now tell me what is in that head of yours or else we will never be done with this conversation...'' 
 
 
 `` … No. There is nothing more to say-'' 
 
 
 `` You think it is so easy to get rid of an artist? We are everywhere and I know just how you feel. It is not only your fault that you are in here, everyone who has ever tried to make something out of life is a victim of hell… But the time will come when we will be done with this conversation. We will talk again about art. You do n't want me to give up?'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` … No, you are wrong... Art does n't need rules and if it is so abstract then maybe that is what makes it art…'' 
 
 
 `` And what do you have left when no one understands your work? Are you trying to tell me that you care more about what people think of your work than you care about the work itself? Is this why you want to be an artist? To please others, to win praises or awards… Tell me if it is really worth all this effort just for a few empty words on someone's lips.'' 
 
 
 `` … I do n't know-'' 
 
 
 `` You are not honest with yourself… If you can tell me the truth, then maybe we will have something to talk about.'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` It is not that simple... Art has become an expression of emotion but also a reflection of life and people's values... Sometimes it is only a symbol for what other people think or feel… It is a communication tool, even if it may be unintentional at times.'' 
 
 
 `` Communication? How can art communicate anything? Is there some kind of message in your work that you are trying to express? Tell me what does this painting say! I want to understand you better…'' 
 
 
 `` … You do n't understand. Art is a way to show how we feel, but also our inner thoughts and beliefs, the things that other people would never know about us… It is a reflection of ourselves...'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` How can you reflect something that no one knows? How can I understand your work if I do not know what it means to you? Is this all just some kind of nonsense, or are you really trying to make sense out of the world…'' 
 
 
 `` It does not matter. Art is about expressing feelings and ideas in a creative way. You can use different techniques but still be an artist if you do it with passion...'' 
 
 
 `` Are you telling me that I am wrong? Do n't tell me that I do n't understand art. If you have something to say, then you should express yourself! There is no one here to tell us what we can and cannot say or how it should be done...'' 
 
 
 `` … No. Of course not-'' 
 
 
 `` Why are you so afraid? Are you scared of the truth that I speak about art? Maybe there is some other reason why you do n't want to tell me what your work means? If this is a misunderstanding then please forgive me and I will leave... Tell me if you are afraid or just ashamed.'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` … No… I am not scared-'' 
 
 
 `` What do you care about? Does it make a difference to anyone whether your paintings represent something that other people would never understand, or are they only symbols for the artist himself? Do
