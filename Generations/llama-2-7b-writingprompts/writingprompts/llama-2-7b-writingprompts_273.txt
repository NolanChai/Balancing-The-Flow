They say that what you think about in your last moment is the most important thing in your life. I hope that ’ s not true because as I lay here dying, my insides intermingled with the machinery that has kept me alive for these past few days, all I can think about was how much I hated this town. My friends who died have told me to go easy on the place but they just don ’ t understand. This town is no good. They say it ’ s got a lot of potential, but what could be done with these people? The cops are as bad as the criminals here and I was never able to get anywhere in life. The only thing that made it worthwhile were my friends but they all died or moved away. Now this is me. Dying, alone, on a hospital bed. And what did I do with my life? Nothing. Well…nothing great anyway. This town has had it ’ s turn and now it ’ s going to die. The whole place will be burned down and then the world will have its next chance to start anew. And if that isn ’ t a happy ending, I don ’ t know what is.
