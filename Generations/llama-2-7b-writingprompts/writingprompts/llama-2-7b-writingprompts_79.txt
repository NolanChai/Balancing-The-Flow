I have been having a similar problem lately, where I am not sure of what to do with myself and keep postponing. It is hard when you do not know which tasks are the important ones or how much time you should spend on them. In this case, it sounds like your procrastination has become an unhealthy coping mechanism for you and it is a good idea that you work on doing something about it. I think that it is a good idea to start by setting clear priorities in your life so that you can keep things organized and manageable. From there, you could set aside some time to write down the tasks or projects that you are currently working on, how much time you think they will take, and what your priority should be for them (i.e., I would like to get this done by Monday). By writing these out in a clear list, it may help to get things moving more quickly because everything is laid out before you. Another thing that can help with procrastination is starting small. Start with the easiest task and do not let yourself be overwhelmed if something else needs to take precedence. It sounds like you have already made a good start by deciding what your priorities are, so I suggest using those as a guide for your next steps!
