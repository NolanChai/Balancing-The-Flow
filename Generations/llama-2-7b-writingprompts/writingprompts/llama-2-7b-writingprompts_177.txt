`Son, you are not getting rid of me that easy!`, I said in a tone of annoyance and continued to smoke. `Mom, get down from there'', my son sighed with a tired voice, folding his arms as he looked up to the roof of the house in which he was raising my grandchildren. Too stoned to listen, I deliberately ignored him. It is hard work being an adult and having children to care for; it just makes me want to smoke more marijuana! He screamed: `Mom! Get down from there!' Well, if you keep screaming like that then I'll jump off the roof', I thought to myself as I continued my enjoyment. Soon after, a loud thump was heard and he burst into the house in tears. After the shock of what had happened sunk in, I panicked and realised that it was not so funny after all. `Mommy? What did you do to yourself?' My son asked as he sat next me on the floor with my granddaughter. He was crying even more now as I tried my best to reassure him by saying: `` Oh don't worry, nothing really happened. It is just a bit of bruising around here and there''....... Too stoned to listen, he continued to look at me with horror in his eyes.
