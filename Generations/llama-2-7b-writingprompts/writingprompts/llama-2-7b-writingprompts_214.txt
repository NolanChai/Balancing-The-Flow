He is not afraid of such things. The others are a danger, but they do not matter now. He feels the presence behind him. It's warmth and bloodlust makes it easy to recognize as another of its kind. He waits for the strike that will come from behind, then grabs his prey by the neck and slams their head against the wall
### Response:
He feels the attack coming and easily turns around to face the other man who is not yet fully in combat stance. The attacker, knowing he has been seen, decides to go for an unarmed strike. He does so with great power and speed but his efforts are in vain as the other grabs his head and slams it against the wall. His brains splatter on the ground.
