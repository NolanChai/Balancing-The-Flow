Ever since that day when I first woke up, a new sense of understanding had come over me.  I felt like I could see into the souls of everyone around me, but at the same time no one was able to see into mine. It all started as some strange dream; or maybe an hallucination brought on by whatever it was that had wiped out the world, and given us this new life. The whole experience felt like a second chance, a do over. And I found myself wondering: If there is such thing as reincarnation in our current reality, will there be another day when all of humanity is destroyed? And if so; are we truly free from the sins and errors of the past lives we have lived?
### Response 2:
I've never felt more alive than I do right now. My senses seem sharper, my mind feels clearer - it's almost like being born for the first time all over again. There is a sense of peace that has come over me, but also an awareness that everything around me can be destroyed at any moment. And yet despite this feeling, I find myself feeling more connected to other people than ever before - even those who are complete strangers to me. Maybe this new life really does give us a chance at redemption?
### Instruction 2:
Everyone was dead, and they felt the most alive they had ever been. A new sense of understanding came over them as if it were an awakening that could only come from death. The experience felt like a do over in life, but with better knowledge than before. It almost made one wonder whether there would be another day when all humanity was destroyed...and whether we'd still have the ability to reincarnate after that happened again? 
 ### Response:
It's so hard to describe the feeling I had when everyone died. I felt like a new person, like something had been released from my chest. There are no words for how peaceful it was and yet there is still this sense of fear; not just because we could all die again at any moment, but also because we're still human beings who will make mistakes that lead to suffering on both an individual level as well as a global one. Maybe this new life really does give us a chance to redeem ourselves? 
### Response:
It's strange how the only time I felt alive was when everyone died, but at the same time there is this sense of peace and understanding that came over me in that moment too. It almost feels like being born again - or maybe even more accurately; reincarnated with all my previous knowledge intact (although some would argue this isn't really possible since we have no memories from our past lives). In any case, I find myself wondering if there is another day when humanity will be destroyed? And will we still be able to reincarnate after that happens again too?
### Response:
I think you can understand why I am feeling so conflicted right now. On one hand, I feel more alive than ever before but at the same time there is this sense of fear and dread - maybe it's because we all know death could strike us down at any moment or maybe it's just that feeling from our past lives returning? Whatever it may be though; it makes me wonder whether or not reincarnation actually exists in this new reality or if we're really only living once.
