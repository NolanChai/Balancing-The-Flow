`` Admiral,'' The secondary helmsman's voice echoed across the bridge. `` Port Authority's welcoming us through the checkpoint. ETA ten minutes to dock.'' 
 
 *Here we go. * 
 
 The mood on the ship had been tense since their departure from Docking Bay 710, when they were forced into action against the Dark Lord's forces. Now that their escape was imminent, many crew members were starting to relax and unwind as they prepared for what would likely be a long journey to their new home system. 
 *So much can happen in just one day.* The ship's captain thought. He knew that he could only do his best with the time he had left; if he couldn't get them out of here, it wouldn't matter how many days or months went by afterward. They would be trapped and defenseless against whatever might come their way in this unfamiliar star system. 
 He sighed heavily as a surge of adrenaline rushed through him once again- the same feeling he had felt every time he entered combat since becoming an XO on the USS Garrison 10 years ago... but something was different about it now; there was no sense of urgency or fear, only anticipation and excitement. The captain was finally going to get his hands dirty again for real this time- no more pretending! His blood pumped harder as he thought back on all those battles that had come before him: Star Wars III Episode 6: A New Hope (2015), Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2014)... *All in good fun*- until now. The captain knew that he would have to prepare himself mentally for what lay ahead if he wanted any chance of making it through alive this time around; but for now, at least there was no rush-- they'd be docking soon enough! 
 He walked over towards one of his bridge officers who had been standing nearby ever since they were forced into action earlier today: `` We're almost home-'' He said with an excited tone in his voice. The officer looked up at him from her station and smiled broadly back: `` I know! It's so exciting!'' 
 The captain laughed lightly before turning around to face away again-- *Now where are those damn landing gear controls when we need 'em most?* He thought to himself as he began fiddling with the ship's controls once more...
