# This is the last time anyone ever sees me.

> I remember that night like it was yesterday. I could hear his screams as he tried to crawl away from her, even with my eyes closed. She had just started to use his blood as an ingredient.
> I wanted nothing more than to help him but the pain in my body was too great and I could barely stand myself. I reached out to grab him by his arm and he immediately stopped moving. He knew what this meant, that he would be with me forever now, unable to do anything for himself but obey her commands.
> She had begun to sing a song as she mixed his blood into the potion, one so dark that it made my stomach churn. When the ingredients were all combined and the cauldron was boiling away on the fire, she turned towards me with an evil smile plastered across her face.
> `` Now we must wait until you've fully recovered before I can start working on your transformation``, she said in a whisper as she slowly approached my body. A tear rolled down my cheek but I couldn't even blink without pain shooting through me. This was just beginning...

# A few months later
> The screaming had started again last night, only it was worse than ever before. I could hear him begging for his life as he fought against her attempts at controlling him completely. She would stop every so often to calm herself down and let out a cackle that echoed throughout the entire building, but then she'd start screaming again as loudly as she could until there was nothing left of him.
> The only way I can describe how it feels is like someone slowly ripping your soul apart with their bare hands while you watch helplessly from behind bars made out of iron and stone - except that this person is also laughing maniacally at what they're doing to you! It was almost enough to drive me mad too but instead I just sat there, day after day, watching my body slowly break down.
---
# Today was the first time in a long while when she didn't scream. I could hear him begging for mercy from behind her back as he fought against his bonds again and again but this time it seemed like something had changed. She wasn't laughing anymore, instead there was an empty look on her face that reminded me of myself before she did anything to change my body forevermore - except now I knew what would happen if I tried running away or attacking someone else like before because every second spent here felt more painful than the last one ever could have been.
---
# As much as I wanted to stop watching this whole thing play out right in front of me, there was something about seeing him struggle so hard against his fate that made me feel better somehow? Maybe it was just knowing how helpless he felt at this moment or maybe because it reminded me too much about my own situation. Either way though, I couldn't take my eyes off of them anymore even though every second here was slowly killing me from the inside out.
---
> A few moments later she turned around to face me once more and when her gaze met mine for just a moment before returning back down again something about what had happened earlier seemed different now - almost like she'd forgotten all about him for some reason or another? Was this part of the plan too? Or was it simply an accident?
> I don't know but either way it felt like things were changing in ways that made me want to cry out loud even though I knew there would be no one around here who could ever help me if I did...
---
# When she finally stopped staring at me with her empty eyes and started walking away from the cauldron once more, my heart sank even lower than before - knowing full well what was coming next. But instead of following after her like usual he simply stayed put where he was until one final scream echoed off into nothingness moments later; his last cry for help falling on deaf ears as she continued walking away towards whatever destiny awaited her just beyond these walls...

# I wish that was the end of this story but unfortunately there's still more to come next time around - so keep your eyes open and stay tuned!
