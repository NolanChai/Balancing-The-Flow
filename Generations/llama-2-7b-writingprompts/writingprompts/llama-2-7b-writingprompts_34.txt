`` It must be hard to live so carelessly.'' You say.
`` Do you really want me to answer that?'' `` No, that was rhetorical... I know why you do it.'' You say with a sad smile. `` What?'' `` Do you remember the last time I saw your face? I watched as they threw you into prison.'' `` Yes, yes, I remember it like it was yesterday.'' `` It's been 14 years since then... And yet you still haven't changed. You are just a man with no purpose in life, doing what he thinks is right.'' `` What do you mean?! My purpose in life is to break the laws, they make us stronger.'' `` No... it makes us weaker. That's why you keep running away from your family and friends. You fear being accepted by them because deep down inside you know that you will be judged if you were to return home.'' `` What?! I refuse to listen to your nonsense!'' `` Then stop running, go back home... face the consequences of your actions and prove to them how strong you've become.''
