 The girlfriend of the late internet activist Aaron Swartz is calling an investigation into his death a "whitewash."

Raunchy photos of 18-year-old Katherine McKinnon are circulating online, despite her insistence that she has never had sex with anyone underage.

Kimberly Brown has also been accused of embezzlement and is awaiting trial in federal court. She has denied all charges.

The investigation into Swartz's suicide is being led by the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office, which has said it will not pursue criminal charges against McKinnon or anyone else in connection with his death.
