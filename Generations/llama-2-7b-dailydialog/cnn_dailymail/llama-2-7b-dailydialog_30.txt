She found it on a patch of grass beside the hutch, which is attached to the family’s kitchen window. She said: “It’s a tiny egg and I think it was made by a chickens but we have never seen one this small before.” Her father Michael, who keeps two white Legbar hens in the garden of his home near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, said he was amazed at how small the egg is. 
He added: “I’ve been keeping the chickens for about three years and they always lay large eggs. I’ve never seen an egg this small.” Michael, a farmer who breeds pigs and cattle, said he hoped Shannon would be able to enter it into the Guinness Book of Records. 
The book contains a variety of records such as the fastest time for running around the world in under eight days and the most number of chicks hatched from an egg by a single hen. The smallest bird egg is about half that size but Shannon’s may not be big enough to qualify for entry. 
Her mother, Diane, said: “We are pretty sure it was made by one of the white Legbar hens in our garden because they have laid some eggs in the past which were smaller than normal.”
