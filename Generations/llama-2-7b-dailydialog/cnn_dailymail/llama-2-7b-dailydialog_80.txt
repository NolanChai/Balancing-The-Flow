A: Well, I'm glad you finally found your stuff. It must have been quite an ordeal to go through all that. But don't worry, this happens a lot in these days of tight security measures and crowded airports.

B: Oh, I can understand what you mean. The luggage handler at the Los Angeles Airport seemed rather nonchalant about losing my luggage. He just handed me the boarding pass for it and told me to have a nice day! It was not a very pleasant experience.

A: So you've lost your things before?

B: Yes, I did once when I came back from China last month. And the airline didn't even compensate me or anything.

A: Well, it's not really their fault because they can't be everywhere at once and cannot guarantee that their luggage handlers will do a good job of handling people's belongings. I hope you won't lose your luggage again in the future.

B: Thank you very much for listening to me, Amy. Now I feel better about it because I know that I can always count on my friends and family for support during these times when I really need help.
