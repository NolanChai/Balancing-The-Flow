Giorgi, ranked No. 145 in the world, showed she wasn't intimidated by playing against Williams, and held serve under pressure to stay with the 36-year-old American through most of the opening set. Williams was forced into deuce seven times, including at 2-all when Giorgi had a chance to serve for the set.
Giorgi saved two break points in that game, then three more chances in the eighth game, before breaking back twice to send it into a tiebreaker and forcing Williams into some uncharacteristic errors with her service volley.
Williams held on from there after rallying from 5-2 down against a feisty Giorgi to take a 1-0 lead in the best-of-five series, which Italy needs to win both singles matches on Sunday to advance to next year's Fed Cup final.
