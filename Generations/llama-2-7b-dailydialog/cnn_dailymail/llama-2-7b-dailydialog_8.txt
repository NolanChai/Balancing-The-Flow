Years ago there was an argument about whether or not St George was actually English. One side said he wasn't because he was from Turkey and the other side said he was because his mother was English. The final decision was that he is English as it was decided by the parliament that if one of your parents are English then you are also considered to be English!

### Question:

Which countries celebrate St George's Day?
