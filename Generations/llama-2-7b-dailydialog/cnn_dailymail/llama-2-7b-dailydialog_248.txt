1. Cave-paintings are among mankind’s most enduring forms of art, and the earliest examples come from France and Spain dating to some 40,000 years ago. The paintings were not simply decorative – they were part of a religious rite. 2. The woman was buried with her arms crossed over her chest, as if in sleep, while red ochre stained her hands and face. She is wearing yellow flowers around her head which may have been used to adorn her hair or possibly worn on her nose, an early sign of body decoration. 3. She was buried with a small animal, probably a fox, and there were also three pig skulls near the grave. The fact that these animals are buried alongside her indicates that she was both hunter and gatherer. 4. Her cave may have been part of a settlement or ritual site. The site had many hearths, and it is possible that people would gather to pray around them. 5. There is evidence in other caves from this time showing that red pigment was used for body decoration, while yellow dyes were used for hair dyeing. These colours are often associated with fertility – the woman’s grave contained the skull of a pregnant mare.
