The captain then regained control and the plane landed safely at Denver International Airport just 32 minutes after takeoff from Salt Lake City, Utah. 

### Result:

There were no injuries on board, but a spokesman for SkyWest Airlines, Chris Deedy said that the captain and his co-pilot were taken to hospital as a precautionary measure, although he would not elaborate why this was the case. 

### Conclusion:

It is believed that the incident happened because of a faulty pressurisation valve which could have led to depressurisation in the cabin - potentially causing passengers' eardrums to burst and leaving them exposed to sudden decompression.
