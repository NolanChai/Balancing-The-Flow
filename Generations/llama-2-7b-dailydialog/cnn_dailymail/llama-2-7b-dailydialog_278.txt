The ball was not my fault. I have played for five years now at Real Madrid and never had a problem with Ronaldo. But what can you do? I try to respect the other players, but sometimes things go wrong. We are in the same team now but there is no reason why we shouldn’t be. We just need to concentrate on our games.
### Response:
It was a stupid comment by Ronaldo and he should have apologized for it right away. He has been criticizing Lionel Messi every time he had the chance but he didn’t show up in front of the camera when I asked him why. I think that’s very strange behavior because Cristiano is always looking for attention but if you don’t give it to them, they tend to get angry and say something stupid like what Ronaldo said about Messi being dirty.
