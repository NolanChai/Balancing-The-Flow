Brown was injured in a tackle by Worcester scrum-half Dewi Lake during Saturday's Premiership encounter and will not feature again until October 15 at the earliest, after receiving the news that he had suffered concussion for the fourth time this season.

O’Shea added: "I think there is a tendency now for players to be going off with concussion more than we have done in the past. I think it's a little bit of that, but also sometimes we are not getting people off quickly enough when they do suffer it.”
