When I first saw this mug shot I was shocked by how beautiful Jarret looks. It's like he got a new face lift or something! The one on the left shows that he is looking right into the camera with his eyes wide open and he looks alert and clean-cut. He has a nice smile on his face. He also looks really fit and well-rested in this photo. I can't believe this was taken after getting busted for drug possession! I would have thought that he had been arrested for being drunk and disorderly or something.
