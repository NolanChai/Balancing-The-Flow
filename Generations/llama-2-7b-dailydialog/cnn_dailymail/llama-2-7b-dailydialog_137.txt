Van Gaal is a specialist at winning things, but he hasn't really delivered anything yet with United. They will be top of the league if they win their remaining games, and that would be another step forward for Van Gaal. He has had more time than previous managers to mould his squad into champions, but I donâ€™t think he can complain about his players if they win it next season.
