Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding is arguably the most famous marital ceremony of the the 21st Century so far. So it is should be of little surprise that their choice of wedding decor has sparked such a huge interest from people all over the world. Their wedding ceremony was held at Westminster Abbey and they had an estimated 300,000 guests in attendance which made it the largest royal wedding ever to occur. The main centerpiece for this event was a floral arrangement that consisted of more than 8,200 flowers, all of which were grown or cultivated in Britain. Aside from their wedding ceremony being the biggest one so far this century, they had the most expensive cake on record to boot.
