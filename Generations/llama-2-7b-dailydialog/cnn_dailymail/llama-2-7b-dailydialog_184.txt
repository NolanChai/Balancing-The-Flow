The rocket was carrying cargo and supplies for the International Space Station when it failed soon after launch on June 24th. NASA has said that it would try to help if requested but that they would not take control of the craft, which is currently out of range.

### Assessment:
Roscosmos reportedly tried several commands to correct the situation but was unable to restore normal function. It appears that Progress M-27M will remain in a safe orbit until it runs out of fuel and burns up in Earth's atmosphere later this year or early next year.
