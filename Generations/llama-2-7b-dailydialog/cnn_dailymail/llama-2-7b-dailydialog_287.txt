Qatar’s Constellation Group has acquired a 50% share in the owning company of three luxury hotels in London, including The Connaught and Claridge's. 

### Explanation:

Constellation is based in Qatar and it bought its stake from the US firm Blackstone Group. The two other properties are The Berkeley hotel on Wilton Place and the Dorchester Collection hotel chain, which includes Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles and New York's Plaza Hotel. 

### Opinion:

The acquisition has raised questions about whether these hotels will be sold off to other international investors. There is also concern that they could become more expensive for the tourists visiting London. However, Constellation said it wanted to keep them as independent hotels. 

### Conclusion:

Qatar's Constellation Group sensationally snapped up a majority stake in the company that owns Claridge’s, The Connaught and the Berkeley Hotel last week. It was just the latest move to put Qatari money into British property, but the eye-catching purchase raised questions about whether these hotels would be sold off to other investors and how they would affect tourists in London.
