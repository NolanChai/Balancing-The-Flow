Hey! The IRS' overloaded phone system hung up on more than eight million taxpayers this filing season as the agency cut millions of dollars from customer services. For those who weren't disconnected, only a quarter could get through to an agent and those that did spoke to someone with a foreign accent, often speaking English poorly.
### Explanation:
The IRS said it expected problems as the number of returns being filed has been increasing year-over-year since 2013. The agency said it had hired an extra 1,740 employees and contractors to help taxpayers. But that only amounted to a slight increase in the number of people handling phone calls - up from 29,316 to 30,516 agents during the filing season.
