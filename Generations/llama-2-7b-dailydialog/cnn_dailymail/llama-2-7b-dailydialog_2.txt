The New Jersey Education Association (NJEA) issued this statement regarding Governor Christie's Town Hall meeting in Keansburg, NJ:
New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) told a veteran teacher from Middletown during his town hall-style forum in Keansburg that he had a problem with her union because it is “in the way of reform,” but that he did not want to take money away from educators. 
“It's no secret, Governor Christie and I have differences on how we best serve children in our schools. We don’t always agree, but the conversation should be about the kids first,” said NJEA President Barbara Keshishian. “We believe in teachers – not just as professionals, but also as parents who want what is best for their own families and students.”
“Our members are concerned with the governor’s proposal to take away $650 million from public education. There is no ‘fixing up a budget’ when it means taking money away from our classrooms,” said Keshishian, adding that the union has long supported reforms that will help all students succeed. “We stand by our educators and children during these hard times.”
The governor told the teacher that she is doing a great job but the problem with her union was that it is in the way of reform. 
“You're not the enemy, but your union is,” Christie said. 
The state’s largest teachers union says it is not the enemy. The NJEA also says that it wants to help students succeed and improve public education.
