"It was good to see him, but he's only been here a couple of days," said Graham Thorpe, who has coached him in the past. "We can't judge him yet because it's too early."

### Context:

Pietersen, the 2010/11 Player of the Year and Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World that season, was left out of England's World Cup squad after falling out with then-coach Peter Moores. After his contract at Nottinghamshire ended he returned to Surrey for rehab as he recovered from a knee operation.

### What they said:

Thorpe on the possibility that Pietersen could return to England colours: "The only thing I've been told is that he hasn't been asked by the selectors yet, so we don't know."

Pietersen on what his coaches can expect from him: "I have a good relationship with everyone here. I am not coming in with any baggage or anything like that because it's been too long since I was last playing for Surrey."
