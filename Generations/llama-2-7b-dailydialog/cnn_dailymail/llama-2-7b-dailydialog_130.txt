It's great news that Australia's World Cup winner Aaron Finch could be on his way back to Leeds before the end of the season.Finch has been struggling with a hamstring problem since Yorkshire's final match against Notts last month and had looked in doubt for this summer but he's now likely to feature when Leeds play Worcestershire at Headingley next weekend.Hopefully Finchy will be fit enough to make the trip down to Taunton as well. I really enjoy watching him bat because he plays the game with so much freedom and you know that he can win a match on his own if needed.

### Explanation:

Finch is currently recovering from a hamstring injury in Australia, after missing the second half of Yorkshire's season. He is hoping to be fit for the final match against Worcestershire next weekend and for the County Championship game at Taunton between the 15th-18th August
