I think I have the right type of Brazilian, that’s for sure! There are a few players who can change the game with the ball but it’s also important to have a striker who knows how to play football. Neymar is the player I am targeting in this transfer window. It may take a while before he becomes an Arsenal player as he’d be one of the most expensive signings we’ve ever made but I believe it will happen eventually if we can win over the heart of his father, who is also his agent.
