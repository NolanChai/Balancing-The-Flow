The twin 18-month-old brothers who died after they fell into a canal near their home in Yuma, Arizona, were identified on Sunday by authorities as Eli and Silas Keslar.

### Explanation:
According to the Associated Press, Eli and Silas Keslar went missing Friday morning while at an outdoor park with their mother and another sibling. The boys' bodies were found in a canal late Saturday night after rescuers combed through a five-mile area around the park for hours. Authorities say they did not know if the boys had been swept away by strong currents, but witnesses said they saw them playing near a drainage ditch before they disappeared under water. 

### Reasoning:
The twins' father, Michael Keslar, told ABC News on Sunday that Eli and Silas were "very energetic, very athletic" kids who loved running around outside. He said the boys had been playing at a park near their home when they went missing.
