I hope that the police will be able to find out what happened and apprehend those responsible for this heinous crime. My deepest condolences go out to Stephanie's family and friends as they deal with the loss of such a special woman who had her whole life in front of her. I wish them all well and hope that those responsible pay dearly for their actions.
