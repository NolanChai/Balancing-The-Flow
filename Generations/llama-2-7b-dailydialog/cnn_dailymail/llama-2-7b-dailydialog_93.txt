Rafael Nadal started the defence of his Monte-Carlo Masters title on Wednesday against unseeded Frenchman Lucas Pouille and it looked like business as usual for the Spaniard, who won 6-2, 6-1 in a first-round match that lasted 93 minutes. The 14th-time champion was rarely troubled by his compatriot and will now face either Marius Copil of Romania or Frenchman Pierre-Hugues Herbert in the second round.
