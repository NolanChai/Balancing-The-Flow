Adi Viveash's Chelsea U19s side stormed into the UEFA Youth League final following a 4-0 mauling of Roma in the semis. After a tense and goalless first-half, midfielder Charlie Colckett's deflected shot gave them a deserved lead after 64 minutes, before second-half goals from Jamal Blackman, Nathan Ake and Gael Kakuta completed their demolition job.
