Obama and McDonough didn't need to hear about Psaki's pregnancy for them to hire her — they just needed to know she could take the job. But it was a pleasant surprise, and one that came after Obama had already accepted Psaki as his new spokesperson on the condition that she'd take maternity leave when she became pregnant again in May 2016.

### Context:

The president is in good company with his hiring of a pregnant woman to serve as communications director, particularly during a time when women are making big strides in the workplace. On Tuesday, Yahoo Inc., one of the world's largest Internet companies, announced that it had named Marissa Mayer as its new CEO, and in doing so, made her the first pregnant woman to hold the post at a Fortune 500 company.

### Assessment:

Jen Psaki is just one of many women working today who have faced the challenge of balancing career aspirations with family obligations and raising children — all while being asked to do more work than they're paid for in a field traditionally dominated by men. In 2011, the number of pregnant women in the United States was at an all-time high, with 34 percent of all women between ages 25 and 39 reporting that they were expecting their first child within four years. The Pregnancy Rate for Women Aged 40–44 (168 per 1,000) is the highest on record.

### Conclusion:

Though it's been more than a decade since women started making major strides in corporate America and breaking down gender barriers at work, there are still some obstacles facing working moms today — particularly those with small children. While the number of pregnant workers has increased over time, employment rates for mothers have remained unchanged for more than 10 years according to a recent study by The Pew Research Center. And while women now make up nearly half (46 percent) of all U.S. employees in large firms, they are still underrepresented at senior levels compared with men — even though the majority of new hires are women in management positions according to a report from McKinsey & Company published in August 2013

### Solution:

While many companies have been slow to change their attitudes about how they recruit and promote women, some businesses are taking steps toward improving the workplace for mothers. Companies such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Yahoo Inc., Marriott International Inc., and Starbucks Corp. offer paid maternity leave in addition to providing support for working parents including on-site child care, flexible schedules, lactation rooms, breast pumps for nursing moms who need them when they return to work after giving birth
