Gun culture is nothing new in America. But these days it’s becoming increasingly dangerous for youngsters to show off their weapons on social media platforms like Twitter.

### Explanation:

The baby-faced boy from Memphis, Tennessee poses with guns, cash and bags of weed on a regular basis. His Instagram account boasts more than 60,000 followers, most of whom are other teenagers. One post has already been flagged by Twitter as breaching their rules against illegal activity. The picture showed the boy posing with three guns and a large bag of marijuana. In a separate photo he poses with one gun and another bulging wallet filled with $100 dollar bills. He is also seen posing beside the latest edition of 50 Cent’s autobiography, The 50th Law – in which the rapper urges his young fans to ‘learn how to make money before you learn how not to lose it.’
