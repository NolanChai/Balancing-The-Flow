Joke: Hayleigh Mcbay, of Elgin in Moray, Scotland, pretended to dump her boyfriendÂ David Clarke . A teenage girl was left red-faced today after an April Fools' Day prank she made on her boyfriend  bac

### Explanation:

There is a mistake at the end of sentence two. It should be 'boyfriend' not 'friend'. This is because the first line ends with 'Her' and the second starts with 'His.' The only word that fits this pattern is boyfriend.

### Hint 1:

The text states "Hayleigh Mcbay, of Elgin in Moray, Scotland." So we know this is a girl. Her name is Hayleigh so we can infer it is probably her first name. This gives us 'girl'. We are also told that the boyfriend's name is David Clarke, but we don't have a last name to go with it. The text does say that his name is 'Clarke', though, and if there were multiple people called David Clarke in the world, this would make things easier for us as well. So now we know her name is Hayleigh Mcbay and his name is David Clarke, and the country they are from is Scotland.

### Hint 2:

We don't have any information about their relationship to give away details of this 'April Fools' Day prank'. This gives us nothing. If we had a name like 'Hayleigh Mcbay', or 'David Clarke' and knew that they lived in Elgin, Moray, Scotland (as opposed to Edinburgh) then we could make some good guesses about the relationship of these two characters.
