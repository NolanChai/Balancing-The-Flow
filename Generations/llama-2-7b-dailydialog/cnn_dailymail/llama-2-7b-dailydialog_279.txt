US regulators are poised to demand conditions for the deal that would force both companies to divest themselves of some assets to ensure they don’t control a large portion of the nation’s broadband marketplace.
The Justice Department is concerned the combined company could hurt competition and raise prices on services like pay-TV, according to reports. Both Comcast and Time Warner Cable have said their merger would be good for consumers, though they haven’t detailed what concessions they are willing to offer in order to win antitrust approval for the deal.
The proposed agreement comes after months of speculation about whether or not the companies will make a formal proposal. The two companies have long been rumored to be in talks over a merger and an announcement could come as soon as this week, according to reports. If it goes through, the combined company would be the largest broadband provider in the country with nearly 40% of the market share, compared to roughly 29% for second-largest Charter Communications. The deal could also potentially lead to cable giant AT&T buying satellite TV operator Dish Network as well.
The news comes amid a wave of merger and acquisition activity in the industry. In recent years, telecommunications companies like Verizon, Comcast and AT&T have been seeking ways to cut costs while increasing profits. With so many deals already being proposed, there is growing concern that consumers could soon see higher prices as a result of these moves.
In addition, regulators are concerned about the potential for increased competition in broadband markets where Comcast and Time Warner Cable don’t currently compete against each other. The two companies have argued that their combined network will be more competitive with Verizon Fios than it was before, which could lead to lower prices for consumers if they win antitrust approval for the deal.
### Question:
What are regulators likely to demand from Comcast and Time Warner Cable as part of their proposed agreement?
### Answer:
Regulators will likely demand that both companies divest themselves of some assets in order to ensure they don’t control a large portion of the nation’s broadband marketplace. The Justice Department is concerned that if Comcast and Time Warner Cable merge, it could hurt competition and raise prices on services like pay-TV.
### Comment:
Comcast and Time Warner Cable have argued that their combined network will be more competitive with Verizon Fios than it was before, which could lead to lower prices for consumers if they win antitrust approval for the deal. However, regulators are concerned about whether or not this argument holds up in court given how much money both companies make from advertising revenue on their networks
### Result:
Comcast and Time Warner Cable are poised to meet with US Department of Justice officials over concerns raised by their $45 billion merger. Regulators will likely demand that both companies divest themselves of some assets in order to ensure they don’t control a large portion of the nation’s broadband marketplace, according to reports.
### Outcome:
If Comcast and Time Warner Cable are unable to win antitrust approval for their deal, they could face legal challenges that would delay or derail the merger altogether. In addition, if regulators demand too many concessions in order for it to go through, it could lead to higher prices for consumers as a result of increased competition among broadband providers.
