Apple is not alone in this regard. All smartphones on the market have some form of battery drain issue. However, Apple's lackluster response to the issue is unacceptable for a company that prides itself on its customer service.

### Explanation:

The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were released in September with great fanfare and plenty of hype about their battery life improvements over previous models. However, customers quickly noticed that these devices still experienced rapid battery drain when they weren't in use or charging overnight (which should be expected). 

### Opinion:

While Apple has been quick to blame third-party app developers for causing the battery problems on its devices, it is clear that there are some serious issues within the company itself. First off, why would they not test these phones before releasing them to the public? Secondly, how can a company with such an impressive track record when it comes to customer service be so slow and unresponsive about fixing problems once they've been reported by customers?

### Conclusion:

Apple needs to take responsibility for its battery life issues on its devices. It should offer free replacements or repairs until these problems are fixed, as well as provide clear instructions on how users can get more out of their batteries.
