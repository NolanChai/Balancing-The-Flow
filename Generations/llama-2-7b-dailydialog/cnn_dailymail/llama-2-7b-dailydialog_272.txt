A second Navy SEAL, Petty Officer 2nd Class Jonah Kahl, has died after an accident during a training exercise Wednesday evening at the Virginia Beach base, the U.S. Naval Special Warfare Command said in a statement Thursday night.

Kahl was pronounced dead Thursday at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital, according to the Navy Times. He had been flown there earlier in the day after he was injured during training and taken off life support shortly before 9:20 p.m. local time.

Lloyd also said that one other SEAL is still hospitalized with serious injuries.

The accident took place at a pool on Naval Special Warfare Development Group, known as Seal Team Six, at Virginia Beach Naval Base in southeastern Virginia. The exact cause of the accident hasn’t been determined yet. A Navy official told CNN it could be a training exercise gone wrong or an injury that happened during a workout before the training began.

SEALs were on the ground doing physical training and water rescue exercises at the pool when Kahl was injured, Lloyd said. He declined to specify what type of training activity he was involved in.
The incident is under investigation by an officer who has been deployed to Afghanistan with the group, according to CNN affiliate WAVY-TV.

SEAL Team Six’s headquarters are located at a large building complex known as Camp Peary at the northeastern edge of Virginia Beach city limits. It houses SEAL Team 6 along with other special operations personnel from all five branches of the military, according to an Army Corps of Engineers document on the facility.
The area is guarded by military police and a 24-hour security force, according to the document. The sprawling base has been used for decades by the Central Intelligence Agency as a top-secret training ground known as The Farm for CIA spies and operatives from other nations who receive specialized skills there.
The Farm is separate from Camp Peary but shares some of its facilities, including a waterfront facility called “the Point” used to train officers in advanced swim and rescue techniques, according to the Army Corps document. The complex also includes a shooting range for sniper training.
