Agger will appeal the ban but he could face an extended suspension. His absence will be a blow to Liverpool's title hopes and his replacement at the back will need to step up if they are to maintain their challenge for the Premier League crown. Agger is in contention to play against Fulham on Monday and that may increase the chances of Fernando Torres making his comeback from injury as well as Steven Gerrard after he missed last weekend's win over Sunderland with a groin problem.
