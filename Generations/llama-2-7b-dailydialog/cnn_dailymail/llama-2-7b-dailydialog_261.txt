Hugo Lloris is the captain of France and the captain of Tottenham Hotspur and I'm very proud to have him in our team.  He is an exceptional goalkeeper and has all the qualities required for that position - he commands his area well, is good with his feet, organises the defence, distributes the ball really well and also has a great shot-stopping ability.
