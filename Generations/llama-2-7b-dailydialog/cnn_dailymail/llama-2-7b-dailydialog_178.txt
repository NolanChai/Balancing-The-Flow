Alexander Krasnov, an activist from the group GayRussia, said the response was unacceptable. "We hope that Apple will sort out this problem as soon as possible." In his post, he wrote: "Apple's Siri service is designed to answer users' questions quickly and accurately... but unfortunately this time it has failed in its task." He added: "Homophobic slurs do not belong in the 21st century".

### Reaction:

Siri's apparent homophobia has sparked a storm of criticism on social media, with users accusing Apple of ignoring complaints. Some suggested that Apple should block its Siri function for Russian users as punishment until the issue is resolved. Alex's video has been viewed more than 50,000 times since it was posted on YouTube last week.
