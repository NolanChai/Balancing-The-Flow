The following are commonly heard in New York City:
"It’s all yours." 
"Get lost!" and "Have a good one."  
"Give it to me." 
"What’s the matter with you?" 
"I can take it from here." 
"Go for it." 
"Fix it yourself. I got other things to do." 
"No way!" 
"Let's go." 
"Are you kidding me?" and "You’ve got to be kidding!"  
"Which one is the boss?" 
"What’s on your mind?" 
"Hurry up already. I don't have all day." 
"Have a good day." 
"Have you checked out yet? We’re closing soon." and "Closing time." 
"That doesn’t sound like me at all!" and "You are not my type."  
"Can I help you?" and "What can I get for you today?" 
"How was your day?" "I need to know what is going on around here. How am I supposed to find out if you keep to yourself all the time? And why don't you look up from your cell phone once in a while?" "Give it here." 
"What did you say?" and "Hold on, just a minute."  
"You’re not invited!" and "I can tell you’d rather be somewhere else."  
"Don't come back. You're fired!" 
"Take your hands off of me." and "Back away from that."  
"Keep out of here, I don’t want to see you again." 
"What the hell are you doing?" 
"Get lost!" 
"You can have it." 
"I know what happened. You’ll never believe me, but I saw him do it myself." 
"Where are my manners? Forgive me for not introducing myself. My name is (Name). It's nice to meet you." and "I don't have your number on speed dial, so if we need to talk again, would you mind giving me a call?" 
"What’s up with that?" 
"You want to make something out of this? I didn’t do anything!" and "Come back when you grow up."  
"I know the drill." 
"Thanks for coming by. Please stop by again soon." 
"Why don't you take a hike?" and "Have a nice day." 
"Don’t take this the wrong way, but I was wondering if you had any plans for tonight." and "I want to thank you for coming over tonight. It means a lot to me that you made time to be with me."  
"Let me know when you get here so I can let you in." 
"What’s up?" and "Come again?" 
"Don’t forget your coat." 
"Take a seat, make yourself comfortable. What do you think about this?" and "I'm trying to give you my opinion, so pay attention for once."  
"Hey there! How are you doing today? It has been too long since we last saw each other." and "You can have the whole day off if that’s what it takes to get rid of you." 
"I got your back." and "Let me know what I can do for you. I'll be happy to help in any way I can."  
"Sorry, but we are closed right now." or "I think I heard something about closing early today. Do you want the manager?" 
"Hold on a second while I check this." and "This is getting ridiculous! I don’t know what to say anymore!"  
"Don't push your luck with me." 
"It takes two to tango." and "You are too busy worrying about yourself to care about anybody else. It really shows that you have no empathy for anyone around here." 
"Let me get this straight..." and "What did I just say?" or "Do I have your attention now? Can you hear what I am saying to you?"  
"How are we doing?" and "You’re so lucky. I wish I could be in the same position as you." 
"Give me a call when it's convenient for you." and "Don’t let my door hit you on your way out!" 
"I know you feel bad, but that doesn’t mean we have to talk about this any more. Let’s drop the subject altogether." and "If you can’t even handle your own responsibilities, how in the world do you expect me to be able to trust you?"  
"Good luck!" 
"Don’t let this get under your skin." or "This is nothing that you should worry about. You are over-thinking it." and "You know I will always be here for you, no matter what." 
"Thanks for coming by today to see me." and "I hope we can do this again soon."  
"Fine, but don’t come crying to me when you run out of money!" 
"You should stop talking like a baby. You are not that cute anymore." and "I'm sure you are wondering how I found out about your little secret." or "It doesn't matter if you think it is none of my business; I still have to know what happened here today."  
"What’s up?" and "You got any plans for tonight? We can go see a movie together." 
"I don't want to talk about this anymore." or "I just don't care. You are wasting my time with all your complaining, so let's drop it, okay?"  
"Do you have the time?" and "Are you busy? Would you mind if I took a rain check until tomorrow?" 
"That’s what happens when you take drugs." or "I don’t care how much you drink. It is never an excuse for your bad behavior." and "You are acting like a baby! You should be ashamed of yourself, but it doesn't surprise me one bit that this happened to you!"  
"Thanks for being here with us." or "Let's all get together soon for dinner again. I had such a good time last time." 
"Have fun and take care." and "I’ll see you later, okay?" 
"Give me a ring sometime when you have nothing else to do!" or "What is the matter with your friends? Don't they know that I am busy at work right now?"  
"Didn't you hear what I just said?" and "Stop being so rude! You are not funny." 
"Do you have any plans for later?" or "Can we do something together sometime soon?" 
"You’re the best!" 
"Don’t call me again, I don't care what it is about. Just stop calling and leave me alone!" and "I really can't stand this anymore! Do you have any idea how hard it was for me to tell you that? I am so sorry if this hurts your feelings."  
"This isn’t a good time, but we can talk later today after work." or "I'm afraid I won't be able to go with you tonight. How about another night?" 
"You are an idiot!" and "Why don't you try using that brain of yours for once? You are making this so much harder than it has to be."  
"This is a little too much information. I think we should stop talking about it now, okay?" or "I can’t believe what you just said! You know I will never do something like that, don't you?" 
"What are you waiting for? Go on, get going!" and "Can someone please tell me why you keep standing there staring at me?"  
"You need to be more considerate of other people’s feelings." or "I am sick and tired of hearing that excuse. You have no respect for anyone else around here, so don't come crying to me when it turns out the hard way!" 
"Don’t talk like that! What kind of person talks to someone that way?" and "I was joking with you; I didn't mean it."  
"I am not looking for anything right now, but thanks for asking. You are very sweet." or "It was really nice meeting you last night, but we had better stop talking like this because your boss will find out what is going on here." 
"You should think about how you treat people before it’s too late to do anything about it!" and "I wish I could help you, but there isn't much that I can do for you. You just need to take responsibility for yourself and get your act together."  
"Get out of my face!" 
"Don’t be so touchy with me. Do you want me to slap some sense into you?" and "I wish you would stop acting like a child all the time! It gets on my nerves." or "You are such an idiot for doing that again! You really need to grow up!"
