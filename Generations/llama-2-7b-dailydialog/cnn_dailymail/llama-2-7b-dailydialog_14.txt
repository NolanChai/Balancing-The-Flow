* It is immoral for David Cameron to suggest that high taxes are immoral, especially when he voted in favour of the increase in VAT last year.
* David Cameron has been promising a tax cut but not one penny will go to those on low and middle income - only to those earning over £150,000 a year. It’s another example of David Cameron saying one thing and doing the other.
* The Tories want to put up VAT in April, freeze tax thresholds until 2016 and remove the 10p tax rate – all of which will hit poor families hardest.
* This tax cut for millionaires is a cynical stunt by David Cameron that has no credibility whatsoever - it’s clear the Tories are only interested in their wealthy donors.
