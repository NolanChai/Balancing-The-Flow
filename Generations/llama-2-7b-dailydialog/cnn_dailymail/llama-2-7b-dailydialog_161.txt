1. born prematurely at 26 weeks in April 2007 to parents who had come to Canada from the U.S., where their son and daughter had been born healthy just months earlier. The girls' father, Hung Nguyen, was diagnosed with end-stage cirrhosis of the liver after a car accident that left him with brain damage 16 years ago.
2. Nguyen asked his doctor about whether he should be considered for transplant but was turned down because of his alcohol abuse. Doctors said they would have to wait until he sobered up before making a decision on whether he'd qualify.
3. While the twins waited in hospital, their mother died suddenly while giving birth to a third child. The father moved back to Vietnam, where his wife's body was taken for burial.
4. With her father gone, Phuoc became Nguyen's favourite daughter. She had undergone surgery twice to have her esophagus connected and had to get daily medication to control diabetes she got from a kidney transplant. 
5. Binh was also in need of special treatment for heart problems, but because Phuoc got the organ first, she'd had to wait months longer for surgery. When Binh finally received her surgery in March and started showing signs that her body wasn't accepting it properly, doctors decided to switch organs between them.
6. Nguyen says he has no regrets about choosing his daughter. "I did what I thought was best for the girls," he said through a translator from Hanoi where he is now living with other Vietnamese immigrants. 
7. "Everything's good and fine between me and my wife, even if she isn't here physically."
8. Binh Wagner had her last chemo treatment on July 10 before getting her new liver. She was doing well in the recovery ward Thursday and expected to leave by the end of next week.
