### Explanation:
Gov. Cuomo's trip was arranged to expand New York trade relations with Cuba and to attract investment to the Empire State as more Cubans are permitted to visit the U.S., particularly those living in Miami.
Cuba's economy has suffered due to a 50-year trade embargo. It is also grappling with falling oil production that is being blamed on the country's declining reserves, and it faces a huge debt burden from foreign investment in its tourism industry.
Cuomo's delegation will meet with Cuban government officials to discuss potential partnerships between New York companies and Cuban state enterprises for co-productions of film, television and theater projects. Cuomo is also exploring a deal with Cuba that would allow the island nation's state-run sugar company, Azcuba, to buy sugar beets from New York farmers at a higher price than it receives now from the Russian government, according to The Associated Press.
Cuomo has called for the end of the trade embargo as he said it is unfair and counterproductive. He also wants an end to restrictions on travel and the sending of remittances by Cubans living in the U.S.
Obama's easing of the long-standing Cuban policy opened Cuba up for business with the United States, including the resumption of direct commercial airline flights and greater banking and telecommunications ties.
New York state is the closest to Havana after Florida, with the New York City borough of Queens home to more than 100,000 Cuban-Americans.
