The 2014 attack was condemned by the Egyptian government, which ordered an investigation into how it was allowed to happen.

### Analysis:

Copts have faced widespread discrimination and violent attacks in Egypt for decades. In 2015, a suicide bombing killed more than two dozen people at another Coptic church in Tanta during Palm Sunday Masses. In November of that year, terrorists attacked a second church near the southern city of Minya with machetes and firearms, killing nearly 30 worshipers.
