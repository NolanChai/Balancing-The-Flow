A: I don't think they should be allowed to do so! That's terrible ! B: But why ? It's their children . Shouldn't they try to save them from the brutal British government ? A : Yeah , but in a way. If you ask me , I think that the British police will find those children and bring them back . The parents may be arrested . This is terrible !
