I love Cassey Ho's response video! It is so powerful in so many ways. The way she handled those nasty comments was wonderful - I would have been devastated if someone said such things about me, but her confidence is inspiring. She also used the comments to show how much support she has from fans - it really does make me wonder why people can be so cruel on social media sites.
