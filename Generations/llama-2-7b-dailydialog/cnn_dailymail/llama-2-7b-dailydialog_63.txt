This is the terrifying moment a woman drives the wrong way down a highway and plows into oncoming traffic in an apparent suicide attempt.  Jack Rivera, a New York truck driver, captured the collision on his phone and posted it to social media, where it's been shared almost two million times.  The crash happened Tuesday morning at Exit 20 of I-86 near Corning, New York.  Rivera said he was coming off the highway when he saw a woman driving in the wrong direction on an exit ramp.  He estimated her speed to be about 50 MPH as she approached traffic going the other way.  The impact between their two vehicles crushed the car's windshield and flipped it onto its roof, Rivera said.  Fortunately, no one was hurt in this crash, but authorities say they are still investigating what happened.  This video is truly scary to watch as you can see that Rivera narrowly avoided a fatal collision.
