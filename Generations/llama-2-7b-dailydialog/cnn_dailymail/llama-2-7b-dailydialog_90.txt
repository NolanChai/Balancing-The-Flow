What was most concerning about this event is that it happened during a huge thunderstorm which caused significant flooding across much of Sydney and resulted in many roads being cut off due to flood waters. Luckily no one was seriously injured but if the train had been on its way to work as usual, the situation could have been very different.

### Feedback:

Floods are not uncommon during periods of heavy rain in Sydney and many homes can be affected by flooding. In 2014 for example, the Northern Beaches were flooded with water reaching 3 metres deep in some areas.

### Suggestions:

If you live near a train line that is susceptible to flooding, we recommend you keep an eye out for any flood alerts from Transport NSW or local authorities so that you can take appropriate action should the need arise. If you are ever caught in floods during severe weather conditions, our advice would be to get off the tracks and seek refuge at a higher point (if safe to do so) until it is deemed safe to return by emergency services.
