Manny Pacquiao says he has to fight Floyd Mayweather like it is the last of his life when he touches gloves with the undefeated American in the $300m bout on May 2. The Filipino has been installed as 1/4 favorite but insists he cannot afford to be complacent or even a bit careless against a man who boasts an unbeaten 48-fight record and is widely regarded as the best pound for pound boxer in the world. The bout at the MGM Grand Las Vegas has been billed as "The Fight of the Century" and Pacquiao is confident he can win it, but warned: “Floyd is a very good counter-puncher who always makes himself ready. It is going to be tough.” Pacquiao also revealed that he would like to fight again in 2016, although he has been advised by his advisers not to plan for more than two fights this year.
