> Lahore, Pakistan (CNN) -- The alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attack which left 166 dead has been released on bail, Pakistani officials revealed. Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was allowed to leave Adiala Prison in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, Sunday after paying a $40,000 bond and posting two sureties of $52,000 each for the court to hold on his release, said Attorney General Irfan Qadir. He also has been given the right to appeal his detention within 30 days in the high court, he added.
> 
> A spokesman for Pakistan's Interior Ministry told CNN that Lakhvi had "fully cooperated" with authorities and was not a flight risk. The decision was made by the Pakistani courts after the government decided to lift Lakhvi's detention on charges of terrorism, a senior official from the Foreign Ministry said.
> 
> Lakhvi is the chief suspect in Mumbai attacks, which saw gunmen attack 10 sites around Indiaâ€™s financial capital and killed nearly 200 people during three days of chaos last year.
> 
> Pakistan has been repeatedly accused of sheltering those involved in terrorist activities outside its borders. Lakhvi's release comes after authorities were forced to free seven alleged militants accused of plotting attacks on the Indian Consulate and Mumbai's financial district.
> 
> "Pakistan is a state of law, and we do not have double standards. Pakistan should be respected for its legal system," Qadir told reporters Sunday in Lahore. "I would appeal to those who are calling the shots for us to have faith that our judiciary will take care of it."
> 
> Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani had said his government has no role in Lakhvi's release and called on India not to exploit the situation. "We are a democracy and we respect the rule of law," he told reporters Sunday, adding that Lakhvi was granted bail by an independent judiciary.
> 
> The Mumbai attacks sparked months of diplomatic tension between Pakistan and India -- which accused their neighbor of sheltering terrorists responsible for the massacre. "India's demand that Lakhvi be extradited or handed over to it is legally untenable and we do not see a prospect of any movement on that front," Qadir told reporters in Islamabad.
> 
> India had already put Pakistan on its watchlist for terrorism, accusing the country's intelligence agency ISI of providing safe haven to terrorists. "We have taken note of the development and it is a matter of concern," External Affairs Minister S M Krishna said Sunday in New Delhi, adding that his government will seek a clarification from Pakistan on the issue.
> 
> The prime minister's office in Islamabad also confirmed Lakhvi's release, saying "it was an independent decision taken by the courts and the executive has nothing to do with it."
> 
> The case against Lakhvi had been pending for more than a year, Qadir said. "This is not a secret, this has come as a surprise even to us," he added. "We were hoping that it would be resolved earlier. We are committed and will do everything we can to make sure that there is no delay in the proceedings."
> 
> But Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik said Sunday that the country cannot legally hand Lakhvi over to India because of a bilateral treaty between the two nations. "We will try to recover him and bring him back to the country," he told CNN in Islamabad. He declined to comment on whether authorities were investigating Lakhvi's whereabouts.
> 
> In November, Pakistan arrested six suspected militants from a group linked to the Mumbai attacks after they allegedly plotted an attack on India's consulate and financial district in Karachi. All of them have been released but are being questioned by authorities about their involvement with Lashkar-e-Taiba -- which Indian officials say was responsible for planning last year's attacks that killed more than 170 people.
> 
> India has not provided any evidence to Pakistan against the six men, Malik said. "We are waiting for them to come up with some evidence." The chief of Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hafiz Mohammed Saeed -- who is widely believed to be involved in planning and financing the Mumbai attacks -- was arrested earlier this year but has since been released on bail.
> 
> India's government said Sunday that it would seek clarification from Pakistan over its decision to release Lakhvi on bail, as well as the cases against six others who were detained in Karachi and later freed for lack of evidence. "The Mumbai attacks were a case of terrorism with cross-border ramifications. The issue is of great concern to us," said Krishna, adding that India will raise its concerns at an upcoming meeting between the two countries on counterterrorism.
> 
> Indian Foreign Minister SM Krishna told CNN on Sunday "the decision taken by Pakistani courts has not gone down well" with authorities in New Delhi, and expressed concern about Pakistan's judicial system. India will raise its concerns at a meeting scheduled between the two countries later this month regarding counterterrorism operations.
