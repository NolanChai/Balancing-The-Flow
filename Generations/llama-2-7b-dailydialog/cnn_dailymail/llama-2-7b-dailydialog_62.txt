Human beings have been on Earth for more than 30 thousand years, but the universe is believed to be around 15 billion years old. We do not know how long our Sun has existed in our solar system. This gives us a clear indication that there could be a lot of sunless planets out there in our galaxy and perhaps even other galaxies as well.

### Key:

Human beings, the universe, Earth, solar system
