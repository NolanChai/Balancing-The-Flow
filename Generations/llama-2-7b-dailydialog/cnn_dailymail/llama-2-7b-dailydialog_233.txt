The caller said a girl was running around outside, alone, in the cold with no shoes or jacket on while another boy had been seen throwing sticks at cars earlier that afternoon. It's not clear if the caller saw the two kids playing outside or got the information from someone else. 

### Explanation:
A few years back, a similar incident sparked outrage over what some parents saw as 'overreaction,' and a new book that challenges traditional parenting styles was born. In the book, author and blogger Lenore Skenazy shares her personal story of when she let her then 9-year-old son take the NY subway alone and what happened next. She is now known as 'The Free Range Mom' and has been a spokesperson for kids playing outside unsupervised ever since. 

### Conclusion:
Now, she says there's no need for parents to panic after hearing about the incident in Maryland because they are making too much out of nothing. "As long as theyâ€™re not doing anything dangerous or illegal and their parents have given them a general sense that this is okay, it's fine," Skenazy told NBC4.
