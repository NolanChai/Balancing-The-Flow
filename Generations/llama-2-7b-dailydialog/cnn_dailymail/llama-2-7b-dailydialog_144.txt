The first thing that came to mind was that people are so stupid for doing such a crazy ritual. Then I got angry and sad at how our ancestors treated their children. If I saw my grandparents burning me with fire, I would have cried out of pain. I hope parents today teach the importance of good health to their kids because I don’t want this culture to continue in India. It is so unnecessary to burn your skin just for a tradition that is already outdated.
