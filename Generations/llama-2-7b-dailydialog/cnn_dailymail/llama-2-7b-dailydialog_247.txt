Paul Gregory is a very fit man , but that's not what's important here. If you are a disabled person and say to the DVLA or anyone else you have trouble walking more than 20 yards (metres) then you can apply for a badge . I don't care if you're in wheelchair bound, deaf , blind or anything else , it doesn't matter. The important thing is that the disability and/or illness prevents you from walking more than 20 yards without great difficulty . The only person who knows your physical capabilities is yourself so you must make a truthful application . I think this man has been fined for being deceitful when applying for his badge , not because he's unfit .

### Reaction:

This isn't fair. Paul Gregory is in his 50s and in good health, so if anything you might expect him to have a blue badge as he could walk further than someone with an actual disability. I hope this doesn't set a precedent for other people who apply for the badges because they are disabled but look healthy .
