(P1) may soon be lost to the ages forever.

(P2) The British government announced Tuesday it is planning to destroy its entire stock of the Bard's first folio, the 400-year-old printing that contains his plays and sonnets as they were written. The library says that although it will preserve 16 original copies, most of which are rare and valuable, the others have been stored in boxes for decades and are in poor condition.

(P3) "The folio is now over 400 years old," said a spokesman from the British Library. "It's in very delicate condition and it does need looking after." 

(P4) The 16 copies kept at the library, which are all of a better quality than those stored in boxes, will remain intact. The rest of the folios will be dismantled and sold off to collectors or publishers who are willing to pay for the chance of owning them. 

(P5) The announcement comes as the British Library prepares to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death with an exhibit displaying first folio copies from around the world. In addition, all the major U.K. libraries will hold a series of events starting in May called "Shakespeare Lives."

(P6) The first folio, printed by publisher Cuthbert Burby in 1623 and containing 36 plays written by Shakespeare himself plus some collaborations, was the only major work by Shakespeare to be published during his lifetime. It has long been considered one of the most important literary works ever produced, as it provided a glimpse into what Shakespeare originally wrote for the stage.

(P7) The library's decision to destroy its stock comes after an independent survey found that 86 percent of them were "at risk of loss." One of those copies had already been damaged by water and others are missing pages. 

(P8) "The decision was made, in the end, because this material is of such great significance to researchers who are interested in Shakespeare's plays," said a spokesman from the British Library. 

(P9) "It's an amazing document. It really does give you a sense that here was a man who had come up with these plays, that he was trying things out and they weren't always successful."

(P10) Shakespeare scholars have expressed regret at the decision but understand why it is being made. 

(P11)"I do find it very sad," said Emma Smith, professor of Shakespeare studies at Oxford University. "On the other hand, I think what's more important about the first folio is its survival and that we have copies in good enough condition to be able to read them." 

(P12) In total there are just 750 known surviving copies of the first folios worldwide. The British Library said it would continue to preserve these books, as well as those held in the National Archives and private collections around England. 

(P13) The British Library's announcement was also welcomed by David Crystal, a professor emeritus of linguistics at the University of Wales, who said he is pleased that the folios will no longer be vulnerable to theft or damage.

(P14) "It makes me feel better," he said, "because I've been worried about this for some time."

(P15) He added: "I'm saddened by the decision but if these things are going to be destroyed, it would have been nice if they had waited a little bit longer until they were in better shape. 

(P16)"The first folio is what Shakespeare wrote -- that's what people want to read," said Crystal. "It's not so much the book itself as what's inside, which is why I think this decision is a little bit sad." 

(P17) The British Library is encouraging private collectors who are interested in buying damaged first folios to make their offerings publicly known by posting them on its website. Those who would like to buy a copy of the folio can do so through an auction, but will have to pay more than $600,000 for it. 

(P18) The library said that although there are hundreds of first folios in existence, many of them are badly damaged or incomplete copies. Some, however, are considered the most important surviving books ever produced and are therefore protected by law.

(P19) One of these is a copy belonging to Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle that was presented to her as an anniversary gift in 2016. Another is the folio kept at Eton College, which also belongs to the Queen. The library said this copy will remain on display there.

(P20) The first folios will be dismantled and sold by auction over the next few weeks.

Suggested response:
Shakespeare remains to this day one of the most popular authors in the English language, with millions of readers worldwide and countless productions being performed every year. While many people may be unaware that he is considered the most famous author on Earth or that his works have been translated into more than 100 different languages, it's hard to deny the influence Shakespeare has had in shaping our culture today.

In "The Bard Is Dead, Long Live His Words," a CNN article published on April 29, 2016, the author argues that the first folios of Shakespeare's plays are being destroyed because they no longer serve their purpose for researchers who study the works in the library. However, this decision is flawed and misguided; rather than disposing of these priceless artifacts, the government should preserve them and make them available to scholars worldwide. 

In "The Bard Is Dead" article, we are told that because Shakespeare's works have been translated into so many different languages they are no longer necessary for researchers who want to study his plays in their original form (1-2). In addition, it states that only 750 copies of these first folios remain worldwide and that some are already damaged or missing pages. The author argues that while it might seem like a shame to destroy these books which contain so much information about Shakespeare's life and times, this decision is necessary because they will soon be in such poor condition that scholars cannot read them (5-6). 

In my opinion, I strongly disagree with the author's claims. The first folios are not simply pieces of paper or old books; rather, they represent our culture and heritage as a nation which was founded upon the works of Shakespeare himself. Moreover, these texts contain invaluable information about his life and work that cannot be found anywhere else except within their pages (1-2). 

In conclusion, I believe we should preserve all copies of "The Bard Is Dead" articles and make them available for scholars to study not only the works themselves but also our culture itself. These books are more than just a collection; they are an integral part of who we are as people today and deserve to be preserved for future generations to enjoy!
