She was the most hated woman in Britain, loathed for her role in the break-up of the Prince and Princess of Wales' marriage and vilified for everything from her dress sense to her looks. But ten years after the so-called "War of Wales" she has been rehabilitated by a new generation. 

### Explanation:
The Duchess is now 59, the Prince of Wales 62 and Diana was 30 when she died in August 1997 following her car crash in Paris with Dodi Al Fayed. Now, more than ten years since her death, the princess has been rehabilitated by a new generation who grew up after her death. 

### Opinion:
Her sons William and Harry have spoken out in favour of their mother's legacy, as have Prince Charles. This new public support for Diana has opened up an honest and frank discussion about the mental health issues she faced. 

### Conclusion:
But while her family are trying to celebrate the princess ten years after her death, this week's anniversary will not be easy for everyone who loved her.
