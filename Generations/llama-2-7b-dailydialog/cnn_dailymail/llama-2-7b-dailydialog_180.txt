The actor took to Instagram to share the footage, which showed him attempting to remove the arachnid from his mouth with a pair of tweezers after it had fallen into his throat. The video was filmed at home and saw the spider fall out of the comedian's mouth before scuttling across his face and down towards his chin, as he attempts to grab it with his fingers.
