Military officials in Kazakhstan have introduced a Miss Army competition in the hope of encouraging more recruits. The Kazakhstani Ministry of Defence has chosen 123 of its prettiest female soldiers and ordered them to parade in their underwear on national TV, all in an effort to promote the army among young women. The event was held in Astana, where 60 contestants walked a runway while wearing skimpy uniforms designed by Kazakh fashion designer Kanat Tokashev.
