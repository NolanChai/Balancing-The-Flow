We don't know why this happened to you. We don't understand what God is doing here. But we do know that you are loved deeply by so many people. You will be in our prayers every day of the rest of your life. Your fiancee loves you and he wants to marry you as much today as he did yesterday, as much tomorrow as he does today, and forever more. We love you and we're gonna take care of you. 

### Analysis:

This is one of the most famous speeches given in a hospital ward and for good reason: it was delivered with great emotion from a man who was not prepared to speak at all that day. This is one example where we can see how our emotions sometimes can get the best of us, but when we let them out it can do so much more. 

### Conclusion:

Let yourself feel what you are feeling and express those feelings. It will help others in your life know that you are OK. If you don't feel like talking right now then you shouldn't have to. Take the time you need, but when you do decide to speak again know that it will be easier after a day or so of letting go.
