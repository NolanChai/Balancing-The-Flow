Mr Scott also has two children from a previous relationship and is understood to have been estranged from his wife for several years. Police arrested Mr Stanford at the scene and he was charged with murdering Ms Scott on Tuesday afternoon after being refused bail in Leeton Local Court. The pair were last seen together outside the home of Mr Stanford's parents on Monday night when they left the property in a silver Holden Commodore. They are believed to have stopped at a service station where Mr Stanford is alleged to have told Ms Scott he wanted to break up and that she was 'too much to handle'. The pair then visited a local pub, before arriving back at Mr Stanford's home shortly after 11pm. After an argument outside the property, they are believed to have entered through the front door, with Mr Stanford allegedly grabbing Ms Scott by her throat and forcing her to sit on a lounge chair. He then allegedly hit her in the head with a baseball bat before repeatedly stabbing her in the chest area while she screamed for him to stop. Ms Scott's body was found in the backyard of her boyfriend's family home just before 7am on Tuesday morning.
