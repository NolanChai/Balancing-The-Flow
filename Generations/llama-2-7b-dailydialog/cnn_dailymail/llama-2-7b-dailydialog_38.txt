The Tories are already planning an attack on the Scottish Nationalists, suggesting they will be willing to hand over more power if they do form government with Labour.

### Reaction:
I suspect that's exactly what Mr Miliband is trying to prevent at all costs and I can't understand why he's coming here. He doesn't want the Scottish Parliament to have any more powers, he thinks that it's got enough already. That's why he's coming here.
