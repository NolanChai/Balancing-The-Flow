The best teams always win the biggest games and that has been Aston Villa's problem this year. They have had great wins against Everton, Manchester City, Chelsea but they haven't been able to pull off the big result in an away game. It is a tough tie against Liverpool because you know how well their front players are going to perform and it is always hard to stop Steven Gerrard. But I am looking for Aston Villa to come out with a point on Sunday, they have to get something from this game.

### Explanation:

We can all learn from this story if we look at the two key words - "sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp looks ahead to his former club Liverpool's clash against Aston Villa in their FA Cup semi-final on Sunday" and "look forward to a season of big games". We know that these two teams will have a chance to play together soon. It is important for us to look ahead of time, instead of being caught by surprise at the end.
