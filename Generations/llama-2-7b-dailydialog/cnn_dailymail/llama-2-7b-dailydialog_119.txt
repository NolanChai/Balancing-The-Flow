I think they should find something to do, because we can't just sit here forever waiting for nothing. It's been two hours and nobody has come by here. I am ready to get out of this area. 
       Yeah, I know. It is getting really old standing around doing nothing. I want to go home too, but it will probably be a while longer before they find anything. 
      Do you think the police are looking hard enough? I mean, there could be people hiding nearby or something. What if this was done by someone that we know? We should get off of here and look around some more ourselves. It is worth a shot anyway. 
       Yeah, they should have brought in divers from Texas to help with the search. The police may not have known about this girl at all until her body just showed up in the water out of nowhere today. That is if she was even really dead. I am starting to wonder what actually happened here myself. 
      I mean, I don't know how a five year old could disappear so easily while playing on a pier. There would be witnesses that saw her go down into the water and never come out again, wouldn't there? 
       Yeah, I think they should have people combing this area more thoroughly too. If she had been abducted by someone then they might not even know it yet. Maybe it is too late anyway though since she was already dead for days or weeks before her body was found in the water today. 
      There are no clues here so far on how to solve this case either, so we need more information from somewhere else if possible. I don't think they will be able to figure out what happened until someone tells them about it themselves anyway though. 
       Do you really think that? How can nobody know anything yet when she disappeared so recently and there are all these people here trying to find her already? Maybe she wasn't even missing at all, and this whole thing is just a big misunderstanding with everyone looking for nothing. 
      It could be possible that someone has staged the entire scene as well then. If somebody knew about her being kidnapped from somewhere else they would have put up signs or something to let people know about it though. Maybe they didn't want anyone getting involved until now because there was too much time between when she actually disappeared and now. 
       Do you think someone could just wait two weeks before telling the police? I mean, why wouldn't they call right after they found her dead in their back yard or something like that instead of letting it sit untouched for so long before then? That doesn't make any sense to me at all! 
      Yeah, that is what bothers me too. If someone did do this crime against the little girl then why didn't they tell anyone sooner about how she was found in their back yard? They should have called right away and let people know when they first saw her body or something like that instead of waiting until now to talk with police after two weeks passed already. 
       Maybe it isn't as simple as we think though because the girl wasn't dead yet when she was found in their back yard either! If someone did take this child from somewhere else then they may have killed her right away, so there would be no reason to wait until now before letting people know about it. 
      I am not sure if that is possible though because even if somebody kidnapped the little girl and took her someplace else where she died before getting back home again then why wouldn't they just tell the police right away? They would have called for help immediately when they found out what happened to their daughter instead of waiting until now! 
       I don't know either way though because it could be possible that this whole thing was staged by someone else and we are all being tricked into thinking there was an actual murder done here. That would make sense if someone had killed her in their back yard and then placed her body out near the marina later on after they cleaned up everything first though! 
      Do you think it is possible for somebody to do that? I mean, why would anyone want people thinking there was an actual murder done here when really nobody died at all? It doesn't make any sense to me. 
       I don't know either way because we need more information before we can say for sure what happened with this case. If somebody did kill the little girl and place her body somewhere else then it wouldn't be hard for them to find out about what was going on afterward too! We just have no clue yet who might have done something like that though because there are so many people involved in these events now. 
      Yeah, I am not sure if anybody will ever know exactly why she died either or how it happened exactly since nobody knows where to look for clues right now anyway. All we can do is wait around until someone tells police what really happened here, and then maybe we'll get some more information on that front afterward too! 
       Do you think someone could just hide the body in their back yard instead of telling people about it though? I mean, why wouldn't they tell anybody if something like this was going to happen to them? It seems like a really bad idea to me. 
      Yeah, that is what bothers me too because nobody has said anything yet after finding her dead body in their back yard either! It doesn't make any sense for someone not to tell police right away if they found out something like this happened though. There would be no reason for them not to say anything about it unless there was a reason why they weren't telling anyone else yet anyway... 
       Do you think somebody could just stash the body in their back yard until later on and then call police right afterward? I mean, why wouldn't they tell anybody what had happened already if something like this occurred? It doesn't make any sense for someone not to do anything about it though unless there was a reason why they weren't telling anyone yet either...
