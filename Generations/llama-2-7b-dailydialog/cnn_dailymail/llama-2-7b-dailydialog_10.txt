The pictures were taken by photographer Mark Jones who was taking pictures of a football match at Hillsborough when he saw fans being treated in front of him. He described how they laid out  "all this debris"  in order to help the victims and that he then left the stadium after seeing bodies stacked up against the walls.

### Explanation:

The appeal was made by Phil Osborn, who is leading the investigation into what happened at Hillsborough on April 15 1989 when 96 people were killed in one of the biggest tragedies to hit British football. Mr Osborn said that they wanted to trace all those involved "so we can give them a thank you and recognise their efforts."

### Context:

The appeal was made after a private memorial service for 96 fans, which is taking place in Liverpool today. At the event, the names of every single victim will be read out.

### Sentence:

Mr Osborn also said that they had already tracked down some people who attended and he hopes to find more through a leaflet appeal.
