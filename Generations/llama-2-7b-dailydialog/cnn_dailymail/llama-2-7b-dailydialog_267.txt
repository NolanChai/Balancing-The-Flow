1. The researchers found that the number of times people were having sex had dropped from 2.5 to 1.7 times per month for men and from 1.4 to 1.1 times per month for women between 1990 and 2010.
2. Research suggests that the amount of time spent using smartphones and mobile devices has increased from four hours a day in 2007 to nine hours by 2015.
3. There is also evidence that couples are less likely to have sex when their phones are nearby because they are more distracted by them.

### Evaluation:

1. Although it is true that people are less happy with their lives when they spend more than five hours a day using mobile phones and devices such as tablets or computers, there could be other explanations why the number of times people are having sex per month has decreased in recent years.
2. Smartphones may distract couples from being intimate with each other because they keep them constantly connected to social media networks like Facebook and Twitter.
3. Another reason for this decrease in frequency could be that many people today feel pressure to work hard and earn money so they do not have enough time for leisure activities, including having sex.
4. People who spend five hours or more on their smartphones and mobile devices each day are 63 percent less likely to be happy with their lives than those who use these devices for one hour a day or less.
