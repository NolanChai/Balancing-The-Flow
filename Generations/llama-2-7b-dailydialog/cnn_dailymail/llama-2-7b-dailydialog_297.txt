This is not the first time that a social media post by a criminal has led to their conviction. In October 2013, Mark Kavanagh and Kevin Mason posted videos of themselves smashing up cars and looting them. They were later jailed after they were identified in the videos.

### Context:

Social media is frequently used by criminals to identify and target victims as well as brag about their exploits and criminal activities. The FBI has a “Cyber's Most Wanted” page on its website where they highlight fugitives who are using social media networks to further their criminal enterprise.

### Implications:

There have been several instances in recent years of criminals bragging about crimes and their exploits on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and other social media sites only to get caught by police after a member of the public posts it. This was an issue which concerned police forces even before such platforms became so popular. It is now also becoming apparent that there are many criminals using social media to further their criminal enterprise.

### Conclusions:

Social media is providing more and more opportunities for criminals to target potential victims, brag about crimes and identify themselves with their illegal activities. Criminals who use these sites should be aware of the fact that they are not safe from prosecution just because they are posting their message anonymously online.
