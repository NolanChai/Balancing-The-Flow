A 10-year-old boy who beat a younger child to death in Canada went to his friends claiming that he had witnessed a 'big guy' strike the victim with a rock. Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma inflicted by several young boys on the afternoon of November 13 last year at a school playground in St. Albert, Alberta. Bonneauâ€™s killer was arrested after he bragged about his part in beating up Lee Allan to other students.

### Reason:

In a statement released Wednesday afternoon, police said the boy confessed to his friends that he had struck Lee Allan with a rock, although no witnesses could confirm this story. Police also noted that Bonneau suffered a head wound consistent with blunt force trauma and that fractures in both of his arms were likely caused by being pinned down by several people.

### Conclusion:

The killer has not been identified. He is currently charged with second degree murder, and could face 14 years in prison if convicted. In addition to the charges filed against him, police have arrested two other boys on suspicion of beating Lee Allan to death, but no charges were filed at this time as investigations continue.
