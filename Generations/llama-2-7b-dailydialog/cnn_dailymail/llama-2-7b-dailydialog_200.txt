The Maldives have long been one of my bucket list destinations and when we got engaged I knew exactly where we would honeymoon.
We planned our trip months in advance, booked the flights, made reservations for resorts, set up activities…then I realized that we were leaving in two weeks! It was then that it really hit me how excited I was to finally get to go and spend some time together on our honeymoon.
My husband and I are both fairly adventurous people who love outdoor activities and the Maldives has a ton of options for us as we’re sure you’ve heard! We were so lucky that it was the best weather possible when we got there, almost unseasonably warm in fact. It is monsoon season during this time but we had no rain at all on our trip.
On the first day of our honeymoon I wanted to relax and get over our jet lag. So we spent most of that day lounging around on the beach and going for swims in the crystal clear water. Then I got the itch to go exploring, and my husband wasn’t far behind!
The Maldives is an island nation so there are many resorts scattered all over the place. Our first stop was a deserted little island off of our hotel that you could only get to by boat. We had a few hours to explore it before we were picked up again and taken back home to our hotel for dinner at the main restaurant there.
We spent most of our time on the beach but once we went exploring I realized how beautiful the nature was in this part of the world! We saw tons of birds, fish, and even some sting rays during our snorkeling trip that day. It was amazing seeing such different kinds of animals right off the coast, nothing like anything else I’ve seen before!
We got back to the hotel around sunset which meant it was time for dinner again (this happens a lot). We had one last swim in the pool afterward before heading upstairs where they had set up an entire dessert table just for us. It felt like heaven with all those sweets waiting there for our arrival! After dinner, we went back outside so I could take pictures of my husband by this gorgeous waterfall that was right next to our hotel.
That night, we had a candlelit dinner in the restaurant. We were seated at an outdoor table which felt romantic as hell and provided us with some breathtaking views of the stars above. The food was amazing, too! I don’t think either one of us has ever eaten such good food anywhere before this trip. It really was a nice change from all my usual foods at home (I know…so boring!)
The next morning we had an early breakfast and went back out on the water in our boat for more snorkeling adventures! We saw so many things again today, it’s hard to even count how many. Some fish were brilliantly colored while others seemed like they came from another planet entirely! It was fascinating seeing them all up close like that and just taking pictures of their beautiful shapes and patterns made me want to go out every day after this trip ends too bad there isn’t time for everything though…
We got back to the hotel around lunchtime which meant it was time for another nap! This place really knows how to do naps right. When we woke up later that afternoon, I had an appointment set up with my husband’s favorite spa service provider and she treated me like royalty during our visit (and then some). I don’t normally like massages but after getting one here in the Maldives, I might just have to change my mind about them. It was such a relaxing experience that made me feel better than ever before!
We ended up spending all evening out on the beach and then going back inside for dinner again at our hotel restaurant. The food was amazing once more today but we couldn’t stay much longer afterward because there were some special events planned for us tonight with our wedding planner who had organized everything throughout this entire trip! She even brought us two bottles of champagne when she delivered them to our table so it really felt like a special occasion. After dinner, we headed upstairs once again where they had set up another dessert table for us which was just as delicious as the last one!
After dinner, there were still things planned but I was feeling pretty tired from all that food and drink earlier in the day so my husband and I decided to go back down to our room early. It really is such a beautiful place when you take time away from everything else going on around you so we got ourselves some wine glasses filled with champagne before turning in for the night!
The next morning was our last day here, but it wasn’t without one more special treat from them which were two fresh strawberries delivered right to our door at 6 AM! They made sure everything went smoothly during our stay and always had us covered whenever they could. It really felt like home away from home when we were there!
We got up early again today but not before having one more swim in the pool first thing after waking up because it was just too beautiful to miss out on seeing yet another sunrise over these crystal clear waters that I now know will forever be etched into my mind as some of my favorite memories ever!
We had breakfast with them again before checking out at noon when they dropped us off back at the airport where we said goodbye to our wonderful hosts for one last time before getting on our flight home. It was such a surreal experience leaving there knowing that I might never see this place again (but hoping I do someday!)
I have so many amazing memories from my honeymoon in the Maldives and it was honestly better than what anyone could have expected or dreamed up for themselves. They made us feel like royalty while we were there which is why it’s hard not to fall in love with this beautiful country!
