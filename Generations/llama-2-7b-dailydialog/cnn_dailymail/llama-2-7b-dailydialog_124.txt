This is a heart-warming story and the parents should be commended for making their son's final hours happy ones. However it's not so much that they married at his bedside as in front of him - which would have been kinder to his mother, but I doubt he had the mental capacity to take everything in.
It must also be said that Corey did have the opportunity to marry both of his parents on two separate occasions but chose to refuse it each time. It's a story that shows how cruel fate can be and has left many people with an aching feeling in their hearts, especially for Corey's mother who is clearly devastated by her son's death.
I feel that this is very much a story of the heart rather than one to be taken too seriously or one that should have been reported on as news because it happened at such short notice.
