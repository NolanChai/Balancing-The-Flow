(Jane)I'd still rather stay home in New York and have a good job with a future than try some other place on the other side of the world.  
  
(CNN)But there are jobs here, you know! The unemployment rate is high and many people can't find work. It seems to me that most people want a change, but they don't know how to make it happen.  
  
(Jane)True enough. But I think the key is not just getting up and going somewhere else, but doing something with yourself once you get there. Too many people go on holiday and come back home. They have no plan for their new place. If they had a plan when they left home, they'd have a better chance of finding success in their new life abroad.  
  
(CNN)That makes sense. What should someone do if she is thinking about leaving her hometown to travel and find work somewhere else?  
  
(Jane)First she has to think hard about what she wants out of the move. The best way to approach this decision is with a plan, and then once you have that plan in place, you'll be more likely to achieve your goals than without it. I've traveled all over Europe for work and on vacation. Most people don't realize how different European countries are from one another until they actually go there. The climate is different, the culture is different and the language is often completely unrecognizable to outsiders. So if you can take the time to plan your trip in advance, you'll be better prepared for a new life abroad.  
  
(CNN)How does someone plan for something like this? What kind of things should she do first?  
  
(Jane)First and most importantly, get your documents together: visa, passport, identification card, work permit...all of that stuff is a nightmare to deal with once you're already abroad. So I recommend doing it at home. You can apply for the papers in person if you prefer or do so through an online service. If you choose the latter, just make sure everything you submit is accurate and complete. Don't let something like a missing signature ruin your chances of traveling to another country!  
  
(CNN)What next?  
  
(Jane)You have to look at all aspects of life in a new place: transportation, housing, healthcare and employment opportunities. I'd recommend starting with the work situation first because it will help you determine where else you should focus your attention once you get there. And when planning for a job abroad, remember that some countries require foreigners to register with a local employer before they can legally find and keep a position.  
  
(CNN)So how do we decide which country is best suited for us?  
  
(Jane)Do your research! You'd be surprised at the different types of jobs that exist in Europe alone, let alone other places around the world. Some people look to their families and friends for advice on where they should go to work, but I recommend finding out as much about a new place as possible before you leave. And don't just research the obvious things like climate or employment rates...take into account everything from food prices to public safety statistics when planning your trip abroad!  
  
(CNN)What do you think will happen next? Do you think we are all going to end up working in another country somewhere down the road?  
  
(Jane)I certainly hope so. With the right plan, the world is yours for the taking.
