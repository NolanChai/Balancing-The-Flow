A section of Arsenal and Liverpool fans left their seats empty at the Emirates Stadium for the first 10 minutes of their lunchtime Barclays Premier League clash in a protest against ticket prices. Supporters have been critical of the cost of attending games in recent seasons and in response to their disquiet, the clubs announced a joint initiative earlier this month to increase accessibility by reducing the price of entry for all fixtures next season to Â£20 for adults. However, supporters believe that more needs to be done to reduce ticket prices across the board.

### Explanation:
Today we were joined by a couple of our Liverpool fans who chose not to support the club by coming in the ground today and taking part in the protest against rising ticket costs.
