Dear Mrs Moser, we are so sorry for your loss and wish to express our condolences for what you have been through. We had a discussion with the neurosurgeon before your wife was admitted to hospital. He assured us that her condition wasnâ€™t serious. But it is easy to misjudge these things when someone is in an induced coma, which is used as a last resort for seriously ill patients. The comatose patient is completely unresponsive and there are no indications of any brain activity whatsoever. We are so sorry we were unable to save your daughter.
