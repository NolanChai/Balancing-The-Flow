The Daily Mail is having a laugh here surely? She thinks that she can have an extravagant wedding paid for by the taxpayer because it's "her basic human right". I am no expert on Human Rights law but if you need to pay thousands of pounds for a white dress, caterers and entertainment then it isn't a 'basic human right'. It is a privilege. If Anna Broom really thinks that the taxpayer should fund her extravagant wedding ceremony she needs to spend some time in Eastern Europe - where this sort of thing happens all the time - and have an abortion (or a 'termination' as you call it).

### Response:

What does happen is that a lot of people get married in a church. They don't all wear white, and they don't all spend thousands of pounds on entertainment and decorations and other frivolous things. It doesn't really matter if the taxpayer foots the bill or not - this woman will still be married at the end of it all.
