Scientists from University of Southern California have discovered that if you want to get rid of fake tan, all you need to do is simply take a shower for 30 minutes.

### Reasoning:

They also say this is much more effective than conventional methods such as scrubbing with soap or using specialized body scrubs to remove the tan. They found that the solution works on any type of tan, including spray-ons, creams, lotions and airbrush tans.

### Conclusion:

Researchers also said this is not just a temporary fix but will last for at least 30 days. And this could save women a fortune in expensive tanning products as well as time spent on salon visits to get the job done properly.
