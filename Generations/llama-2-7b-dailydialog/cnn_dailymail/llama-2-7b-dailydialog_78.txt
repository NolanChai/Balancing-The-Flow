It is matches like this that makes one wonder just how good Gael Monfils could have been; and perhaps how good he still can be. The Frenchman is sometimes fantastic, often frustrating and always flare-prone but against an opponent with a similar mentality – the man from Kazakhstan was unstintingly aggressive in the manner that befits someone of his stature – it’s all there for the taking.
Monfils is clearly on some kind of form right now, having lost just three games across his previous four matches, and has found a level of consistency to go with his natural flair. It also helps when the man in front of you plays as well as he does. That’s not to say that Monfils was playing perfect tennis by any stretch; he had his struggles especially on serve but, for the most part, he kept it all together to make it into the semi-finals – a position where he will face an old friend in Florian Mayer who also qualified with ease.
