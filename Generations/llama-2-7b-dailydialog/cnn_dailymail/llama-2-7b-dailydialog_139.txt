"No, no way," the photographer said to the woman, who was charged with having sex with a dog in 2016. "This isn’t funny." Driscoll then hit him over the head with a beverage bottle and yelled "F--- off." He called for help and police arrived quickly and arrested her. She was charged with assault, disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration. Police said she will be arraigned on Monday. The Daily News reported that Driscoll went to court Saturday afternoon in handcuffs wearing a white tank top and leggings. A judge granted her bail after the hearing. Her attorney, Gerald Secorsky, told the New York Post that he would challenge the charges. "I’m going to contest this," he said. "It is ridiculous."
