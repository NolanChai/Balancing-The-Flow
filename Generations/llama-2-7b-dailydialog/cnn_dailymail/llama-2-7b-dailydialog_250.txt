"It will be an electric motorcycle with 1 MW power," says Dr. Roberts Bukans, co-founder of Drive eO and an entrepreneur who has spent years working on the project. "We are now developing the first version of it."
The new vehicle is a response to Tesla's 'insane mode,' which offers its highest power and speed levels when drivers need extra power for racing or fast acceleration.

### Action:

Tesla's car is not only faster than other vehicles on the road, but also offers a range of 310 miles per charge and has an electric range of up to 250 miles. It can go from zero-to-60 mph in less than four seconds, which puts it on par with many sports cars.
The Tesla Model S P85D's 'insane mode' may be fast, but a new electric car by Drive eO is set to be even faster. The Latvian firm is currently developing a one megawatt electric race car to compete in Formula E and it will have a range of 310 miles per charge.
"The motorcycle's battery capacity will not only make the car more powerful, but also safer," says Dr Roberts Bukans, co-founder of Drive eO and an entrepreneur who has spent years working on the project. "It will be an electric motorcycle with 1 MW power."
