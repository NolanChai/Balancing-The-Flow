The Conservatives have called for an election, but the Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn has said that it’s too soon after the Brexit vote and his party is against it. He has also said that he thinks that the government is panicking over the general election. 

### Reaction:
Jeremy Corbyn has received a lot of negative criticism over this, including from his own party members who don’t think he should be so sure and that the Labour Party shouldn’t be against it just yet.
