The only thing Alex cares about is money. If he thinks he can make more by selling recreational marijuana than medicinal he will do it and he doesn't give a rat's ass whether his customers are sick or not. He has no conscience whatsoever.

Alex Impey is breaking the law selling his customers marijuana, but as long as he keeps hearing stories that the drug is helping them cope with pain, he couldn't care less. And business for medicinal is booming. But now the DEA has set their sites on him and he could lose everything if they catch up to him.
