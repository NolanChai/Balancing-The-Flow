The first Nike team training session took place at Carrington on Tuesday afternoon where the players were seen wearing black shorts and blue Nike vests, which features their new logo. But the full kit is yet to be unveiled and the club will not make a public appearance in it until August 16 when United take on Barcelona at FedExField in Maryland.

### Question:

United's deal with Nike - thought to be worth £750 million over 10 years, from 2015-2024 – is the most lucrative sports sponsorship agreement ever signed by a football club and was only announced in April. But it means the Red Devils will have to play at least some of their pre-season games wearing kit made by Nike’s arch rivals, adidas.

### Question:

But why would that be?
