Man City should wait until he becomes a free agent before making an offer. That way, they can save a little money and the player will be able to consider other options if City's approach is unsuccesful.
### My response:
City are very keen on Sterling as Liverpool want Â£50 million for him, and it is unlikely they would let him go for that price during the transfer window. However, it looks like an attractive option because of how much money City have at their disposal.
