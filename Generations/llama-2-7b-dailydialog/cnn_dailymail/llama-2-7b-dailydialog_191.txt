The mounds of rubbish were discovered on Monday afternoon when a member of the public contacted police to report them. When officers arrived they found a huge amount of household rubbish and even a trolley. They had no idea how long it had been there, but they suspect that someone may have been dumping there for weeks or even months without realising that what they were doing was illegal.
