(Forbes)There’s no question that the closure of Corinthian Colleges, as well as some other recent news items regarding for-profits, have put a spotlight on this issue and there seems to be more awareness now about the problems that exist in the sector. However, these closures are not necessarily going to result in more job placements or better student outcomes. They will likely just result in more debt and fewer opportunities for students looking for a good education.

### Response:
(New York Times)The Corinthian Colleges collapse should serve as an alarm bell, signaling that the federal government’s lax oversight of these institutions is causing too much harm to students and taxpayers alike. The Education Department, which is responsible for enforcing existing regulations, must step up its efforts to ensure that for-profit colleges are doing right by their students. 

### Response:
(The Hill)It is unfortunate when a student has an experience like the one described here and we applaud Ms. McDonald for sharing her story with us, but it is not accurate to say that Corinthian Colleges’ failure is the reason she didn’t get a job at the end of her program. It is clear from the Department of Education’s own data that students at all types of higher education institutions — including public and private nonprofit schools — are having difficulty finding work after graduation.
