We have to say that the Indonesian government have behaved as we anticipated, by continuing with their cruel punishment of two young men who committed crimes nearly twenty years ago in a foreign country which at the time was not a member state of the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) treaty. This is yet another example of where the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of men, and it goes to show that the death penalty for drug crimes should be abolished across the world. There can be no doubt in our mind that Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran would not be on death row if this were a democratic country with a fair legal system. It is a disgrace that their lives are being wasted like this, as they will now die without seeing any of the improvements they have helped to bring about for the inmates at Kerobokan prison where they both spent years behind bars.
