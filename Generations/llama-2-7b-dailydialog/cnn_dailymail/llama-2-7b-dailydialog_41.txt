The robbers staged two raids on the vaults, stealing more than £5 million of jewels and cash in what was one of Britain's most audacious heists in recent memory. 

It is now thought they may have been given advance warning that a police officer would be changing shifts at the centre - with the thieves waiting for him to leave before returning to remove more items.  

### Emphasis:

The raid was part of a series of robberies by gangs targeting vaults around London and in Surrey, which saw them take almost £20 million worth of jewels from the same area over three days last April. 

### Explanation:

Police were accused at the time of failing to act quickly enough when an alarm was triggered in the vaults.  

The gang returned twice - first on Easter Monday, then a week later on Good Friday - and managed to break into the vaults again by forcing open a door on their second visit, which came as the officer who raised the alarm had left for lunch. 

### Result:

It has emerged that police may have to pay out hundreds of thousands in compensation as a result of the failures during the raids - which could leave taxpayers facing massive bills.
