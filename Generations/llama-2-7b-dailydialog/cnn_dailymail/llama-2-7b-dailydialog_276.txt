Professor Tim Spector at King's College London, who was involved in the research.Peanuts are a great food for children as well because they are easy to digest."When we eat peanuts we do not see the bacteria we would normally expect to find there because the peanut actually prevents them from getting into our bodies. We think that's why eating these nuts has beneficial effects on gut health," he said.
