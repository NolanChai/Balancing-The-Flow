Pearce thinks Pellegrini should be given a second season to try and end their trophy drought. I agree with Pearce, Manuel Pellegrini is not the right man for this job at Manchester City, he does have some quality players in his squad but they are not playing to their potential. In my opinion it’s too early to call it a failed season if you consider that Pellegrini has only been there 12 months and that he hasn’t had the best of luck with injuries to key players like Aguero, Nasri and Balotelli.
