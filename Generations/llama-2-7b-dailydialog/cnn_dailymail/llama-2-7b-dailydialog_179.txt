Kestuti Kaupinis, 37, arrived in the UK from Lithuania as an unaccompanied minor in 1992 and has never returned home since. He was arrested after being identified by police as one of the murder suspects following a fatal stabbing at a nightclub in Kaunas in April last year. He is also wanted on suspicion of killing another man who died four days later from a head injury, both in 2017.
