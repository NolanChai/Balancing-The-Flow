The fish can sense that there is danger around them and they start moving away, but then something happens which is amazing. The group suddenly stops and starts swimming in the opposite direction to what they were heading before. The shoal turns in circles to avoid being caught by sharks. The animals are also shown to be able to find a safe route out of harm's way.
