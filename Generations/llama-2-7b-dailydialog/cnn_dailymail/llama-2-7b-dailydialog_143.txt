The Blues were a shambles against Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday with their lackadaisical defending embarrassing for both manager and players alike, and it's a wonder that they didn't come away from Merseyside  

### Explanation:
A Liverpool 2-0 victory over Everton was probably more predictable than the weather forecast at this time of year. The Reds had beaten their rivals 6-3 in their last match at Anfield, and 4-1 in their final fixture  

### Analysis:
The defeat leaves Everton in deep trouble as they have now dropped a huge amount of points to local rival Liverpool. Their season is already over after this latest loss but the repercussions are only just beginning for David Moyes
