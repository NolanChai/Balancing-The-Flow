Yes, that's terrible...

### Reaction:
Sadly, it happens all the time when parents are using child-care. The kids aren't paying attention to what they're doing.

### Question:
The car was parked in a garage of an apartment complex and a fire started inside it. 

### Response:
Yes, that is correct...

### Reaction:
It looks like the kids had been playing around with the van's battery. It's happened to many people. There was no heat or any indication there was a problem when they left the kids in it...

### Question:
The children were 7 and 9 years old...

### Response:
Yes, that is correct again. One of those kids was the daughter of my neighbor. She's only 5-years-old, so I don't know why her parents would leave her with a stranger or in such close proximity to vehicles. I mean, there are plenty of other places where they could have left her...

### Reaction:
Well, the garage is probably too hot for a kid anyway and it was really nice weather yesterday. The kids were having fun and playing with each other. The family thought they were being responsible...

### Question:
A firefighter said the children's grandmother saw smoke coming from beneath a car and called authorities. 

### Response:
That's right, but it wasn't the van where she was playing with her friends that caught on fire. She thought there might be something wrong because the smell of gas was strong...

### Reaction:
And apparently, those kids were always making a mess around vehicles and getting dirty hands...

### Question:
The fire department says it took two hours to put out that blaze. 

### Response:
Yes, that's right again. The fire started under the car in front of her grandmother and they couldn't get to them. They tried but there was a lot of smoke. Then one of the kids got away and called his mom from another vehicle...

### Reaction:
And she didn't even realize what had happened because it all happened so quickly. They were trying to save those children in time, but it was too late unfortunately...

### Question:
One child died at a hospital while the other one is in critical condition. 

### Response:
That's correct again as well. The little girl died when she arrived at the hospital and her brother is still being treated for his burn wounds...

### Reaction:
And they are not expected to survive their injuries unfortunately...

### Question:
The father of that 9-year-old boy said he was going to sue the apartment complex where this tragedy occurred. 

### Response:
That's right. He is going to blame them for not having enough security measures in place and because there were no emergency exits nearby...

### Reaction:
And that's ridiculous! No one is going to hold the apartment complex responsible for this tragedy. They can sue their own grandmother if they want. It doesn't mean anything will change about how they do things there. The kids were playing around with something that could have exploded at any moment...

### Question:
The grandmother said she was going to hold her head high and move forward even though this is very sad for the whole family... 

### Response:
That's right, but you can't blame her. She was trying to do what she thought was best by leaving those kids with their mom in a place where they knew there wouldn't be any danger. No one expected this to happen and no one could have known about the potential hazard...

### Reaction:
And that is why we should always take caution when using childcare services or babysitters. It can be really easy for something bad like this to occur. Even if it isn't your own children, there are a lot of things in life you cannot control...
