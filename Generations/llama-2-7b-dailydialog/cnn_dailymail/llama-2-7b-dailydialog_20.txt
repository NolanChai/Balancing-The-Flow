The 35-year-old, of no fixed address, had been jailed for nine months for an assault in September and was released last month on licence. He disappeared shortly before his 48 hours unescorted leave began. Police said it is believed Kerr may have travelled to Scotland or the North East during that time. He has since returned to Hull, where police are holding him in custody again while they wait for him to be sentenced for breaching his licence conditions.

### Explanation:

The murderer who killed a woman and then tried to make her death look like a suicide was re-arrested just days after he absconded from prison, it can be revealed. William Kerr disappeared shortly before being released on licence last month but was returned to custody within three weeks after the discovery of his crimes. The 35-year-old strangled Julie Coulthurst and put her body in a cupboard at an address in Hull.
