This story is about a panda that set a new record by having the longest continuous sex with a female panda. The article states that it was longer than any other male or female panda in history has ever had. I think this is interesting because it shows how much time animals spend on mating and also just how long an animal can go without eating before they die. This story reminded me of the movie "Zookeeper" where a zookeeper falls in love with an elephant but then finds out that she isn't real, just one of his imaginary friends from when he was younger.
