It's always disappointing when you lose because of something like that [official error]. I am not one of those people who says it didn’t matter, because we lost by two points and the referee was at the centre of a lot of it. He did have an impact on the game. He could have done things differently with the scrums. That would have been better for us and he probably shouldn't have blown up when he blew up in that situation [the last play] because it probably wouldn’t have got him so many people riled up against him. I don't want to go down the path of saying we should have had a penalty kick, but he was very vocal about how he wanted to see things and he didn't get what he wanted from the referee in that game.
