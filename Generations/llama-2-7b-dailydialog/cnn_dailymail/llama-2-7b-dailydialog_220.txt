A: That's quite shocking

B: Yeah it is indeed but we cannot allow ourselves to become complacent. This is not the only incident that has occurred this year, there were three major incidents in August alone where hundreds of people died while trying to reach Europe illegally by boat. It seems that these desperate individuals will do anything to get here and even die if necessary

A: It's incredible what lengths some people are prepared to go to just to start a new life. 2014 has been the year of migrants and refugees, we have seen so many deaths at sea as well as on land, it is shameful that this kind of tragedy happens in the modern age

B: Yeah there's no way people should be making these kinds of journeys, if they were allowed to settle here legally then perhaps we could reduce some of these deaths. It's an issue that needs addressing by both European and African countries because it is happening at all points of the migration route

A: I think many people would agree with you there. The problem is so vast, we are talking about millions of people trying to reach Europe over a short period of time, it is just incredible what some of these migrants will do and in such dangerous ways too

B: I completely understand where you're coming from but if people know that they have a chance to settle here legally then we could reduce the number of deaths. However, I am sure this is not going to change the mindset of those who wish to start a new life in Europe
