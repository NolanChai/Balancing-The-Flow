Dear __________, I am very worried about you and hope that your parents will reconsider their decision of marrying you off at such a young age. Please donâ€™t let them make this mistake as it is not going to benefit anyone in the family. You are too young to be married, so please speak up for yourself and stop your wedding ceremony from happening. I promise that we will help you if you need assistance. Please consider my offer before making a big mistake.
