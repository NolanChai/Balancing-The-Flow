I don't understand why people would want to talk with the president of the United States, who doesn't even know what he is doing and will lead America into a world war within his first two terms if he succeeds. I feel sorry for the rest of the students, they had no chance to ask anything as well. He was on a rant about climate change which most people know nothing about and why would you want to interrupt that?

### Analysis:

President Obama has done some great things while in office like creating a health care reform bill that helped millions of Americans, but his weak foreign policy and his love for executive orders is going to be the demise of our country. The fact that people are starting to notice this scares me as most Americans don't know what is going on outside their own backyard. This kid had a lot of guts asking Obama about all the problems we are facing in Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine.
