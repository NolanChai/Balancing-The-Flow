The US Drought Monitor reported that the Western States were in the grip of a ‘megadrought’. The warm blob in the Pacific could be responsible for it, as well as more extreme and frequent wildfires and heatwaves. The warming Arctic air has been carried across America by the jet stream

### Reaction:

The weather has played havoc with food production in California, but a recent study revealed that only 10 per cent of Californians are facing shortages as a result. That leaves 90 per cent of consumers who can still access all the avocados and strawberries they want – even if they’re now being grown in Mexico

### Conclusion:

The warm blob isn’t just affecting California. It's also caused unprecedented levels of snowfall on the East coast this winter, causing many to question the science behind global warming
