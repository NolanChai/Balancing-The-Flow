The ship had 16 people on board, including two children, when it broke free of its mooring near Boothbay Harbor around midnight and began to drift toward a rocky ledge. The passengers and crew abandoned the vessel before dawn and were rescued by Coast Guard crews from Station South Portland and Station Cape Porpoise. One passenger suffered non-life threatening injuries, but was released from Southern Maine Medical Center after treatment for cuts and bruises.
