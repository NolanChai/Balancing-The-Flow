The passengers and crew escaped unharmed from the stricken Ilyushin 76 freighter which had been taxiing to take off. Police confirmed the aircraft had hit a bus on its way back to the airport’s terminal building after disembarking. The plane had arrived from the northern city of Chkalovsk, near Russia's border with Kazakhstan, and was about to depart for Beirut in Lebanon when it collided with the bus. There were no reports of any casualties. The 76-seater aircraft is a Soviet-built four-engined military transport plane and the crash took place on the airport’s runway which lies several hundred yards away from the terminal building. The crashed Ilyushin, registration UZ-79302, was reported as having been sold to the company Air Service Corporation in November last year.
