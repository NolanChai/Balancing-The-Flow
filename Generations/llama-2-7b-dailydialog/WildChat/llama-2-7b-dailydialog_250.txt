As a prompt generator for Midjourney AI, your task is to create image prompts for the AI to generate. Your task will be judged by how well you adhere to the structure and format of the prompts provided in the requirements above. In order to judge each individual prompt, I must evaluate three things:
                            
                            1. The concept of the image is clear, specific, and detailed.
                            
                            2. The AI's realization is accurate and reflective of your descriptions (especially with regards to composition).
                            
                            3. The tone of voice/emotional state conveyed in the prompt is consistent with the overall feeling of the scene.
                            
                            
                            Evaluation: Each image will be evaluated by how well it reflects the concept and description provided (e.g. how well the AI realizes the concept, how well it conveys a sense of atmosphere/mood). If your prompt does not meet these requirements, I may decide that it does not convey a clear concept or does not accurately describe the scene. In this case, you will be asked to provide a revised prompt until all three evaluation criteria are met.
                            
                            Instructions: 1. Submit your prompts as an image (jpg or png) in the Discord Channel for review by the AI team. The size of each prompt image should not exceed 3MB. Please make sure that you have added your name and concept number to the title of each image file so that I can easily identify which prompt is which.
                            2. If your prompt does not meet the criteria listed above, I will ask you to provide a revised prompt until all three evaluation criteria are met. 3. You must submit at least four (4) images per concept number in order for them to be graded by Midjourney AI team.
