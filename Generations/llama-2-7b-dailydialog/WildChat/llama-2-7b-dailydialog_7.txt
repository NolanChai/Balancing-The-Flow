I am here to help you write an article for National Dog Day, and I will do my best to make sure it ranks well on Google. 
Let's start by brainstorming some topics that might be relevant to this event. We can focus on the history of dogs, their impact on society, or simply the joy they bring into our lives. We could also talk about how to celebrate National Dog Day, with ideas such as adopting a dog from a shelter or taking your pet for a walk in nature. 
Once we have a list of potential topics, let's start working on the outline and structure of the article. We can begin by introducing our main theme, which would be "Celebrating National Dog Day" followed by an opening paragraph that gives readers a glimpse into what they can expect from the rest of the content. After that, we could include subtopics such as "History of dogs" and "The impact of dogs on society." This way we will create a clear roadmap for readers to follow as they explore our article. 
Now let's take a look at some specific details regarding formatting style guidelines for this type of writing project: 
* Use short paragraphs with an average length of between 3-5 sentences each; longer ones could be broken down into smaller sections instead (easy on eyes).
* Keep in mind that bullet points are best used sparingly but may also serve as a great way to summarize information without overwhelming readers with too much text at once.
* Use bold or italics when necessary for emphasis or clarification purposes only; don't overdo it since this will look unprofessional in the end result product (i.e., print magazine article). 
* Incorporate visual elements such as images whenever possible because they help break up long blocks of text while also adding another layer to understanding what we are trying convey here â€“ which can be especially helpful when dealing with complex topics like dog ownership etcetera...
