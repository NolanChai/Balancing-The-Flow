There’s no doubt that account-based marketing (ABM) has emerged as one of the most important tactical trends in B2B marketing over the last decade, and rightly so. ABM is an ideal way for marketers to drive top-line growth because it’s a highly personalized approach designed to attract and retain high-value accounts — both new and existing ones.
For example, it can help you identify accounts that are likely to generate significant revenue and then target them with content, social media engagement, and other campaigns tailored specifically for each account. This ensures that every contact receives information most relevant to their needs while helping build relationships between buyers and sellers — a win-win situation!

In this blog post, we’ll explore these questions in detail so you have all the facts before putting together your own plan. We’ll also discuss some common mistakes people make when implementing their plans as well as provide tips on how to avoid them!
