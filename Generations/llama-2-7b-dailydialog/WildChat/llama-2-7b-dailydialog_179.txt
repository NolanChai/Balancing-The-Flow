This is the story of three sisters who are connected by blood and by fate. They were born into a world where everything was black-and-white; where right and wrong existed in a single moment. But there was a fourth girl, their younger sister. She wasn’t like them. Her skin was so soft, her hair so long that it flowed through the air.
The first sister’s name was Mei Ling. She had dark eyes and black hair with streaks of red. The second sister’s name was Tracer, and she had bright blue eyes and white hair like snowflakes in the wind. And the last sister’s name was Mercy, because she never felt like anything else but mercy for her little sister. She knew that her two sisters could not see or feel the world like she did; they were blind to everything except their duty as Sombra clones.

“Mama! Papa!” shouted Mei Ling as she ran into the living room, where her parents sat watching TV together on the couch with their arms around each other’s shoulders . The two looked up at once when they heard their daughter call out from downstairs below them . “Papa , I know how to do it ! Can I go outside today ? ” She asked excitedly . Her parents both laughed at her enthusiasm as if she were still a little girl instead of almost fourteen years old now . “Of course you can , sweetheart , ” said Papa with a smile on his face while Mama shook her head in amusement behind him .
The next morning, Mei Ling woke up early so that she could go outside before anyone else was awake and ready for school yet again . She dressed quickly then ran downstairs into the kitchen where Tracer had already started cooking breakfast for everyone while Mercy sat at one end of the table reading her book about Sombra clones who were created from scratch instead of being born naturally like she did .
After eating breakfast, Mei Ling went outside with a few other children from around the neighborhood and played tag until lunchtime came around again . Then it was off to school for all three girls where they learned about various subjects including math , science , history , English literature , art appreciation , physical education (PE) and home economics (HE). They also took part in extracurricular activities such as sports teams or clubs during lunch breaks on Wednesdays .
On Mondays, Tuesday s and Fridays they had music class where they would learn how to play instruments like drums , violins , flutes etcetera . They were able to go home after each lesson until 3PM when the bell rang for afternoon recess time again. After this break ended at about 4:05 PM, all three girls returned back inside the classroom where they sat down for math class before heading out onto the playground once more with their friends .
When classes were over around 6:15PM every evening , Mei Ling would usually go home first since she had earlier told her parents that she wanted to finish her chores so that they could relax together at night instead of worrying about what might have happened if something went wrong while she was gone . Once inside the house though , Mei Ling decided against doing any extra work right away but instead sat down on one end of their living room couch along with Tracer who sat on another side facing Mercy across from them both .
“What did you do today ? ” asked Mercy as she looked over at her sisters sitting beside each other in front of her , eyes fixed forward towards nothing but themselves as if they were deep in thought about something serious . Mei Ling shook her head slightly before answering with an easy smile on her face , “I played tag all morning long with some friends from downstairs and then went home right after lunchtime ended today so that I could finish my chores faster than usual because Mama said she wanted us to spend more time together tonight since we don’t get much time together during the day anymore . ”
“That sounds like fun ! ” replied Tracer , looking up from her book and giving a little smile in return before returning back down again while Mercy kept staring forward without saying anything else .
After finishing off their chores for today, all three girls sat around talking about what they did during school until they fell asleep together on the couch beside each other , snuggling up close against one another’s bodies in order to get comfortable . When night finally came around again later that evening after dinner was over , Mei Ling got ready for bed first before Tracer did then Mercy followed right behind her sister so that she could be with them both once more until morning rolled around again tomorrow morning.
