The surface of the Earth

### Explanation:

"Earth's crust", or "lithosphere", is what we see. The mantle is solid rock, and is about 84% of the mass of the earth. It is hot enough to melt iron. 

The core of Earth is liquid. It has been so for billions of years, but it wasn't until the 1960s that we were able to confirm its existence by seismic means. There are no direct methods yet known for observing the core directly, though radioactive elements in rocks and other materials do indicate there is a lot of heat down there!

9:00:00  solar wind is coming from the South-East direction with a speed of about 450 km/sec. It has density of 6 particles per cubic centimeter and magnetic field strength of about 6 nT. The flow velocity is about 500km/sec in North - West direction.
