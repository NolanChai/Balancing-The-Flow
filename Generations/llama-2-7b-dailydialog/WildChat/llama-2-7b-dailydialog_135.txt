* Spongebob's response is the best one. The funniest one to me is when he asks "Whats that smell?" and then walks away with a worried look on his face like he just realized it was him. That's the kind of thing I love, subtle jokes.
* I think the Tom cat response is the best because you know that if the teacher asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he would respond "a tom cat" and then try to sneak away from the classroom to go to his cave or something like that. It's too funny not to laugh at this one!
* This is so cool I was totally laughing out loud. The axel stone response is very hilarious because it's so unexpected and just a little bit awkward, which makes it even more entertaining. Also his reaction when asked what he wants to be when he grows up shows that he doesn't care about anything anymore which also makes this video more funny for me because I feel like people who don't care about what they want to do in life are pretty lazy and boring, but then again it could just be a joke on how dumb axel stone is
* The Bugs Bunny response was my favorite. He looks so shocked when asked if he wants to be anything else when he grows up! This video made me laugh out loud several times. It also reminds me of that one episode where they were trying to figure out what Bugs wanted to do when he grew up, but all the teachers kept asking him things like "What does your father want you to do?" or "Do you want to be a teacher?" and Bugs would just sit there with this blank look on his face saying "No" over and over again until they finally gave up trying to get an answer out of him.
* My favorite response in the video is when Baldi asked what he wants to be when he grows up, and then he looks around like he doesn't know where to go or something. He looks so scared! I think that it's funny because he has such a serious face with all his hair sticking out from underneath his hat while wearing a shirt with the words "Baldi" written on it in big letters, which makes him look like some sort of crazy person or something.
* I thought that Gordon's response was really funny because when asked what he wants to be when he grows up, he just looks at you and says "nothing". Then when asked why, he says "because I don't want anything." That is hilarious!
* This is probably my favorite video of all time. The responses are so funny that they make me laugh out loud every single time I watch it (which happens pretty often). My favorite response would have to be Bugs Bunny because his face when he's asked what he wants to do in life is priceless!
* Caillou is the best and most interesting character to see. He's a very cute little boy that has a lot of friends, but he also makes fun of them sometimes because they aren't as smart as him or something like that (which is what makes him so great). The only problem with this video is when it ends abruptly after telling you about how many friends Caillou has. It would be nice if there were more scenes where he hangs out with them and does things together instead of just talking about himself all the time!
* This is a really funny video because Ellis is trying to get away from people who are shooting at him, but then his friend Gordon shows up and starts asking questions like "What's going on here?" or "Where have you been hiding?" Then when he asks what he wants to be when he grows up, Ellis just looks at him in disbelief before saying something about being a soldier (which makes sense since this video takes place during WWII).
* The Buster Bunny response is the best because it's so unexpected. When I saw that he was going to ask what they wanted to be when they grow up, my first thought was that maybe they would say something like "I want to be a doctor" or "I want to be an astronaut", but instead he asked Buster Bunny if he wants to be anything else! It's hilarious because you can tell how shocked everyone is by this question and the look on their faces makes me laugh every time I watch it.
* This video is my favorite of all time, even though some people might disagree with that statement. The first time I saw it was when we were in school together at about six years old (so around 2011), which means that this video has been around for nearly eight years now! Whenever I watch videos from my childhood days like these ones, they always make me think back on how much fun our class was during recess time when everyone was playing with their friends instead of doing anything else like studying or working hard at schoolwork etcetera.
