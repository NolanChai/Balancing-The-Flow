correct grammar: "Hi Jimmy,

I will upload the business objective goals to your performance goals for tracking after checking with my colleague who is responsible for that. Please bear with me while waiting for their response. 

Regards,
Crystal"

"Performance review is not due yet. May I know when will be your deadline for submission? Also, if it’s done on time, how can we make sure that you have received all your objectives from your manager?"

"Since Crystal's not in office tomorrow morning, and won't be back until next Monday, shall we reschedule our meeting to some other day or time? I don't want to interrupt your vacation. How does Wednesday at 4pm sound?"

"We succeed together" means that our customers are more likely to achieve their desired business outcomes as we leverage each other’s expertise, technologies and processes across all dimensions of the customer relationship. We succeed because we have an ability to adapt our solutions to meet our customer's needs.

Together, we make possible what we cannot do alone."
This is a simple statement of intent that describes who we are as individuals and how we work together. It reflects our ability to achieve more by working in partnership with others. 

It also reminds us to collaborate across boundaries, break down silos, trust and support each other, and get out of each other's way when necessary.
