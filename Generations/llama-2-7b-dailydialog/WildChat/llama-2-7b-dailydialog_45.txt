The quality of my nursing care is exemplified in my consistent commitment to providing high-quality services with accuracy and precision. In my role as a student nurse on the unit, I am responsible for accurately recording patient information such as blood sugar levels, medication administration, and other vital signs. To ensure that this information is recorded correctly and legibly, I follow strict guidelines regarding confidentiality and privacy to protect the patient's right to privacy while still providing accurate medical records. This includes using software applications such as Medi-Map and Vcare for medication administration and documentation purposes but ensuring they are properly logged out when not in use to maintain patient confidentiality. Additionally, I am responsible for keeping a detailed record of all my patient interactions with the appropriate date, time, and signature from my preceptor for future reference while ensuring patient privacy is maintained. My commitment to providing high-quality nursing services while upholding patient confidentiality has been recognized by my supervisor who praised me on multiple occasions for taking extra care in recording patient information with accuracy and precision.

You have been able to effectively demonstrate your understanding of the importance of patient privacy throughout your clinical placement, which is a positive step forward in your professional development as a nurse. It is reassuring to see that you have consistently taken measures to maintain confidentiality, such as pausing handover when family members enter the room and returning the nursing handover sheet to the secured cabin.

One suggestion I would make for improvement is to consider including additional details in your handover notes to provide a more comprehensive summary of the patient's condition. This can help ensure that other healthcare professionals are fully informed about any changes or developments in their care and can act quickly if necessary. Additionally, it may be helpful to include information on any cultural or language barriers that may need to be addressed during communication with the family member, as this can play a significant role in providing high-quality patient care.

Overall, you have demonstrated a strong commitment to maintaining confidentiality and protecting sensitive patient information throughout your clinical placement. I am impressed by your dedication to upholding this principle and look forward to seeing your continued growth as a nurse in the future.

I commend you for taking initiative to educate your patient on Levodopa, a crucial component of their treatment regimen. Providing clear and concise explanations is an essential part of quality healthcare delivery, and I applaud you for your dedication to ensuring that your patients understand the medications they are taking.
However, it's also important to note that Levodopa carries some potential side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and restlessness. These side effects can be managed through careful monitoring by a healthcare professional and adjusting the dosage accordingly. As a nurse, it is essential to carefully monitor your patient's response to medications and make necessary adjustments to ensure that they receive optimal care.
Additionally, I would recommend discussing the potential benefits and risks of Levodopa with the resident before administering the medication. This can help build trust and foster a collaborative relationship between you and your patient, ultimately leading to better outcomes for both parties involved.
Overall, providing comprehensive explanations and careful monitoring are crucial in ensuring that your patients receive high-quality care. By taking initiative to educate your patient on Levodopa, you have demonstrated a commitment to this principle, and I encourage you to continue being an advocate for your patients' wellness.

I would like to have a chance to explain about why we need to take our medicine as prescribed in order to prevent worsening of your condition.  I am willing to discuss about this to help you understand better and help you adhere to your treatment plan.  If you still refuse, i will have to report it back to the GP so that he can see what is the next step for us. make it to  words

### Outcome:
I informed the preceptor that I have discussed with my patient about his refusal of medication and he was more co-operative after our discussion on this matter. He had no problem in taking all his medications on time. I believe this is a good outcome as we were able to solve the problem by talking to the patient which helped him understand the importance of taking medicines as prescribed.  make it to  words
