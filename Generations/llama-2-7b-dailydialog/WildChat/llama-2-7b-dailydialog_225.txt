```vb
Sub MyMacro()
    Dim Cell As Range, rng As Range
    Set rng = Range("H5")
    
    If Not IsNumeric(rng) Then GoTo Exit_Label
        
    For Each Cell In Range("B6:B100").Cells
        If Cell.Value = "Service" Then
            If rng.Value <= Cell.Offset(0, 2).Value Then
                rng = Cell.Offset(0, 2)
            End If
        End If
    Next
    
    rng = Range("H5").Value
End Sub
```

### Explanation:

I am using a `For Each` loop to loop through the range that was selected and search for the value "Service" in column B.  For each time you find the text value "Service", it will check if the date in column H is smaller or equal than the current cell's offset.  

After searching, we get our earliest date found by setting a variable `rng` to that cell and then exiting the loop. After that we just use this variable as the new value for `rng`.  Then we can set `rng` back to "H5" (the original starting point of the search) and calculate the answer in there.

Hi, I am using MS Excel VBA and have written code for your project.

Here is the sample workbook in .xlsm format, where the formulas are defined at worksheet level so that you can change them as per your requirement (I haven't added any service dates to showcase how it will look after changing it to "Serviced").
[Sample workbook](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B47-i5fWU06KMlJkR3hEck12ZlU)

\begin{code}
Sub test()
    If Range("B1") = "Serviced" Then
        MsgBox "Please ensure that an identical Service is created with a Next Service Due Date after changing this to Serviced." & vbCrLf, , "Message"
    End If
End Sub
\end{code}
