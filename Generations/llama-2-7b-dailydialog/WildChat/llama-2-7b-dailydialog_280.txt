The first thing I would say is you need to get more detail in your instructions. The second thing I'm going to tell you that we can help each other by brainstorming. My idea was to write about them as they meet in the hospital and he flirts with her, she gets upset, they both realize they are similar and become friends or lovers. There should be some jokes about them being handicapped for example. I know you are not sure if this is going anywhere, but it's a start.

I have tried my best but I can't make it work with the current arrangements of our patients in this ward. However, as soon as a room becomes available I will put you both together in the same room, if you agree to it. Please donâ€™t make me regret helping you!
