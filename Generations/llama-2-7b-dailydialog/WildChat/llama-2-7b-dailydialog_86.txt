It is widely believed that today’s manager should utilize all the
resources available to him/her in order to succeed at his/her job. In my
opinion, this view of management is very appropriate for modern managers.
First of all, as a modern manager, he/she has much more information than
any managers did in the past. For example, thanks to the Internet, they can
easily gain access to any data they need to do their job (Chang & Wang, 2006).
In addition, nowadays managers are provided with more opportunities for
training and development than before (Zhang et al., 2013) . With these two
resources available, modern managers can quickly catch up with the newest
technologies to improve their performance and succeed in business. For example,
in order to get along well with customers and maintain a good relationship,
managers should know how to use social media (Liu et al., 2015). Accordingly,
managers who utilize all the resources available will be able to deal better
with issues which they encounter in their workplace. Furthermore, there are also
more ways for managers to communicate with each other and share useful
information (Zhang et al., 2013) . Therefore, I believe that it is more
appropriate for today’s manager to use all the resources he/she has in order to
succeed.  

Secondly, managers are encouraged to learn from their predecessors as much
as possible (Zhang et al., 2013) , which means that modern managers should be
familiar with management theories and concepts of the past. Thus, it is
necessary for today’s manager to make a good use of all his/her resources in
order to achieve a better job performance and success.

The current trend in higher education is to use an online learning environment as part of the student’s educational experience. Most universities are using Blackboard for their online classes. For example, the University of Phoenix uses it for its entire student population and some traditional colleges offer a hybrid class option that allows students to take online and traditional classes.
