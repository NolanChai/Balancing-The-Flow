1. Mishaali immediately retaliates with a right hook that connects, leaving her Hyderabadi rival Kareen stumbling backwards. Mishaali follows up the punch by driving in an uppercut to her rivals face which Kareen manages to block with her free arm but Mishaali comes back with a left jab, sending her Kolkatan opponent reeling again and this time she falls onto her back as she tries to protect herself against the blows. Mishaali lets out an evil looking grin at Kareen before going for one last hit with the right hook, but Kareen is able to block the punch this time using both arms which results in a brief pause in the fight as both women catch their breath and prepare to strike again.

The second blow comes from Mishaali who delivers a flurry of punches that Kareen attempts to defend but fails, one after another they come down on her face until finally Kareen is able to push back the Hyderabadi and get into position to throw up an elbow strike. This however proves fruitless as Mishaali manages to block it with her arm before grabbing onto her rivals face and twisting her neck. A few more seconds of wrestling ensued until Kareen managed to grab Mishaalis legs and kick away, but the Kolkatan was able to roll away from Kareens blows easily as she rose to her feet, she then throws a punch at her face that hits just above her nose before Kareen responds with an elbow strike of her own which lands in Mishaali’s chest, they both then stand there for a few seconds until the fight breaks off into grapples.
3. The fight continues as both women begin to wrestle with each other until they find themselves on their knees with Kareen having Mishaali by the hair and a grip on her right arm that causes her to cry out in pain, however before she can do much else, Mishaali uses her free arm to grab onto the back of Kareens head and slam it into the floor which results in the Kolkatan woman releasing her hold on her rival. Both women quickly get up again with a renewed sense of energy as they both look for an opening, however neither is able to get much in the way of a strike or submission hold until Mishaali charges towards Kareen with open arms only for Kareen to jump back just enough so she could use her own momentum against her and flip backwards into Mishaalis chest.
4. The fight continues as both women try their best to get in a hit or submission, but neither is able to land anything that will leave the other woman on the floor with a knockout blow, until finally Kareen manages to grab onto her rivals head and slip into an arm lock that ends the bout with Mishaali unable to escape from the hold. The fight was close throughout and it could have gone either way as neither fighter seemed willing to back down or give up despite how tired they were becoming, but in the end it was Kareens determination that won out against her rival and gave her a well deserved victory over the Hyderabadi woman.
