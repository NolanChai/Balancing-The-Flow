Let's say the temperature of your coffee is 135 degrees Fahrenheit. This means that everything in it, such as the liquid itself or anything solid it might contain, is moving faster than usual and with much greater force. The water molecules are slamming together violently, and the energy they gain from this impact can be harnessed to drive other chemical reactions that take place inside your coffee, such as the formation of acids and bases (things like sugar) or even the production of tiny pockets of gas called bubbles.

These bubbles will rise up through your drink until they burst at the surface where you've left them to fizz away while you sip your beverage from the top down, similar to how we see bubbles form in carbonated soft drinks or beer when they are opened up for consumption by a human being who is about 5 feet tall with arms that measure just over two-thirds of their height from floor to wrist and who has fingers that are roughly equal in length but slightly wider than normal (according to my friend Andrew).

Heat death occurs when the universe reaches a state of equilibrium in which its entropy is maximized. This corresponds to an idealized situation where all matter and energy in the universe are uniformly distributed and have reached thermal equilibrium. The amount of entropy would be infinite, as it cannot increase further with time due to the second law of thermodynamics.

Boltzmann brain is not so bad an idea, but the reason to believe it might happen has nothing to do with quantum physics.  A very likely event in the evolution of the Universe (and therefore the number of these brains) is that of a supernovae explosion.  In this case, what happens is that all the mass in that particular star gets compressed into a small region in space.  
This would lead to an incredible amount of energy being released at once and also to a rapid change from one state (infinite) to another (very little).  
All these happen very quickly (as far as the universe is concerned, i mean), which means that the laws of physics don't have enough time to "adjust", leading to a sudden change.  
This in turn leads to a randomization of the state of every particle within this region, including our brains.  
The question then becomes how likely it would be for this process to happen in any given moment.  
In order to calculate it we need to use physics laws (which are not so complicated) and some statistics to make sure that the result is reasonably accurate.

And then the same thing again. Infinite universes means infinitely many of these things happening, which implies an infinite number of parallel universes. Now I don't see anything stopping an infinite amount of universes from being in this situation and having all of their instances of the program be identical except for the fact that there is no infinite loop at all! So in each universe where the infinite loop does not exist, the computer would run forever like you said it should. But since we know that one does occur somewhere, that means that an infinite number of universes have this infinite loop and nothing can stop them from existing.

This question has been raised before and I am going to take this opportunity to clear up any misconceptions you may have on this issue.

First, we need to define what "Boltzmann Brains" are, since some readers might be unaware of the term. The term was coined by the physicist Sean M. Carroll and refers to a brain that is part of an observer-independent eternal inflation universe (I'll explain what this means in detail later). In this type of scenario, there is no single "big bang" which gave birth to our current universe from a quantum fluctuation, but rather an infinite number of bounces into existence and subsequent deaths due to the eternal inflationary expansion. Boltzmann Brains are essentially random, uncaused events in this scenario that have no real causality between them and can therefore be considered "real" universes.

The second thing you need to understand is how a probability like "greater than 0%" or "less than 50%" relates to something like "the existence of our universe." To put it simply, there are a few problems with this question: firstly, the number we're dealing with does not correspond to a "probability" at all. Secondly, we don't really know how likely these Boltzmann Brains are; if they have already existed and died off many times in an eternal inflationary universe then their relative probability is going to be quite high. Lastly, the question ignores that there was no "initial condition" or "beginning point" from which we can derive a probability based on it being "more likely for something to exist than not."

So while I am happy to answer your questions with regard to probability, I don't think this is what you are really trying to ask. I hope this helps!

That's right. But even if we didn't exist, this fact is still true, because there will be other Boltzmann Brains to fill our place, and the whole thing can be repeated infinitely many times. So, it's not only that we would have no memories; in a certain sense we wouldn't even exist for more than one Planck time (i.e., 10^{-43} seconds).

Yes, you can. You just need a lot of mass (think like the earth) and a lot of time to reach thermal equilibrium. The Earth is about 13 times the diameter of the Sun (about 86500 miles vs 71329), so if we ignore other factors it will take ~13*T (the lifetime of the sun) for it to get to equilibrium with the Sun's heat. If the mass was evenly distributed over a sphere, then the time would be T/4.

It is impossible for air to escape from an empty vessel. This is because the pressure of the air outside the can is greater than that inside the can, and so the can will not be able to push the air out. In other words, if you put a can in a vacuum chamber, it will never open on its own.
