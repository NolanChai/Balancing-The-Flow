Lydia's friends are concerned about the recent accident that left her lying unconscious on the pavement outside of a fancy restaurant, which is why they come to visit her at the hospital every day. Her close friend from childhood, Eliza, commented: “It’s such a good thing you’re in here. I feel so much safer knowing your there.”

Her best friend and roommate, Tessa, was a little too excited by Lydia's newest hospital attire. She said: “I like the way your hat makes your face look smaller” and “You are my favorite actress but that’s only because you have a bigger head than me!”

Lydia's fans can’t help but notice her incredible sense of style, despite her current hospital attire. One fan commented: “You are so fashionable! What shoes do you wear with the cast? I always think of you as wearing heels.” Another said: “I feel bad for your legs because they’re always hidden under those clothes you wear.”

One day a little boy, who is sitting in Lydia's room on the bed next to her, makes his way over and looks at her with big eyes. He says, "Hi, I'm Cody" and holds out his hand for shaking. She smiles warmly as she reaches out and takes his hand. As they are talking Lydia discovers that he has a crush on her and he asks: “When will you get married? When do you think you’ll start dating?”

Lydia giggled and says "I don't know Cody, but I like you too much to ever turn you away.” Lydia is having such an amazing time with her new fans that she doesn’t even notice how much time has passed. All of a sudden she realizes it’s getting late and the nurses are coming in for rounds.

### Assignment:

Now imagine what a modern-day Lydia would post on Instagram if she was a Hollywood actress. What does Lydia's fashion sense look like when she is at home? Does she dress differently to please her fans and followers? Or has the fact that she's in love with a famous film actor made her more confident and carefree about what she wears, and how she presents herself to the world?
