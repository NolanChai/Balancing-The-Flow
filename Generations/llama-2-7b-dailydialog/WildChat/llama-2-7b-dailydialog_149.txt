Planet Psychre
Hjaoith is a rocky planet orbiting star Op, the fourth in cold zone around Op. The planet is a little smaller than Earth and its surface contains little or no water. It has bluish-gray patches that look like ice crystals from space and middle gray areas that donâ€™t contain any ice. Ice crystal patches are warm due to absorption of starlight, which heats the planet and melts the ice. The presence of ice on Hjaoith allows for life to exist as ice-based proteins evolve. Flora and fauna on Hjaoith is entirely ice-based. Icewood trees have light blue woods and leaves. Lomneals are sophonts living on Hjaoith who resemble humans, their skin is a darker shade of purple with bright blue eyes that contain melanin and blood is transparent lacking hemoglobin. Lomneal society is anarchistic. It is polygamous but not gendered. There are no fixed genders in the species. They reproduce by parthenogenesis.
