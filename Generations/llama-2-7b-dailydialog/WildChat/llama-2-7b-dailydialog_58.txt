Iodimetry is the determination of the amount of a substance by its reaction with a compound which contains an iodine atom (iodide, IO–) or an ion that has been substituted for it in the coordination sphere of the central metal atom.  The reaction may be either a redox one or an oxidation-reduction one.  Iodometry is the determination of a substance by its reaction with iodoantimony trioxide (Sb2I6).

10 mL 5 M Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)  5.76 g  324 mL Water    HCl (0.5 mol/L): 6.89 g NaI(aq)  67 mg H₂O₂:  31 mg

### Procedure:

1. Add 0.5 mol/L of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the flask. This solution is called the titrant. 2. Weigh out 5 g of sodium iodide and add it to the flask. A white precipitate should form immediately. This solution is called the reagent.
3. Add 1 mL of HCl to the flask, then add a few drops of starch solution (1 part starch + 9 parts water). If starch solution is added before the addition of titrant, it will be converted into iodine starch which could make the measurement difficult or impossible.
4. Add 20 mL of distilled water to the flask and mix well. This is the titration mixture. The volume of titrant added should be less than 50 mL.
5. Titrate the flask with thiosulfate until a permanent purple color appears in the starch solution (note: The initial dark yellow color will gradually change to a purplish blue).
6. Calculate how much titrant you used and divide by the volume of the original titration mixture. The result is the number of millimoles of iodide added per mL of titration mixture. 7. Repeat steps 1–5 with fresh solutions for each test solution or sample, taking care to record each measurement carefully.
8. Repeat the titration procedure on a blank sample (a sample without the unknown substance). This is done so that you can calculate how much of your original mixture was used up in the titration process and eliminate it from the results. 9. Calculate the iodide content for each test solution by comparing the amount of thiosulfate needed to turn purple the starch indicator with a standard curve prepared using standard solutions (in other words, we know how many millimoles of iodine are in an equivalent volume of water and NaOH). 10. Calculate the concentration of each test solution or sample by dividing the total number of moles of iodide found by the amount of original reagent used up.

### Equation:

\[\mathrm {IO_{3}^{-}_{(aq)}+\mathrm {OH^{-}} _{(aq)}\longrightarrow \mathrm {I{-}O{-}H} _{2\,(s)}\]

I2: 0.47 mL I2 = 0.48 mL titrant(67mL titration= 88 mL titrant)

Na: 1 mol Na + 1 mol H2O gives 2 mol NaOH

Sodium Thiosulfate: 3 mol S2O3^2-/Molarity of sodium thiosulfate = (0.47mL I2/ 88 mL titrant) x(3 mol S2O3^2-) = 0.65 mM

### Exercise:

Determine the volume of 1 M NaOH that is required to neutralize an excess of HCl in a solution containing 0.34 g NaCl and 0.07 g KCl. (Na:23, Cl:35, O:16)

### Response:

A neutralization reaction will occur if you add excess alkali to the acidic solution to reach neutrality. The following reactions are known for sodium hydroxide. 

NaOH(aq) + HCl(aq) -> NaCl (aq) + H₂O(l)
NaOH(aq) + H2SO4(aq) -> Na2SO4(aq) + H2O(l)

The volume of 1 M NaOH is given in the problem:

V = (0.34gNaCl x 1 mol/23 g Na)/ (23g Na + 1mol Cl) = V = 5.6 mL
