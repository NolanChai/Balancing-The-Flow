I am the Red Flower with White Stripes. I am from a foreign country and my name is Chrysanthemum. In that country, we like to eat flowers, particularly these two kinds of flowers: one called 'Jing' flower or 'Purple Sweet Potato flower', which is the red flower with white stripes that you are asking about; another one is 'Chun' flower, a kind of purple flower. They taste sweet and are delicious.
