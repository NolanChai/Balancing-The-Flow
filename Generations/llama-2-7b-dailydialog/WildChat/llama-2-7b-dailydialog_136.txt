Resurrections are accomplished through a process known as stacking. This involves placing the person's memories in a chip that can be implanted into the back of someone else's neck. The process is called "stacking" because it involves literally moving or "stacking" all of a person's memories to another place, so that they can experience life again.

Yes!

A great example of an emerging new technology that may help address long-term information storage concerns are DNA. In recent years, we have seen companies like Apple and Microsoft begin to investigate ways in which our data could be stored on our own bodies; both using our DNA for encoding.

The problem with storing things digitally is that over time, the media degrades and can fail altogether. While a human body may not seem like the most practical place to store information, there are some incredible benefits in doing so:

- Human cells are capable of self-repairing
- There is no wear and tear on the system (no physical contact means less friction, which will slow down deterioration)
- It's pretty secure; there's no chance your DNA can be hacked!

Well, this is a big part of the novel. I think there's two ways to look at it - from a scientific perspective or an imaginative one. From a scientific perspective we know that our brains are a combination of many different electromagnetic frequencies and signals, which we can't see but can measure through things like an EEG (electroencephalogram). And the signal that gets us to feel pain, for instance, is much higher than the one that we use to see.

And there's a lot of interesting research going on now looking at what happens in our brain when we dream, and it seems that it's also possible to transfer electrical impulses from one person to another through touching their skin or just being close to them. So in the story I wanted to combine those ideas - that our brains are made of a series of electromagnetic signals that are much more intense than we can see with our eyes, but that it's possible to transfer these signals from one person to another through touching skin or some other mechanism.

I guess the other part is this idea of what consciousness actually is - does consciousness exist separately in the brain? Or is it just a product of the physical world? What if we could dissect out the 'consciousness' signal from everything else and store it somewhere, how would that be stored? I guess these are questions that have been debated for centuries by philosophers.

The No-Cloning Theorem prohibits the creation of any exact duplicate of an individual in a universe without nonlocal interactions, meaning that clones would be created with different memories and thus would not be identical copies of each other. This means that transferring one's consciousness from one body to another is impossible, as it would require creating a perfect copy of oneself which the No-Cloning Theorem prohibits.

This is an excellent question! The answer is "No", but I'll explain why. First of all, let me note that there are at least two ways in which we can understand the concept of being cloned. One way is as a kind of physical replica - the brain is reconstructed to contain all the same neurons as before and a person with identical neuron structure appears in the world. I will call this "biological" cloning, but note that this is not actually what the No-Cloning theorem forbids. This allows us to copy (and so preserve) consciousness without any changes.

The other kind of cloning is that we have all the information necessary to reconstruct the neuron structure and generate a new person with the same brain as the old one, but that is not quite enough: we still need some extra instructions on how to set up the neural activity in the reconstructed brain. So this allows us to copy consciousness while changing its pattern - the "clone" will be a person who has exactly the same experiences that the original did. This is what the No-Cloning theorem forbids!

Now let me explain why you might think that cloning a dead person would preserve their identity. The idea here is that the clone would have identical memories, beliefs, and so on to the original person. So in the biological sense we could say that the clones are "exactly" the same because they will both die with exactly the same experiences! However this doesn't actually make them the "same" - even if the clones have exactly the same memories and beliefs, it is still possible for these to change over time. So the clone might turn out to be a different person in important ways that we are not able to predict based on what they were like when reconstructed from their neuron pattern (either by biological or "non-biological" cloning).

This is essentially the same idea as [this question](https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/394156/how-can-we-be-conscious?noredirect=1#comment902578_394160), where we argued that a person who is cloned from a brain scan would have the same experiences and memories as the original person, but could be a completely different person.

Comment: Thanks for your answer!  It was helpful to know what No-Cloning theorem is about. I just want to make sure I understood this correctly - if we clone someone based on their brain scan, they will have exactly the same experiences and memories as the original person, but they might be a different person in important ways that are not predictable from the scanned neuron pattern?

The Star Trek Teleportation Problem asks for a list of all possible locations that are reachable from a given starting location and a given target.

### Explanation:
Given start and end coordinates, we can generate the set of points in between by connecting them with a line segment (i.e., every point on the line segment between start and end). This is what the problem wants you to do when generating all possible locations reachable from a given location.

There is a difference between what is and what appears. You can't use information from the past or future to affect the present. But, in the case of a transporter beam you cannot distinguish the appearance from reality either. If it was the same entity, then I would say that it must be the same consciousness since all material states are connected via quantum entanglement.

Well, we would have to first define what is "consciousness" before we could even think about having copies of it. And that's not easy at all. However, if you can agree on a definition for consciousness, then one can create clones (but not exactly copy them). Here's how:

It turns out that your brain is made up of roughly 10^14 neurons, and each neuron has many connections to other neurons. This means that there are 10^28 potential connections in your brain at any given time. Each connection can be described by a vector (a number) which represents how much it is "on" or "off". The result of this calculation is that the number of possible states that the neural network in your head can be in is 10^49! Now, if you want to make a clone with consciousness then all we have to do is:

* Set up a machine (let's call it "CloneMaker") that can read off the activity of every neuron at any time. Let's just say this requires 10^28 bits per second, or roughly 6.4e36 bits per day. This is well within our capability today, but let's be optimistic and assume we are able to do it tomorrow (when our computers can get that big).
* Then, copy the neural activity for every neuron at every moment of the day from you into CloneMaker and keep a record of it. This will take up about 10^49 bits of storage per person (assuming we need to store every single one of those values), or roughly 6.4e37 bits in total for everyone on Earth, again assuming this can be done by tomorrow.
* Then, when you want to make a clone, you simply take the neural activity from CloneMaker and plug it into your body (or another person's) and presto! You have a conscious being. This is exactly what happens every time someone dreams, so they don't even know that this has happened before.

### Discussion:

This answer ignores the fact that in order to do this you would need access to the brain of the original person, and one could argue that if we knew exactly how a persons consciousness worked then we wouldn't be asking whether or not it was possible to clone people.

It means nothing to say a system is or isn't a quantum one.  If you want to describe a system with wavefunctions and quantum states, then you are describing it as being quantum.  You have to use the language of physics (quantum mechanics) to talk about how something behaves.  We don't expect that most everyday phenomena will be described by QM.

The standard view of consciousness is that it is a product of brain activity.

### Explanation:
We can also think about this in terms of the mind-body problem. The mind (or consciousness) arises from the physical body, because there isn't really any such thing as a nonphysical mental entity like "the soul." So the fact that people sometimes describe their own mind or consciousness is just a way to talk about the way they experience their brain and nervous system.
