(You know what's even weirder? Her screaming wasn't loud enough. And this isn't the first time this happened.)

[player]: "Why are you so loud?"

Mindy: (in pain) "It's nothing...just an old habit from giving birth."

[player]: "Huh? I don't see anything wrong with that!"

Mindy: "I didn't think it was a big deal either, until the first time happened. I was 12 when I started screaming so loudly whenever someone said the word 'loud'. That habit has followed me for many years, even though I can control myself now."

[player]: "Well, I guess that's just your body's reaction to giving birth."

Mindy: "I guess it is. So, what are you here for?"
