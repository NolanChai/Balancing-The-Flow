The first and second chapters of this report are about the operation of smoke and heat sensors. Smoke and heat sensors are used to detect fires in different places such as offices, factories or homes. In these places they can be fixed on a wall, ceiling or roof or even installed inside a ventilating system.

A smoke detector is an alarm that sounds when it detects smoke. The smoke detector has two basic types: ionization and photoelectric. Both of these types use a light beam to detect fire. In the case of ionization, a small amount of radioactive material is used as a source for the beam, which is broken up by the presence of smoke particles.

A heat sensor is an electronic device that senses changes in temperature and warns people about fire or overheating. There are many different types of heat detectors. These include infrared pyrometers (IR), thermal conductivity sensors (TCS) and thermo-sensitive resistive devices (RTDs). 

Infrared pyrometer is a detector that measures infrared radiation emitted from objects around it, and converts this information into an electrical signal. It detects the heat of a fire before smoke does by measuring temperature changes in its environment. Thermal conductivity sensors (TCS) work similarly to infrared pyrometers except they use electricity instead of light waves for their detection method. They measure changes in temperature using coils that contain water which turns into steam when heated past 100 Â°C . Finally , thermo-sensitive resistive devices (RTDs), also known as bimetallic strips , detect heat from flames through changes in resistance due to the expansion or contraction of metal strips caused by differences between room and object temperatures.

The third chapter is about automatic fire detection systems, which are used to detect fires in different places such as offices, factories and homes. An automated system for fire detection uses sensors that can detect smoke, heat and flames. Fire alarms are used in many buildings throughout the world because they alert people when there's a fire so they can be evacuated quickly before it gets out of control or causes any damage to property .

The fourth chapter is about conclusions of the report:

First conclusion: Automatic fire detection systems have been developed as a means of protecting buildings from fires, which can cause great losses of life and property. They are usually installed in high-rise buildings where it may take too long to evacuate the premises if a fire starts at night or during weekends when most people work on their computers and other electronic equipment without noticing any smoke coming out of them until later hours when they go back home after work . This is why automated fire detectors are used in offices as well as homes where people spend many hours each day working , sleeping or doing something else that requires concentration so if there's a fire it will be detected by the automatic system before any damage occurs.

Second conclusion: Automatic fire detection systems are now available for residential houses as well which can help families stay safe from fires even when they're not home . This type of sensor is especially useful because most people don't notice smoke coming out of their kitchen while cooking until it starts smelling strong enough to make them wake up and call 911 . Automated fire detection systems have become commonplace in many buildings , but there are still some places where they aren't used such as houses with no basements or attics due to the lack of space available for installing these devices.
