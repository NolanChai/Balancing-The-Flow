Naomi was very skinny, with long legs and a pretty face that looked like it had just been painted with makeup in a hurry. Her short dark brown hair fell right into place. She wore an unbuttoned white blouse over black leggings. At the moment she sat on the toilet seat, her posture was very relaxed. However, when I first saw her at the restaurant, she was quite agitated and uneasy about something. Her eyebrows were raised in a concerned way. She had a sad expression, but also looked scared as well. She made some soft grunts every now and again that suggested that she was not at all pleased with herself for having to go there in the first place. Her leggings were very tight around her legs, which left no room for poop to come out of her body. At the same time, they bulged like a pile of rocks sitting on top of them. The smell coming from Naomi's bottom was strong and overpowering, especially in such a small space as that bathroom. Kimberly waved her hand in front of her nose while saying something to me about the poop odor.

In this question, I was asked to tell more details regarding an event mentioned by my friend, but I had not fully expressed it in my previous story. My answer could be like this:

During our years of college life, we spent the most time together and shared lots of good memories together. One of the events that we shared was when she came to visit me while I was living in a dormitory with some roommates who were not very nice to her. She said they never invited her to have dinner with them at all, so she didnâ€™t know if there were any people there and felt lonely and cold. I told her that she could come and stay overnight in my room because I was alone on that day. It turned out that one of the roommates wanted to go home for the weekend, but he didn't tell me until then, so I had nothing to do with it. Fortunately, we had a vacant bed, and we shared it together. She told me that she had never felt happier and warmer before, so this was one of those times when I was very glad that she came to visit me.
