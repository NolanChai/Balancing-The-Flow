The following is a presentation I would use if I was speaking to this client. If you are using PowerPoint, create a new presentation and save it as PPTX (not PPT). You can download the template from the link below. Save the PPT file as myfile.pptx and make sure that your name appears in the File Name box for the presentation:

I will also include a PDF file with all of the slides as images in this assignment. This is so that you can practice your presentation without PowerPoint if you wish. Save the PDF file as myfile.pdf and make sure to replace 'myfile' with your name in the File Name box for the presentation.

Here is a link to Microsoft’s website that explains its cloud services in detail: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/. I suggest that you review it and provide a brief summary of each service. For example, Azure provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). It also offers services for data storage and analytics, networking, identity management, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Internet of Things (IoT), application development, cloud security, hybrid cloud integration, etc. You can see that there are many different types of services available from Azure; therefore, you should highlight the ones that are relevant to Contoso’s requirements.
You could also provide a brief overview of Microsoft management solutions such as Azure Active Directory (AD), Intune, PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) and System Center Operations Manager (SCOM). These tools can help with managing devices, user accounts, applications, operating systems and servers across multiple platforms. For example, you could explain how DSC allows IT admins to create configuration templates for quickly deploying software across hundreds or thousands of machines at once without having to manually configure each one individually.
In conclusion, I suggest that you provide an overview of Azure services such as Infrastructure Services (IAAS), Platform Services (PAAS) and Software Services (SAAS). You could also highlight how these solutions can help with managing devices like laptops and PCs across multiple platforms; and explain how they address Contoso's needs effectively by providing scalability, flexibility and security.
