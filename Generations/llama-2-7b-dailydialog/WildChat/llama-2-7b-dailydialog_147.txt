Celestine Weeks is a 49-year-old female with a history of severe head trauma suffered from a car accident 4 years ago that left her quadriplegic. She is able to use manual wheelchair, but she is dependent on ventilator support through a tracheostomy for her breathing. Celestine has limited ability to participate in social and professional life due to this dependency on mechanical ventilation.
Celestine suffers from multiple complications as a result of her severe head injury, including severe neurological impairments which affect her mobility and cognition. She has difficulty maintaining consciousness and has been unable to breathe independently since the accident due to damage to her brain stem that controls respiration. This is due in part to chronic seizures caused by swelling of the cerebrum, as well as trauma-induced bleeds on her brain that have left her unable to control her breathing and movement.

Celestine also suffers from severe spasticity which results in a permanent fixed flexion position at the neck, leaving her dependent on ventilation for life support. This chronic spasm is caused by traumatic injury as well as secondary to the severely restricted range of motion of her cervical spinal cord due to damage to the brainstem and spinal cord itself. Celestine also has a history of frequent upper-respiratory infections and pneumonia, which can lead to further complications with breathing if they occur.
