Alice: (to herself in labor pains) "Ahhhh, this hurts! I feel like my life is flashing before me!"

(The teacher looked at her for a bit. Then he picked up the phone.)

Teacher: "Hello 911? Yes, we're having an emergency in classroom A6. Could you send us an ambulance as soon as possible?"

(The teacher hung up and told Alice to stay calm while the paramedics arrived. They were rushing her to the hospital.)

Teacher: "Stay calm, Alice! The ambulances are on their way!"
