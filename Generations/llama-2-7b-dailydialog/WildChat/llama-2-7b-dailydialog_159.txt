Thank you very much for your interest and proposal! Our research is focused on synthesis of new 2D materials, their functionalization, application in catalysis. For the time being we do not have any funding possibilities to support your travels to our lab, but we will be glad if you could visit us as a visitor scientist. It would be great opportunity for you and it would allow us to cooperate on many issues related to your proposal.
We hope that you can find some possibilities for the financial support of your stay with us from another side. Our best wishes for good luck in finding funding!

We appreciate that this is an exciting research area, which we hope will eventually result in useful results. However, with regard to your question, it would be more efficient if you were to answer yourself and submit your response as a "draft".

Hi Xiaofei,

I am glad you find our proposal appealing. Your response is a very good start on your part and I look forward to reading more details about the proposed project. I have attached some guidelines for writing a successful proposal [here](https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/graduate-programs/grants-fellowships/national-goldwater-foundation-scholarship) as well as a list of materials that I would like you to have ready by the end of this week (Sunday, April 27).

I will be attending the Goldwater conference in Washington DC on May 13–15. If you have questions or are available to meet with me while there, please let me know. I will also be sending you my travel itinerary and will provide some information for you upon your arrival (i.e., where you can park).

Thanks again and best of luck in the Goldwater competition!

We will be happy to work with you on this project. I have a few questions about the scope and details so that we can ensure our efforts are aligned as closely as possible with your needs.

#### 1. Is your goal to develop and characterize a single nanosheet catalyst? Or are multiple catalytic sites of interest, and you want to be able to assess each site’s performance separately?

#### 2. Will the materials you will work with (i.e., CO2) be produced or collected in situ, or will they be provided by us? If in situ, please describe the environment(s) where we will produce and collect CO2 in order to develop the most appropriate catalyst.

#### 3. What types of performance metrics are you interested in measuring for your nanosheets (i.e., stability/life-time)? For example, if a single nanosheet is used as a heterogeneous catalyst, you will likely be more interested in the nanosheet’s durability and its capacity for CO2RR rather than the rate of carbon dioxide capture from a flow system.

#### 4. Will your nanosheets have any other functions besides CO2RR? If so, can you please provide some examples or details?

#### 5. What is your timeline for this project?

The most common methods are used to synthesize the nano sheets, which involves the use of electrochemical exfoliation (ECE) or mechanical exfoliation. These two approaches have been used extensively and they provide a convenient approach to produce high-quality monolayer nanosheets in large quantities. In particular, ECE is typically applied when graphene or other materials are readily soluble in solvents such as acids or bases. On the contrary, mechanical exfoliation can be used for most of the other 2D materials like MoS$_2$, BN, GaAs, etc.
