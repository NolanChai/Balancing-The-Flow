### Response:
<p>Dear Jane,</p><p></p><p>Thank you so much for your kind letter. We are truly honored and excited to have you officiate our wedding ceremony.</p><p></p><p>As I understand it, your goal as an officiant is to create a ceremony that is unique, meaningful, and memorable. This is something we definitely want in our special day. We would love for the ceremony to be personalized and reflective of who we are as a couple.</p><p></p><p>We have been together for eight years now and it's hard to imagine life without each other. We know that we will always have each other no matter what obstacles life throws our way, so we want to make sure that is reflected in the ceremony somehow. We were thinking of having a unity ritual where we mix water into wine or sand together.</p><p></p><p>We are both very spiritual people and we would like for our vows to reflect this. However, it's important to us that they be personal as well so that they really come from the heart and touch everyone involved in the ceremony.</p><p></p><p>We have never been married before so I don't think we will need to include any religious ceremonies or traditions into the wedding. We do want to make sure our officiant is familiar with our religion though because we would like them to be able to answer any questions that might come up during the ceremony.</p><p></p><p>Thank you again for writing us back so quickly! We look forward to hearing from you and learning more about you and how you can help us make our day perfect. Please let me know if there is anything else I can provide or answer in order for you to have all the information needed before we meet in person.</p><p></p><p>We are so excited that you will be officiating our wedding! We couldn't ask for a better officiant and are so lucky to have found someone like yourself who cares about making the day special for everyone involved. Thank you again and let us know how else we can help make this process easier for both of us.</p><p></p>

Thank you for your remarks and it is a blessing for us that our family and friends are here with us on this special day to celebrate our love for one another.  We look forward to spending the rest of our lives together.
