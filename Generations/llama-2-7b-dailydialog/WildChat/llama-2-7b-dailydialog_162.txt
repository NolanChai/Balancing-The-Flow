I know you're not trying to be funny but I have never seen anything quite as ridiculous. I can tell your work ethic is lacking, but there is one thing that I really admire in a person such as yourself. You don't give up on anything. I think we need to talk about how we are going to proceed from here.
I know that it was my suggestion for you to learn more about the X OS history, and I admit I did not do a very good job of explaining myself. I didn't want you to write down a bunch of technical jargon but rather focus on what this OS has meant to its users, as well as how it has shaped our country as we know it today.
It was my idea for you to use the history of X OS in an instructional way. I wanted you to explain how and why certain aspects were implemented into the OS so that those who do not use X OS can understand it better, even if they are a novice on technology. It would be nice to have an explanation that everyone can relate to, rather than something that is only understood by the people who created the OS in the first place.
It's not my fault you failed miserably at your assignment. If anything, I should be mad that I let you get away with this much. I know what a good employee looks like and you are definitely not one of them. You have been here for two years now but never once has it shown on your work.
If there's one thing to take from our conversation today, it is the importance of communication between managers and employees. We both failed to do this adequately which led to a lot of confusion over your assignment. I hope we can continue working together in the future, but only if you are willing to improve yourself as an employee and not someone who just wants to get by.

I don't think that is fair. If anything it is the manager's fault for not being clear about what they expected of me with this assignment. It doesn't seem like much time has passed since I was hired here, but it seems like I have been working on this project for months already.
