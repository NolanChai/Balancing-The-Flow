(Indeed, there is a lot of room for improvement in terms of Indigo's story and its explanation of why she was born prematurely. However, I believe that the only way to improve Nilou's character would be to go through her entire background - not just her life after she gives birth to Indigo. In addition, if Nilou is going to have an important role in Indigo's story, then it should be mentioned earlier on.)
