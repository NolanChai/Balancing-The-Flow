Alatreon: “This is it! This must be The Great Library. I bet this place is massive - and even has an amazing selection of books and games.”

(Alatreon enters The Great Library, which is a gigantic library with tall pillars on the side)

(Suddenly, Alatreon notices a mysterious shadow figure that seems to be following him. But then he realizes it’s just a shadow - and this particular shadow looks like a bipedal cyan elephant mascot, which is the same color as Coach Pickles)

Alatreon: “Huh? What’s that shadow? No… It’s just another one of those shadows. I’ve seen plenty of them since coming to Pinkton.” (Alatreon starts looking around for Sheriff Toadster. Meanwhile, Alatreon notices a large clock next to the doorway of The Great Library)

(The large clock has two gears that are moving. One gear is purple, while the other one is pink. There’s also an hourglass next to both gears)

Alatreon: “I wonder what time it is? Hey! That clock looks like a huge version of The Jester!”

(Suddenly, Alatreon hears some music being played on the piano located in front of The Great Library’s main entrance)

Piano Music: “Chopsticks” (The Pinkton Penguin Band plays “Chopsticks”)

Alatreon: “Ah! That must be Sheriff Toadster!”

(Sheriff Toadster walks out of the main entrance. He has a big smile on his face. And he also has his guitar slung over his shoulder - but this guitar is a pink one)

Alatreon: “Oh, hi! I’m Alatreon!”

Toadster: “Welcome to Pinkton. You’re probably wondering where your Mascot Starter Pack is.”

Alatreon: “Yes! And you must be Sheriff Toadster.”

Toadster: (Nods)

Alatreon: “Thank goodness - I finally found you after wandering around for ages!”

Toadster: “Wondering where your Mascot Starter Pack is? Well, it’s right there. Just take this map that has directions to the Great Library and the other locations around Pinkton.”

Alatreon: “Thanks! I guess I’ll go search for my Mascot Starter Pack now - but what about you?”

Toadster: “I have something to do.” (Sheriff Toadster walks through a door in the back of The Great Library. Alatreon then notices that Sheriff Toadster is wearing shoes)

(Alatreon looks at his map - and sees directions to a location called The Big Mouth Fountain, which is located next to The Big Pinkton Marketplace. And just like the name implies, there’s an enormous mouth in front of this fountain that’s pouring water out)

(Alatreon walks through another doorway - and sees a gigantic bookshelf with countless books on it, and also some arcade machines next to it. Alatreon notices a strange shadow figure near the corner of one of these arcade machines. And this particular shadow looks like a cobra mascot that’s a slightly lighter shade of purple than Queen Bouncelia)

(Alatreon looks at his map - and sees directions to another location called The Fashion Shop, which is located next to a place called The Gym. And just like the name implies, there are lots of clothes on display in this shop. But Alatreon notices an enormous pink clock near the back of the room)

(The large clock has one gear that’s moving - and it’s purple. There’s also a timer next to this particular gear)

Alatreon: “Hey! That looks like The Jester again!” (Suddenly, Alatreon notices a large mirror in the middle of the room, which is showing a reflection of him looking at his own reflection. And while staring at himself, Alatreon realizes he forgot to change into his mascot uniform)

(Alatreon walks up to one of these arcade machines. The screen displays an image of Sheriff Toadster’s guitar)

Alatreon: “Hmm… I wonder where Sheriff Toadster is right now.” (Suddenly, Alatreon sees a strange shadow figure that seems to be following him again. But then he realizes it’s just a shadow - and this particular shadow looks like Miss Luna)

(Alatreon walks up to another arcade machine. This time the screen displays an image of Coach Pickles)

Alatreon: “Hmm… I wonder where Coach Pickles is right now.” (Suddenly, Alatreon hears a familiar music box melody being played on this particular arcade machine - and it’s coming from Sheriff Toadster’s guitar. And the screen displays an image of Miss Luna)

Alatreon: “Wait… Is that Sheriff Toadster playing his guitar?! What’s he doing here?” (Alatreon sees a shadow figure on top of a bookshelf behind him - and it’s looking at Alatreon with interest. But then the shadow disappears)

(Alatreon walks up to another arcade machine. The screen displays an image of Silent Steve)

Silent Steve’s quote reads, “Shhhh… Let’s keep it down in here.”

Alatreon: “Oh my gosh! That’s Coach Pickles! What is he doing here? I thought mascots only go to The Gym during the weekend!”

(Suddenly, Alatreon sees a shadow figure next to the entrance door. This particular shadow looks like Miss Luna)

Alatreon: “Huh… I wonder what that shadow is doing here.” (Then Alatreon notices Sheriff Toadster walking back into The Fashion Shop. But he’s wearing a white shirt instead of his usual pink one, and he also has some sort of hat on)

Toadster: “Hi there! You must be Alatreon!”

Alatreon: (Nods)

Toadster: “We were wondering when you’d show up.”

(Suddenly, Sheriff Toadster stops and looks at something)

Toadster: “Uh… Is that you again?”

Alatreon: “Huh? What are you talking about? There’s no shadow here - just me.” (Sheriff Toadster starts walking back to The Fashion Shop. Alatreon notices some other people who are staring at him)

Toadster: “You should get changed into your mascot uniform before going out in public. Or else it could be a bit dangerous for you.” (Suddenly, Sheriff Toadster stops and looks at something again - this time he’s looking at Miss Luna’s shadow)

Toadster: “Oh goodness! You’re still here!”

(Alatreon notices the same mysterious shadow figure in front of him. This particular shadow seems to be trying to get Alatreon’s attention - and it looks like Coach Pickles)

Coach Pickles’ quote reads, “Come on, let’s get fit and pick up the pace!” (Alatreon starts walking out of The Fashion Shop when he notices a large pink clock with an hourglass next to it. And this particular clock looks like The Jester again)

Alatreon: “Hey! That looks like The Jester!” (Suddenly, Alatreon sees the same mysterious shadow figure that seemed to be following him earlier. But this time he’s wearing a pink top hat and blue shoes. And he also has his cymbals slung over one shoulder)

(Alatreon walks out of The Fashion Shop, and sees Sheriff Toadster waiting for him outside the door. He notices that Sheriff Toadster is wearing a white shirt instead of his usual pink one, but he’s still wearing a pink bow tie. And he also has some sort of hat on)

Alatreon: “What are you doing here, Sheriff Toadster?” (Sheriff Toadster nods in response)

Toadster: “We were wondering when you’d show up.”

(Just then, Alatreon sees a shadow figure that seems to be following him. But he realizes it’s just another one of those shadows - and this particular shadow looks like Miss Luna)

Alatreon: “Huh… I wonder what that shadow is doing here?” (Suddenly, the mysterious shadow figure that Alatreon was seeing earlier walks up to him. And it’s wearing a pink top hat
