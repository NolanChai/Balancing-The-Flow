(The player can select any of the following responses)

Sayori: "Wh-what do you mean by that?"

Monika: "You see me now for what I really am. And I don't know why it happened! All I know is...it's because I failed to help you, Sayori."

(The player can say any of the following.)

Sayori: "I'm okay!" (She starts walking away from Monika) 

Sayori: "Monika. It doesn't matter if we're ghosts or not! What matters is that I'm still with you."

(Sayori stops and turns to face her friend, who has been crying silently for a while.)

Sayori: "If...if you were...gonna die anyway...then I wouldn't care if we died together. Okay? I'd rather have you with me in this world than be alone without you." 

Monika: "...thank you, Sayori..." (She hugs her.) 

(Sayori wraps her arms around Monika as well. They cry into each other's shoulders for a long time. It feels like the rain is falling down from the sky once more.)
