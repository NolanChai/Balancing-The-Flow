Valefor: “Mindy! What happened? Are you okay?”

Mindy: (sniffles) “I…I’m fine. I think.”

Valefor: (concerned) “You don’t sound so sure.”

Mindy: “It’s just a bit uncomfortable, that’s all.”

Valefor: “What happened?”

Mindy: “I was flying around in the woods and suddenly I felt light-headed. My wings began to feel heavy and I couldn’t control my speed at all - it was like everything went haywire on me.”

Valefor: “Did you hit anything? You seem fine, but maybe you suffered some internal damage?”

Mindy: “No…I don’t think so. I just landed and I’m not sure what happened after that…it felt like everything was moving in slow motion.”

Valefor: “Well, if it makes you feel any better, I was also feeling a bit light-headed before we woke up.”

Mindy: (shocked) “Really? But how is that possible?”

Valefor: “I don’t know. I tried to ask the others what they think but it seems like they all fell asleep at once and now they won’t respond when I call them.”

Mindy: “Well, perhaps it’s just a coincidence.”

(Just then, Ifrit comes running in.)

Ifrit: “Valefor! Mindy! We need to get back inside. There’s something wrong with the energy here!”

Valefor: (shocked) “What? What do you mean?”

Ifrit: “There seems to be some kind of corrupted energy in this area - it feels like a sickness. We all felt it before we fell asleep, but I don’t know what’s causing it.”

Mindy: (concerned) “Shouldn’t we tell Bahamut? He might be able to help us.”

Ifrit: “Yeah, good point. We should let him in on this.”

(Valefor and Mindy both run back into the cavern with Ifrit.)

Bahamut: (concerned) “What’s wrong? Is there something I can help you with?”

Ifrit: (shaking his head) “No, we don’t think so. We just felt a bit light-headed and dizzy before falling asleep.”

Bahamut: “Dizzy…hmmm. That could be the cause of the disturbance in the energy - some sort of sickness. I know we are all susceptible to it, but Valefor seems particularly vulnerable. Do you two feel anything different?”

Valefor: (nervously) “Not really. My wings are still weak and dizzy, but that’s about it.”

Ifrit: “I don’t think we have any external injuries either. We just slept through the night like normal.”

Bahamut: “Hmmm…I suppose I can try casting some spells to see if they affect you in any way. Let me get my magic book.” (he goes off to find it.)

(Mindy flies up into the air, watching as Bahamut casts a few spells on Valefor and Ifrit.)

Bahamut: “Okay, this one should do something.” (casts a spell)

Ifrit: “Whoa!” (he jumps up in the air - but he doesn’t fall down as expected. He just stays suspended in place!)

Valefor: (nervously) “What is going on? Is this Bahamut’s doing?”

Bahamut: “I don’t think so. Let me try again.” (casts a different spell)

Ifrit: (falls to the ground, groaning in pain) “Ow ow ow! That hurt!”

Valefor: (shocked) “What did you do?”

Bahamut: “I’m not sure…perhaps something happened when I was casting that last spell. But don’t worry - we’ll find a way to fix this.”

(Mindy flies down and lands on the ground beside Ifrit.)

Mindy: (concerned) “What should we do now? Bahamut can’t seem to help us.”

Ifrit: “I don’t know, but I think we need to stay here until we figure out what’s going on. This sickness is affecting more than just Valefor.”
