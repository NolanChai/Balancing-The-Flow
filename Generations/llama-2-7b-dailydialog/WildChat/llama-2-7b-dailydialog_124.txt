Hi. I'm Lita Cabellut and thank you for coming in to talk about my work.

### Interviewer: 
I think we should start off by telling our readers a little bit more about yourself and how you got into art in the first place.

### Response:
Well, I grew up in Spain but I moved around a lot when I was young, so I ended up living in many different countries such as Italy, England, America and Germany. After leaving school I went to London and studied at St Martin's School of Art from 1984-5, which is where I got into painting portraits for the first time.

### Interviewer: 
How do you decide what to paint? Do you choose your subjects or does it come more organically in the form of an idea?

### Response:
I usually start with a photograph, but then I make changes as I'm painting until they're no longer recognisable. The original image becomes something else in my head and this is what I paint. For example, the first time I saw that photo of David Bowie, it made me think about his personality, which is very interesting to me because he is an icon who has changed so much throughout his career.

### Interviewer: 
How do you choose your subjects? Are there any celebrities or people in particular you like to paint?

### Response:
I'm interested in all kinds of people, famous and otherwise. I used to make drawings on the tube but nowadays everyone is always looking at their phones so it feels like a different time. However, one day recently someone got up and asked if she could look at my work, which made me really happy because that's what art is all about.

### Interviewer: 
Your paintings can often take months or even years to complete, how do you keep yourself motivated when the process drags on?

### Response:
It helps if I have other projects on the go at the same time so that I don't get bored. Also, every day there are new developments in my work and it always keeps me excited.

### Interviewer: 
Do you ever find your subject staring back at you from the canvas?

### Response:
Yes! But sometimes it can feel like an intrusion because I'm not sure whether they are looking into my mind or if they think that I'm making fun of them. I always get really nervous when I talk to my sitters afterwards because I don't want to upset them by revealing something that they didn't intend for the painting to say.

### Interviewer: 
What is your process like? Do you start with a sketch or do you just go straight into working on canvas?

### Response:
I always work from life but sometimes I also draw from photographs and these are often used as reference points. If I need to capture something more accurately, then I might use them too. However, for the most part, my paintings are done in a single sitting so it's important that they turn out right first time around!

### Interviewer: 
How do you choose the colours and materials with which to work? Do these help you achieve your desired effect on canvas?

### Response:
The material I use depends on what I am trying to convey. For example, if it's a dark image then I might use thick paint so that it has more impact but if it's a lighter image then maybe thin washes would work better with the lightness of the subject matter. Also, sometimes I will put down multiple layers before finishing off any one particular part because this adds depth and helps me achieve my desired effect on canvas!

### Interviewer: 
Can you tell us about your exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts last year? It was hugely popular with many people visiting to see it. What did you think about that experience in particular?

### Response:
The show at the Royal Academy of Arts was a huge success and I'm very grateful to everyone who came along to see my work! The response has been overwhelmingly positive so far but there are still two months left until it closes so there is plenty more time for people to come visit me.

### Interviewer: 
What are your plans for the future? Any new projects that you're working on or want us all to know about?

### Response:
I have a few exciting ideas in mind but I don't want to say too much just yet as I need time to work through them first. However, if any of your readers would like an update then please feel free to contact me and ask!
