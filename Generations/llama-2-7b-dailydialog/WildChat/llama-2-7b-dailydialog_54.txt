memorization is not always necessary. For example, when we are asked a question during a quiz or test and need to recall what we know at that moment, memorizing may be helpful. However, it does not guarantee success in your long-term memory.

It is widely believed that memorisation is an effective way of learning, which has been proven by a lot of studies and has been practiced for many centuries.  However, there are some flaws in this assumption because memory is not perfect as it often fails to recall information accurately. Moreover, the brain can only store so much information at once. Hence, if too much information is given at one time, most of them will be forgotten in the short term. As a result, memorisation may cause students to cram and forget what they have learnt in a short period of time. In addition, memorising facts often fails to encourage students to develop critical thinking skills as they tend to stick only to specific information instead of trying to connect it with other knowledge.  Therefore, although memorisation can help improve short term memory, it may not be an effective way for long-term retention and is not always the best solution for learning.

The myth of memorization has been prevalent throughout human history. However, it is only recently that researchers have shown that memorization alone does not lead to true understanding. In fact, there is a growing consensus among educators and experts in the field of learning sciences that mastering content requires more than just memorizing facts; students need to understand why things happen as they do.  This is especially important for mathematics because many mathematical concepts are abstract or require multiple steps before an answer can be reached (such as fractions). In order for students to fully comprehend these ideas, it helps if they first see how these concepts work in practice by doing exercises or manipulating objects rather than just memorizing formulas and definitions.  This way, when faced with similar problems later on down the line, learners will remember how their solutions were derived from scratch instead of relying solely on rote learning strategies like memorization alone would provide them with.

the learning myth "memorization is the key to successful learning" has been widely believed for a long time, however, there are lots of evidences proving that this viewpoint does not work well. the following passage will show you that memorizing without understanding it can cause negative results in our study: 

<p style="text-align: justify; direction: ltr"><em>Some educators believe that students learn best by simply memorizing and repeating material, while others believe that students learn more effectively if they understand the material and are able to apply the knowledge. Research has shown that many of these beliefs about what is good learning are simply myths. For example, it was once believed that only the top 5 percent of a class had the ability to go on to college. Many high schools were set up to channel all but this small percentage of students into blue-collar jobs and vocational training. It took decades for educators to realize that nearly every child has potential for higher education, if it is properly nurtured. Similarly, many believe that a person learns better by simply memorizing facts and repeating material back than he or she does by trying to understand the ideas behind those facts.</em></p>

as the passage said, many people think that we will learn more effectively through memorization, however, it has been proved that memorization can only help us achieve some results in the short term. because of this, most of the knowledge is forgotten after a while. if you want to learn something permanently and use it for life, then you should understand it deeply and apply it.

the following passage illustrates how effective learning takes place: 

<p style="text-align: justify; direction: ltr"><em>“Learning by heart” has never been a very good method of teaching, though it is one that many teachers are tempted to use because they think the pupils like it. It certainly makes them more “lively” and even helps some of them to do well in examinations; but what does this achievement amount to? The memory is not the mind itself: it is merely a place where the mind puts things down while waiting for better accommodation. If we are only learning by heart, then we have nothing left when we can no longer “say our lessons.” This method of learning, too, produces some good results in the short run and poor ones in the long. </em></p>

from the passage above, it can be seen that many teachers would choose to use memorization as a way of teaching because they think it makes pupils lively and even helps them do well in examinations. however, we should bear in mind that "learning by heart" is not an effective method of learning. if we want to learn something permanently and apply it for life, then the method of understanding and applying what you've learned are better than memorization.

### Evidence:

the following passage will show you a more accurate position on how to achieve successful learning: 

<p style="text-align: justify; direction: ltr"><em>If students try to learn only by memorizing, they may have excellent short term recall but their long-term memory is likely to be less than satisfactory. In addition, when these students are asked questions that require the application of concepts rather than rote memory, they often do not know what to answer and look blankly at the questioner or ask for a clue. They cannot think because they have no background knowledge of the subject. </em></p>

as we can see from the passage above, students who try to learn by memorization are likely to fail in long-term memory. because of this, learning through memorization is not good enough when you want to study something permanently and apply it for life. what's more, many people think that students will have better understanding if they learn through memorization and then use the knowledge in examinations. however, this method may cause problems like "cramming", which means we study all the information before an examination, but don't remember it afterward.

the following passage shows us a more effective way of learning: 

<p style="text-align: justify; direction: ltr"><em>Understanding and application are the keys to long term retention. It is important for students to understand how things work, why they do what they do, and how to apply that knowledge in many different situations. Once you know how and when to use a concept or principle, then it becomes easier to remember these concepts over time. </em></p>

from the above passage, we can see that understanding is the key to successful learning. once people understand why things happen and what they're used for, they will have better long-term memory as well as deeper understanding. however, many students still choose to learn by memorization. in this case, they may achieve some results in examinations but fail in life afterward when it comes to using the knowledge.

### Conclusion:

in conclusion, memorizing is not an effective method of learning because it can cause problems like "cramming" and failure in long-term memory. moreover, people who try to learn through memorization do not know what to answer when they are asked questions that require the application of concepts rather than rote memory. therefore, we should choose a better way of learning, which is understanding and applying things we've learned instead of memorizing them.

### Recommendations:

the following passage will give you practical recommendations logically based on your conclusion: 

<p style="text-align: justify; direction: ltr"><em>There are several ways in which the teacher can help students to understand and apply their knowledge. First, when giving a lecture or other form of instruction, the instructor should relate what he is teaching to current events and examples from real life whenever possible. This will make it easier for the student to relate what he/she has learned to his own life. </em></p>

the above passage tells us that there are several ways in which teachers can help students understand and apply their knowledge, such as by relating what they teach with current events or examples from real life. if we use these methods in teaching, it will be easier for students to remember what they've learned and more importantly, they can apply this knowledge to their own lives.

### Conclusion (2):

the learning myth "memorization is the key to successful learning" has been widely believed for a long time, however, there are lots of evidences proving that this viewpoint does not work well. the following passage will show you that memorizing without understanding it can cause negative results in our study:
