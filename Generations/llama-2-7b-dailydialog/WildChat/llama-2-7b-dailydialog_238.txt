переведи на русский As a result of experiments conducted at the Research Institute for Agriculture Technology (RITA) of the Ministry of Agricultural Development and Water Management of Uzbekistan on improving the efficiency of chemical fertilizers using PAW, it was found that the use of PAW has great potential as an alternative to chemical fertilizers.
In order to increase yields in crop production, the application of various organic and mineral fertilizers is widely used in agricultural production. These methods provide a high yield due to increased soil fertility and soil moisture retention, but they also have drawbacks: they are not always effective when applied in large amounts (especially mineral) and are harmful to the environment. In this regard, there is a need for innovative technologies that use organic matter more efficiently, so as to reduce the negative environmental impact of chemical fertilizers on agriculture.
In order to assess the effectiveness of using PAW in wheat crops in Uzbekistan, an experiment was conducted at the experimental field of the RITA Ministry of Agricultural Development and Water Management of Uzbekistan on increasing yields in crop production. In 2019–2021, as a result of experiments conducted using PAW solutions (at the rate of 30 kg/ha) to irrigate wheat fields with low electrical conductivity (57 and 62 mS/cm), the yield of grain increased by 2.5% compared to the control group in which no PAW was applied. In addition, at the same time, the amount of nitrate-nitrogen decreased by about 10%.
