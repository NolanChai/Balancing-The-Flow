Write a Day 2 script for Araneas's father.

(Characters: Araneas’s father, [player])

(Scene: Spider den - day)

(Araneas is already 9 months pregnant with 1000 sons and daughters at the moment of meeting her father - while Mindy has only just given birth to all of her babies. Vanessa’s labor began approximately an hour earlier.)

(Araneas’s father is a human, [player] is a human as well)

(Shortly before Mindy gave birth to all 2000 of her babies, Araneas and Vanessa had been chatting with each other for roughly half an hour - while Mindy was busy with her own labor. After meeting Araneas’s father, they begin talking again)

(The day would actually start with the sisters beginning to talk about Mindy giving birth to all 2000 of her babies)

You're in labor! You have a child on the way!

Hi Vanessa, I hope you feel a little bit better today! You know that I would do anything to make this situation easier for you. Is there any way we can cheer you up? Maybe go out on the town or something? I don't want you to be so sad anymore! What about it?
