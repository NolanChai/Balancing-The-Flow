<p>Jane and her two friends are on their way back home when they spot that a girl has just been pulled over by a police car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <u>Jane:</u> What happened to her? She was speeding. I can't believe she got arrested.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <u>Tina:</u> It must be terrible for the girl. You know how much it sucks having a record, right?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <u>Jane:</u> Yeah but I don't think she was too fast.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <u>Tina:</u> Well what if they put her in jail? Wouldn't that be a nightmare for her?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <u>Jane:</u> Maybe. But she'll still be alive when she gets out.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <u>Tina:</u> Well I know this girl, she got pulled over for speeding once and they actually did arrest her but then the judge gave her a break and didn't send her to jail. He let her off with just community service.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p> <u>Jane:</u> Oh well I hope that happens to her. She looks like she couldn't hurt anyone.</p>
