                            [1]: I love the cute dog in this prompt! I think it's very imaginative to create a scene where a cute puppy is sitting on a grassy field under a clear blue sky, with a colorful collar, captured by a Nikon D750 camera, 50mm lens, shallow depth of field. The composition focused on the dog's face is very interesting and I can't wait to see what Midjourney AI will create!
                            [2]: Your use of imagery in this prompt is incredible! It paints a picture of a beautiful women sipping coffee in a vintage cafe. The composition focused on the woman's face and hands, reminiscent of a painting by Leonardo da Vinci. I can imagine what Midjourney AI will create based on your description.
