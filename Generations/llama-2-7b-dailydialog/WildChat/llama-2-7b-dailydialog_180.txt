* What a great script! You can improvise it as you like. I would recommend taking it slow because the build up is essential. Get them relaxed, then hypnotized and then have fun! It's a good idea to keep this short - about 4-5 minutes max with plenty of room for audience interaction. The more fun they are having, the better the experience will be for you too!
* This is an excellent script because it contains all of the elements that make hypnosis exciting and entertaining for everyone involved: a great story (David falls into a deep trance), role reversal (the victim becomes the master), humour, teasing, and audience participation. There are many ways you can approach this script to vary the experience depending on what your goal is with the group. You could use it as a stand-alone induction and hypnotize a different volunteer each time or use it as an ice breaker at the beginning of your show before diving in deep for a more structured session. If you plan to do this, start off by having someone from the audience who is very responsive take part - that way the entire group gets into it and won't be afraid to participate once they see how much fun others are having!
