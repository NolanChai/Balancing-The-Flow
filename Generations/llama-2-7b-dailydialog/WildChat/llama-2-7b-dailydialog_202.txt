1. Introduce yourself first with name and where you are from to the rest of the group
2. Ask each person to introduce themselves and their nationality to the whole group
3. Encourage everyone to share a piece about what they think about your country as well as theirs (Their culture, food, customs)
4. Do not speak over others during conversations or interrupt others when they are speaking, be patient and respectful with people's comments
5. Introduce yourself in the national language of that specific region to show you are willing to communicate even if it is through a translator
6. Use gestures and eye contact while speaking to convey your thoughts and understanding
7. Use slang terms and phrases only when necessary so as not to offend others (Including non-verbal cues)
8. If there is a conflict, discuss the issue with everyone rather than going behind each person's back or being disrespectful towards them
9. Ask questions about the culture of other countries and learn more about their habits
10. Show your willingness to learn new languages by asking people what they know in another language so that you can practice speaking it with them (This will also help you communicate better)
11. Include everyone in conversations instead of just focusing on those who speak the same language as you or are from similar backgrounds

* Greet people at the door. Ask them if they have any dietary restrictions or other preferences. * Have a table reserved for each member of the group, and distribute snacks so that everyone knows what to expect. 
* Bring a sign-up sheet so that everyone can put down their names ahead of time. Then when it is time to eat, they don't have to say anything to get their food. * Ask people if there is anything that you should know about them before the meal. * Remind people that this is not just a social gathering; we are here to discuss business as well. 
* Let everyone take turns talking and listening. It might be useful to set up some ground rules at the beginning of the meeting, such as not interrupting people while they're speaking, or only asking one question per person. 
* If someone doesn't want to speak in front of the group, don't force them to do so. You can always have a private conversation with that person afterward if you need more information from them about an issue being discussed at meeting time! 
* Try not to dominate conversations by talking too much yourself. Ask people who seem shy if they want to say anything before moving on to another topic or letting someone else take over speaking duties for a while." * Let everyone have their turn, even if it means interrupting someone else's monologue! 
* Don't get stuck in small talk all evening; this is not an excuse for chitchat-time only. You might want to use icebreakers or other ways of getting people involved right away so that they feel comfortable enough with each other before moving on to more serious topics. * Make sure that everyone knows what kind of food will be served and when it's being served! 
* If there are any problems at all during the meal (like someone not liking what was offered), try your best not to make them feel bad about it or embarrassed in front of their friends/family members who may have been invited as well." * Be sure that everyone has something good to eat before moving on with the agenda items! 
* Let people know that you're available if they want any help with anything related specifically toward their particular group project or event (which will likely take up most of our time). If someone does have an issue while eating though, don't let it ruin things for everyone else who came out today!" 
* Be polite! Even if you don't like what was said during the meeting itself - be professional and respectful at all times so that people will want to come back again next time around." * Always thank your guests afterward - even though they may not have enjoyed their meal as much as we hoped! 
* Remind everyone about next week's meeting date before they leave. This way, there won't be any confusion about who needs to bring what when." 
### Assessment:
* What would you do if someone started eating your food? * How do you feel about being asked questions in front of a group without warning? * Have you ever been asked to speak up for yourself before? * Would you rather have people talk amongst themselves or just listen quietly while others talk? 
### Follow Up:
* What did you learn today? * What will be different next time around after this experience?
