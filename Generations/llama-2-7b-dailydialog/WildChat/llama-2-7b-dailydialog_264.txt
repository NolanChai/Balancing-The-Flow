the answer to your question is no. Motherhood is one of the most important stages in our lives, yet it is also one of the more challenging ones because we need to find balance between motherhood and being a good mother which includes caring for oneself first. The fact that mothers are able to put their children's needs ahead of themselves without feeling guilty about this does not mean they are narcissists - it just means they know how much better off their kids will be if mum takes care of herself too!
