Christian Vaughn (Stacy Simmons): Stay away from me Christian! I don't like you!

Tommy Rollins (Selina Morano): Hello Selina, it is nice to meet you! Let's go on a date sometime?

Billy Turner (Valentina Miller): Hey there, Valentina. What are you interested in? We should get together and workout. Maybe we can find an extra hour in your schedule for me to come over after work? You could maybe help me with my gymnastics! I need some serious core workouts and a few tricks would be really cool.

Stacy Simmons (Billy Turner): Hi Billy, nice meeting you too. We should definitely talk more about training together.

Selina Morano (Tommy Rollins): Hey Tommy, I think we're going to be good friends. Would you like to go out for drinks after the gym tonight?

Valentina Miller (Christian Vaughn): Hi Christian, how are ya doing? Nice meeting you too. Are you interested in anything besides boxing and kickboxing? I think it would really help our training if we all do some other workouts to give us a break from the monotony of our regular routines.

Christian Vaughn (Valentina Miller): Hey Valentina, that's not very nice of you! What's wrong with me anyways? I just don't like your style. It is too "Girly" for my taste and you know what they say...

Selina Morano (Stacy Simmons): Christian has a point Stacey. We need to be open minded about our training styles. You are always talking about how we should all come in and practice our "Kata". It's not that I don't think it is important, but why do you spend so much time on the same things?
Stacy Simmons (Christian Vaughn): Fine! We can workout with each other. I just wish you would be a little more open minded.

Billy Turner (Valentina Miller): I think that we should all learn something new from one another. It will help us to learn our strengths and weaknesses better so that we can continue to grow in this field of training.

Tommy Rollins (Stacy Simmons): I agree with Billy. We need to get into the gym together and learn a few new skills! I think it will make each one of us even more complete martial artists when we are done with our training.

Selina Morano (Billy Turner): Great idea, Tommy! What do you think Christian? Would you be interested in joining us for some sparring and kata? Or maybe some jiu-jitsu techniques or wrestling? I would love to workout with you and learn a few new moves.
Christian Vaughn (Tommy Rollins): No thanks! We can talk about this later, but I have been thinking that it would be a good idea if we all came in together and worked on our grappling styles. Do you think that would be okay with everyone? I really don't want to offend anybody or cause any problems so just let me know how you feel about it.
Billy Turner (Selina Morano): That is a great idea Christian! We all need some new training techniques in our arsenal and working together will help us all become better fighters. What do you guys think?
Valentina Miller (Tommy Rollins): I agree with both of you, we should definitely come in and work on our grappling styles together.
Christian Vaughn (Billy Turner): Great! We can all meet up tomorrow morning and talk about what techniques we would like to focus on for the next few weeks before we go back to fighting each other. Sound good?
Selina Morano (Valentina Miller): Sounds great, Christian. Let's get together after our workouts this evening so that everyone can have an opportunity to share their thoughts about what they would like us to focus on for the next few weeks before we return back into fighting each other. What do you think, Tommy?
Tommy Rollins (Billy Turner): Yeah! That sounds like a great idea and I will see you guys after our workouts this evening. Thanks again Christian for making me feel more welcome at your gym than anyone else here has ever done before today! I really appreciate it.
Stacy Simmons (Tommy Rollins): No problem Tommy, I am always open to new ideas and trying something different if it will help improve my skills in the future. By the way...I think we are going to have a lot of fun together too! Let's go! We need to get out there and start training!
