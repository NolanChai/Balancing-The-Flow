We chose to use the 'Perspective Ident' in our fake case study film because we liked the idea that the brand was already using the new motion control camera style before the official launch. It gave us an idea to use this technique as a way to reveal what the Christmas 2003 would be like for Channel 4, and then also to have one TV being on in each of the channel's four main genres: Comedy, Drama, Film and Arts.

We felt that this was the best idea as we wanted to showcase that a Channel 4 Christmas would not only be filled with quality viewing, but it will also feature Channel 4's well known sense of humour and quirkiness. We used 'Comedy' first as an example of this because it's something that most people associate with the channel.

By the time we got to 'Arts', we could see that there was a connection between each genre as we were using the same motion control camera move in them all, and then by the end it felt like the four genres had come together as one in the form of one TV being on and showing the Christmas ident.

### Commentary:
We used the Channel 4 'Perspective Ident' to showcase what the new brand was going to look like. This allowed us to have a good insight into what the rebrand would be, before it launched in January 2004, and we felt that this was important as it helped us come up with our idea for our case study.

We had a number of ideas which ranged from using an ident as a background image on one TV being on to using just the 'Perspective Ident' as a way of revealing what the new channel would be like, but we eventually settled on the idea that we liked most: Using the 'Perspective Ident' to reveal one TV being on in each genre and then have all these TV's come together by the end.

We felt this was important because it showcased the four genres of Channel 4 without giving away too much about what the rebrand would look like, so that viewers were kept interested until January when the new brand launched on-air for real.
