It is becoming a trend in many developed countries that people are choosing to adopt a healthier lifestyle. I believe there are several causes behind this change, and the government should also play an active role in encouraging their citizens to be more health-conscious by implementing certain policies.

It is true that there has been a significant shift in public attitude towards physical well-being as evidenced by increased attention given to eating healthy food and exercising regularly. I believe there are many reasons behind this trend but the main ones are that people are becoming more aware about how their lifestyles can affect their overall health, and also because of a growing concern over the high cost of medical treatments in the modern world.

Hi dear ,  I think you are going to achieve a very high Band Score , but as an expert IELTS tutor with many years of experience in teaching IELTS , I would like to point out that your writing contains too much repetition .  Try using different words or expressions .  Also, try not to use too much general information , especially at the beginning and end of your essay . You should aim for more specific statements in your writing .  The IELTS examiner will notice if you don't do this . Finally, make sure that you get rid of all spelling mistakes and grammatical errors from your essay . It is important to proofread your writing at least 20 times before submitting it . I hope these tips are useful for you. Good luck!

The following are my suggestions for the above paragraph.

*   You should use a stronger word such as “to be” in place of “is”. For instance, “Low pay and low status are not good enough to keep workers happy.” is more expressive than “Low pay and low status are not good enough to make people happy.”
*   Please add “of” to the following phrase. “Most of employees can’t accept this type of working condition”.
*   Add some other details such as the number, location or percentage. For instance, “This is also a common trend for over 60 percent workers in China.” would be better than “this is also a common phenomenon among Chinese workers”.
*   Please replace the word “workers” with another one because it is repeated several times within the paragraph.
