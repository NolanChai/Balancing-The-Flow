Level: Night Club

Boss: Christiano Valentino

Christiano is wielding a pistol, and has taken cover behind a pool table. He fires a shot at James, but misses. The bullet ricochets off the wall behind him and hits his secretary Ying who takes a bullet for her boss.

James continues through the room until he reaches Christiano again, this time his twin secretary Yang steps forward to help him in the fight. With both of them working together as a team they try to stop James from advancing further into the bar. The twins use their Triangle Choke attack to immobilize James for a few seconds before he escapes and continues down the hallway.

Ying and Yang follow closely behind him, but not before Yang spots his boss's pistol and grabs it from off of the pool table. She then fires at James in an attempt to stop him from reaching her brother. He dodges the shot and continues forward, the twins fall back behind him to wait for their next move.

James turns left into a doorway that leads out onto the street where he sees his taxi driver waiting with the engine running and the doors open. Before jumping in he takes one more look back at the club where Yang is still firing at him from inside. He then jumps into the car as it drives off into the night.
