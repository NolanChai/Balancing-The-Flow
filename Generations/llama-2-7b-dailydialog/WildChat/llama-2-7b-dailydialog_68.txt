Thank you for the kind invitation. I am sorry to inform that it would be impossible for me attend your year-end party due to other business commitments on that date, and hope that you will understand my situation. Please let me know if there is anything I can do for you.

Thank you for the invitation. I am sorry that we are not able to accept this invitation but would like to attend your next event instead. It's on our schedule and we hope we will be able to see everyone then. We look forward to seeing you there!

We appreciate you sending us the invitation for our year-end party. Unfortunately, I can not accept it as I have another commitment that day but hopefully I'll be able to make it next year instead if it is still going on.
