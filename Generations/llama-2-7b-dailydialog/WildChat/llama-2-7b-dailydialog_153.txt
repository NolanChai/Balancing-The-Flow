No, it won't change color in your picture. Instead of that, when you expose your scene properly for a mid-gray object like that, any colors in your image will be accurately reproduced in their original saturated form (assuming you don't add too much contrast). This is the key advantage of correctly exposing your images; they will look good on the web, and they'll also look great when printed.
