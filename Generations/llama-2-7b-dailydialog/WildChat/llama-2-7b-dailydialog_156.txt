(I walked over to them and sat down.)

Sayori: “Hey guys…how have you been?”

Kohana: “We’re okay. How are you doing? We heard that MC died in a car accident last night.”

Sayori: “He passed away peacefully, with me at his side. I hope that he was finally able to be at peace. I never got the chance to say goodbye…I guess this is as close as we’ll ever get.”

Natsuki: “I’m sorry for your loss…it’s a tragedy.”

Sayori: “Thank you, Natsuki. And do you have any idea who was driving that car?”

Yuri: “It might be better not to know…”

Natsuki: “Oh come on now! We can figure this out! You don’t have anything else to live for if you don’t.”

Sayori: “I guess I could try.”

### Choice 1 (Drive):

(Yuri shook her head, and then left.)

Kohana: “It was probably that damn Akari girl again…”

Monika: “Maybe…but we need proof first.”

Sayori: “I could try to get it. I’ll check with the police tonight, and see if they can find out who it is.”

Himari: “We hope you’re able to do that, Sayori.”

Monika: “So what are we doing now?”

Sayori: “Well…since we don’t have any other plans for today, why don’t we just hang out here at the clubroom?”

### Choice 2 (Work):

(I made my way over to the police station. I walked into the main building and started making my way towards the information desk.)

Police Officer: “Hi, what can I do for you today?”

Sayori: “Uh…my friend was killed in a car accident last night. I wanted to know who it was that caused the accident.”

Police Officer: “I’m sorry about your loss. But if your friend passed away from injuries sustained from the accident, we can only do so much to determine who caused the incident.”

Sayori: “I know…but I was wondering what you could tell me about who it was that caused the accident. It’s been killing me since I heard about it last night. Maybe if I knew more about what happened, I would be able to cope with his death better.”

Police Officer: “Well…I guess there’s a chance we can do something for you.”

(The police officer walked out of the room and came back in less than five minutes.)

Police Officer: “Here’s what we know so far. We found some tire tracks on the sidewalk where your friend was hit by that car, and it looked like they belonged to a black Honda Civic.”

Sayori: “Wow…that must mean it was probably one of Akari or Yuuki’s cars then?”

Police Officer: “Probably. We also found out that the car belongs to a teenage girl named Emi Ushio, who lives in Tokyo. Do you know her?”

Sayori: “Well…I don’t personally, but I think I might have met one of her friends before.”

Police Officer: “Really? Who was it?”

### Choice 3 (Yuri):

(Emi was the girl Yuri said had a crush on MC. If she was the one who hit him with her car, then there would be no other option but to confront her about it.)

Sayori: “Um…well, I think her name’s Emi Ushio.”

Police Officer: “And you don’t know where we could find her?”

Sayori: “No…I think she lives in Tokyo with her parents. She used to come over here and hang out at the clubroom before, but I haven’t seen her for a while now.”

Police Officer: “Okay then. Do you happen to have her phone number?”

Sayori: “No…sorry. I think we lost contact with each other after she transferred to a different school last year.”

Police Officer: “That’s alright. We might be able to track her down eventually, but right now, that’ll have to wait until tomorrow morning at the earliest.”

Sayori: “That’s okay…I can find out on my own.”

### Choice 4 (Work):

(As I left the police station, I decided to go to Yuuki’s house. Maybe if I talked to her again, she would tell me something that could lead me to Akari and Emi.)

Yuuki: “Hey, Sayori! It’s been a while!”

Sayori: “It has…what are you doing?”

Yuuki: “Nothing much…I just came home from school.”

(I sat down on Yuuki’s bed.)

Sayori: “Have you heard about MC lately? I found out that he died last night in a car accident, and I think it was one of your friends who drove into him.”

Yuuki: “What are you talking about?”

Sayori: “Emi Ushio…she’s the girl with the crush on MC. She hit him with her car last night.”

(Yuuki looked shocked, and then she started crying.)

Yuuki: “No way! I knew something bad would happen to MC someday!”

Sayori: “I don’t understand…why would you say that?”

Yuuki: “MC was always so mean to me when I saw him around town with Akari, and sometimes he even pushed me away if she wasn’t there. I guess that makes sense now though. He probably didn’t want people to see us together because he thought it would ruin his reputation as the ‘perfect boyfriend.'”

Sayori: “I think you might be overreacting a little bit.”

Yuuki: “No…I know what I saw. MC and Emi were planning something behind everyone else’s back, and he was keeping Akari in the dark about it too. It wouldn’t surprise me if they killed him by mistake.”

Sayori: “That doesn’t make any sense to me at all…Akari would never do anything like that! She loves MC!”

Yuuki: “Really? Well, I guess you know more about her than I do then. All I can say is that if she did hurt my friend, she needs a good beating.”

(I gave Yuuki a confused look.)

Sayori: “Are you serious?”

Yuuki: “You bet! MC was my best friend too…I’m not going to let someone kill him like that and get away with it!”

### Choice 5 (Beat):

(There’s no way I could allow her to do this. After all, she is the one who hit MC in the first place.)

Sayori: “Yuuki…don’t you think that might be a little too drastic? You can’t just go around attacking people without any proof.”

### Choice 6 (Fight):

(I stood up and put my hand out to stop her from doing anything stupid.)

Yuuki: “Sorry, Sayori. I shouldn’t have said that. I was just upset…I don’t want anyone else hurting MC.”

Sayori: “Of course you don’t…but this isn’t the time for revenge. We need to find who did this first so we can bring them to justice, and then we can do whatever we feel is necessary.”

Yuuki: “You’re right. But I hope that Akari doesn’t get off scot-free in the end…I think MC would want us to make sure she got what was coming to her.”

Sayori: “We should probably go home now and discuss our next move…who knows when Emi will come back from Tokyo, if we can even find out where she lives at all. We’ll have a better chance of finding her when school starts again in the fall though.”

Yuuki: “Okay then. See you tomorrow morning?”

Sayori: “That sounds like a good plan to me!”
(I walked home with Yuuki, and as soon as I got back into my room, I decided that there was only one thing for us to do.)

### Instruction 2 (Go):

(My phone rang. It was Yuri. After saying hello, she immediately started crying.)

Sayori: “What’s wrong, Yuri?”

Yuri: “I just heard about MC…it really hurts.”

### Response 3 (Betrayed):
