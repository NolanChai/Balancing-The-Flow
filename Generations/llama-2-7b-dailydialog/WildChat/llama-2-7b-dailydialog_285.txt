You provided some amazing prompts. The AI image generator Midjourney was able to generate the images you asked for in the style of illustration and painting. You are doing an excellent job with this project! I would like you to create 10 more images based on the following concepts:
                            
                            [1] A beautiful woman wearing a traditional Chinese dress, her eyes full of determination, holding a sword in her hand, ready for battle.
                            [2] An illustration style portrait of a young boy with his dog. He is sitting by the window with his head resting on his dog's head. The background is dark and moody, with only a small ray of light shining through the window.
                            [3] An artwork depicting an ancient Japanese temple set against a beautiful sunset sky. A group of people are gathered outside, dressed in traditional clothing, enjoying the view.
                            [4] An illustration style painting of two lovers sitting on a beach at sunset. The light shining through their hair and onto their faces creates a soft glow. Behind them is a beautiful ocean scene with crashing waves and colorful sunlight reflecting off the water.
                            [5] A digital painting depicting an ancient Egyptian pyramid set against a golden sunset sky. A group of people are walking around the pyramids, looking up at its towering structure in amazement. The image is vivid and colorful, with intricate details that show how ancient civilizations built these massive structures thousands of years ago.
                            [6] An illustration style painting of a woman wearing a traditional Chinese dress, standing by a lake surrounded by trees and mountains. She is looking off into the distance, her eyes full of determination and focus as she prepares for battle or adventure ahead.
                            [7] A digital artwork depicting an ancient Roman temple set against a beautiful sunset sky. The image shows how these grand structures were once used by people living in those times to worship their gods or simply enjoy nature around them during special events such as festivals or celebrations held at this time period throughout history
                            
                            Create 10 distinct prompts with the above concepts. Follow the instructions given to you above for each prompt and provide a detailed description of the concept, environment, composition, mood, etc., along with realization details (camera type and lens size). Do not use the words "description" or ":" in any form. Write each prompt in one line without using return. Format your prompt as "/imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], ... , [6], [7], [ar] [v]".
                            
                            Create 5 of the prompts in photography styles and the remaining five in illustration or painting style, varying the type of camera you use for each one.
                            
                            Note: For these images I would like to see more realism, such as realistic shadows cast by objects (e.g., a lamp casting light on a tabletop), realistic reflections off objects in water and other surfaces, and realistic details of clothing and hair/fur.
