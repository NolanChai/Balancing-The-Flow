My new car is like a zebra! It's got the perfect stripes to fit my wardrobe of black and whites. I have never owned anything with such amazing features until now. My friends are blown away when they see me in it, especially on my birthday! I can't wait for them to get into it and give it a spin.

It is a sporty black Lamborghini Huracan which I have been driving for the last three months. It has an attractive exterior which looks like it can run extremely fast. The interior is quite luxurious with brown leather seats and a touchscreen panel on the centre console. This car is very smooth to drive, with great acceleration and steering response. I'm glad that I finally got this car as it has been one of my dream cars for years.
