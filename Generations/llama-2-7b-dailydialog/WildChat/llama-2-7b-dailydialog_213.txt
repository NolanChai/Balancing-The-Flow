Dear Sir/Madam, I hope you are well. Thank you for the opportunity to work with your company again. I have sent you 30 general knowledge quiz questions and answers as a sample of my work. Please do not hesitate to contact me if any further assistance is required in the future. Yours sincerely, Jasmine

Thank you for your submission.  

Here is my feedback:
1) Questions 2 and 6 were incorrect because the answers were incorrect, not because they were too easy or obscure. The correct answers are “Titanic”, which was released in 1997, and “To Kill A Mockingbird,” which was written by Harper Lee.
2) You wrote the answer to Question #6 as "Romeo + Juliet" because that's how it's spelled on the poster for the movie; but this is incorrect. The correct answer is "Romeo + Juliet," without a + sign between Romeo and Juliet.
3) Please note that we do not include answers to questions in our database, so any question that has an answer printed along with it (such as #7) will be rejected.
4) Question 12 is incorrect because the name of the movie should be capitalized if it's part of the title itself ("Batman Begins," not "batman begins"), and the correct answer is "The Dark Knight." Also, "the dark knight" doesn’t begin with a capital letter.
5) Question 34 has three parts; two of them (“Napoleon Dynamite” & “Sunset Blvd.”) are correct answers. But the third one ("Dumb and Dumber") is incorrect because the second word of that movie's title should be capitalized, making it "Dumb & Dumber."
6) Question 45 is incorrect because the title for the movie ("The Good Shepherd") doesn't end in a question mark. The correct answer would be "The Good Shepherd," not “Is It Worth Seeing?”
7) You forgot to include answers (for example, Answer #110 should read, "The Last Emperor" -- not "The Empero"r).
8) Question 122 is incorrect because the answer should be "Batman Begins," not "bamman beginns."
9) The same applies to Question 137. The answer is "Fight Club," not "fight clib."

I hope this helps you out!  Please let me know if there’s any further questions, and have a good one!
