Thank you for choosing Microsoft Corporation!

Thank you. I'll try my best to help her out.

Yes, you can. But you need to go to the website and click on your Facebook icon at the top right side of the screen. There's a little menu with a gear and an x. Click on that. Choose 'link another account'. Follow the instructions and then log in with your second Facebook account.

In Instagram  app, when you are advertiser and have created some ads which failed the review, there will be a banner saying "Your account is restricted from advertising" on your account page. As shown below screenshot. In this case, the banned reason is that we didn't follow their "advertising policy".

If you are looking for these warning in web version, please go to **[Insights](https://instagram-ads-portal.com/business/reports)**  -> **Account** , and then click on the **Ad Account** under the left menu. On the right side, there is a section called "Rules".

Hello,  I see that you have a number of questions about selling your shirts online and getting them printed.  But since your question is very broad,  can you please give me more details so I can help you better?

Thank you for your prompt reply, and we hope that our cooperation with you will be a success in the future too. I think I can do this by myself if you need it. And my English is not very well .Sorry about that. Please give me some time to translate it. I'll do my best.

I think the name and design of your company logo are very important, so you need to put more effort on them. And here are some suggestions below:

1) As your company name, "Vicenza Jewellery", is rather hard-to-remember and sounds a little bit old fashioned, we'd suggest you change it to "VicenzaJewelry" which will look more attractive with the logo. You also can use "Vicenza Jewels" or "Vicenza Jewel".

2) Since your website is about jewellery, you may want to put a necklace in your company name and logo (as shown on the following picture), which will let people know that the brand is all about jewellery. You also can use other decorative designs like bracelets or rings around the name.

3) If you'd like to design something more abstract for your logo, it's okay too. In this case, a simple and elegant logo with the brand name in the centre will do great (as shown on the following image). And the blue colour is very good choice because jewelry usually uses that colour to describe elegance and noble.

What can chat GPT + cavana do to help a small business with posting, social media posting, and scheduling?

Chat GPT is an advanced artificial intelligence system that can generate human-like conversations based on the data it has learned. It is trained using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user inputs in a natural way. It has been developed by OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research company founded by Elon Musk and Sam Altman.

Chat GPT can be integrated with other tools such as social media management platforms and scheduling tools to help small businesses automate their posting process. For example, you could set up a rule that says "when I receive a new product review, automatically post it on Facebook and Twitter". By integrating ChatGPT into your marketing plan you'll be able to streamline your social media marketing efforts without having to manually perform each task yourself.

there is no place you can learn the Cavana language except Cavenalab, which is a private research lab. It's not an open community. You may check out our official website if you want to know more about us: http://www.cavanalab.com/index_en.html

> Thank you for your suggestion!  We are using Canva now and we will definitely consider this.  We are looking at the user experience when it comes to the mobile app.  The next phase of our project is to include a better way to upload images and videos as well as enhance the search capabilities of our site.  Thanks again for your feedback!
