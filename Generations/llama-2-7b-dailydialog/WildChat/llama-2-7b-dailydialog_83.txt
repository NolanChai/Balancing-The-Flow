#### [1. Street description #1](https://github.com/vitom-s/game-design-challenges/blob/master/instructions/2020-05-08_street_description_1.md) :

> I'm on this street, what do I see? 
> I'm on this street, what do I see?
> I am on a long street where there are a lot of buildings. But it is not like the typical streets in other cities that look nice and clean and tidy. This street seems to be in an industrial area or maybe even somewhere remote. It looks quite deserted and old here, everything looks gray. 
> The first thing I notice when I turn around: A strange sculpture made of iron and wood. It is a gigantic human skeleton with large wings spread out on its back. There are two people standing in front of it looking at it, as if they were guarding the entrance to this street. I approach them cautiously. 
> "Hello there. Do you know where I can find a decent restaurant around here?" I ask the taller one with black hair. He looks at me like I was crazy and replies: "Hey, what are you doing out of your way? It's dangerous to be on this street. You better leave before something happens to you!" 
> The other person stands silently next to him. I look up towards the sky and see that it is not a clear blue day like we usually have in our cities, but rather very cloudy. Suddenly, I hear a rumbling sound behind me and turn around just in time to see a huge flying creature pass by overhead, emitting sparks of electricity from its wings. It's probably something that lives on the roofs or balconies of all those old buildings nearby. 
> "What was that?", I ask them. The taller one looks at me and says: "That is called a 'roof-eater'. It feeds on people who don't watch out where they are going." I notice that he has two fangs in his mouth, which look very sharp indeed! Then the other one walks towards me slowly while opening up her hands as if she wanted to touch my face or something... 
> Suddenly, it dawns on me: The person with black hair is actually wearing a mask that makes her look like an alien creature from outer space and so does the other one! Are they aliens? Or maybe just people who are part of some weird cult... I quickly turn around again and run away as fast as possible.
> 2. Street description #2 :
> The city looks very strange, it almost feels like it's not even real at all. Everything is so unusual that you can hardly believe your own eyes. All the streets are crowded with people who seem to be rushing around in a hurry as if they were looking for something. Some buildings look like huge skyscrapers while others look like old ruins. In between there are shops, cafés and restaurants of all kinds selling every possible kind of food imaginable. There's even an old church with its tower visible from far away over the roofs of other houses.
> It is obvious that something weird must have happened in this town because everything looks so different than usual, it almost seems like a nightmare or some sort of dream... 3. Street description #3 :
> I'm walking down this street looking for something interesting when suddenly there are screams coming from somewhere behind me! I look around but can't see anything except buildings everywhere on both sides of the road and people hurrying past without paying attention to what's happening behind them. I decide to go back into one of these houses hoping that it might be safer inside than out here in the open where something could happen at any moment... 
> But then again there are still lots of shops nearby so maybe there will be some food available if I can find someone who works in a grocery store or restaurant... Maybe they know how things stand around here because their business is being affected by this strange situation too! I continue walking and eventually find myself standing outside an old building that seems to have been abandoned long ago because all its windows are broken, leaving only small holes for light coming through them onto the sidewalk below where people walk past without giving me any notice at all...

The development of the cities in the world is so fast that they are usually built without a comprehensive plan for future growth. The development of a new city can cause the failure of its urban planning, and it is often due to the lack of information. The rapid growth of population leads to many problems such as the traffic congestion, the high crime rate and the poor housing conditions.
The history of this city can be traced back to 1960 when there were only a few people living here. During that period, it was a small rural area with only one village. The population grew slowly until 2000 when it had increased more than tenfold from the original number.
The rapid growth of population has caused many problems such as traffic congestion, high crime rate and poor housing conditions because there is no comprehensive plan for future development and it lacks information about future growth trends due to insufficient research on urban planning issues beforehand .

Factions in a city shape its development by influencing its economic direction. As an example of this, let us look at New York City where real estate is one of the most important sectors in the economy. Factions that influence how the city develops are those who have the power and money to decide what kind of buildings get built when. In addition to these factions, there are also other people that help to shape the direction a city goes in; these people include developers who have an idea for something new they want to build or a businessperson who has some influence over the area’s development plans and would like their business to be located close by so it is convenient to get to work each day.
