Welcome! Let's begin your adventure today. You are in a fantasy world, with no one else around you besides yourself. I need you to tell me what the scene looks like and who or what is there. 1.) The first scene begins in front of a temple where you can see a large statue of a man on the right side of a road that runs in front of you. There are a few trees behind you, but otherwise it's empty. 2.) In the distance you can see another temple with two more statues to its sides. It also has a small house on top of the temple, and there is some light shining from underneath the roof. The sky is dark, and clouds are in the way of the moonlight shining down on your face. 3.) You can see a man standing inside one of the temples. He's wearing a white robe that has the same red flame pattern as you have on yours. His eyes are closed tightly and he is muttering something to himself. A light is shining down from above, so his face cannot be seen very well. 4.) The man opens up one eye at a time before shutting them back again after seeing that there's nothing around him but darkness outside of the temple. He steps out onto the road and begins walking towards you slowly with no real sense of urgency or hurry about his actions whatsoever...
