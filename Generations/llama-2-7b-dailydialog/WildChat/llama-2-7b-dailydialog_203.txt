Blue Beetle is being compared to the first and third Avengers movies as well as Shazam. It's a new style of superhero movie that feels like it could be a great fit in the DC Universe.

The Blue Beetle movie has been compared to previous blockbusters, which is likely because its story is set up much differently than other superhero films.

The first and third Avengers movies have been compared to Blue Beetle due to how they each use a group of heroes in their plot, much like the upcoming DC movie will.

Jaime Reyes is shown alongside the previous owners of his Scarab armor.
As mentioned earlier, Jaime Reyes' legacy and mantle were previously established in the comics before he officially debuted as Blue Beetle in 2006. His predecessors have been introduced in the movie, with Ted Kord even having a large presence throughout the film. Given how much time is spent on his life and his work, it seems like Jaime will be taking up the mantles of all three men that came before him, which would put an interesting spin on the comics' legacy idea.

The first two Avengers movies both centered around a team of heroes in the early days when Marvel was trying to build its cinematic universe. This eventually culminated with 2019's Avengers: Endgame, which saw many characters from throughout the MCU dying. It was later revealed that these deaths were only temporary and would be reversed at some point through time travel, though this wasn't until the third movie in the series. This is the same kind of thing Blue Beetle has set up, with Jaime eventually inheriting not just his mantles but also other people who've wielded them.

This is similar to the Shazam movies, which feature Billy Batson taking on different incarnations of himself when he says his name. This gives him powers like Superman's strength or Flash's speed in order to deal with situations better suited for specific individuals. While the Blue Beetle movie isn't about these different individuals, it does set up a similar idea where Jaime can borrow abilities and power from other heroes who've come before him.
This is a very common trope in superhero comics, but it hasn't been handled on film as much outside of the Marvel movies. The latter had to deal with different characters for its three-film run because of how many were introduced in the first movie, while other heroes who've come and gone were just relegated to cameos or appearances from other actors. In this way, Blue Beetle has a lot of potential to be something fresh for the genre that it might not otherwise have had if handled by another studio.

The upcoming Blue Beetle movie seems like it will be a great addition to the DC Universe and possibly its own universe at some point in the future. This is especially true with how many different characters will come into play, which is something that hasn't been done on film before. The first Avengers movies already did this to an extent by bringing together Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and more. Blue Beetle is only doing it more, and that might mean more shared universe heroes down the road.
