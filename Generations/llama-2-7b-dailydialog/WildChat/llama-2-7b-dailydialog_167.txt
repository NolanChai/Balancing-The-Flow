"We do not see that there is any evidence of this in the text under consideration ; nor can we understand how what was true of some things could be taken as true of others. â€” It does not appear to us that the thousand years are borrowed from the Jews, but that it is John who has borrowed from them. He does not say "a thousand years," but "a thousand years are as one day." If we take the passage in its connexion, we perceive that this language of John is an appropriate commentary on what he had said respecting the reign of Satan and his restraint during the time of which he was speaking ; for it was a reign of terror, when evil ruled over good, and when the saints were exposed to destruction, and suffered every thing but death ; as many of them did die. This was not because they had not strength or ability to resist, but because there was no other way to deliver them from the hand of their persecutors. They were restrained by the power of Satan's kingdom in the earth, and it is this reign which John describes when he says that a thousand years are as one day."
