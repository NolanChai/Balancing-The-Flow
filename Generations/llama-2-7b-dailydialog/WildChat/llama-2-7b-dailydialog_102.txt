### 
### 1) 1. Explain to your students why the Balkans are called that way and why they were considered an important region of Europe in the past. (10 min) 2. Have them watch a short video about the region and ask questions about it afterward (6 min).
### 3) 4. Ask your students to answer a questionnaire on their perceptions of Balkan countries before watching the film, then have them do the same after. (50 min) 5. Have students make a list of important geographical features of the Balkans and present their findings to each other using an interactive whiteboard or other technology (35 minutes).
### 6) Ask your students to read about how countries in this region compare with others around them, then discuss these comparisons in groups of three or four. You may want to give them time at home to research their topics further before coming back together as a class again for discussion so that they can come prepared with more information about each place than just what’s provided here:
### 7) Have your students do an exercise called "What am I thinking?" where you ask them questions and let them draw pictures in response to those answers without saying anything out loud (20 minutes). They should then compare their drawings with others on the board or using a document camera so they can see what similarities exist between different people’s thoughts about each place! 8) Ask students whether any of these places have been featured in movies recently and why? What would be an important aspect that made it unique from other parts of Europe/world? How does this region compare with others around it (such as Asia Minor)? Why do you think this region has not gotten more attention over time compared with other areas on Earth?
### 9) Give students a map and ask them to draw where they live on it, then give them another one that shows the Balkan countries. Have them explain why they chose certain spots as their homes based on what they know about each place (25 minutes). 10) Ask your students questions such as "What do you think is most important when visiting these regions?" "Would it be better if we were allowed to travel freely between countries like we can within the United States now, or do people still prefer borders because they provide us with security from outside threats?"
### 11) Ask your students what they would like to know about Balkan countries that aren't covered in this lesson plan? If there are any topics you think should be included here but aren’t, let us know so we can make changes before next time!
### 12) Ask your students if they have questions about the material provided in this unit or if anything else comes up while discussing it during class today that isn't answered elsewhere within these pages (such as which countries border each other).
### 13) Have a fun quiz game where you ask questions such as "What are three Balkan countries?" and so on. You can also play with pictures, colors or anything else that seems interesting to your students!
