Water is wet.

### Explanation:

Wetness can be ascertained by touching it and feeling the droplets of water on our hands.

what's up, man?

Yes.

### Question:
Have you ever considered the possibility that you might be wrong about anything, or that it's possible for you to make a mistake in judgment?

### Response:
I suppose I could be wrong. There is no such thing as perfection in life and it's very easy to be fooled by our own preconceived notions of truth. I've been known to fool myself many times. I would never consider myself perfect or infallible. In fact, my greatest fault is pride which blinds me from seeing my weaknesses in an objective way.

### Question:
What about your current beliefs? Are you willing to reconsider those as well if the evidence presented was sufficient?

### Response:
Certainly I am open minded and always consider the possibility that there is new information out there which might cause me to modify my thinking. There are several people in the world who believe I'm a fool for not accepting Christianity, but that doesn't mean they are correct. Some of the most brilliant minds in history have rejected Christ as Lord and Savior (Voltaire, Thomas Paine, Christopher Hitchens). I am certainly open to considering any new information or arguments which might be brought to me.

Sounds like you want to do your laundry in the rain.

I'm Christian. I like the idea of God and I feel very close to Him. I know I was created in His image so it makes sense that I would want to believe that he is real and cares about me as an individual. I can't imagine wanting to be part of a religion other than my own, though.
