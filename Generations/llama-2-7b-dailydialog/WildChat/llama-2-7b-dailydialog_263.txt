I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I am not against fan translation or even fan dubbing of anime series; I just didn't like this specific case of a fan translation being placed side-by-side with a professionally done translation in order to "compare". The translator is obviously not the target audience here, and this kind of test is unnecessary.

There's no such thing as watching anything without a legal license. Even if you go abroad to watch anime, it has already been released in that country before. If your country hasn't released it yet, then you need to wait for its release

"Thank you for reaching out about your interest in To Your Eternity. Unfortunately, due to licensing agreements with our partners in each country and region, we are not able to provide this series at this time. We hope that one day, these rights will be made available so fans everywhere can enjoy it."

I am now angry

### Solution:

"5. Watch subtitles or dubs of the anime in your country: Although you may need to watch with subtitles instead of a dubbed version, consider watching anime online for free on YouTube and other streaming platforms. Keep an eye out for fan-translated episodes that are available for download, as these can be accessed from anywhere."

I wanna pay my bills without watching subs or dubs I have no money to buy plastic DVDs.

"It is very easy to speak about marginals. When they were still on the air and we saw them all, they could do everything except watching anime. And then in two weeks the third season was announced, and now they will be able to watch it. Therefore I do not call those people marginals. These are simply fans of this manga who have become interested in it.
I think that these are not even marginals, but just fans. The company is very glad that a series like this is loved by such a large number of people and we hope to continue making more season of the show."

I am not going to argue with you about your feelings towards Crunchroll. I believe you have every right to be dissatisfied. But in terms of their work - they are just a platform for people to watch anime (the fact that they translate it is just icing on the cake) - and the fact that To Your Eternity is not available yet does not mean at all that the fans who supported your campaign are bots
