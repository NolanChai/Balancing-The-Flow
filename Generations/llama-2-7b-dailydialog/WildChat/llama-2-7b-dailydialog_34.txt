summarise this: The name Hermanoubis (Ἑρμανουβιϲ) was used as a proper personal name and occurs in the Greek papyri more than any other personal name. (In seven instances [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9] the ending of the name is abbreviated or not preserved.) It is always masculine; it may be assumed that Hermanoubis was a common and well-known name in the Delta at Alexandria.[2] In addition to direct theonymy (the giving to humans of unaltered divine names), there is a phenomenon of "transferred theonymy" (the adoption by human beings of names taken from other individuals or groups) evident in personal names that include a suffix based on the name of one or more gods, with the addition of another ending. A number of such forms appear throughout the corpus; I will refer to them as "theophoric" because they are often also "divine" (i.e., from a god), but they may not be proper names. It seems that Ἑρμανουβιϲ, attested six times [2, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15], is a theophoric name based on Hermanoubis.[4] In an odd instance (9) the form Ἑρμανουβιϲ in the nominative is borne by a woman, an Alexandrian nurse (ἡ τροφόϲ). It is highly unusual for female theophoric names to be unmarked for gender in this way.[5] I suspect that because the element -ανουβιϲ in Ἑρμάνουβιϲ was often declined with a dental declension in -ιδ-, it might have been conflated with the similar declension of Greek feminine names in -ίϲ, -ίδοϲ.[6] If this is correct, it may be preferable to read the nurse's name as an oxytone (Ἑρμανουβίϲ). There are two further forms based on the god Hermanoubis: Ἑρμανουβᾶϲ (six instances: 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 20) and Ἑρμανουβίων (four instances: 3, 6, 18, 19). -ᾶϲ and -ίων were, in fact, the commonest Greek suffixes for personal names based on the Egyptian god Ἄνουβιϲ.[7] It is interesting that in a business letter (3) the two forms Ἑρμανουβίων (l.38) and ἑρμανουβᾶϲ (l.41) are used interchangeably to designate the same individual. In this case, ἑρμανουβῆϲ may be a hypocoristic of ἑρμανουβίων, since the suffix -ᾶϲ often served this purpose.[8]
