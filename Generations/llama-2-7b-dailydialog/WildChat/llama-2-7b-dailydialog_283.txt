### 1. Research & Analysis
#### What is the challenge and who am I helping?
I am trying to understand what my customers are going through by talking with them directly to uncover their pain points in a deep dive way.

#### How will I use this information to build a strategy that delivers results?
I have set up interviews for each customer of mine and took notes from every meeting, which I recorded using Google Docs.

#### What are my key assumptions about my customers' situation?
I am assuming that all my customers are already aware of the product that I am trying to sell them but don't know enough about it because they haven't researched it. So they feel a bit uncomfortable in terms of using this platform without getting their questions answered.

#### What is the key problem I will help solve?
The main problems my customers are facing are that there are too many choices for them to choose from and not enough information to decide which product to buy.

#### What are the results expected after 3 months?
They can make a well-informed buying decision with less confusion by reading through all reviews given by previous users as well as seeing live demos of how it works in real life scenarios. This would result in better conversions and increased sales for me as well since now I know what my customers want more than anything else on this website which is more information about how exactly does the software work?

#### What are my top 3 growth hypothesis?
1) I believe that there will be a significant increase in both traffic and conversion rates if we implement our new strategy of creating detailed product descriptions for each type of product sold on Racecar's Growth Framework VIRALITY engine website because this would give consumers more information about what they are buying so they don't feel as confused when deciding between options since they already know how it works.
2) If we add new content regularly (such as articles about different types of software), people will visit the site more often because there is always something fresh and interesting going on. This would also help attract new customers who might not have known about us before but now do because of all these great reviews they saw online from previous users.
3) By implementing our new strategy, we will be able to increase sales since consumers know exactly what they are getting before buying something which means less confusion for them! This would result in a higher conversion rate and increased revenue as well since now I know what my customers want more than anything else on this website which is more information about how exactly does the software work?

### 2. Execution
#### What are my key actions to execute the plan?
1) Create detailed product descriptions for each type of product sold on Racecar's Growth Framework VIRALITY engine so consumers have all the information they need before making a decision about what they want;
2) Implement new content regularly (such as articles about different types of software);
3) Continue adding new features to increase our conversions and revenue. This would result in higher conversion rates and increased sales!

### 3. Measurement
#### What are my KPIs?
I will use the following metrics: traffic, conversion rates, and revenue as my KPIs since this is what matters most to me because it is directly related to how well-informed consumers feel about buying a product on our website before making their final purchase decision which leads directly into higher conversions (more people signing up) and increased sales (people actually buying something from us).

#### What are the key success metrics that matter?
If we see an increase in both traffic and conversion rates, then it would mean that we have successfully implemented our new strategy of creating detailed product descriptions for each type of software sold on Racecar's Growth Framework VIRALITY engine which would result in better sales numbers as well since now consumers know exactly what they are getting before buying something from us so less confusion about how the software works.

#### How will I measure success?
I will use Google Analytics to track all traffic and conversions on our website, along with revenue generated from each product sale. If we see an increase in both metrics after 3 months of implementing this new strategy, then it would mean that we have successfully implemented our plan which resulted in higher conversion rates (more people signing up) and increased sales (people actually buying something from us).

#### Virality (Mention)
* To increase our brand awareness we would utilize social media and focus on Facebook. We would create a Facebook page for the company so people could interact with us and learn more about what we offer. We would also add social sharing buttons to make it easy for people to share information about us with their friends.
* We would implement a referral program whereby if any of our patients referred someone who ended up buying one of our products, the person being referred would receive 10% off their order and we’d give them $10 back via Paypal as an incentive for referring us.
* We would also target physicians focused on ADHD by sending out a newsletter with information about what we do to the e-mail addresses of people who have been referred from the medical community.
#### Referrals (Mention)
* We would create an online store whereby anyone could purchase our products, but we would also make it easy for people to refer their friends via a social sharing button at the bottom of each product page so that when you share one of these pages with someone else they can easily click on it and buy something. This will encourage virality among customers who like what they see in the newsletter or hear about from their physician friend, but don’t have time to search around online for other similar products before making a purchase decision.
#### Targeting Physicians (Mention)
* We would send out a monthly newsletter that was focused on ADHD with information and resources related to this condition such as articles about medication options or treatments, lists of support groups in their area if they wanted more personalized help with managing this condition at home instead of going through a doctor’s office or hospital setting every time something comes up.
