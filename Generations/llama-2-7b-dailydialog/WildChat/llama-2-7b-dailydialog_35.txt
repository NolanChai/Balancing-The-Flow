Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>,

I’m available at Monday 9:30 am Irish Time. I know this is quite early for you so I won't hold it against you if you can not make it.

Best regards, <Walid>

Good to hear from you Walid,

Yes i’m available on Monday. 9:30 am Irish time is 12:30 pm here in the US. That should work for me. Let us know how it goes. I can't wait to meet you in person after so many emails back and forth. I look forward to working with you.

Best regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>

Hi Ola,

Thank you so much for your quick response! The dates of Wednesday at 9 AM and Thursday at 10 PM are perfect for me. Let’s plan to meet on Wednesday next week (28th) at 9 AM.

I look forward to our meeting and learning more about you and your work!

Hey Neil, I'm sorry that I had a last-minute change of plan and could not meet up today. I do have another meeting tomorrow at the same time. Is there any chance to meet on Thursday evening? If it doesn't work out on Wednesday or Thursday evening then let me know when you will be free again and we can arrange something else. Thanks for your understanding, Walid

reply to this email and propose other dates : Hi Neil,

I'm sorry too that I cannot make it today. But I hope we can meet at another time. Are there any days which are more convenient for you ?

Sincerely yours,
Walid

Hi there.
I'm afraid that's a no-go with me as well. I can't make it on any of the new proposed dates either so we will have to postpone this meeting until further notice.
Please note that I have sent you a couple more alternative days and times in case anyone is available from your team on those days:
* 17th January 2018 at 4pm (UK time)
* 19th January 2018 at 5pm (UK time)
* 23rd January 2018 at 12pm (UK time)
Let me know if any of these new dates works for you and your team.
Many thanks,
Joe

Great! See you on the day of the conference.
