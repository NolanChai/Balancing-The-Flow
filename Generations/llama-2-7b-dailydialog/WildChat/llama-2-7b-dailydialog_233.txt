Amatsumagatsuchi: “Ayumi… you’re very sick, aren’t you?” Amatsumagatsuchi asked Ayumi. He gently touched her head - which she flinched upon at first - and she didn’t respond. She was lying on the ground, and seemed to be in pain.

Ayumi: “W-What?! Am I really sick?” Ayumi said out loud after a few moments of being silent. The girls all looked up from what they were doing, and stared at Ayumi - who was just recovering from her surprise.

Cupa: “Yes… You are very sick…” Cupa answered Ayumi, with Andr, Blazette, and Vanessa also answering in the same way. However, there wasn’t much of a response from Ayumi herself - she just looked at Amatsumagatsuchi.

Ayumi: “Then… What do we need to do?” Ayumi said, her voice trembling with fear as she stared up at Amatsumagatsuchi. 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I don’t know… I have no idea what the problem is. But you shouldn’t be in pain.” Amatsumagatsuchi looked at Ayumi again, and gently placed his tail on her forehead. However, as he did this, several flashbacks of Ayumi appeared in his mind.

Amatsumagatsuchi: “This is the first time I’ve ever felt such a strong mystical energy coming from another being…” Amatsumagatsuchi said to the girls - who were looking up at him with curious eyes. 

Ayumi: “I-I have no idea what you’re saying…” Ayumi replied, her voice shaking as she stared at Amatsumagatsuchi. She was confused by his sudden appearance and actions.

Cupa: “Amatsumagatsuchi seems to be picking up something about us that we don’t know…” Cupa said out loud - which surprised Ayumi, who was staring at Amatsumagatsuchi as if she were in a daze. 

Andr: “Yeah… I think so too…” Andr replied to Cupa - who nodded her head in agreement. She also looked up at Amatsumagatsuchi and stared back at him.

Blazette: “We’ve never seen anything like this before, either!” Blazette said out loud, as the other girls - Ayumi included - were silent as they all listened to her. 

Ayumi: “You mean… You can actually hear what I say?” Ayumi asked, surprised that Amatsumagatsuchi could understand what she was saying. She thought monsters couldn’t even talk!

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I-I don’t know exactly what you’re saying right now… But I can hear everything you’re saying.” Amatsumagatsuchi replied, a bit uncomfortable with the fact that he could actually understand what Ayumi was saying. He didn’t understand this at all!

Amatsumagatsuchi: “However - even though I don’t know why I can hear your voice right now… I do know something very important.” Amatsumagatsuchi paused for a few seconds, and then continued talking to the girls. 

Ayumi: “And what is that?” Ayumi asked, curious as to what Amatsumagatsuchi would say next. The other girls stared at him with eager eyes - who were also curious as to what he’d say. 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I know why you all came here!” Amatsumagatsuchi exclaimed, staring down at Ayumi and the rest of the girls - who were surprised by his sudden outburst of energy. 

Ayumi: “And what’s that?” Ayumi asked again, curious as to why they had come to this place. She didn’t remember coming here at all! 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “You are the next generation of Monster Hunters!” Amatsumagatsuchi exclaimed - which caught everyone off guard. He looked down at Ayumi and then at Vanessa, Andr, Cupa, and Blazette with wide eyes - as if he were looking into their souls and seeing what they had done before. 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “You’ve all gone on numerous journeys in the past… but you haven’t accomplished anything yet.” Amatsumagatsuchi continued to stare at them, as if he were trying to tell them something important. The girls all looked at him with puzzled expressions - which he seemed to notice, and then smile a bit before speaking again. 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “However… You will accomplish what you set out to do.” Amatsumagatsuchi said, staring down at Ayumi. He then looked up at all of them, as if he were trying to tell them something important about themselves that they didn’t know yet - but would eventually find out later on in life. 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “You are the future of Monster Hunting… You will be able to achieve everything you desire!” Amatsumagatsuchi said, looking back down at Ayumi and then at all four girls again - who were now staring back with a bit of hope in their eyes. 

Ayumi: “Really? I mean… Are we really the future Monster Hunters?” Ayumi asked out loud, curious as to what Amatsumagatsuchi meant by that statement he made just then. She also wanted to know what this mystical energy was that Amatsumagatsuchi had picked up on - it must be something important! 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I-I can’t tell you for sure… But I believe so…” Amatsumagatsuchi replied, looking down at Ayumi and then back at the other four girls again with wide eyes as he seemed to look into their souls again - or perhaps try to get them to remember something from a long time ago? 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I can’t be certain… But I believe that we will all grow up and become great Monster Hunters!” Amatsumagatsuchi said, looking back down at Ayumi with a smile on his face before returning to staring into the girls' eyes. 

Cupa: “So… What’s next?” Cupa asked out loud - which surprised everyone else since no one was expecting her question at all! 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “Next… You have a lot of work ahead of you…” Amatsumagatsuchi replied, as his tail started to shake with excitement. He then turned around and faced the girls again - staring back down at them with wide eyes before turning back around to face Ayumi once more! 

Cupa: “We do? Why?” Cupa asked out loud, surprised by what Amatsumagatsuchi had said just now. She wasn’t expecting this at all since they were only here because of the strange monsters attacking them earlier on - but it seemed that there was something more to this than just an attack! 

Ayumi: “Why are you talking about us being future Monster Hunters?” Ayumi asked out loud, confused by what Amatsumagatsuchi had said just now. She wasn’t expecting him to say anything like that at all - and neither was anyone else for that matter! 

Blazette: “He’s not talking about us being future Monster Hunters… He means we are already there.” Blazette replied, as the other girls nodded their heads in agreement with what she said. They were staring at Amatsumagatsuchi with puzzled eyes - who then turned back around to face them again and continued talking about them being future Monster Hunters! 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “You are all the next generation of Monster Hunters… You will be able to achieve everything you set out to do.” Amatsumagatsuchi replied, staring down at Ayumi and then at all four girls again - who were now staring back with a bit of hope in their eyes. 

Cupa: “Really? I mean… Are we really the future Monster Hunters?” Cupa asked out loud, curious as to what Amatsumagatsuchi meant by that statement he made just now. She also wanted to know what this mystical energy was that Amatsumagatsuchi had picked up on - it must be something important! 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I-I can’t tell you for sure… But I believe so…” Amatsumagatsuchi replied, looking down at Ayumi and then back at the other four girls again with wide eyes as he seemed to look into their souls again - or perhaps try to get them to remember something from a long time ago? 

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I can’t be certain… But I
