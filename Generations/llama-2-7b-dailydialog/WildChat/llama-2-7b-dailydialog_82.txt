I have read this story many times and I am still amazed at how much thought went into the writing of this piece. I feel like you really captured the feeling of a child who is being disciplined by an adult in a loving but strict manner.  This kind of treatment can often be what children need, as they are taught that bad behavior has consequences and good behavior gets rewards. 
I found the way that you described the nanny to be very interesting.  The use of language was really intriguing and I enjoyed reading how this character thought about discipline in general.  
The use of magical abilities was a great idea as well, especially because it allowed the child to experience some playfulness but also allowed him to be disciplined at times.  These two qualities can often go hand-in-hand when you are raising children.   
Lastly, I think that you did an excellent job of showing how much this child needed discipline and guidance from his nanny.  The way she disciplines him is very loving but firm which is important for young children to learn about proper behavior in order to grow up into respectable adults.
