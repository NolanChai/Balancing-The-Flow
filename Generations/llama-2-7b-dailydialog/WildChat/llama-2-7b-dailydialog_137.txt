objective and subjective are relative terms.

### Explanation:
seismic intensity scale is the relative indication of earthquake intensity to mankind, which has been developed from the subjective observations of people at that time and places, while the seismic magnitude scale is an objective scientific indicator of earthquake energy release, which was initially defined by the US Geological Survey in 1979.
