No, it's not a good translation. I guess you could say something like '快跑' or '衝過' and use 水渠 to indicate waterfall (and then use 走 by itself), but if you want the wording of your sentence in Chinese, it would be best to change it to a different structure.

I think the problem isn't the literal translation of Velociraptor. If it were that simple, we wouldn’t be having this conversation. The problem is how to translate the meaning into English. To answer your question “Can you elaborate?” I think the most obvious thing is that the sentence is describing a predator – someone who hunts and kills other animals for food or sport (猎物). However, in Chinese there are several different words used to describe a predatory animal (猎动物、肉食动物), but in this case it's the adjective 迅猛 that makes all the difference. When we use Velociraptor as the translation for 暴龙, the reader is going to get the impression that the Velociraptors are very fierce or violent (in fact they're not). So it’s important to note that just because an animal is predatory doesn’t mean it has to be vicious. The other thing you need to consider here is the fact that 龙 and 迅猛 have two different meanings in Chinese, whereas 狼 and 钩 are homophones in English. So if Velociraptor doesn't fit with one of these meanings then it won’t be a good translation for the word 暴龙 (即使你用"钩头飞狼"这个译法).

The meaning is the same, but not word-for-word. In English, we use different phrases to talk about a person who is chasing after another one or following someone closely. They are all in pursuit. You can say "the Velociraptor is chasing after baby Azhdarchids." "The Velociraptor is in pursuit of the baby Azhdarchids" sounds a little more appropriate.

Yes, I guess so. But it’s not perfect.  The translation you gave seems to say that she eats all the animals in those forests, when what the English says more clearly is just that she’s at the very top of the food chain in these forests (or maybe “top” means “chief or head” as well?).

"Single crested pterosaur"

### Explanation of correct response:
The answer can be inferred from the literal Chinese to English translation of 「單」and 「翼」which both mean single.  「龍」means lizard or dragon in general. Therefore, the meaning would be something along the lines of "a lizard with a crest."

This is a hard question because I need to translate both Chinese and English, but still I can make an attempt. 

### Question:
How about the second one?

### Response:
It is not so difficult. I can just tell you that the Chinese idiom here means "it’s all right if it's late", which can be interpreted as "I don't mind if we meet again at another time". 

### Question:
That sounds like an indirect translation for me. You seem to have translated this phrase by using two English words, "no problem" and "later".

### Response:
Actually there is a more appropriate idiom in Chinese that means the same thing. The idiom is “又不如晚了” which literally translates into “it’s not too late”. 

### Question:
In English, we often say "no problem" and "see you later", but when it comes to a phrase like this one, they are just two separate words. The Chinese idiom is a single unit of language, which shows the cohesiveness of Chinese characters. 

### Response:
That's true. You have pointed out an important difference between English and Chinese in terms of their use of phrases. In fact, it is one of the major differences between these two languages. 

### Question:
Can you give me another example?

### Response:
Let's talk about this phrase "我在乎你的事情". The English equivalent would be "I care about your affairs". 

### Question:
That sounds a little strange. Why did you use the Chinese idiom instead of just saying "I care about you"?

### Response:
This is because we tend to use such an idiomatic expression when we want to talk about a very serious matter, or something that one cares much about. 

### Question:
OK, I understand now. That makes perfect sense! 

### Response:
Good to hear that! Now can you tell me which Chinese phrase is equivalent to the English idiom "you're welcome" in Chinese?

### Question:
Well, we don’t say "你好意思" all the time when someone says “thank you”. 

### Response:
That's correct. The expression is more commonly used during special occasions. We tend to use this phrase as a formal response to a compliment from somebody else. 

### Question:
Oh, I see! So the literal translation of "you are welcome" would be "I am glad for you". 

### Response:
You got it right! Now, could you give me an example of when we would use this phrase?

### Question:
Sure. You could use that expression to say “thank you” after receiving a compliment from someone else. 

### Response:
Exactly! To sum up, the Chinese idiom “好意思” is commonly used in the same way as the English phrase "you are welcome". 

### Question:
This is really interesting! I can understand why you use it to say thank you when someone compliments your work. 

### Response:
You’ve got a good sense of Chinese idioms, my friend!
