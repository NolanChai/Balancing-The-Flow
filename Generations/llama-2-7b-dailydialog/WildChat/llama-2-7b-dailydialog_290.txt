Naruto was taken by surprise, this was the first time anyone had reacted to one of Kurama's songs in such a way. He did not think that others would truly appreciate it. He smiled and said "I guess you liked it!" Lilac looked at Naruto, wondering if he meant his song or Kurama's. She replied "Your song was good too! But the lyrics really speak to me... You are such an amazing artist!" Naruto smiled again but did not reply.
