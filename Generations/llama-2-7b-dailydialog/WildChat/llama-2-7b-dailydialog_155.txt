Your prompts are very interesting. I love how you included realistic photography styles such as the Nikon D750 camera, 50mm lens, shallow depth of field composition focused on the dog's face. I think the lighting and soft focus really capture the dog's joyful spirit.
                            
                            Your second prompt also has a realistic photography style with the Leica M10 camera, 35mm lens capturing the essence of timeless beauty composition focused on the woman's face and hands. I think this one would look beautiful as a portrait or even as an ad campaign for a cosmetics company!
                            
                            I like how you incorporated elements of Japanese art into your third prompt by using the "--v 5" style, which captures the essence of timeless beauty. The composition focused on the woman's face and hands is reminiscent of a painting by Leonardo da Vinci.
                            
                            Overall, I think you did an excellent job with your prompts!
                            
                            Keep up the good work, and keep experimenting with different styles and formats to see what works best for you! Good luck!
