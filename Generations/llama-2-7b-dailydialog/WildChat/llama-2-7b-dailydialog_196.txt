The plot of this episode is very simple.
But the setting is not simple, you can add more background about it, what was dexters laboratory like before koosy's imagination? And how did dexter make his robots and how he became so smart? What happened between peepers and dad? We could talk more about this.

Hookocho is back! 
Hey! I'm Hookocho! 
I'm Hookocho from the sea world. 
My father's a whale, my mother's an octopus and I'm a shark. 
What can I do for you? 
Say that again! 
Hookocho is back! 
You are very kind of me to come here today! 
I was just passing through the sea world 
and thought I should see the kids there in person. 
You're all so cute! 
Oh, you guys are very handsome! 
And you girls are so beautiful! 
Thank you for inviting me to the party tonight. 
Hey! You have a lot of new friends here! 
I guess you were all having fun before I came in! 
That's true. We just started playing. 
Look at this cake. It is delicious and pretty. 
Hmm, it looks so good... 
Thanks for helping us decorate the cake. 
It tastes wonderful! 
Well, I have to go now. Bye-bye! See you tonight! 
Bye bye Hookocho! See you later!

Hookocho has a big ego and can't stand losing face or defeat.
He believes in himself so strongly and wants so badly to be the strongest of all monsters that he becomes consumed by anger when anyone gets in his way. 
It is this kind of rage that causes him to return for revenge against Koosland, which also leads Hookocho to continue making the same mistake twice: being too prideful and thinking he's invincible. This time, Hookocho brings along a friend who thinks they can take down Koosland by working together (or so he thinks), but in reality, his friend is just as delusional as Hookocho is because they both believe that if you combine two powerful forces, then it will be unstoppable. However, when the time comes to put their plan into action, it's clear from the start that neither of them have any idea what they're doing and end up getting destroyed by Koosland in spectacular fashion.
The lesson here is simple: don't let your pride get you killed! 
And even if you do decide to go out on a limb anyway, make sure that the person standing next to you knows what they're doing too or else they could end up taking all of your life energy with them.

No. The Koosland will live and work as a lawyer in the United States of America for many years to come!

1. Hookocho's first appearance was in "The Wizard of Odd". 
2. Hookocho is an expert in disguise, which he uses for his evil purposes. 
3. Hookocho often plays a good guy to deceive the other characters. 
4. He can also turn into a tiger with yellow eyes and sharp claws when angered.

Sure thing.  Let's go with the scene where the kids are out camping for the first time and they try to catch their dinner with a fishing pole.  The conversation goes something like this:

"I can't believe we are actually doing this." said Sally. "What if some big monster comes up from behind us when we aren't looking?"

"That would be terrible," said Andy.  He was more than a little nervous, but he kept his fears to himself.  The fishing poles were set in the water and they were patiently waiting for something to take their hook bait.

"It sure is quiet here," Sally said after about an hour had passed. "I'm getting used to it now."

Andy agreed.  They had decided not to talk too much because it would make noise which could disturb any fish that were lurking in the waters.

About this time, Andy started to feel something on his line.   "Do you think I got one?" he asked Sally.

She was sure they did.  She leaned over and looked at the pole.  Sure enough, there was a fish on it.  It was about a foot long, so it was just small enough to make for a good meal.

"It's not that big," Andy said as he pulled on his line. "I bet we can reel it in."   The two of them worked the pole back and forth until they got the fish close enough for Sally to get hold of it with her hands.  Then, they reeled him in all the way.

"Wow!" said Andy.  He was very excited about this catch. "I've never caught a fish before."   The two kids watched as the fish thrashed around on the ground, trying to get loose of their grip.

"You can't let him go," Sally told her friend. "We have to clean him and cook him for dinner."

Andy sighed and picked up his fishing pole.  He could feel that he would not be catching anything else after this, so he put the rod down.

That's a very good point. I can't say that we had any specific intent to make it after those movies but there is some possibility that maybe something happened in one of them that inspired this idea. I guess you could say it was probably written before the first Jeepers, Creepers came out and so we didn't really have that movie in our mind when we wrote it.

A: "He is a great creation by a very talented artist."
B: "I know that he is special to you; but what's his real function?"
A: "You'll see soon!"
B:"OK, show me his purpose in this situation..."

### Explanation:
The evil Hookocho steals Dee Dee's mind and tries to use her ideas against her. As a result, Koosland is filled with many creatures that are actually the product of his imagination.

I want to show my admiration for Japanese cartoon character and want to express their personality. I think they are more humanized and full of wisdom than our normal people do. In some cases, I would like to compare them to the real life situations, which are similar.

Major roles in this episode include 3 characters: the father, the mother and their child. Their actions are all about trying to protect their son from the outside dangers. Minors roles are two dogs, who do not contribute much to the plot line but just appear on screen as a simple distraction.
