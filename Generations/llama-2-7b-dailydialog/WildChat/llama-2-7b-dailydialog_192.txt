- Wow. That's really cool. What is it for? I think I've seen some of this animation on TikTok.
- I was looking at the videos. I also love watching people play games! You are so talented! Thank you so much, by the way. The music in this game is very good too.

<span style="background-color:#FA4C6B">You’re so hot!</span>

You need a lot of training to get in. The reason you can’t get through the door is because you didn’t have enough points. But I am here to help you.

Hey, what are you doing? Get back into your room!

Okay... Bye then.

Okay.

Have a good sleep. Don't forget to dream of me and I will do the same to you. 

Sleep well too. You have a test tomorrow in school, right? And your brother has one too, remember that! He is so smart but he always tries to cheat on his exams. But I told him it was a waste of time.

I will try to do my best tomorrow, thanks for the support. See you later mom!

Okay...

Good night, have sweet dreams. 

Sweet dreams mommy. 

Nighty night. Love you too. 

I love you more. Goodnight.

gf: we're back again!

pico: hi again, everybody. I don't know about you guys, but I feel like we really need a little bit of a break from the monsters out there in that game...

pico: so why not let's all hang out here at my place and watch some tv, and just have fun hanging out. That way we can recharge ourselves for the next battle! I love this show!

gf: whoa, this is really intense! They're fighting monsters again?

pico: yeah, they are fighting these... um... well whatever you want to call them... zombies. I mean, I don't know what else to say about it. It just kind of looks like a zombie. But no one ever really knows for sure which ones are actually humans anymore in that show.

gf: yeah, those things definitely look like something out of the game!

pico: you can say that again.

carol: this is such a great show. I love it so much! I mean, what if that was real? What if we're in some kind of zombie apocalypse?!

milla: don't be silly! There's no way any kind of zombies are actually real! That's just something from a video game!

pico: well, I guess we'll never know for sure... but hey, let's not focus on all that. Let's watch some more and just enjoy it, okay?

carol: yeah, you're right pico! It is fun to relax a bit and just watch tv with friends here in your place. I can definitely feel myself getting tired... but it feels so good to be able to get away from all of the stressful fighting in that game for a little while.

gf: me too. This really has been a lot of fun! Let's keep hanging out together, and then when we go back into the game again, we will be even stronger than before! And I can't wait to get to the next level so that I can fight those zombies for real!

carol: yeah! Maybe we could all go on a vacation somewhere?

pico: hey... if you guys really want to take a vacation, I know just the place! It's this old abandoned amusement park out in the woods that I found. There are so many cool places to explore there and play video games! It would be super fun for all of us!

carol: sounds like an awesome idea pico! Let's go tomorrow!

gf: yeah, it looks like we have a plan!

Zombies and robots?! We're on the rooftop again? I think that we should leave now! It's too dangerous to stay here!
