Well, I don't know.  But I can tell you how to find out:

```sh
$ man -l hdparm
```

```txt
       -f format
              Specifies the file system format of the device. The format must be
              specified in the form used by fdisk(8). See fdisk(8) for a complete list
              of supported formats.
