I have created an angular directive for that. You can just add this to your template file to use it. 

```html
<ul class="favourite-products">
    <li ng-repeat="product in products" class="item"  product="product"
        favourite-products="product.id as id" (click)="toggleFavourite(item)"
        *ngIf="!favouriteProducts[id]"><div class="favourite-icon" ng-class="{'active': isFavorited(item)}"></div> {{ product }}</li> 
</ul>
```
And then in your component:
```typescript
import {Component, OnInit} from '@angular/core';
@Component({
    templateUrl: 'app/product-list/product-list.component.html'
})
export class ProductListComponent implements OnInit {
    products: IProduct[]; // Products will be passed here and you can add this in your component template or pass it to the directive by adding *ngFor="let product of products" 
    favouriteProducts = {};   // This is an empty object that you can use as a dictionary for storing favourite products
    constructor() { }
}
```
and then you can simply add this code to your component:
```typescript
addFavourite(product) {
        if (this.products.some((p) => p._id === product._id)) {
            delete this.favouriteProducts[product._id];
        } else {
            this.favouriteProducts[product._id] = true;
        }
    }
```
