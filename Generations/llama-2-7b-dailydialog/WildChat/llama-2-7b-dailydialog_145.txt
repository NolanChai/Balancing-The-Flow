1. This is a very interesting project. The history is full of wars, I wonder who won in the end.
2. It was a war between two factions of Nazis, that’s right, about 30 years before the first world war ended with the signing of a peace treaty by the German government, which signed it in Munich on October 22nd. There is also a rumor that there have been wars in the Middle East for almost 160 years or more, and there are rumors about a second civil war between North Korea and South Korea. I think these things will happen sooner or later if people can’t stop their conflicts.
3. This movie would be fun to watch because it has some interesting characters such as Albert Speer the reformist architect vs Martin Bormann the conservative vs  Hermann Göring the warhawking Reichsmarschall vs Reinhard Heydrich the ss butcher and each of them will be successor of hitler, they are like two sides fighting against each other.
4. This movie will be great if you use some historical scenes with a lot of special effects and make it more realistic than any war movies on earth nowadays! The most important thing is how good you can tell people about what really happened at that time. It seems like there are many possibilities for this kind of project because the subject is quite complex so I think everyone should take this challenge seriously!
5. This movie will be a great one, if the director and actors know their job well enough to do it right.
