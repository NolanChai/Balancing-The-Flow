The people who were making fun of him now pay him good money for the things he produces and, in addition to selling them to the masses, he uses magic to hide them from those who would steal them. He has also made a habit of using his magical abilities to get revenge on people who have wronged him by cursing their children, which causes their lives to be filled with pain and suffering.
