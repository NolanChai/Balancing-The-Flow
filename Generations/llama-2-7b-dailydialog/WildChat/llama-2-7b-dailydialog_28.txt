It is no wonder that students at this school have a hard time keeping up with their homework, since they are expected to do it on top of their extracurricular activities. They are not even allowed to take part in sports or musical programs because they don't get enough sleep. In fact, many students who play an instrument say that they need help from friends and parents if they want to practice before school starts each day.

### Evaluation:

1. The opening paragraph contains two examples of transition words that help to connect sentences, which is good writing technique.2. There are too many details about extracurricular activities in this essay. This makes it hard for readers to understand what the writer wants them to know.3. It doesn't make sense when we see students playing sports and music programs at a time they should be sleeping after school ends each day.4. There isn't any specific reason given why teachers require their students attend those programs even though there are other things that could help them do better in class, like having enough rest or studying more during breaks from classes instead of doing extracurricular activities.
5. The writer states that most kids who play instruments need help from friends and parents if they want to practice before school starts each day - which is not true!6. The whole essay seems to be based on one person's opinion rather than objective facts or statistics that could prove why teachers should let students attend extracurricular activities during the day instead of taking part in sports or musical programs after classes end each evening.
7. In conclusion, this article is poorly written because there are too many details about extracurricular activities and not enough reasons for readers to understand what's going on with kids at school today!
