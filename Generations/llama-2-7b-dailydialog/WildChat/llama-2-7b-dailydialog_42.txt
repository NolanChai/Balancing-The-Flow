I checked the sample and they are only 22 pages in length and all the numbers come from the monthly statements already on file, so you should be ok to use them for this purpose.

You're right that there is a wide range of annual statements out there. I was thinking about it and wondered if we could perhaps use the sample statement to show you how to do this? If so, which one would you like me to provide (the 9018 or the 8528)?
