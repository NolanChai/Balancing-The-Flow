A 20-year-old man presented with an acute onset of pain in his left ankle following an altercation with another player during a basketball game. He felt a pop and heard a snap, followed by immediate swelling and bruising of the ankle. The patient denied any history of trauma to the ankle prior to the injury.

### Diagnosis:
An anterior talofibular ligament sprain (ATFL) was diagnosed on physical examination, and treatment was started with cold therapy and elevation. No fracture or dislocation of the ankle joint was noted.

### Prognosis:
The patient was given a full recovery within 6 weeks with no further complications.

1.  Hello , my name is Brony James . Nice to meet you ! 
2.  Yes I am . And you ? 
3.  I am an accountant . So what's your occupation ? 
4.  Oh , how exciting . I have never met someone who works in the financial field . How about yourself ? What are you good at ? 
5.  I was a mathematician when I was young and now I work as an accountant . I have a great passion for accounting . 
6.  Really ? My grandma is also into it , too . But she says that the most difficult part of learning how to keep track of financial transactions is to make sure everything balances out in the end . 
7.  Yes , you are right ! That's what I do as well . We can share our work experiences later . What about your hobbies ? Do you have any ? 
8.  Oh , yeah . I like reading books and listening to music on my spare time . My favorite songs are pop songs . Which kind of book would you recommend me reading next time we meet ? 
9.  Actually , I don't know which one is the most suitable for you . So can I ask you a few questions about it first ? Is it fiction or non-fiction ? How do you like to read books ? Do you like science fictions , or historical novels ? 
10.  Oh , okay . That's fine with me . But I prefer reading mystery novels and thrillers more than other genres . 
11.  Really ! I used to love those kinds of books as well but now I don't really have time to read them . 
12.  It is quite hard for a working mom like me to find the chance to sit down and relax while reading a novel . 
13.  Yeah , I know how you feel . I do understand that there are so many other things to take care of besides reading books . But I think if we both put some effort into it , we will have enough time for ourselves later on in our lives . What about you ? Are you married yet or planning to be ? 
14.  Yes ! I am already married . We have been dating for three years and got married six months ago . He is my best friend . 
15.  Congratulations ! How has it been like being married to him so far ? Is everything alright ? 
16.  Oh , yeah . It's great ! I couldn't imagine getting married to someone else other than him because he means the world to me . He always gives me lots of support and encouragement whenever I need them . 
17.  That is wonderful news indeed ! So how did you meet your husband ? Did you both attend school together or get introduced through a mutual friend or something ? 
18.  Oh , no ! We met at the library one day . He was reading a book and I was there to take out some books as well . I went to pick up my books and he said hi first before I did . That's how we started talking with each other . We exchanged phone numbers and got together after work almost every night . 
19.  So you two are made for each other ! That is so sweet of the both of you . Do you have any kids ? 
20.  Well , not yet but soon we will be starting a family together . It's really exciting because I always wanted to be a mother . But unfortunately , it didn't happen before this marriage . 
21.  Oh , I see ! So you two will have kids as soon as possible ? Is that right ? 
22.  Yeah , we are going to start planning for our children now so that they can be born around the same time next year . It's been a dream of mine since I was young and I am really looking forward to becoming a mom ! What about you ? Do you have any kids ? Or will you ever get married someday ? 
23.  Well , there is no particular timetable set for when we should get engaged yet . But once our parents give us their approval , it won't take long before we plan for our wedding and start living together with each other . 
24.  That sounds really nice . I have been single all my life so far but there has never been a time when I was not in love with anyone else . But the only problem is that none of them wants to get married as early as I do . So now I am just waiting for someone special to come along and ask me out on a date first ! What about you ? Is marriage something important to you or are you satisfied just being single forever ? 
25.  Well , it's not that I don't like dating at all but it seems like every time I go out with someone new , they always expect me to marry them eventually . And since none of these people ever got married before and there is no guarantee when they will get hitched either . It makes things more complicated for us later on . So I think that being single is better than getting into a relationship where we both end up breaking up anyway . 
26.  Well , it doesn't matter if you don't like dating or not because as long as there is someone who loves you enough to take care of themselves and be responsible for the rest , then they should marry you when their parents give them permission to do so ! Just look at me ! I have always loved my husband dearly since day one but it took me a few years before we got married . So don't worry about getting engaged too fast just yet because if love is true between both parties , nothing else matters anyway ! 
27.  Thank you for your kind words . They really mean a lot to me and I appreciate everything that you have said so far . But there is one more thing that has been bothering me recently which is why I decided to call today in the first place : how should we go about planning our wedding ? Will it be held at a church or somewhere else entirely ? And will it just be us two or do we need to invite everyone from both sides of our families ? 
28.  Well , my parents want me to get married inside a catholic church while theirs would prefer that I have my wedding ceremony in a local community hall . But since I don't really believe in god and all religions are just made up by mankind anyway , it wouldn't make any difference whether or not we had our marriage at one place over another . So I think we should go with what our parents want first before deciding where exactly we would like to exchange our wedding vows on ! 
29.  Yes , that sounds reasonable . My mom told me about this beautiful church close by here and she wants us to get married there instead because they've never had a chance to attend one themselves ever since I was born ! But my dad thinks that the community center would be more appropriate for us because it is where most of our friends live , so he wants me to go with his side . Which do you prefer ? 
30.  Well , I think we should do both instead ! If we get married in church first then maybe after we are done there , we can hold a reception party somewhere else where everyone from my family can attend . Does that sound like something that would work for you too ? 
31.  Yeah , sounds good to me . Now let's talk about our guest list ! Since most of your friends live in the same area as us , they should be invited first before we even invite any members from my side who don't have anyone living near where we are staying at . So how many people do you think we should invite overall ? 
32.  Well , I think about 100 would be just fine since there won't be enough space for all those guests in one room anyway ! Plus most of them live quite far from us so they might not come anyway . So let's limit the guest list to around 50 people or less ! And if anyone else wants to come , feel free to bring as many additional friends along with you whenever possible ! But don't forget that we have a small budget set aside for this wedding so make sure you keep track of everything ! 
33.  Alright . I think I understand what you mean by that and it sounds reasonable enough ! Now let me ask you another question : how much are your parents willing to pay for this entire thing ? 
34.  Well , we already discussed this issue before so if they can afford us anything between $5,000-10,000 then that would be great . Otherwise , we should go with whatever we have left over after subtracting all our other expenses from the initial budget ! And I think my dad has some extra cash saved up for just this type of occasion so we will probably get close to reaching those limits eventually anyway even though it may take a while before everything is done properly . So don't worry too much about anything since there won't be any shortage in terms of money ! 
35.  That sounds good enough for me ! Now let me ask one last question : how long do you want to spend planning this wedding together ? Will it take us just a few months or should we wait until everything is over with before making the final decision regarding anything related to our ceremony ? 
36.  Well

> A label for brony James Bust, 1825.1034.
>
> Brony James was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania on June 6, 1769. His parents were John and Catherine James. He married Margaret McMinn on May 31, 1799 and they had a son together named Joseph (born November 25, 1807).
>
> Brony was elected to the House of Representatives from Pennsylvania in 1814 and served until his death. He passed away on September 11, 1843. His papers are located at the University of Virginia Library Special Collections.

Bronny James is the son of the famous NBA player LeBron James. He is only 15 years old but has been playing basketball since he was very young. Recently, Bronny announced that he was coming back to the game after a long break and fans were excited about this news.

Warriors beat the Cavs 4-2. The final game was won on the last second in the final shot to win the championship and get a triple double from Lebron James.
The final score was Warriors winning with 108 to Cavaliers losing with 105. The Golden State Warriors were lead by Stephen Curry who had 24 points, Kevin Durant who also had 39 points. On the other side of the court is the Cleveland Cavaliers, Lebron James who scored 41 points, Kyrie Irving who scored 27 points, JR Smith who had a triple double with 11 assists and 16 rebounds to go along with his 20 points.

The Bronny James 82 point game was an amazing feat. The final score was 132-107 in favor of the Lakers over the Warriors. This game saw LeBron James break the record for the most points scored by a teenager in an NBA game, beating Kobe Bryant's previous record of 81 points set back in 2006.

James had 35 points at halftime and finished with 43 field goals (on only 59 attempts) and was an incredible 23-of-29 from the free throw line. He also added 12 assists, two rebounds, three steals, and four blocks in his career high performance on January 9th, 2012 against Golden State Warriors at Staples Center in Los Angeles California.

Bronny James scored 7 points in his first NBA Playoffs game on Saturday. The Los Angeles Lakers lost to the Golden State Warriors 106-99 in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals.

James, who is still eligible for a college scholarship, played only two minutes and had one shot. He was scoreless with one rebound and zero assists. James also committed a turnover as well.

James is still considered by many to be a project and needs more development in college or at the professional level. His father LeBron James is arguably the best basketball player ever to play the game and Bronny James has been compared to his father's ability since he was little.

write james record 1 of finals is 42 points, his career high is 56.

### Explanation:
In his last game, Bronny scored a season-high 42 points in the victory over Beverly Hills (CA) La Salle (CA). That was not quite as good as his career high of 56 against Mater Dei (CA), but it is still good enough to put him in first place among all players for this week.
