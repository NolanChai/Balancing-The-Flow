The program is good but not that easy to complete because the requirements are really high. I am required to have research and teaching skills, which is what they expect from PhD candidates. I also need to work hard on my dissertation in order to defend it successfully. Being a doctoral student requires me to make significant sacrifices of my time and effort in terms of study.
