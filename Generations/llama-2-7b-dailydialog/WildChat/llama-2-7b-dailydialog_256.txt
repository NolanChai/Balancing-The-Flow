Doctor: “Alright, Natsuki, let’s have a look at your scan results. Do you want to take a peek?”

Natsuki: (shyly looking at the screen) “Oh my god! She looks so big!”

Doctor: “Well, that’s because she is very big for her age. Her growth rate is very normal though.”

Natsuki: “I can’t believe this is happening to me. It seems like yesterday when I was just starting university.”

Doctor: “Don’t worry about it, Natsuki. Babies grow at different speeds and there are no two children that are alike, so try not to compare your daughter too much with other children of the same age.”

Natsuki: (excited) “What? What did you say?”

Doctor: “Don’t worry about it. Babies grow at different speeds and there are no two children that are alike, so try not to compare your daughter too much with other children of the same age.”

Natsuki: (nervously) “Oh my gosh! I can’t believe this is happening to me. It seems like yesterday when I was just starting university…”

Natsuki: “Whew, that was a bit nerve-wracking. I think it’s time to go home and rest now.”

Sayori: “Okay. But before you leave, can you help me with this? I’ve been trying all morning to get this stuff out of the box, but I can’t seem to figure it out.”

Natsuki: (excitedly) “Oh, sure! This is going to be so much fun!”
