Heather Schmidt is an elegant 49-year old woman. She was very upset when her daughter Susan was involved in the accident that has left her with bilateral hip spica casts. The mother has been taking care of her daughter for over a month now, since she got out of the hospital. She tries to do as much as possible herself but sometimes it is just too much even for an energetic and determined woman like Heather.

She goes to the medical store to buy some special equipment that will make Susan's life easier and more comfortable when she will be confined to a wheelchair due to her injuries, but she ends up buying a lot of things: a special wheeled bed with adjustable parts; a hoist with a special frame for moving Susan; a highly adjustable orthopedic bed with an electronic system that allows Heather to move the headrest and leg rest independently; reaching aids for easy access to furniture and drawers in case Susan needs something, plus a variety of adult diapers.

The patient is a 60 year old Caucasian female who presents to the emergency room via ambulance with complaints of difficulty breathing. She was found by her family at home sitting up in bed unable to breathe and began having tingling, numbness and loss of consciousness in her extremities shortly before calling 911. The patient is now awake but confused and combative while being transported to the emergency room on a gurney. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath at rest, however she has an audible wheeze and has difficulty catching her breath when moving from lying down to sitting up in bed. 

Her past medical history is significant for hypertension controlled by lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide and hyperlipidemia. She is a cigarette smoker but does not drink alcohol and denies drug use. She is on no vitamins or supplements, her medications are as follows:
1. Lisinopril 20 mg daily
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg twice daily
3. Rosuvastatin 20 mg daily
4. Aspirin 81mg once a day

Her family history is significant for no medical problems and her social history is significant for smoking cigarettes, being on disability and not working due to multiple chronic health problems including hyperlipidemia, hypertension and congestive heart failure. She has 4 children (2 boys and two girls) with all of them having children of their own.

Physical examination findings include: blood pressure 176/90 mmHg, pulse rate is 86 beats per minute, respirations are 18 breaths per minute and heart rate is 95 bpm, temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), weight of 224 lb, height of 60 inches or 5 feet tall and BMI of 32.4 kg/m^2. There are no distended neck veins and her eyes are open but unfocused, dilated to almost fully constricted and she appears confused when answering questions. She also has a wheeze and cannot sit up in bed without gasping for air after about 10 seconds of breathing at that position. Lungs are clear with no crackles or wheezes on auscultation, cardiac examination is normal without any murmurs or rubs being heard with an S2 gallop present on palpitation. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender without organ enlargement.
