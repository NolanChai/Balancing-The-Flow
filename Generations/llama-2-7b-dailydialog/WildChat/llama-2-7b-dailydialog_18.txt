Write a script that introduces the VT Hokie football team for the 2007 season. You should start with a lead in that tells your audience how well they did last year (record, conference championships) and where their hopes lie this season. Then you want to go into more detail on individual players -- starting with the quarterback and then each position group after that. You need to cover offensive and defensive lines, receivers, running backs, linebackers, and DBs (defensive backs). You don't have to mention all of these players if you feel there are some who you know won't see much playing time this season. For example: if you think the third string quarterback has a good chance of starting at least one game but it's not very likely that he will start more than that, then feel free to leave him out -- but mention him briefly in passing if you want to (or just say that your audience should look for the third string QB when he comes in during the game). You also don't have to go into great detail about each player -- just a couple of sentences on each should suffice.
