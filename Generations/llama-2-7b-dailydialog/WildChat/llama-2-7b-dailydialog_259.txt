I know, but it’s a bit weird that I am doing this kind of writing about Power Rangers, TMNT, and My Hero Academia, and I need someone to help me write something for the story, and I hope you would give me your permission, and thanks for taking my request.

When I read your prompt it made me think of the scene from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles when they first found out who they were and what they could do. In this case they have just discovered that Raph is their big brother (even though he was only like 5 minutes older than them) and they had a lot of catching up to do in the training department, as well as some time with him. He is very quiet and reserved while all of his brothers are talkers by nature so it would be very hard for Raph to keep up with any kind of conversation if he weren’t used to keeping himself relatively calm. I think that this part should have a bit more dialogue since Raph really only has one way to express his feelings and that is through action not words.
