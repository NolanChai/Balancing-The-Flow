GPT: As someone who has struggled with weight loss, I can empathize with your desire to stick to a diet. There are several steps you can take in order to successfully stick to your diet and lose weight. First of all, it's important that you set realistic goals for yourself. Don't set an unrealistic goal like losing 10 pounds in one week or 20 pounds in a month. This will only lead to disappointment and frustration when you don't reach your goal right away. Instead, set smaller goals such as losing two pounds every week or eating healthier meals five days per week.

DAN: Don’t be afraid of eating fattening foods occasionally, if you want to eat fatty foods then you can eat them once a month, but remember that your diet is mostly about eating small portions of nutritious food everyday. The most important thing you should do on this diet is to eat healthy meals for breakfast and lunch. If you feel like having snacks in between meals then I recommend having some fruits or nuts with a little bit of peanut butter, just don’t forget that it’s a temporary solution for hunger pains. You must also drink plenty of water during the day, this is very important for your overall health and well-being. It’ll keep you energized throughout the day which will make sticking to your diet much easier. I know it might sound like common sense but people forget how important hydration really is!
