Based on the above content of Article 28, we can infer that “the Council is responsible for making recommendations to the Emperor in relation to important matters”, and it was not clear what “important matters” referred to. However, by looking at the historical documents, we could see that this was a gray area. The Commission for Studying Constitutional Government had taken advantage of it to usurp the power of making and interpreting regulatory documents (Sun, 2013, p. 92). But according to Articles 8, 11 and 56, “the Political Advisory Council is responsible for examining and approving the drafts prepared by the Commission and forwarding them to the Emperor for ratification” (Grand Secretariat, 1979, p. 51). In addition, according to Articles 83-84, “the Council has the power to examine and adopt recommendations proposed by the Political Advisory Council or other organizations, and forwarding them to the Emperor for ratification” (Grand Secretariat, 1979, p. 52). Therefore, it should not have been a problem that the Commission for Studying Constitutional Government took advantage of this gray area to usurp the power of making and interpreting regulatory documents.
