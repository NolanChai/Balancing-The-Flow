Hey! This is my first challenge and I'm really excited for it!! Let me tell ya, there is nothing like the feeling of accomplishing something new, especially if its a new way to do something like this. So lets get started with some ideas!

I think that one way you could do this would be by using a bunch of people and a bunch of water balloons, then getting them all to throw the balloon at once so it hits someone on the head and they're hit in the face with a wet squishy balloon. It wouldn't really hurt them because they probably wouldn't be expecting something like that, but it would definitely make them jump and get their adrenaline pumping!

Another thing you could do is get a bunch of people together in one area and have one person in the middle of everyone. You then have all the others take turns throwing a ball at this guy to try to hit him with it, and when they hit him he has to jump up into the air which makes him really dizzy and gets his adrenaline pumping!

If you don't want anyone to get hurt or have any water balloons, then maybe you could use something like a big fan and blow it in their face while they are wearing a blindfold. This might be just as effective as the other two things because it will definitely make them jump and get their adrenaline pumping!
