Detailed instructions were given to you for how to complete this task.  Please adhere to the structure and format requirements as described above.  Your assignment should be at least three paragraphs in length, with each prompt formatted according to these guidelines.  Avoid using the word "description" or ":", and write one sentence for each prompt.  Include a realistic photographic style prompt with lens type and size.
                            
                            Separate different prompts with two new lines, as shown in the example below:
                            
                            /imagine prompt: A young girl in a red dress playing with her toy horse on a bright sunny day in a meadow filled with flowers and grasses. The toy horse is galloping around happily with its mane blowing in the breeze, while the girl sits atop it laughing and giggling. A gentle breeze rustles the leaves of the trees behind them, creating a soft background noise as they play together. -ar 1:1 --v 5
                            /imagine prompt: A stunning landscape with a lush green mountain in the background, a winding river in the foreground, and a couple relaxing by a tree on a hot summer day. The woman wears a white dress with a blue flower pattern while her partner wears a blue shirt with light blue jeans and sneakers. They sit under the shade of the tree, enjoying their time together as they watch the river flow by. -ar 1:1 --v 5
                            
                            The response will be graded based on your ability to adhere to these requirements, with a lower score assigned for each prompt that fails to meet these expectations.  This task requires you to carefully follow these instructions and produce well-written prompts according to the required format.  A prompt is considered not to have been completed if it does not meet all of these requirements or contains grammatical errors, poor sentence structure, and/or any other writing issues that impede understanding of the intended message.
                            
                            The response will be graded as follows:
                            
                            [1] = 0 to 2 points if the prompt is not formatted according to these requirements.
                            [2] = 3 to 5 points for following all requirements but containing grammatical errors, poor sentence structure, and/or any other writing issues that impede understanding of the intended message.
                            [3] = 6 to 8 points if the prompt is fully formatted according to these requirements without any grammar or writing issues.
