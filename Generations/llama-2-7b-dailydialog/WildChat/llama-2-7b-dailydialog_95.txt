1. Hyperglycemia increases the blood volume of the body resulting in an increase in extracellular fluid. The increased blood volume also dilates the vasculature which causes a reduction in arterial blood pressure. This decrease in blood pressure further decreases Na+ and Cl- ions, resulting in hypernatremia and hypochloremic metabolic acidosis.
2. Hyperglycemia increases glucose production in the kidney leading to increased production of urine, which results in a reduction in extracellular fluid. This is often accompanied by increased renal excretion of potassium, which leads to hypokalemia.
3. In addition to increased urinary output and renal potassium secretion, hyperglycemia also causes an increase in glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubules of the kidneys. This leads to an increase in glomerular filtration rate which can lead to elevated levels of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN).

**Increases**

### Reason:

The normal pH range for blood is 7.35-7.45 (acidotic) and the bicarbonate ion concentration in this range is about **15 mEq/L**, when a patient presents with metabolic acidosis, it means that there is less carbon dioxide removed from blood and therefore more CO2 stays in blood.
This decreases the HCO3 level as the following equation shows:
```
H + ions from acid will replace bicarbonate to make carbonic acid, which decomposes to form two hydrogen ions (H+) and one molecule of carbon dioxide (CO2).
HCO3- ions from bicarbonate will react with H+ ions to produce hydrogen carbonate which dissociates to form the same two ions, H+ and CO2.
Therefore, if there is more acid in blood than can be balanced by the available bicarbonate, then some of the bicarbonate will react with the extra protons (H+) to make carbonic acid, which decomposes into hydrogen ions and carbon dioxide.
```
As a result, **the pH decrease** which lead to metabolic acidosis and therefore an increase in HCO3 level is seen.

Ms. Baga-at has productive cough with expectoration of pus-filled sputum. She also developed chest pain that was associated with inspiration, and fever. The findings suggest possible bacterial infection involving bronchioles and alveoli. She is likely to have pneumonia.

* 23-year-old female
* admitted with right shoulder pain, swelling and mild fever. She had a history of fall on ice one month ago.

### Questions:
1. What are the pertinent clinical findings?
2. What is your differential diagnosis?
3. What diagnostic test do you recommend? Why?
4. What treatment should you provide for this patient? 
5. How would you monitor and follow up with her condition?

The patient is a 63-year-old female who presented to her doctor with complaints that she had been experiencing difficulty breathing for some time. She said that during this time, she was not able to sleep because she felt as if there were something in her throat and she could not swallow. The patient also noted that whenever she attempted to breathe, it was hard and caused a painful burning sensation at the back of her throat. In addition, the patient said that she had been coughing up yellowish-green mucus for several months as well.

The patient's history indicates that she has a long history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She was diagnosed with COPD about 10 years ago and is currently on oxygen therapy due to her worsening symptoms. The patient also said that she had been taking steroids for several months prior to her visit but did not think they were helping much at all.

The physical examination revealed a clear left-shifted heart sounds with an S1 heart murmur present at the right sternal edge as well as decreased breath sounds on inspiration and expiration due to air trapping in both lungs secondary to emphysema, which is also characteristic of COPD (Rang et al., 2012). Additionally, there were signs of cardiovascular compromise present including jugular venous distension and bilateral lower extremity edema with pitting. The patient had a normal body temperature, blood pressure, and respiratory rate during this visit but was noted to be tachypneic (>25 breaths per minute) due to her respiratory distress from COPD (Rang et al., 2012).

diagnosed with the right lower back pain caused by L4-5 disc herniation.

we treat with hormones that stimulate insulin release in a dose-dependent manner.

### Explanation:
The patient has type 2 diabetes mellitus and will need to be on oral antidiabetic medications, but this will not be adequate for long term management of the condition. The patient is also overweight and thus needs to lose weight as well. Treatment with an insulin-sensitizing agent in conjunction with a diet and exercise program is preferred if possible. The patient should also have his/her blood pressure controlled to help prevent end organ damage.

Increased rate and depth

### Rationale:

The ABO blood type and Rh factor are determined by the presence or absence of certain antigens on red blood cells. A positive result indicates that an individual has the particular antigen, whereas a negative result suggests its absence. The most common methods for determining these types and factors include direct coombs testing, immunohematology screening panels, and typing panels (e.g., anti-A or anti-B).

Gastritis with possible ulcer.

Abdominal pain can be very difficult to diagnose and treat, but there are some common signs and symptoms that may point to a specific underlying condition. The most important thing is to take your time and assess all of the possible causes in order to find an effective treatment option. If you suspect that this patient's abdominal pain could be caused by something serious or life-threatening, it would be best for them to seek medical attention right away rather than try self-diagnosis at home

### Assessment:

When assessing this patient’s abdominal pain we need to first consider what might be causing the discomfort. Is it related to eating or drinking something? Has there been an injury or surgery in that area recently which may have caused nerve damage? Was any recent sexual activity involved? All these factors will help narrow down possible causes of abdominal pain

### Response:

Secondly, we must make sure that nothing serious is going on such as internal bleeding from ulcers or other gastrointestinal issues (e.g., appendicitis). If our patient’s condition does not improve after treatment then they should be seen by their doctor right away because if something isn't treated quickly enough it can lead to severe complications that could require hospitalization or even death

### Assessment:

Next we need to look at how much time has passed since our patient’s last meal so we know what symptoms they might be experiencing after eating certain foods. We also want to ask questions about their daily habits such as drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes which could affect how long it takes for stomach contents to move through your digestive system

### Response:

If our patient has no history of gastritis or other inflammatory conditions then there may be an issue with their diet. For example, if they eat too much fatty foods or high sugar snacks then that could cause problems because these types of meals tend to sit in your stomach longer which causes discomfort as well as bloating and gas

### Assessment:

We also need to check for any signs of constipation by asking about bowel movements. If our patient is having difficulty passing stools then they might have some sort of obstruction in their digestive tract such as diverticulitis or colon cancer so it would be best if we called ahead and made an appointment with a gastroenterologist specialist who can perform more advanced tests on the patient's bloodwork

### Response:

If there is nothing wrong then maybe our patient just has a little gas trapped inside of them which could cause some discomfort but usually goes away after eating something light like crackers or toast. If however they don’t feel any better after following these recommendations then it's time for us as medical professionals take care of this problem ourselves

the people who made these choices are not aware that they have already lost their freedom
  we're trying to educate them so that they understand the nature of this choice and why it's a bad one
  they also don't realize that they have limited options because they are in a contractual relationship with a government agency that is holding them there against their will
  these people are stuck without access to good legal counsel or much money for food, so if we help them out by providing meals it will make the difference between surviving and living on the street
  
### Question:
  can you talk more about how this is not a moral obligation but rather an expression of human rights?

### Response:
  yes, we think that people have a fundamental right to be free and in control of their own lives
    it's also a civil duty to help those who are suffering or at risk for being exploited by the system
    we hope that this will inspire others to do good as well
  
### Question:
  what would you say if someone accused you of taking advantage of these people?

### Response:
  i'd say that the people who are volunteering their time and energy to help these people are doing them a favor. It's not exploitative, it's helping in a way that people can actually make an impact on things. This is how we make the world better for everyone.

Yes. Gastritis is the most common cause of duodenal ulcers and H. pylori is implicated in many cases. I would probably suggest testing for H. Pylori, as well as performing an upper endoscopy to rule out other causes such as malignancy or a benign lesion (eg. angiectasia).

The patient was hypertensive and had a past history of diabetes, he also complained of chest pain at the same time. There were other symptoms that led to diagnose heart attack such as shortness of breath, abdominal pains, nausea and vomiting. The patient also has a family history of heart attack, so all these factors put together lead me to think it was an AMI.
