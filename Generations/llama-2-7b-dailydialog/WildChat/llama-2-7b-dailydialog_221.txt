Hanako: “I have no idea what you’re talking about, Sayori. Do you need to explain?”

Miku: “Oh, okay. My mom always warned me that I had a stomach of steel. Well, she was right!”

Rin: “What do you mean by that? Is it something bad?”

Miku: “No…not exactly…It’s just…well…I have some good news for everyone.”

Hanako: “You’re pregnant?” (laughing)
