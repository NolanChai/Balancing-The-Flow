1. You need to know the skills and knowledge of the quality assurance job role requirements, as well as how the relevant industry operates in terms of regulatory requirements.
2. It is essential to have excellent communication skills so you can convey any issues clearly to other staff members.
3. The ability to manage your time effectively is also important for this role because you’ll need to meet tight deadlines and be able to prioritise tasks accordingly.
4. You must demonstrate initiative when dealing with problems that arise during projects, such as identifying solutions before being asked by your team leader or manager. 
5. Strong problem-solving skills are essential because you might have to deal with unexpected issues or changes in plans at short notice without enough time for planning ahead of time due to unforeseen circumstances outside of work (e.g., illness).
6. You should also be able to adapt quickly when things don’t go according to plan—for example, if there are delays caused by external factors like weather or supplier issues—and remain calm under pressure even when others may become frustrated or angry because their schedules have been thrown off balance by these unexpected developments
7. You should also be able to work independently without direct supervision from your manager most of the time since this role requires you to complete tasks on your own schedule within deadlines set forth by upper management personnel based upon company policy guidelines established beforehand during orientation training sessions held during new hire onboarding periods
8. You need to know how to communicate well with both internal and external stakeholders including suppliers, vendors, customers or clients who may have different communication styles than yours (either spoken words alone versus written language). It also helps if you know when it’s appropriate for each type of communication method based upon the context at hand so there aren't any miscommunications due to misinterpretation between parties involved during conversations held over phone calls/video conferencing sessions etcetera.”
9. You should have good organisational skills so that everything related directly with this position can be kept organised without becoming too scattered around different locations throughout your workspace environment which makes things more difficult later on down the line when trying out new processes because they weren't planned properly ahead of time instead being thrown together haphazardly once again.” 
10. You should also know how to use a computer well enough that you can navigate through software programs such as Microsoft Word (MS Word) or Excel (Microsoft Excel), which are necessary for completing tasks related with quality assurance jobs; this includes having the ability write documents and reports effectively while maintaining proper formatting standards set forth by upper management personnel beforehand during orientation training sessions held during new hire onboarding periods etcetera.”
