It is an empty layer.

I'll teach you! First of all, the key point is to find the root. You know that, if a number is a perfect square, its factors must be 1 and itself. And the product of two numbers must be divisible by their sum. Thus, 216 must be a product of some factor pair, because it is divisible by 27, which is the sum of the prime factors in 216. Now we can see that the only square whose factors are 1 and itself is 2^4=16, so this number might be our target. Try to prove it!
