Write a script to add or remove products from the inventory. This will be a command line program that prompts the user for an action, either "add" or "remove".  The program should then ask if the user wants to see all products or only those added to the inventory. If no command is given, it should display all products. It should also verify the quantity of each product on hand and display a list of product names and quantities.
