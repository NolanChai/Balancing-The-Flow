(Inside Yuri’s room…)

Yuri: “Ah! MONIKA!! SAYORI!! NATSUKI!!! What are you doing in here?!”

(The girls turn around to see her in the doorway, and they jump with surprise. She’s clutching her stomach as she grimaces in pain.)

Sayori: (worried) “Yuri…are you alright?”

Yuri: “I-I’m fine! Don’t worry about me!”

Natsuki: “Are you sure? I don’t think you look good.”

Monika: “Yuri, let us take a closer look. We need to make sure nothing is wrong.”

(The girls approach Yuri and gently touch her head.)

Sayori: (worried) “Yuri, what’s happening? Why are you in so much pain?”

Natsuki: (also worried) “Do you have a fever? Your skin is hot to the touch.”

(Yuri bites her lip and looks around the room nervously.)

Yuri: “I-It’s nothing…it’s not that serious. I promise!”

Sayori: (concerned) “But your face looks like you’ve been through hell.”

Natsuki: “Please let us examine you properly. We want to make sure you’re okay.”

(Yuri sighs and finally allows the girls to check her over.)

Monika: (looking closely at Yuri) “Well…your face looks a bit swollen, and there are bruises on your wrists. Are those from restraints?”

Yuri: “W-What are you talking about? I’m fine! Nothing is wrong!”

(Sayori and Natsuki look at each other in concern.)

Natsuki: “Huh, you’re hiding something.”
