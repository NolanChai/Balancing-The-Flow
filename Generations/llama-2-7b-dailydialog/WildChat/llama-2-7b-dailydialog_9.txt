In my opinion "Chopin: Desire for Love" is the best TV series I have ever seen. It's a mixture of genres. It has mystery, romance, comedy, tragedy... But mostly it is an emotional experience. Every time I watch it, I can feel my heart beating faster and tears coming to my eyes. The cast is amazing; the chemistry between the actors is electric. And the music - it's like a symphony that goes through your soul!
The only thing that bothers me about this series is the lack of female lead roles. I wish there were more women in power positions and not just background characters or love interests for male protagonists.
But overall, "Chopin: Desire for Love" has been one of my favourite shows ever since it came out two years ago!
