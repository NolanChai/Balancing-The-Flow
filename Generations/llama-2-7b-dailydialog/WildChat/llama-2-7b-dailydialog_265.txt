I have no objection to your use of "Hermanubis". I suppose if you want to use "Hermes-Anubis," or something similar, that is also acceptable. But either way, my preference would be to avoid the term “hybrid” as it implies a blending of elements from two different deities and has been used by scholars for this purpose before (e.g., by Wiedemann 1985:36). As I pointed out in our earlier correspondence, I have no issue with the terms “syncretic” or “syncretistic.”
