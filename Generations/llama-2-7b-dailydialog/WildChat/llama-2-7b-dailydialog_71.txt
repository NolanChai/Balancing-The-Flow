A. The randomized blocks design can have equal numbers of subjects in each block as long as there are no repeated measures (e.g., subjects receiving both treatments).
B. This is incorrect because subjects are not assigned to treatments randomly within each block, but rather by age-group, so this does not apply here.
C. No, the design can have a control group with a randomized block design. 
D. A matched pairs design uses paired samples. Each subject receives both treatments and is compared to its own baseline, whereas in a randomized blocks design each subject receives only one treatment and is compared to its own baseline (i.e., the mean of all subjects' scores without receiving that treatment).
E. This is correct; it says that there are two groups: one group of subjects who receive Treatment A, while the other group receives Treatment B.

```python
import sys

if __name__ == '__main__':
    sys.stdout = sys.stderr = open(os.devnull, "w")
    print("Input a number: ", end="")
    num=int(raw_input())

    if 0 <= num < 8 and num >= 1:
        print ("Correct !", end="\n")
    else :
        print ("Incorrect !", end="\n")
```

* 1. We should sample from the population with replacement, and the sample size is $30$.
* 2. We will compute the sample mean $\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nx_i$ and the sample standard deviation $s = \sqrt{\frac{(n-1)}{(n-1)}\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{x_i-\bar{X}}{\sigma}\right)^2}$ where $\sigma^2=\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\frac{x_i}{\sigma}\right)^2$.
* 3. The null hypothesis is $H_0:\mu_0=69$ against $H_A: \mu>69$.
