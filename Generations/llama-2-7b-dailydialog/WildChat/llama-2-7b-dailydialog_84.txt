(That was a mouthful of names for all of your monsties! And I can already see from the way you describe them, that you're a skilled fighter. So let me introduce myself to you as well. My name is Gajau. I am a rider. I am not from Mahana Village - I was born in Dual Blades. But my village was attacked by Ancient Dragons and Elder Dragons, so I left to go explore the New World. During those adventures, I discovered something interesting about my monsters - they were able to evolve! At first, I wasn't sure what these new forms of monsties would look like - but one day, when I was in a cave fighting an Ancient Dragon, I saw a flash of light behind me. When I turned around and looked at it, my monster had evolved into a flying wyvern with wings that were white as snow! I was so excited by this discovery - which is why I named my flying wyvern, "Holy Flame". And now you know my story. So what are your plans for the future? Do you want to be a great monster rider or do you want to become something else?)
