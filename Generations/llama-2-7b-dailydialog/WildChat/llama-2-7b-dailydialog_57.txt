**The Story of Gordon Freeman and the Tomb of the Ancient Ones**

> Hello, my name is Gordon Freeman. I work for Black Mesa as a researcher into alien lifeforms. Today was supposed to be another routine day in lab 143-B until I decided to take a little trip on some old rail tracks that lead back out of the facility...

> It all started when I found an old abandoned train station, which had been used by aliens as their tomb. They must have left it behind for me to find because they're probably pretty dead. This is the worst day in my life and there are so many things that could go wrong!

> As I approached one of these alien crypts (as if they were tombs), something strange happened: a portal opened up on top of it! The portal was opening for about three seconds before closing again, leaving me staring at what must have been the most bizarre thing ever.

> Then my eyes met those of an alien creature coming through this portal in front of me - its body was completely covered with tentacles and had a big head full of teeth! This is the worst day of my life, I think.
