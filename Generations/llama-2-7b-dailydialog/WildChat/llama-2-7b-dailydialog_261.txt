The story of the man who was separated from his Korean daughter by a secret affair was very sad and touched many people's hearts. The audience found Paige a special young woman in Korea who has mixed blood from two countries. When she met Matthew for the first time, he did not believe she was his daughter. However, after finding out that she is really his daughter, it is revealed that her mother told her about her father while they were traveling on the plane back to the US. She found herself in a new country where her language skills are weak and she does not know anyone. When her friends talked with each other, Paige thought that she was the only Korean-American person in this place, so it made her feel different from others. However, when they had a talk about Korea, her friends were really interested in Korea and its culture. They also asked questions about life in Seoul and said that they wanted to visit Seoul someday. After all of these experiences, she felt like she is not alone any more and she can be happy here.

### Conclusion:

The main character Paige was a girl who grew up with her mother in Korea until she came to America and found out that she had two different fathers; one is Korean and another is American. She decided to find the father who is American and went back to New York where he lives. When she met him, they felt a little bit awkward because she was not sure how much he knew about her. However, after finding out that this guy really loves his daughter even if he does not know anything about her, it made her feel happy and relieved.
