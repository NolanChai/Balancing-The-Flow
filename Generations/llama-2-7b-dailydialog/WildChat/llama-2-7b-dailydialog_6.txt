- Hey guys, I have an idea for a scene in Stranger Things season 3. This is our best friend, Maxine. She's the one that likes to read about witchcraft and spells. It's her favorite past time.
- So, this scene happens when Will Byers returns home from his adventures with Eleven. He's a little freaked out by what he experienced there in the upside down. When Maxine walks into the room, she says: "Hey guys! I just finished reading that book on how to summon demons!"
- So Will and Mike are all like "Really? That is crazy." 
- And then Max goes over to her bookshelf where she has this book about summoning the demon known as The Mind Flayer. She pulls it off and opens it up on her desk. Then she closes her eyes for a second before opening them again and saying: "Demon of the Upside Down! Come here!"
- A bubble of smoke comes out from underneath her bed, followed by a tall creature with glowing red eyes and sharp teeth. It's The Mind Flayer! It looks like it's been in Maxine's body for quite some time as well. 
- The thing grabs her shoulders and is trying to pull her away from the desk but she stays put and says: "I command you, Demon of the Upside Down to leave my friend's bodies alone! I also command that you stay where you are so we can talk about this."
- Mike and Will come over to see what's going on. 
- The Mind Flayer growls at them and they both get scared, running away from the desk. Maxine stays still and says: "I have a proposition for you. I know that you can see into the upside down as well." 
- Then she opens her eyes wide to make it look like she's possessed by The Mind Flayer as well and then whispers: "If you help my friends, I will let you stay in my body so you have a place to live until your bodies are brought back home." 
- At this point, Will and Mike go into the room where Eleven is standing, holding her arms out with her eyes closed. They tell her about what they saw Maxine do. Then Eleven starts to chant something in another language before she opens her eyes again and looks at them. It's like The Mind Flayer can see through her eyes too!
- At this point, Will grabs the syringe of Demogorgon serum from Eleven's backpack that they found earlier and holds it up to The Mind Flayer. As soon as he does, he screams out in pain because The Mind Flyer can feel the electricity being passed through its body by the serum. 
- He starts to pull Maxine away from the desk but she uses all her strength to hold on and say: "No! You will not leave my friend's bodies alone! I command you, Demon of the Upside Down, to go back into your own world!"
- After saying that, there is a flash of light and The Mind Flayer disappears from Maxine's body. She falls on top of her desk with a thud. Mike helps her up off the ground as Will continues to hold onto the syringe. He pulls it out of his jacket pocket before running over to where Eleven is standing. 
- When he gets there, she gives him an evil smile and says: "Well done, my friend." She then runs toward Maxine with her arms open wide as Mike looks on in fear.

Max tells the Demogorgon about her plan for world domination. She also mentions that it's a shame that nobody ever sees her as much, since they only see her when she's doing something good like rescuing Will or saving the day in general. The Mind Flayer seems unphased by Max's plans and says "What do you care if I take over the world? You don't get a cut."
