<?php
// the latest_from_softonic object is returned and all values are set properly.
$value_xml = simplexml_load_string($latest_from_softonic->url);
echo "<pre>";
print_r($value_title);
foreach ($value_xml->url as $key => $value) {
    echo "$key: ";
    print_r($value);
}
?>

### Explanation:

You have to use simplexml_load_string() for the value_xml variable in order to receive any content. You can try this code and you will see that the data is extracted correctly from the xml file.
