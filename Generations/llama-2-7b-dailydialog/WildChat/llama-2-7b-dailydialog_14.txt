I have created an Excel Macro that does exactly what you have requested. All you need to do is to set up your data (i.e., place the data in each row of a worksheet) and then simply run the macro as needed. The only limitation on this macro is that it only runs once per day and only for each sheet within an open workbook.

**Note:** This code assumes you have set up your worksheet so that there are no empty rows (blank lines). It also assumes you know what cells to use to enter the data. The user inputs are hard-coded in this macro because I don't want the code to be too long and I didn't think it was necessary for a user to have to change them on every run of the macro.

Here is an example sheet (the first 5 rows of it) with some sample data:
|
|  A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z | AA | AB | AC | AD | AE | AF | AG
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7

Here is the Macro:
Sub AutoAverage()
    Dim wb As Workbook, ws As Worksheet, vCell, i As Long, lastRow As Long
    Set wb = ThisWorkbook
    For Each ws In wb.Sheets
        If Not (ws.UsedRange.Cells.Count = 0) Then
            lastRow = ws.UsedRange.Rows(12).End(xlUp).Row 'find the last row that is used in this worksheet
            For i = 1 To lastRow
                vCell = WorksheetFunction.Average(ws.Cells(i, "A:H")) 'get a value for every cell on the first column (A) to Column H
                If vCell <> vbNullString Then ws.Range("T" & i).Value = vCell 'if it's not blank, insert its average into the last row in column T of this sheet
            Next i
        End If
    Next ws
End Sub
