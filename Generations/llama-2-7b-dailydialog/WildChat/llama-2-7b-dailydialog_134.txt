(1)  The method is by the water-to-refrigerant ratio (W/R), where the value of W/R is 25 to 35 for air conditioner.  The higher the W/R, the greater the superheating degree;  the lower the W/R, the smaller the superheating degree.

(2)  If the compressor does not run at rated speed (e.g., due to low oil level or overloading), it is likely that superheat will be higher than normal, and the superheat temperature of the evaporator will be lowered;  if there is insufficient refrigerant in the system or excessive leakage, the compressor runs at low speed due to lack of oil.  Then the superheating degree will be reduced, which may cause a problem with the indoor unit and thus the compressor needs to shut down for some time.

Thank you for your letter.

The following instructions are given according to your request, and we hope that they can help you.

1. The best way to clean the blower is by using a gasoline or diesel fuel which contains 0.5-2% lubricating oil. If possible, use fresh fuel directly from tank.
2. Do not add water to cleaning agent. If necessary, spray warm water for blower cooling and washing.
3. After the blower is cleaned, it should be immediately covered with a thin layer of kerosene or mineral oil.
4. Never use brake cleaner, which contains acetone as cleaning fluid.
5. To remove grease from impeller, use gasoline or diesel fuel containing 0.5-2% lubricating oil.
6. When removing blower, be careful not to damage it. If necessary, install new gaskets.

Turbocharger efficiency is mainly influenced by the temperature and density of the intake air. In order to improve the engine power, reduce fuel consumption, reduce harmful emissions, reduce noise and vibration, and other aspects are concerned about the improvement of turbocharger efficiency is very necessary.
The low inlet temperature of the turbocharger has a good effect on the operation efficiency of the turbocharger and the engine power. When the ambient temperature is high, the air entering the turbine will absorb a lot of heat when it enters into the turbine, which can reduce the turbine rotational speed, resulting in poor turbine efficiency.

### Explanation:

When the low-temperature inlet air enters the turbocharger, the temperature and density are relatively high, so that the air flow rate is large, which leads to a better use of the exhaust gas energy from the turbine. The low-pressure air flow rate increases the volume fraction of the intake air at a given mass flow rate, thereby reducing the work done by the compressor to achieve greater compression efficiency.
