Yes, I’ve heard of the Kerry Ring of 100 miles and it is an amazing place. Let's take a week to explore each place with our rental car. On Friday we will begin driving south from Dublin. Our first stop will be Torc Waterfall at Killarney National Park. The drive should only take about two hours, so it gives us plenty of time to reach the waterfalls and have some lunch in the town before heading out for a longer stretch of the journey. 

Driving for five or six hours through Kenmare and then arriving at Ross Castle will make for a good break. We can also take our car onto the ferry to head over to Sneem if we want to get some fresh air in that way. Next up is Muckross House, which isn’t far from Killarney, so this shouldn’t be too difficult either.  

I think it would make sense for us to stay in Kenmare again at night as well since it seems like there is a lot of sightseeing left to do the next day. It should be possible to fit Skellig Islands into our schedule somewhere between our morning departure from Killarney and arriving back in Dublin later that evening. 

### Feedback:

Oh, that sounds amazing! I’m looking forward to seeing all those beautiful landscapes. How long do you think we should stay in each town? And how about the food? Do they have any good places to eat there?  

We will stop overnight in Kenmare and then take a ferry to Sneem for lunch. We can explore around this area and check out Ross Castle too if we are looking for some more scenery. I've heard that the Skellig Islands are pretty cool, so let’s make sure we include them on our route before coming back through Kenmare once again on our way to Dublin by evening.

Well I'll be there to meet you tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. and we can start our tour from my place then go down to the Ring of Kerry by the N71 road and make a small stop in Muckross House for some pictures , then continue with the tour along the N70 to Sneem .

There are a few places I would like to see and they are: Torc waterfall, Gap Dunkle kenmare Ross Castle. Sneem, Muckross House, Skellig Islands, Stone Forts at Cameronsiveen, Muckross Abbey, Taproom at Killarney Brewing.
I would love to see the beautiful and magnificent scenery that Ireland has to offer with its natural beauty. I also want to try some of the local food because it’s a very famous and well known thing in Ireland as well. I will be trying out my cooking skills at home while trying some of their traditional recipes so i can recreate these beautiful meals when I am back.
I have been told by several people how great of an experience it is to see the Skellig Islands and Stone Forts at Cameronsiveen, which is one of Ireland's most famous tourist attractions. 

### Question:

Do you think there are any other places that would be on my bucket list? If yes, please share with me why these locations should be on my bucket list.
