Freedom planet: Hi there Shovel Knight! I’m Lillian! It looks like we’re in the same world!
Shovel Knight: Well, it is a big place to be sure. Nice to meet you. What are your plans after this?
Lilac: I don't know where my sister went or what she was doing but she left me with some money and told me to find myself a new job in the area. So i'm looking for work here.
Shovel Knight: That sounds exciting! We’re off to find more treasure, are we?
Lilac: Uh-huh! I’m going to explore this place and make friends with some people who can help me out. Maybe even become a hero myself one day! Do you want to join me? You seem like fun company.
Shovel Knight: That would be great! But you know, it might be more fun if we split up so I don't get in your way when you find something interesting.
Lilac: Yeah, that's probably a good idea... i mean, maybe later on if you want to hang out?
Shovel Knight: Of course! You have my number, right?
Lilac: You bet I do! See ya around Shovel Knight!
