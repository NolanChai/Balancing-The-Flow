This is an interesting one, as it combines some difficult aspects to create a great project.
The first thing to consider with any type of child abuse is to think about the time period when it was going on, and how long has passed since then? How much time does it have to run its course through the body before the symptoms can be seen? If you were looking at a child that had been molested as a child in some way (either physically, mentally or emotionally), then I would look at the first 10-20 years of life for a big impact.

### Idea:
The first audio is going to be very basic, and just give the listener an opportunity to speak about it in their own way. This will allow them to get all their thoughts out there, without being told how they should feel. 

The second one I would like to have is to show them a picture of themselves as a young child, with a simple statement that they can choose what it means to them. The first time someone says this out loud, it is a very difficult thing to do for many people who have experienced any kind of abuse, so make sure to give them plenty of time to process the information on their own without you prompting them for anything other than how they feel about it.

The next idea would be to have another simple audio that just tells the listener that this is a safe place to share feelings and emotions with me (you) and I will never judge what they say or do while we are talking together. This will help create trust between you two, so don't rush through it too quickly because if it feels like pressure at any time, just slow down until everyone is comfortable again before moving forward again.

### Affirmation:
The fourth one should be something simple like "I am a safe and loving person" or even better yet try saying it to yourself in the mirror so that you can see how your face reacts while you are speaking it aloud. This will help get rid of some nervous energy before getting down into the real meat of things later on in this process when we start talking about more specific topics related to child abuse situations where there may have been physical violence or sexual molestation involved at any point during your lifetime up until now.
### Affirmation:
The fifth one should be something similar to "I am a strong and brave person." This will help get rid of some nervous energy before getting down into the real meat of things later on in this process when we start talking about more specific topics related to child abuse situations where there may have been physical violence or sexual molestation involved at any point during your lifetime up until now.
### Affirmation:
The sixth idea is something simple like "I am able to talk about what happened without feeling embarrassed." This will help get rid of some nervous energy before getting down into the real meat of things later on in this process when we start talking about more specific topics related to child abuse situations where there may have been physical violence or sexual molestation involved at any point during your lifetime up until now.
### Affirmation:
The seventh idea should be something similar to "I am safe and happy now." This will help get rid of some nervous energy before getting down into the real meat of things later on in this process when we start talking about more specific topics related to child abuse situations where there may have been physical violence or sexual molestation involved at any point during your lifetime up until now.
