Essentially, Orientalist discourse is contingent upon a distinct power dynamic that enables Western to create and maintain reductive images of the East. Exercising control over the Orient’s representation, West situates itself as observer, imbued with the power to discipline by defining what the East is and is not. The “power/knowledge” nexus – notion that production, dissemination, and control of knowledge serves as primary agents of power, reminiscent of the Panopticon, wherein West becomes observer, bearer of the gaze, determining Eastern identity, norms, morals and interests. This gaze reifies “a grid of intelligibility that legitimates specific research as objective knowledge.”
