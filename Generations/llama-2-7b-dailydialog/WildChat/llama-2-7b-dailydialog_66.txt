Starcraft 2 players in a game of Starcraft 2 met up with the character from a popular online horror game called Slenderman, which is usually considered an urban legend. A user named Lolwut1809 decided to turn this urban legend into reality by uploading his match on youtube where you can clearly see the player’s side of the map slowly covered in black as the Slender Man himself moves through their base and destroys it. The user also uploaded a screenshot of what happened, showing a character named ‘Slenderman’ destroyed all buildings, killed everyone in their team, and took over half of the territory that was held by their team.

It's an interesting combination! The starcraft characters are very good at combat, and the siren head is a creature who also has some combat ability. But I think their main advantage is in their abilities to control the environment. For example, the siren head can create a sound wave that can knock back enemies, while the star craft heroes have a variety of abilities like flight, teleportation, and healing.

The characters that are in the game, from each race are randomly placed into the back rooms.

### Problematic Character:

Wyrmling Witch Doctor, but the others don't seem to be too problematic in this game.

### Questionable Characters:

Protoss Zealot, Probe and Colossus. 

### Notes:

It doesn't look like any of these characters are actually hostile or aggressive in the game.
