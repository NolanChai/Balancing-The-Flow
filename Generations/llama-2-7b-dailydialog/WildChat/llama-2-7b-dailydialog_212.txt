The girl at the beach was not very happy. She had planned to go swimming for hours, and now it seemed as though the sky would rain any second. She quickly put on her pink bathing suit and ran out onto the sand. 

She went down to the edge of the water, but she decided against getting into the chilly lake. Instead, she sat in one of the deckchairs that were lined up in rows all along the shore. She sighed a bit as she thought about how disappointed her parents would be if they saw her now. 

Just then, the girl noticed something strange happening on the sand. A tiny hole had appeared there, and soon it was followed by another. When the two holes merged together into one giant hole, the girl realized what was going on: a sinkhole! It was getting bigger and bigger until finally, a large part of the shore collapsed into it. 

The girl looked around in terror. There was no way out for her now; she was stuck at sea level with all these people staring at her like she was crazy. The waves were starting to crash against her, and they kept getting bigger and bigger until finally, one wave hit so hard that it pushed the girl straight into the hole!

Once upon a time, there was a girl who went to the beach with her friends. The day was hot and sunny, but she didn’t care because she had a great tan and wore a stylish bikini that showed off her toned body. She loved swimming in the ocean, but today, it wasn’t so nice. There were lots of big waves that knocked her over and made her dizzy, and there were even some sharks that swam nearby. Still, she had fun splashing around with her friends and laughing at how silly they looked when the waves hit them hard.

My name is Strombolia, and I am one of the most popular girls on the beach. I have lots of friends because they like me. Today, my mother told me that we were going to go for a walk in the park so I can meet her friends' children. We walked around for a while and then it started raining! All of us ran back home as fast as we could! When I got back home, my father was waiting for me at the door with his camera! He took several photos of me running back home in the rain but he missed one when I tripped over the kerb. It hurt really badly and I cried out loud. I think I might need a tetanus injection to help cure the pain. I will have a scar on my knee for sure now, it hurts so much!
