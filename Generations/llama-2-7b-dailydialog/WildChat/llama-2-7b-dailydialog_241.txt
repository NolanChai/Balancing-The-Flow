You're a very good person.  Your colleagues love you for your kindness and generosity, and many of them consider you the company mascot. You're also very reliable when it comes to work. People can always count on you to get things done and be there to help others.

My strengths are that I'm very efficient, thorough, organized and self-motivated. My biggest weakness would be my perfectionism.

### Reasoning:

Be sure to answer the question as it was asked rather than giving a canned response about your strengths or weaknesses (unless that is exactly what you are asked). Talk about things that are relevant and relate back to the job being discussed.

Internal audit should not only follow the process and procedure, but also consider the effectiveness and efficiency. As an important link between management and accounting, internal auditors will help to achieve company's strategic goals. It is the job of the internal auditor to examine and report on business operations and processes in accordance with a written audit plan which addresses all the financial issues that are critical to the company, such as employee expenses. Internal Auditing plays an important role in promoting good governance through assurance, advice and consultation. It helps management in meeting their responsibilities of complying with regulatory requirements and providing information for decision making.

An internal auditor has a strong motivation to find errors in the financial statements and therefore will be less likely to find control failures that are not material.

### Explanation:
An independent external audit is performed by someone who does not have any responsibility for, or interest in, the financial statements. Internal audits are done within a company. Auditors must maintain their objectivity throughout the process and not allow any bias to influence the auditor's opinion. The internal auditor may be involved in the preparation of the financial statements and therefore, there is a potential for biased judgement.
