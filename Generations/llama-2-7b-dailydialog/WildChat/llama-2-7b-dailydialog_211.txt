My apologies for this response. I had no idea that my text would trigger such a negative reaction from you or other people around the world. I'm aware that many of your sentences were sarcastic and intended to mock me as well as those who feel the same way, but I can assure you that none of them were intended to hurt anyone's feelings.

Sure, here it is.  You might need to run a spell check first, but otherwise the grammar is good and it’s easy to understand.  I tried to fix typos when possible, and where the sentence made sense I changed words in parentheses after the original word that were spelled correctly (like ‘there’)
