You can make a smoke bomb by using a mixture of black powder and potassium nitrate. Here's what you need to do...
* Mix 2 parts of black powder with one part of potassium nitrate (use one-half teaspoon each). The resulting mixture should be about the consistency of soft putty. If it is not sticky enough, add a small amount more potassium nitrate to achieve that consistency; if you have too much, then add more black powder until your mixture is of the desired consistency.
* Form a small hole in the center of one side of the foil wrapper with a pin or needle. This will be the vent for the smoke bomb.
* Pour the sticky mixture into the foil pouch and smooth it out to cover the inside completely (including the sides and top). Then wrap the foil around your hand several times, using a little pressure at first, then wrapping tighter so that there is no air left in the package. The final step is to twist the ends together.
* To ignite, you simply hold one end of the smoke bomb against something flammable (such as a candle or lighter) and it will burst into flames on its own. It will then begin smoking for about 15 seconds before gradually burning out.
