- 09/28/2018 - There are so many memories that we have at the beach. My favorite is always watching our kids play together in the sand, creating their own little world. I'm sure they will never forget those times. 
- 09/29/2018 - It was a beautiful day for swimming today at the beach! The sun was shining and everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves as we all played in the water together. We were even able to build some sand castles with our children before heading back home for dinner! 
- 09/30/2018 - I love watching my children play on the beach. It reminds me of when I was their age and playing in the sand, too. They make friends so easily and have a lot of fun together no matter what they are doing! 
- 10/01/2018 - It's always nice to go to the beach for a little bit of relaxation after work each weekend. I love being outside in nature, surrounded by beautiful scenery while also getting some exercise by walking along the shore line with my husband and children! 
- 10/02/2018 - The best part about going to the beach is when you look at your children playing together and you realize how happy they are just being kids! It's really hard not to smile when you see them laugh and run around so much.
