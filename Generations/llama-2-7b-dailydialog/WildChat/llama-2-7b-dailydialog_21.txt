The businesswoman wakes up to find that she is no longer a woman but has become a femboy who looks exactly like one, complete with female clothes, a flat chest and an enlarged male bulge. She also has the mental compulsion to use male pronouns and male names. But her rival seems determined to stop the hostilities between them by becoming her wife and breadwinning husband. She is attracted to his new form and realizes that she loves him in it.
