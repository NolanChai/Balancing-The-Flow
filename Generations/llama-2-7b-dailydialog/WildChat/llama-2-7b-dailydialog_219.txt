What's your plan for next year?
I will continue my education in China.
Have you made up your mind what major you would like to study in college?
Not yet. I will start to think about it next semester. 
Have you decided where you are going to apply?
Yes, I am applying to University of Florida and Duke University.
Do you want to go abroad or stay in China?
I'm not sure which one is better for me yet.
What would be your reason to choose UF？
I heard that their business program ranks first in the world. And they have a great football team too! 
Have you visited any colleges in the US before?
Yes, I was lucky enough to visit Duke University and University of Florida last summer. They were both really impressive.
Do you want to go to a small or big college?
I don't care much about its size as long as I can get a good education there. 
Have you ever thought about working in the US after graduation?
It’s possible that I might work for a while after school, but my ultimate goal is still to return to China and start my own business. 
Will you be staying with your host family during summer vacations? 
I would like to but I don't have any plans yet.

Thanks for taking the time to review these results. I know you are happy with your score on the Math section of the exam. 
But the verbal portion was a bit below par and that's where I need to focus my energy from now until next year. 
I am determined to get my score up in this area, but it is going to take more work than usual. 
Let me know how you think I can best do this and what resources are available for help on campus. 
I'd love your opinion on where we should focus our efforts. 
How can the Center for Teaching and Learning help? Should I seek tutoring? What else?
I look forward to discussing all of this with you at our next meeting.

Thank you for your kind advice, but I have been looking forward to taking the AP Chinese exam since it can help me get a good grade in high school and help me better prepare myself for college life and career planning. 

I will try my best on it, no matter what the result is.
