Response from Xiao-Jun Wang :

I would like to clarify that I was referring to the conversion efficiency (CE) in the paper, which is also known as the CO2 capture rate. The other one you mentioned here is the single pass conversion efficiency (SPCE), i.e., the overall CO2 capture rate from the reaction mixture after 1 pass through the reactor, which should not be confused with CE (capture efficiency). In my paper I mainly focus on the CE of the system. However, a similar thing happens in the SPCE and EE for single-pass CO2 capture reactions as well. The overall SPCE is strongly determined by the catalyst performance and reaction conditions, which are not easy to be controlled precisely at the moment. Therefore, it has been found that the mainstream CO2 capture methods involve several passes of CO2 in a cascade reactor system to improve the conversion efficiency. This also explains why there are still significant amounts of carbon dioxide in flue gas after the first pass through a typical amine scrubber and some additional effort is required for removing them in other passes (see refs 1 and 3).
