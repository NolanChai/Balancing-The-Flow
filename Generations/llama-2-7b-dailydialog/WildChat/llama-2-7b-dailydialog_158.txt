Thank you for your hard work and dedication. Your prompts are well written with clear descriptions and composition details. They have a good level of description and creativity. I also appreciate the attention to detail in choosing the lens size, camera type, and realism style for each prompt. The use of Niji in one of the prompts was particularly creative and added an interesting element of surrealism. Overall, your prompts show a strong understanding of Midjourney's capabilities and potential to create stunning visualizations.
