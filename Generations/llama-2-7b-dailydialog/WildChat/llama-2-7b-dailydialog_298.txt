I think that you are asking about a personal trainer or fitness instructor here. It would be good to know what kind of instructor or if he/she is employed by a gym or working independently. Also, it would help to know your level of fitness and the type of training or classes you will take before answering this question. 

### Introduction:
The best way to start an answer to this question is with a description of what your instructor's philosophy on a healthy diet is. If he/she advocates eating organic food, then make sure you mention that in the introduction and follow it up with how much you like or dislike eating organic food. 

### Body:
Give specific details about what your instructor's philosophy on a healthy diet is (i.e., low fat, vegetarian, etc.) and why he/she recommends this kind of diet for his/her clients. You can also describe how you feel about eating the type of food that he/she advocates or if you don't agree with it at all. 

### Conclusion:
In the conclusion, explain why you want to take classes from a certain instructor (i.e., because he/she advocates what I believe in) and why you like eating healthy foods and working out in general.
