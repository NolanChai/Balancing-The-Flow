```
The following are 10 title options for this slide, arranged chronologically and alphabetically. These are my best guesses. I am not a copywriter by trade so these may need more work than others.
* Chronological Order of Contributors to Recovery Trajectory
* Sequential order of contributors
* Whoâ€™s who in the recovery journey?
* A timeline of key people and events in my recovery
* The history of my addiction treatment experience
* How I came to get sober and stay clean
* My personal history as it relates to my addiction recovery
