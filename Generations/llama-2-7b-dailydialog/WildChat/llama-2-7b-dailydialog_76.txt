Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling and Aaron's 12 year old sister Molly-Rose Ling are waiting for their 14 year old girlfriend Sam in class when they realise that she isn’t there yet, when the teacher comes in to start the lesson (which is a History lesson on the French Revolution), everyone starts talking about Julia Fairbanks and how much of a daddy’s girl she is, Jane says that she thinks it would be awesome if her own parents were super rich so they could buy her anything she wanted and they could give her lots of expensive gifts, Aaron and Molly-Rose both agree with Jane about what an amazing lifestyle that Julia has, then the teacher comes in again to stop talking about Julia Fairbanks and tells them all to start their History lesson (and as he does this, Sam is walking into class, and as soon as she enters it, everyone stops talking), before the lesson starts, Jane tells Sam how much of a daddy’s girl Julia is and then Aaron and Molly-Rose explain it to her in more detail than Jane did and how lucky Julia is for being rich, just as they are explaining this to her, their teacher comes back into the room, which makes them stop talking about Julia Fairbanks (and he says that they have wasted far too much time already talking about Julia Fairbanks so it's time to start paying attention in class), and then he asks Sam what she thinks of Julia Fairbanks and her daddy’s girl lifestyle, which causes everyone to laugh at Jane for not realising what the teacher would ask her, Sam says that she doesn’t know how she feels about it yet but she thinks it will be interesting to find out,
