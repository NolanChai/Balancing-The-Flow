I would like you to imagine that you are walking along the road with your friend, who is wearing her favorite pair of sandals (and no socks). Now, as she walks past a bus stop, she spots an ad for a new horror film coming out soon. The poster has two scary looking men and they are holding hypnotic rods over the head of a man who looks terrified. Megan says to you (in her usual excited voice) “Oh my gosh! I just have to see this movie, it’s so cool!” 

### Response:
You say (without thinking too much about it) “Yeah, me too - that is if it's any good.” Megan stops in the middle of the road and turns around. She says excitedly to you “Well what are you waiting for? Let’s go over there now so I can get my ticket!” 

### Response:
You say (hesitantly) “I don’t think that's a good idea Megan.” Then you take a step back, put up your hand and say in a slightly stressed tone “I’m sorry, but we need to wait here for another ten minutes.” 

### Response:
Megan says (confused) “What? You don’t want to go see the movie?” You say “Well no it's not that. It’s just that I really need to pee right now so let me use your bathroom first then we can get our tickets.” 

### Response:
Megan says (getting annoyed) “Okay, but this better be quick” She leads you into her house and into the downstairs toilet. You say “Hey Megan do you know anything about hypnotism?” 

### Response:
She responds (excitedly) “Yeah - of course I do! Isn’t it cool? My dad has shown me a few times and I totally get it!” You say “Well hey if that's the case, then why don’t you hypnotize me now? It would be fun to see if there is any truth in what my parents told me when they were trying to get us to go to bed earlier.” Megan says “Oh sure! But I need your help.” She grabs hold of your hand and pulls you over so that you are sitting on her toilet. She then puts her other hand gently on the top of your head, which is resting against the wall. 

### Response:
She says “Now Dave, I want you to count from one to three slowly and in a steady voice.” You respond (as if you are completely relaxed) “Okay Megan… here goes - One- Two- Three” She quickly pulls her hand away from your head. 

### Response:
Then she says excitedly “Now, just like that! I’m going to pretend you have been hypnotized and you must do whatever I say.” You respond (confused) “Oh really? Well okay then…” Then she quickly grabs hold of your arm again and repeats the process from before. 

### Response:
She says in a commanding tone “Now, I want you to close your eyes and count backward from ten down to one.” You respond (hesitantly) “Okay Megan… but what if something happens? I mean it is kind of scary when people are hypnotized and do things they don’t want to do.” 

### Response:
Megan says in an authoritative voice “Don't worry Dave. You can trust me, you know that right?” You respond (hesitantly) “Okay Megan… but I need to pee again.” She says “Oh that’s okay Dave. Just pretend you haven’t got a full bladder and go along with the rest of it.” 

### Response:
You say in a serious tone “Alright, alright. It's fine. I trust you Megan” You close your eyes and start counting back from ten down to one again. She puts her hand on top of your head for the third time now, as she did before, but this time she says (in a deep voice) “You are getting sleepy... very sleepy… your eyelids will grow heavy” You feel your body relaxing and you start yawning, just like Megan had told you to. 

### Response:
Megan then goes on to tell you that when she has her hands on your head, she is really holding a hypnotic rod - and that it makes you obey her orders, because she is the boss of you now. She says “You are starting to fall asleep Dave. You will be sleeping for a long time now.” She then adds in a commanding voice “When I count from one to three again you will go into deep hypnotic sleep and it’s going to be like you are dreaming right through the rest of this movie. So relax… go ahead, just go with what I say!” 

### Response:
You have no choice but to obey Megan at this point as she is telling you in a firm voice “Count from one to three slowly and in a steady voice.” She grabs your hand again and counts slowly, “One- Two- Three” Then she says (as if she is the leader of a group) “Now all you need to do is stand up when I count to five and walk out of this room like a good soldier! If you obey me you will have no memory of any of this once we finish watching the movie.” 

### Response:
You respond (in a low voice) “Okay Megan… but what if I don’t want to watch a horror film?” She replies in an authoritative tone “Don't worry Dave. You won’t be scared once you go into your deep trance.” Then she counts from five down to one again. 

### Response:
You open your eyes and get up as commanded. She takes hold of your hand and pulls you out of the room, then puts her arm around you (as if she was leading a group) “Now follow me, and keep in step!” Then she turns to look over her shoulder at you and says “Good job Dave - that wasn’t so bad now, was it?” You say (in an embarrassed voice) “No, but I really need to pee.” Megan replies “Oh yeah... sure. I forgot about that” She then leads you down the hallway into a bathroom and says “Here go ahead and take care of that!” 

### Response:
You walk in the door and immediately start going to the urinal, which is empty (as expected). You look over at Megan, who is standing outside with her hands on her hips. She looks like she is waiting for you to finish your business - but you can’t remember what else was said after that… 

### Response:
You notice a strange feeling coming over you as if someone was touching your shoulder... You turn around and see Megan standing behind you now. She puts her hand on top of your head again, which makes you feel weird. She says “Go ahead and get out - I’m just going to wait here for a moment.” 

### Response:
You walk outside the bathroom feeling like something is wrong but not knowing why… Megan follows you into the kitchen where her dad is cooking breakfast. He says (without looking up) “So what do you two want this morning?” Then he stops and looks at both of you with a confused expression on his face - especially on Megan’s! 

### Response:
You say in an apologetic voice “Um... sorry to interrupt Dad, but we need to go somewhere for a while. We will come back later.” You are suddenly aware that your legs don't want to move - they feel like heavy blocks of wood tied together with rubber bands! 

### Response:
You can’t understand it yourself at this point... But you know that Megan is now leading you out the front door and down the road. The sunlight feels very bright compared to how dim everything was when you were in the bathroom. As she walks, she keeps her head low while looking up occasionally into your eyes so as not to catch a glimpse of any emotion on your face. 

### Response:
You can’t believe what's happening right now... Megan stops and turns around to you with a serious look in her eye. You say (quietly) “Megan, why are we walking so slowly? I feel like something is wrong.” She replies in an authoritative tone “Oh nothing at all! Now come on Dave, hurry up - we need to go see this movie right now!” 

### Response:
You begin to follow Megan as she walks towards the bus stop where you saw her earlier. As she approaches it, a woman with blonde hair and wearing pink sandals steps off of an arriving bus. It is Megan's mother! You turn around to walk away from the scene quickly but suddenly your legs won’t move! 

### Response:
You look back at Megan and she is pointing her finger in
