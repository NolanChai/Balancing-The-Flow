"The world changed after the nuclear exchange that nearly wiped humanity from the face of Earth. What was once a technologically advanced country with many powerful cities, fell into anarchy. After a few years however the civilized remnants band together to form what is now called California and restore order. 


By the early 2060s America’s borders have reached their modern-day size of around 3.8 million square miles. The country has undergone drastic changes since then. The Great Crusade, led by Enrique “Henry” Santos and later his son Marcos “Mark” Santos, reunified the country into a single Republic. A technologically advanced society, the Republic is governed as a semi-democratic republic with a strong executive branch centered on the person of the Potus, or President. The Potus is chosen by popular election from among Senate members and serves for 20 years in office. However after only a few decades of peace and order, the old countries along the Interstate have started to rebel against central government authority.


In the south lies Mexico, which unlike much of America, was spared major damage during the nuclear war. A stable and technologically advanced country, Mexico’s influence has grown to encompass most of Central America, and even some of the coastal territories along its border with California. The Republic on the other hand controls a relatively small portion of territory in the south. Much like in Europe, the two countries enjoy a tenuous peace that is held together by mutual benefit rather than shared culture or history. However tensions between the Republic and Mexico remain high due to the longstanding issue over border territories along California’s southern border with the former United States.


The story begins during a time of relative tranquility in the Republic, when its citizens enjoy a peace unseen for nearly two decades. The country has just completed construction on a road connecting the coastal city Eureka to the Atlantic Ocean, which was originally the goal of Potus Henry’s Great Crusade. As a result, the people of America are finally able to travel between both shores in less than 70 days, instead of several months at sea. In these years, there is an unprecedented level of cultural and economic exchange between the coastal cities and those further inland. The Republic’s citizens, who until recently lived on a subsistence diet with very little contact to outside world, are now exposed to the wonders of the Old World. They read classic literature, learn about new technology, and marvel at the grandeur of old American architecture, which they have never seen before.


However this peace is disrupted in 2130 when a ship from Mexico arrives into Eureka with news that has shaken America to its core; a Mexican general was assassinated by a mysterious group of foreigners. The Republic’s government reacts swiftly, sending Potus’ son and heir apparent Mark on an emergency trip to the border with Mexico. In an attempt to smooth out tensions between the two countries, Marcos proposes that both nations hold peace talks in order to resolve their border dispute and secure their shared interests. The Mexican president however dismisses him, citing that such matters require a meeting of the full Senate. Mark is visibly furious but reluctantly agrees to return to Eureka for now.


The Republic’s citizens are not so patient. There have been rumors of foreigners entering American territory in secret for years and they have grown restless at their government’s lack of action on the matter.  An angry mob gathers outside of Marcos' mansion, demanding he take a more aggressive stance against Mexico, as the assassination of their general has angered the populace. The protest quickly turns violent when the crowd smashes windows and begins to throw objects at Marcos’ mansion. Soon enough the rioters have broken down the doors and stormed into the building, where they proceed to ransack it and set fire to the furniture inside. 


The Potus’ son, his wife and three children are forced out onto the streets as their home is overrun by a mob of angry citizens. The Potus watches in horror as the rioters smash everything that they find, including the furniture where his two eldest sons were born.  After a short while the riots finally end as the police and soldiers arrive at the scene to quell the unrest. However the damage is already done; both sides are now primed for conflict. 


After the rioters leave, the Potus orders his security detail to escort him back to his home where he is reunited with his family after being away for so long."

The Republic is very unstable.

### Explanation:

This response indicates that the Republic has suffered through many years of wars and rebellions, and it is still not entirely safe to walk around on its streets. It does not mean that you're in danger or should be afraid, just that the state is unstable.

I think the system is very effective. The system ensures that there are checks and balances on every decision made by a single leader, thus preventing corruption and abuse of power. In addition to being democratic, it is also flexible as the executive branch can be replaced if the citizens feel like they are not meeting their obligations or doing their job effectively.
