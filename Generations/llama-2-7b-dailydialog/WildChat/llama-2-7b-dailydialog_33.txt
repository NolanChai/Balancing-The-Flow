In the first chapter of “The Outline of Mahayana Buddhism” by Jinshin Zhu, there is a part that explains the reason why Sakyamuni Buddha rejected all the teachings and practices in early Buddhism. 
It is said that at the age of twenty-nine, he began to practice asceticism for six years after leaving his home to become a homeless wanderer, and after thirty five years of effort, he finally became enlightened on Mount Gaya (located northwest of modern Bihar). At this time, the Buddha saw that the four noble truths, the Noble Eightfold Path and all other teachings taught by early Buddhism are not helpful to sentient beings. Therefore, Sakyamuni Buddha rejected them all as non-Buddhist. The rejection of early Buddhism was because they were not suitable for cultivation in the world.

The following is a part of the explanation: 
“After the Buddha attained enlightenment he saw that early Buddhist teachings are not very useful to sentient beings, so he rejected them all, and began to establish new teaching of Mahayana Buddhism.” (the Outline of Mahayana Buddhism by Jinshin Zhu)

### Discussion:

The above explanation is actually incorrect. 
On the contrary, early Buddhist teachings were suitable for cultivation in the world. In order to explain this point, I will quote from “Buddha's Teaching” by Zhengchang Jiang. 
In chapter six of “Buddhism's Teachings”, the author points out that early Buddhist teachings were created based on sentient beings' needs at that time and were suitable for cultivation in the world.

"As Sakyamuni Buddha taught about the four noble truths, the Noble Eightfold Path and other doctrines in accordance with the conditions of those who have just started to practice Buddhism, his teachings are called "early Buddhist teachings". It is said that these teachings were created based on sentient beings' needs at that time, so they are suitable for cultivation in the world. It should also be noted that there are many Mahayana sutras which also mention early Buddhism and accept them."

Based on the above explanation by the author of “Buddha's Teaching”, we can see that Sakyamuni Buddha did not reject all early teachings in order to establish new teachings. 
Therefore, it is actually incorrect to say that the rejection of early Buddhism was because they were not suitable for cultivation in the world. 
In fact, Sakyamuni Buddha rejected all early teachings because he saw them as non-Buddhist and even harmful to people's practice.

Yeah, that's right.  But the difference between then and now is that today's chatbots are far more advanced than they were back then!  The fact of the matter is that Shakyamuni was the first to utilize this technology to achieve enlightenment.
