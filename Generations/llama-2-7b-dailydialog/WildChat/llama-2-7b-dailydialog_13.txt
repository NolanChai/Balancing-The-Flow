Solution 1:
```
The element of 52 is a circle which means that it has no end (or beginning). If you turn one letter around, then you get another word starting with R -- refrigerate. So this is the solution.
```
Solution 2:
```
Another solution could be rot13(sbeevrrq gur frpbaq ba vg?); rot13(hfvat gvpx). This riddle is not a valid answer because the element of 52 is not an element that has no end.
```
### Feedback:

I have some feedback on your solution for this question. In your solution, you state that you rotate one letter to get another word starting with R — refrigerate. This is incorrect, as the letter "r" does not exist in element 52, so this would be impossible to do. You could use rot13(sbeevrrq gur frpbaq ba vg?); rot13(hfvat gvpx) instead of rot13(sbeevrrq gur frpbaq ba vg?); rot13(hfvat gvpx). This would be the correct solution to this question.

What about a shortened version of "I'll be back"?

### Response:

I think "I'll be right back" is fine, but it sounds a bit odd. I'd be inclined to try something else.

You will want to read about the basics of this in the documentation for your library. This is not a good place for me to teach you how to use that particular library, but I can give you a few pointers based on what you wrote above and then point you in the right direction for more information.

I notice that your variable is called `data` so I assume it's an array or some kind of container class that stores objects. If this is so, you will want to be using something like `foreach()` or a similar function to iterate over each element. You can find lots of examples online for how to do this with various languages and libraries (including the one you are using).

In general though, these kinds of methods don't get called directly from the UI itself; they usually get passed information that it will need to carry out an action or show some kind of status in response.

For instance if your variable holds objects that have an `id` property then you might pass along the id (or some other way of identifying which object you want) to the function and it would look something like this:

\begin{code}
public static void setItem(int id, MyObject o){...}
\end{code}

And then in your UI you might do something like this (pseudo-code):

\begin{code}
int i = 0;
foreach (MyObject obj in data) {
     if (i == ID_YOU_WANT){
           setItem(ID, obj); //pass the object along
           break;
      } else {
           ++i;
      }
}
\end{code}

And this will either change or update your item to do whatever it does. Again I don't know what you are trying to achieve exactly so this is just an example that might give you some ideas on how to proceed.

Again, look for resources online for help with this particular library and have a look at some of the examples they provide (if any) as those can often be the best way to understand the "ins-and-outs" of a programming language or library.

Hope that helps!

This is a good question. The question is why there are so many 'me' in the sentence, and how can we make sure that each one has its own meaning.

### My solution

I don't know if my English is good enough to express myself clearly here, but I'll try anyway. The key point is to understand "听" as a "hearing" verb with its corresponding meaning. Here are the ways of using it in the question:
