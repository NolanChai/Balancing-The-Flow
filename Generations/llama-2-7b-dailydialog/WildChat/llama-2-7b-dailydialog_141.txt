- Net Profit Margin
- Gross Margin
- Cash Flow Statement
- Balance Sheet
- Income Statement
- Statement of Shareholders' Equity

### Explanation:

The 6 financial statements are: 
1. **Net Profit Margin** - A profitability ratio calculated by dividing a company’s net income by its revenue.
2. **Gross Margin** - A measure of how much money a business keeps from each sale after paying for the products it sells, divided by its sales. The higher the gross margin is as a percentage, the greater the profit per unit sold and the better the company can afford to cut its prices.
3. **Cash Flow Statement** - A financial statement that summarizes the amount of cash and cash equivalents entering and leaving a business over a period of time (typically one month).
4. **Balance Sheet** - A financial report detailing the assets, liabilities and net worth of an individual or company at a particular point in time.
5. **Income Statement** - A financial report that gives information about a company's revenues and expenses over a specified period (typically one year or one quarter).
6. **Statement of Shareholders’ Equity** - A statement showing the changes in the balance sheet accounts of a business over an accounting period, such as total shareholder equity or retained earnings.

### Hints:

- This is a really good question to ask someone you're trying to hire for a financial analyst position. If they don't know what these statements are and the difference between them, then it's unlikely that they would be able to do the job properly if given one!
