The formula below should do that for you.

\begin{code}
=IFERROR(LEFT(A2, FIND(" ",A2, FIND(" ",A2, FIND(" ",A2)+1)+1)-1),"")&" "&RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(" ",A2, FIND(" ",A2, FIND(" ",A2)+1)+1))
\end{code}

To be able to do this you would need the following:

1. A formula field.
2. A calculated field.
3. A calculated formula using the formula field as an input.
4. In the calculated field the result will be greater than 6.
5. Use the "If" statement to compare a cell value with the result from the calculated field.

Yes you can use the same approach. If you are not familiar with the Data Validation feature, please read [this](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-data-validation-to-help-protect-your-workbook-3D79BB0F-E6EC-4812-B5A0-0C53B1D1BDAA?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) article.
