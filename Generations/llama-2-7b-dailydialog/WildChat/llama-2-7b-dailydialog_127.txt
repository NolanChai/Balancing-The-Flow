it was a windy day and i was on my way to work when i saw a woman walking down the street. She looked like an actress because her hair was curly and her face was cute. I thought to myself "she must be famous." When she got closer, i noticed that she was wearing black jeans,a blue blouse and white boots . Her long hair was all messed up like it had not been brushed in days or weeks and she looked very tired from sleeping the night before. As she passed me , I could smell her perfume coming down on my face. It smelled like roses with a little hint of chocolate mixed into it.I got really close to hear what she was saying to someone over the phone but then i realized that she had walked away. I stood there for a minute thinking "wow ,she is so pretty."
