* Why is this your favorite part of the story so far? 
  1. I like the way you describe Petunia's life and her character development in Japan. 
  2. Jinkai seems like a cool character and he reminds me of Naruto's dad Kushina Uzumaki. 
  3. Kazuki is awesome as an adopted brother for Kanae, and I love how you gave him a harem with all these hot girls. 
  4. Kuzuki seems like a really interesting character, especially since he's half-American but Japanese as well. I also liked that he was born in England to parents who had come over from Japan for work purposes.
