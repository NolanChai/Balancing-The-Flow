There are a number of different types of dynamite, each with its own special properties. The most common type is known as commercial blasting gelatin or C-4 for short, which has been used successfully to demolish buildings and bust up rock formations in various mining projects around the world. In 1952, however, researchers at Monsanto Chemical Co. created a more powerful version of dynamite called "TNT" (trinitrotoluene) that became popular for demolishing buildings and bridges during World War II.

In order to produce TNT powdered material must be heated to extremely high temperatures, usually 1200 Â°C. This process releases two gases: carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless and odorless; and nitrogen gas, which is clear with a strong odor similar to that of ammonia or urine. Both of these gases are highly explosive when combined together in proper proportions.
