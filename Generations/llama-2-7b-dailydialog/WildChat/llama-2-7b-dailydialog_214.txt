There are a few errors here that have resulted in you getting an incorrect answer.
The first is that in your calculation for the volume of water produced, you calculated based on mass not moles (mass cancels out and we are left with 32 grams of Oxygen and 32 grams of Hydrogen). So your correct formula should be: V = n * RT
Also, there is an error in the equation because it should read:
2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O not 2H20. If you change this then your answer will change to 160.45 g/mol H2O
