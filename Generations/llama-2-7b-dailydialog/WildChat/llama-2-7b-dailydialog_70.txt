<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Thank you very much, we are so glad that you joined us here today. I can see you are really shining in your bright yellow dress and your red shoes. You are absolutely fantastic! Your passion is beautiful to behold and it is infectious, so thank you for joining us today. You were talking about the importance of showing up, do you remember how you felt when you first joined We4A?

<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> I can see you are still a little bit shy but this is amazing that you have come here and shared your story with us today. This was really brave of you and I am so proud to have met you in person for the first time today, because I know how much you are looking forward to it, right?

<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> So what is the next big goal that you want to achieve as an entrepreneur and as a mother of three children?

We4A program is an initiative of the World Bank to help developing countries to enhance their ability in tackling challenges that are hindering the growth and development. The initiative focus on improving people's lives by promoting job creation, supporting trade, investment and policy reform. In order for a country to achieve sustainable and inclusive economic growth, we need to ensure that our economy is diversified with jobs created and the government revenue increased.
The program also focuses on increasing access to basic services such as education and health care in an effort of reducing poverty in the society. We4A program has been active for 17 years now and has achieved many milestones towards enhancing economic growth of developing countries. In my opinion, we need more such programs that aim at improving people's lives rather than focusing on just making a profit.

So please let me just briefly introduce myself my name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> I am a program manager at GIZ and We4A project coordinator.
