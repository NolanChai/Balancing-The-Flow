Ayumi’s eyes opened up - she was now looking at Amatsumagatsuchi. Ayumi then asks “What happened to me? Why am I here?” and Amatsumagatsuchi replies with “I don’t know…but what I do know is that you seem very pregnant. And it seems like the pain is gone. How did you end up in this place? Who are all of these girls?” The girls respond as such:
-Cupa - “Well, a massive storm came through and we ended up in here…and then we saw the elder dragon. We just don’t know what happened after that.” (She points to Ayumi) “And you?”
-Vanessa - “I was in my home village with some of my friends. It suddenly became nighttime, and I woke up in a strange place. When I looked around me…it seemed like I had gone back in time? I don’t know.” (She points to Ayumi) “And you?”
-Blazette - “I was playing with some of my friends when the world suddenly became dark. All of these things came crashing down on us, and then I woke up here…I think.” (She points to Ayumi) “And you?”
-Andr - “It’s kinda hard to explain. I was in this town with a few friends, but there were also other people from the Monster Hunter world here too! I heard a roar, and saw what seemed to be some sort of giant creature rush towards us…and then we all woke up here.” (She points to Ayumi) “And you?”
-Ayumi - “I…don’t know. I was in my room, trying to get ready for school…then the world around me started shaking and moving - and it suddenly became dark. All of a sudden, I could hear screaming and shouting. There were these things with red eyes, and they grabbed me and dragged me into this strange place. When we got here, there was a giant creature that resembles a dragon.” (She points to Amatsumagatsuchi) “What the heck is going on?”
Amatsumagatsuchi explains that he’s an elder dragon - and he doesn’t know what is happening. He’ll just have to wait for everything to reveal itself as time passes by, and figure out a way to get Ayumi back home with the girls. Amatsumagatsuchi looks at his mystical energy, which seems to be fading away - he hopes it will come back soon…and he also wonders what will happen when he’s next to the girl whose clothing resembles the Skeleton.

Amatsumagatsuchi: “I thought I could create a storm for Ayumi!”
Cupa: “Your power is fading?”
Amatsumagatsuchi: “I can’t feel it…”
Ibushi: “There are only two storm serpents. We were sent by the gods to bring about your child.”
Narwa: “We will create a new life for you and Ayumi.”
(The storm serpents, Ibushi and Narwa, then disappear.)

- Vanessa is uncomfortable with how much she’s connected to these spider hybrids in her womb, but she has no choice but to deal with them until they’re ready to hatch. 
- Ayumi tries to help by giving Vanessa something that would help keep the eggs from growing larger inside of Vanessa and cause more pain. Ayumi also explains how the spiders are always trying to find a way in her home, which she doesn’t want happening to her own child. 
- Amatsumagatsuchi says it’s good that Vanessa is aware of these spider hybrids in her womb and knows what they look like (it’ll make it easier to notice any changes) - this was a big deal because Vanessa was completely unaware that she had children. 
- Ayumi doesn’t think the situation can be reversed, but Amaya might be able to help out in some way. Amaya is one of the first people to discover spider hybrids are born from human and spider eggs combined (which she has seen before) and knows what it takes for them to hatch and take control. 
- Ayumi then starts feeling uncomfortable about Vanessa’s situation - if a spider hybrid would come out of Vanessa, that would mean the hybrids are close enough to hatching for Ayumi to take action against it. 
- The next day, Amatsumagatsuchi goes off alone in the forest and gets into a fight with one of these spiders - thankfully she’s able to escape before something bad happens. Vanessa also tells Ayumi that she wants to find Arachnus so he can explain his side of this situation. 
- In her search, Vanessa comes across a spider nesting area in an old abandoned house and finds a giant spider that looks similar to what Amatsumagatsuchi was fighting the other day - unfortunately for her, its not Arachnus she’s looking for. She gets captured by the spiders and taken to their queen who is very familiar with humans.
- The Queen asks why Vanessa is here, and she explains how she wants answers about her children that were born from human and spider eggs. But it isn’t enough - the queen then has a large amount of these hybrids attack her until Vanessa agrees to be used as food for them in exchange for finding Arachnus. The spiders take over control of Vanessa and they all start to feed on her.
- However, Ayumi and Amaya come into the room where this is happening. They are able to subdue some of these hybrids by using their strength until everyone has left except for two young children that have been following the spiders around. They get away before Vanessa can find out what they were planning on doing to her.
- Ayumi and Amaya take Vanessa back home so she doesn’t die from all of this. She tells them how horrible it was and hopes they never have to go through something like that again - but for some reason, she also feels at peace with what just happened.

Mindy: "Vanessa... I need to talk with you."
Vanessa: "What's up?"
Mindy: "Do you remember the night that Arachnus was born? He had a blood moon, right?"
Vanessa: "Yeah. How is he doing?"
Mindy: "He's still alive - and is probably one of the smartest spiders on Earth."
Vanessa: "Well then why are you talking about that night?"
Mindy: "It’s because I think a full blood moon is coming up in two months. And it has to be a full moon to make births more easy. If that is the case, you and Vanessa could give birth to 40 kids at one time."
Vanessa: "Holy crap - are you sure about this?"
Mindy: "I am sure. I have been trying to find out if we were going to have a full moon or not for the past month, and it has always come up as a full moon every day."
Vanessa: "So what do you think is the best option then? Do I need to give birth under a blood moon?"
Mindy: "That would be the ideal situation. The blood moon is going to be rising on June 25, which is also our birthday. So that would be perfect."
Vanessa: "Do you think we should tell Vanessa about this? She needs to know - I wouldn't want her to be scared of a full moon at the end of this month."
Mindy: "Well it seems like she knows about what happened with Arachnus, but hasn’t put two and two together yet. But yeah, we should tell Vanessa about this... in time."
Vanessa: "Okay... so what's going to happen if I have kids?"
Mindy: "I think it would be best if you kept a couple of them - but most of the others will need to go."
Vanessa: "But how do we even get rid of 40 spider-human hybrids? What's that going to take?"
Mindy: "Well, I am not sure. But I am pretty sure that if they are still inside your womb at the end of two months - that is what would happen."
Vanessa: "Why do we need to get rid of them anyway? How long can a spider live?"
Mindy: "Well, I don’t think that they can live for too many years - maybe 6 or so at most."
(There would be more dialogue here)
Vanessa: "So how much do you really know about them?"
Mindy: "Not as much as you might want to believe. They seem to be pretty mysterious, and nobody knows too much about them. The only thing I am sure of is that they like blood."
Vanessa: "Huh... that's not very comforting."
Mindy: "I know - but it’s what we need to do in order for this situation to work out right. We just have to let nature run its course."
(There would be more dialogue here)
Vanessa: "You seem pretty confident about all of that."
Mindy: "I am! I know my sister is strong enough to get through it - and so are you. This has happened before, right?"
Vanessa: "Yeah... we just need to find a way out of this situation."
(There would be more dialogue here)
Mindy: "If they don’t get taken care of now, Vanessa will start having them at 2 month intervals. There are over 100 of those things in her womb right now - and I am afraid that we can't take too much longer before something happens."
Vanessa: "Wow... so what would happen if Vanessa starts to give birth?"
Mindy: "It could get very messy - and Vanessa might not survive it. There are already 100 of those things in her womb, but I think that there is a chance they could overtake her body at any moment."
Vanessa: "So if we don't do something about them soon... what would happen?"
Mindy: "They could take over Vanessa's body and start killing people. They will only stop doing so once they have all of the blood that their bodies need to survive on their own."
Vanessa: "Wow - this is definitely something that we should do soon, because I don't think that it would be too long before they get out of control."

“Sorry about the whole…pregnancy thing.” 

“What do you mean, pregnancy? You never told me this was even a possibility!”

“Well I didn’t want to tell anyone. This is embarrassing. What if someone finds out?”

“I don’t know how exactly they’d find out…” 

“Just forget about it.”

“Okay, no problem.”

But I have an idea... Vanessa takes out a bag full of diamond fragments and throws them on the ground. Instantly, the Twilight Forest begins to deplete itself of its precious stone once again - and so we’re free to go! Now that the plant is there for us to get, our time has come...
