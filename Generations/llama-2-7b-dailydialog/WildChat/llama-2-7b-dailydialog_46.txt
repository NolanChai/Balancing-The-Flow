Hi. I am glad to know your condition. I will provide you some information about living in Italy. As you can see, we have very different climate around Italy, because the country is big enough to have a lot of differences from North to South. Generally speaking, winters are quite cold and summers hot but dry. In Summer, temperatures rise above 30C and sometimes reach 40C in August. In Winter they can drop below -15C even if the average is around 5-6C for the coldest months of January or February.
As you have already said you don't want cold weather so I suppose that you mean your are looking for a mild climate. If this is the case, there are many cities in Italy that fulfill these requirements. You can consider places like Rome and Naples because they are located in Southern Italy. In these cities it is not very hot neither very cold but the weather stays always pleasant and enjoyable for people from Northern countries. The sea breeze makes temperatures more bearable during summer, especially in August.
You will be happy to know that both Rome and Naples have hospitals as well as education centers. In addition you can find many activities for kids and adults. For instance there are several parks where you can go with children or play sports like volley ball, soccer etc. There are also several museums in Rome and Naples so you will be able to spend your free time enjoying them.
If I were you I would choose the city of Naples because it is a lively town where people have a lot of fun in summer evenings and at weekends. On Sundays, for instance, there are many families who go together with kids or friends to the beach to enjoy an outdoor day full of sunshine and sea air.
I hope this will help you choose your new city. Please do not hesitate if you want additional information about living in Italy. I am at your complete disposal for anything that interests you. Bye!

Dear sir, thank you so much for your support. Your requirements are not that hard. The first place we'd like to introduce is Trapani City in Italy. It has the mildest climate in Italy and it is on the coastal area with beautiful seaside scenery. It also has a great deal of hospitals, schools and entertainment. In addition, people can enjoy their lives by many activities like going shopping, taking swimming, hiking, playing golf etc. We hope you like our suggestions.

The best place to leave the car is in the parking lot of "Palazzo Reale", which can be found right outside the city wall. It's a guarded area and it will cost you about 60 cents for an hour's time, but it's really worth it. It'll make sure that your rental car doesn't get stolen while you're out having fun!

Sorry, there is no result.

Bari is in Puglia, there are many towns you can go to and I can tell you one of my favourite one is Lecce. Lecce is a bit further from the sea but it's very pretty and interesting for architecture. You could stay at Villa del Parco or La Casetta di Santa Teresa.

the best place to live in Naples, Italy is a part of the city that has recently undergone a major makeover.
This is the area where you can find the new business district and all sorts of amenities that will surely make your life easier and more fun!
