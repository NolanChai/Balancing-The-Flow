> Dear Sir, we'd like to share our opinion. Firstly, we're glad to see your feedbacks on our missions. It means that you think it was interesting for you. We hope that all the fans will be pleased with this mission. Secondly, about the details - this is the main point of this mission. We want people who play GTA: San Andreas game feel like they're in real life, and our goal to create missions based on the real life events. In this case, we decided to write a description of a police officer. The reason why you have to do this is simple - cops need respect from people, especially when they are doing their duties. It may seem that all these things are quite obvious for everyone but still... If someone has an opinion about our decision and wants us to change something, he/she can always let us know about it by email or on the forums. Bye!
