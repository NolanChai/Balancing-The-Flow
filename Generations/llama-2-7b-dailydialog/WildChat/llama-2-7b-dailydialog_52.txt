"Demon Slayer" was accused by the Chinese media outlet The Paper of "disrespecting Chinese history and national cultural property". This has been disputed by other sources, who point out that the Rising Sun flag is not a registered symbol of China.

According to the creator of Golden Kamuy, Satoru Noda, he did not intend for his series to be controversial: "I don't think I was trying to glorify war or anything like that... I'm very much against war". The anime adaptation of Golden Kamuy has stated that it does not wish to use any flags from the Imperial Japanese army.

It is true that many historical works have been criticized by historians for glorifying one side while demonizing another. However, “Ranking of Kings” was not a work of history but a fiction written by a comic artist. The plot point about the Japanese occupation of Korea was created as part of the story line to create an interesting and exciting conflict that would allow characters to develop and grow. Furthermore, the depiction of the Japanese occupation of Sakhalin in “Golden Kamuy” is not controversial because it does not affect the main storyline or characters; instead, it serves as a minor plot point that adds to the atmosphere of the setting. As such, this particular criticism does not apply to “Golden Kamuy.”
