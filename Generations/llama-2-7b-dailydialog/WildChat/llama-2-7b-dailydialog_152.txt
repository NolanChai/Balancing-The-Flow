When James got home from school that evening and found out that Charles had won the championship in the G City Invitational Tournament, he was ecstatic. He couldn't believe his brother-in-law would be so successful at such a young age! James shared the news with Olivia, who responded immediately, "Well done, Charles!"

Charles came out to greet them and they all sat down for dinner.
"You must have been very nervous during the match," Olivia remarked. 

Charles nodded as he replied, "Yes, it's my first time participating in a professional tournament. I was quite worried that my opponent would be tough."

James smiled proudly and patted his son on the back while complimenting him for doing so well at such a young age. 

Charles explained how he had been practicing with his chess coach every day after school, which was what made him stand out during the tournament. He mentioned that his opponent was a strong player who had previously won third place in the World Youth Chess Championship. "That's quite an achievement for someone your age!" James congratulated his son again and encouraged Charles to continue doing well in school, as chess could be a lucrative career path if he wanted it to be.

Olivia looked at her husband with admiration while they continued to eat dinner together happily. Charles was an exceptional person and deserved every bit of praise he received from his family members!
