Thank you for sharing with us all the wonderful activities and growth our little ones have been making in the past few months! We are thrilled to see that they’re learning new skills and concepts while having fun at the same time. 

We also appreciate your efforts in creating an inclusive and diverse environment for them, by teaching them about different cultures and cuisines through International Food Week. Our children have always enjoyed these events because it allows them to explore different flavors and learn about other countries’ traditions while making new friends. 

As parents of a PN student, we are grateful for your dedication in helping our little ones develop their mathematical skills. It is essential that they learn how to count early on, so they can excel in the future. We admire the way you make learning fun and exciting for them by incorporating songs and visual aids into the lessons. 

In addition to all these wonderful activities, we wanted to express our gratitude for the month-end assembly performance and birthday celebration. It is always heartwarming to see how well our children perform in front of a large audience while proudly showcasing their skills. We are also thrilled that they can celebrate their special day at school, which gives them an opportunity to interact with friends from other classes and learn new things along the way. 

We appreciate your dedication and hard work as teachers for our children’s education, and we look forward to continued growth in the coming months!

Thank you so much for the update, I'm happy to hear that the PN class is having a great time at school! It sounds like they are really learning a lot. What activities did the PN students do to celebrate birthdays? The children seem to be very active and happy in their physical education classes. How does the PN teacher teach numbers one and two? The children are really enjoying riding bikes, climbing and jumping! They must be very good at it by now since they are so excited about doing it. I can't wait until we get to visit school again soon!
