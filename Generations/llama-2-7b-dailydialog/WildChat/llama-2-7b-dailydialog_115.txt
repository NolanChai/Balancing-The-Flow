The Biblical Antiquities was written by Philo in the first century AD. 
It is a work that explores the history of Israel and Egypt from creation until Joseph is sold into slavery, or roughly the period of Genesis through Exodus. 
Philo writes at great length about many figures in this history, including Noah and Moses, but he does so within his own systematic exegetical framework.
He sees himself as a philosopher who has made an exhaustive search for wisdom throughout the history of Israel. He begins with Abraham and moves through Joseph to bring us up to the point at which Egypt welcomes Hebrew refugees after their exile from Canaan, or roughly Genesis 12 â€“ Exodus 15.

It's a story about how the Jewish people came to be and it contains some of the most important stories in their history. It was written by Louis Ginzberg who wrote many books on Jewish folktales, including The Legends of the Jews (1938).
