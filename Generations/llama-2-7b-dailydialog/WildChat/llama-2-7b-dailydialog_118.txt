[this is told entirely from Sayori’s point of view:]

(In the hospital…)

MC: “Sayori, are you alright?”

Sayori: “I’m fine, MC.” (putting a hand on her baby bump) “Sachiko’s doing fine, too.”

(I gently rest my hands on Sayori’s baby bump, eagerly awaiting the arrival of our daughter. I couldn’t believe my beloved wife was already full-term.)

Sayori: “I know, MC. It feels like just yesterday we were joining the literature club together. And now, we’re starting a family. Oh!!”
