" I focus on traveling around the world and studying abroad . "

" that's pretty cool ! I'd love to travel all over the world one day . "

" it's so wonderful , isn't it ? You'll enjoy every bit of it when you get there . "

I began blogging when I first went to the U.S. for my graduate studies. At first, I wrote about my life there. I wrote about interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special English words that I come across . Sometimes, I would post pictures of my family and friends on the Internet so they could see what I was doing in America . My mom liked my blog because she always knew where I was when I went somewhere by myself .

I have been keeping my own English blog since I went abroad as an exchange student. When I first arrived here, I kept a journal with the purpose of writing down and reflecting on what had happened to me during that period of time. Eventually, it turned into a daily diary which reflected how I felt at different times. And then, I began blogging for a wider audience. Now my English blog has been around for three years, and is still going strong. 

When I first started writing about my life abroad, the focus was on what happened to me during that period of time. I also wrote down what new words I learned daily to keep my vocabulary up-to-date. Now it has developed into a more comprehensive reflection of my life in general; not just focusing on things related to school and study, but also about the events taking place in the world around me. And now that I've graduated from high school, I will start writing about issues that concern young people in China or some other similar topics. 

I used to write every day when I was still a student abroad. But after I returned home and began preparing for university entrance exams, I found myself more busy than ever. I have always believed in the importance of maintaining good relationships with my friends, so it became harder for me to find time to do that by writing on my blog. After graduating from high school, however, I will once again be able to write every day or even more often if I find something interesting and want to share it with others.
