"I ’ ll take a rain check on that , thanks . I ’ d like to go alone once in a while and just experience nature . I could never do that if you were there."

The next turn could be: “ That sounds like it would be fun ! But 30 miles in three days will really make you tired. How can you stand walking that much ? ” or “ Wow , I’m surprised at how often you go hiking . I saw a bear once when I was on an outing but never anything so big as a mountain lion. It must be exhilarating to see such wildlife up close . ”

"When do you leave ? "

" Tomorrow morning . I ’ m leaving at sunrise . "

" Are you going to hike alone ? "

" No , I ’ m going with a group of guys from my gym . We meet up at the trailhead every weekend and go on a 5-day trek . It ’ s really fun ! "

" Is it dangerous hiking in that area ? "

" You can never be too careful , but as long as you have bear spray and know where your food is stored , you should be safe . But just because you are not threatened doesn ’ t mean that you won ’ t encounter wildlife . "

"Wow ! That sounds like a lot of fun , but I don ’ t think I can do that . It must be exhausting hiking for hours and carrying a backpack full of things you need for camping . "

" You would definitely get tired and sore , but it was the most amazing experience . We all had bruises on our legs from where we fell . But that was part of the adventure ! It was worth every second . "

" That ’ s great . I ’ m glad you could get out and do something like that for a change . You sound very enthusiastic about it . Maybe I should try hiking sometime , too . "

" Hiking is really relaxing after all the work we have to do during the week . "
