He opened his mouth and said 'ah'. The doctor stuck the tube in and pushed it to one side. 

"Ah ! Here it is , my dear . It is inflamed and tender . I’ ll give you an antibiotic for that . Now let's look at your nose . "

### Response:

" No need, doctor . You don't have to look . My nose is stuffed up with cold mucus. There's a little blood coming out of it . "

" I'm really afraid that I may get pneumonia . "

" Don ' t worry . You won't catch it from this cold . You should be fine in a few days . Now let me give you an injection . That will help relieve your fever . Take these tablets four times a day and drink plenty of hot liquids . Come back tomorrow , if you have any other complaints . "

Good morning , doctor . What ' s wrong with me ? 

Yesterday I had a runny nose . Now my nose is stuffed up . I have a sore throat . And I ’ m afraid I've got a temperature . I feel terrible . 

Don't worry , young man . Let me give you an examination . First let me take a look at your throat . Open your mouth and say 'ah ' . 

Ah . Your throat is inflamed . And your tongue is heavily coated . You have all the symptoms of influenza . 

What am I supposed to do then ? 

A good rest is all you need , and drink more water . I'll write you a prescription .
