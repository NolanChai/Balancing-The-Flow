We had an excellent trip last Saturday. The weather was beautiful and we all enjoyed the sunshine. We climbed up to the top of the mountain where it is very windy, but we enjoyed the view from up there. It took us a little longer than usual because we were stopping along the way for our lunches.

The Mountaineering Club climbs and rappels weekend. The Colorado River is not easy to climb, because there are few places to put your hands or feet in the cliff. Last week the club went down a 300-foot cliff. It was an exciting experience. I wish you had been able to go with us.

> How did it go ? 

> It went great ! We made it to the top of the cliff . 

> Really ? That ’ s cool. You ’ ll have to show me pictures. Do you like doing that stuff ? 

> Yeah , I love it . It is so fun and exciting ! 

> Well , I think you are pretty brave . If I had been there, I might have freaked out a little bit. How did it feel being up that high? Wasn ’ t the wind blowing hard ? 

> Yeah, it was. But once we got to the top, I felt like flying ! You should try it sometime. 

> Really ? I don ’ t know if I could do it . I am a little afraid of heights . 

> Well , maybe you can do something less extreme with your club next time. How about mountain biking or rafting? 

> Yeah , that would be better for me. I ’ ll have to see what they are doing next weekend. See you later ! Bye !
