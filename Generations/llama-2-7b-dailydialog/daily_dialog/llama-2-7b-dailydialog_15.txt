I will try to get as many cartridges and toner as we need. We have had so much trouble with ordering things online these days, I hope this does not turn out to be a problem ... 

The housekeeping department has told me that they are almost out of the cartridge refills for their copier machine . We will most likely have to replace it , and we could use a new laser printer as well. The old one is about ten years old and does not print in color anymore, nor can it scan and copy things now either ... 

I have asked the office supply store to make sure they are stocked with plenty of toner before tomorrow's deadline. They seem like a reliable company, so I should be able to get our order filled on time . We will need four cases of each type , and the copier printer cartridge is a special kind that we have never tried out .
