" George , I don ’ t think that is a good idea . We might get stuck somewhere on our trip and have to stay overnight . It would be better if we stayed in a hotel for one night instead of sleeping in our van all the time . "

"All right . But can you promise me that we will be back by Monday night?  I am supposed to meet my friend at our usual coffee shop on Tuesday morning, and I don ’ t want to miss her. "

" No problem , Lili . We should get home around midnight or so on Sunday . "

Hey ! How ’ s it going ? 
I ’ m fine and dandy , thanks for asking ! What about you ? Are you busy ? 
Yes , as usual . I just got home from work . How is your day ? 
Great ! You know me , I like to stay busy and active ! How was school today ? 
It was okay . Today we had a fire drill in the school building and then after that, our class took a field trip to the local zoo ! That was cool ! We saw all kinds of animals ! Did you have any activities planned for the kids at your school this week ? 
Actually , we don ’ t do much because we are too busy with preparation for our end-of-the-year party . I think the kids will enjoy their day off . We told them to bring a swimsuit or other sport clothes in case we go outdoors . Have you done anything special recently ? 
Recently ! I bought some tickets to see a play with my wife ! It was so funny ! We laughed all night long ! What did you do during your weekend ? 
Nothing special , just usual stuff like cleaning and errands . Did you get everything done that you needed to this weekend ? 
I finished up the report on time but I don ’ t think my boss is going to be happy with it . He always wants perfection . 
It must have been very hard to meet his standards ! You work really hard and often overtime at your job , huh ? 
Yeah , that ’ s right . Sometimes I go home when my son goes to bed because he is sleeping in the bedroom next door to me ! How about you ? Do you have anything fun planned this weekend ? 
Not really ! Maybe just some housework and errands with my wife . What are your plans for the coming weekend ? 
We ’ re planning a little vacation for our anniversary ! My wife said I could pick any destination of my choice ! We will probably go to Hawaii because it is so beautiful there ! What do you think about going out of town this summer ? 
I would love to go somewhere ! But we are on such a tight budget . If it were up to me , we would be going some place right now but I have to listen to my wife ’ s side of things too ! So what are you planning for your vacation this year ? 
We went to California last summer and the year before that, we took a road trip to New England . We really love travelling all over the country ! It is such an adventure ! This year , I would like to try going somewhere in Europe ! How about you ? Do you have any trips planned for this summer vacation season ? 
No , not yet ! My wife wants to go camping but we never know how much it will cost and if there are any places left . You should probably plan your trip soon before the prices start going up again ! Have a good one and I ’ ll talk with you later ! Bye-bye !

I want to thank for the helpful feedback and comments from my teacher. 

Your corrections helped me improve my writing skill. 

Let ’ s have another look at your comment below. 

The first sentence should be a complete sentence , but it isn ’ t . 

As you said , we can visit different places in the state by our van and I will change it into a full sentence : " We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time , so we can go to different places in the state by our van ! " 

The second sentence should be a complete sentence , but it isn ’ t . 

As you said , I will change it into a full sentence : " We are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time , so we can visit different places in the state by our van ! " 

The third and fourth sentences should be two separate sentences. So they become: " What about other expenses ? Let ’ s see . Gas , food , recreation , we won ’ t spend much . Come on . Don ’ t hesitate . We need to get out of the house once in a while ! " 

The fifth sentence should be a complete sentence but it isn ’ t. As you said , I will change it into a full sentence :" The sooner the better! I can ’ t wait! " 

The sixth and seventh sentences should also be two separate sentences . So they become: " Oh , I don ’ t know where we ’ re going yet ! " And finally, the eighth sentence should be a complete sentence . As you said , I will change it into a full sentence :"As long as we ’ re going , you can decide where to go . I trust your judgments !I know you miss Chinese food , so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time!"
