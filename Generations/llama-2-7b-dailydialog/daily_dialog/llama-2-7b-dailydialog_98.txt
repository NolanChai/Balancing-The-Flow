Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"I'm going to bed early tonight."

"Don't be a wimp, Grand Theft Auto Three has just started . "

" I think you should leave the TV on for me , then ; I don't want to fall asleep and miss all the good stuff ! "

The dialog could be better structured and shorter. 

It seems to me that the speaker of this dialog is a young person, perhaps a teenager or college student. It doesn't sound like someone in his/her early twenties (which would be my guess). The second speaker sounds more mature, but not significantly so. He/she may simply have been acting immaturely in the first place. I'd say that this was a dialog between two teenagers or college students living together at home. 

There are a couple of phrases that I didn't understand: "Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome !" and "What time is it anyway ?" They sounded like fragments of sentences to me. Maybe you meant something else?  

The first speaker says "Grand Theft Auto III is awesome." It sounds like s/he meant, Grand Theft Auto Three (the game) is awesome. I'm not sure what the third speaker said about it being more violent than TV news though. It didn't seem to make any sense. 

The second speaker says "It's more violent than TV news !" What did s/he mean? I think s/he meant that GTA is much, much worse than television news because of all the violence in it. 

"Oh, my God , three hours already !" I didn't understand this sentence either. Did you mean that they'd been watching TV for three hours already? If so, why would s/he say "My God"? That seems to me like a reaction to being surprised about the amount of time that has passed, but not something people usually say in that situation. 

The second speaker says "I have to get the chores done !" Chores means things that you need to do for your house or flat. This phrase would make more sense if s/he said "I've got to get ready to go." 

"No time . That's their headlights in the window !" I don't understand what this sentence means. I think it's something like "We can't do the dishes now; that's because there are car headlights shining in our apartment windows." But maybe that isn't quite right either? 

The second speaker says "OK , emergency measures . Let's throw the dishes in the trash !" What does this sentence mean? Is it like, OK, let's dump them all and we can do them later. In other words, "Let's chuck the dishes into the rubbish." 

The first speaker says "Two birds with one stone ... " This is a very old idiom that means to take advantage of two opportunities in one action. The speaker meant something like: We can do all our laundry and cleaning at once, which will save us time. But it's probably better to say something less colloquial, such as, "We've gotta get this done before Mom comes home."
