It's great you can ride a bicycle. Do you know how to drive? If you do, then it is better for you to use your car instead of bike when you go to Water Park because the traffic in Beijing is sometimes dangerous and I have to remind you of something. First , obey the traffic rules , don't break the red light . Second , play a joke with friends while riding on the bike . Third, hurry up may cause accidents. Finally , remember that coming on the left and going right !
