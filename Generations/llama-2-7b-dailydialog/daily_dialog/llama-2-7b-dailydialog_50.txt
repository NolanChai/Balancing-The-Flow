You know the best place to get Chinese is in New York City or at home. You are lucky there if you want some food from a takeout restaurant. It isn't very good and it isn't even real Chinese. We had better go over to Al's Steakhouse for dinner. They have fried fish and salad bar. And you can go back as often as you like until the place closes at 10:30pm. I would like that kind of food.

" I think that sounds great ! We don't have to rush , either. Let's just enjoy ourselves and eat all we want . You never know when you might be able to find such a place again . I think we should go now . What do you say ? "
