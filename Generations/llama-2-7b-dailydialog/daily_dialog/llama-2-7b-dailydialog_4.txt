I haven't seen any beautiful scenery as yet. I saw a great building which is famous for tourists from all over the world. The tower called “Eiffel Tower” stands in front of us. It is 320 m high and has a long history. I was told by my friend that the tower was built in 1889 for an exhibition. It has been recorded as one of the tallest buildings in the world till now, even though it’s only made of iron and steel.
I am not sure how Eiffel Tower got its name from Gustave Eiffel. Perhaps my friend will explain that to me later on. I am eager to find out more interesting information about this tower from him.
