" I have been working hard as a student . 
I also took part in the activities of my major . 
I joined a group of students who went to a remote town and helped the villagers build a school there . 
We taught them English for three months every summer during our college days . 
I also learned a lot from working with them. "

" I used to be an active student in various kinds of extracurricular activities , such as sports and music , and I was elected the head of the music group . We sang all over town . It was really fun. "
