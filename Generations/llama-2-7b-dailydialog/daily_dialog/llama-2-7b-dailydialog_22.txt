I'd recommend removing the question marks at the end of each sentence. They aren't necessary and could be confusing for readers. Additionally, adding the word “check” between the subject (“Excuse me.”) and object (“Check please.”) would make it more grammatically correct. The next dialog should read like this:
  Excuse me . Would you check the bill , please ? 

  " OK , how was everything ? "

  Very nice . Thank you .

  "Would you like this to go ?"

  Yes , can you put it in a plastic bag ?

The dialog continues from the previous post, where the server asks if the customer would like to-go. He replies yes and asks for a plastic bag. The server puts it in a plastic bag and gives it back to him. The customer pays 25 dollars and asks if he takes credit cards.

The clerk at the register wrote on the credit card slip, "Charge to your room. You have a 9 p.m. checkout time."

"OK . Thanks a lot ! Bye!" The customer walked away from the cashier's counter with the plastic bag in her hand.

```
Excuse me, check please. 
- OK, how was everything? 
- Very nice, thank you. Would you like this to go? 
- Yes, can you put it in a plastic bag? 
- Sure, no problem. Here you are. That'll be $25 dollars. 
- Do you take credit cards? 
- Yes we accept Visa and Mastercard. 
- OK, here you are. Thank you very much. I'll be right back. 
- OK, thank you. Have a nice day. 
```
