Help me write the next turn of this conversation . 

" He is not married yet and he has no kids , but my parents will be arriving with him . "

" How old are your parents ? "

" They're fifty-five. And what about you ? When do you plan to get married or have children ? "

" Yes , he has been married for four years now and it was only last year that their second child was born . He is called Nicholas . "

" Oh ! Well , I think you will be a great uncle . You are sure to enjoy having the grandchildren around . "

" Yes , they will be very happy . We don't have a good relationship with my father but I know he will love his grandson . My mother is much more relaxed about the situation. She wants to see us all as one big family and she thinks this can bring everyone closer together . "

I hear you are expecting your family. Yes, my parents and soon my brother as well. I didn't know you had a brother. Oh yes he is two years older than me. He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often. Nice . Is he coming on his own or with the family? His son is coming as well. He wants to go to university here in England. So they will visit a few universities while they are here. Does your brother have just one son? No, he has two daughters as well. His wife and daughters are visiting her parents so I won't see them. I'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson. Oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . They went to New Zealand last year and loved it. So when are they all coming?
### Explanation:
Hi , there is an error in the first sentence of your response . The verb 'expect' doesn't take a past participle , so change that line as follows : 
" I hear you are expecting your family . " to "I hear you have family visiting ." It is also better to avoid using a phrase such as 'on his own or with the family '. Try using the verb 'come' instead. So you could say something like this , 'Does your brother have just one son ? Yes, he has two daughters as well . His wife and daughters are visiting her parents so I won't see them.'
