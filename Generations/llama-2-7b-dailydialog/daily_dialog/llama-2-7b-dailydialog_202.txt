Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" Three thousand US dollars , please . "

" How long will they be good for ? "

" They're valid until March 21st of next year . "

" Will you accept them as a deposit at your bank ? "

" No , I think we should have some confirmation that these are still active . "

I am wondering if there is a way of starting this dialog with an instruction for the next turn instead of the response? 

" Can I help you ? "

" Yes , I need some traveler's checks . "

" How much do you need ? "

" Three thousand US dollars . "

" All right , can I have your passbook ? "

" Yes , here you go . "

" What amounts do you want the checks in ? "

" It's all the same to me . "

" Here you are . "
