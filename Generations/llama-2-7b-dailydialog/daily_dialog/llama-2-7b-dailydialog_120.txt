The office party is just around the corner and you need help organizing.  I would love to be of service , but what can I do to help ?  How about making sure everything goes smoothly at the reception ?  It’s been so long since we’ve done a formal event like this that I am not sure where to begin .  Let me get the ball rolling and then I will defer to you for your expertise . What would you like to do first , decorations or food ?

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" I think we can go with either Chinese or Indian cuisine . "

" I like that idea , but I don't know anything about Indian food so I would have to do some research on what to serve . "

" Let's not worry about that for now . I will start a list and you can make any suggestions you want . We need to get cracking as the party is in two weeks ! "
