Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" I am going to make some appointments for us to visit homes that are open this Sunday . We can meet at noon and start our search for houses around 1PM , if you would like ? "

" Noon is good for me . How about you ? "

" I will be there by noon as well ! "

Good job on getting through a conversation about looking at houses together.  We still need to add a few more sentences and phrases like "That sounds great" and "Okay, I'll see you then".  We also have to work on making the responses sound less rehearsed or robotic .

This dialog is a conversation between two people, and you're doing it well. 
You could make your sentences more concise and use active voice with some practice and time. 
I think that you used the correct punctuation in most of your sentences. 
Your last sentence could be rearranged to avoid using the word "that" twice . 
Also, it should be "We would like to see as many homes as possible." (Instead of "It will take most of the day.") 
"I'm leaving from work, so I can just meet you at the first home we're looking at. " sounds better than "I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . "
The second sentence in your response is correct, but you should make a full sentence with the verb phrase "can think of five houses..." rather than ending it with "...that." 
The last sentence has good structure and is well written. 
You've done great ! I hope to read more from you soon .
