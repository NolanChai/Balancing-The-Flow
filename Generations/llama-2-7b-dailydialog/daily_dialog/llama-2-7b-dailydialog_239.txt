" Yes , it does . History tends to repeat itself in politics , wars , fashion and economics , although each time they occur they are different because of technological advances . 

" For example , during the early 1900s a man named Woodrow Wilson was elected US president and he promised that he would end world war I . "

" But in spite of his promise , there were no peace talks when World War II broke out two decades later . "

" You could argue that the reason for this was because of Wilson â€™ s weakness as a president . "

" He never got involved in world politics during or after WWI , and so by the time he was running for election again he had no reputation of being powerful or strong . 

" In fact , he became even weaker because the United States Congress refused to ratify his treaty that proposed international disarmament and a League of Nations . "

" What do you think ? Does history repeat itself ? "

History repeats itself if you are interested in it and pay attention to details. If you don't, then your grades will show it . You should have listened better to your teacher. The lessons might not be as boring as you thought !
