I feel sorry for you. It’s a jungle out there. Do you know any places? Well, I guess I can ask around to see if anyone's got a room or an apartment available. Thank you. I think I should also have a look at the Internet to see if anyone's got a sublet. How much do are you looking to spend? I can only afford about 1000 RMB a month. Looks like you’ll have to get a place in the suburbs. Anything you need to have in the place? I want a bedroom with full bath, and it’d be better if the bedroom is on the sunny side. You can also check out university bulletin boards. Why? Will those be students who are leaving ?

I hope you find something nice soon.
