Thank you! It is quite interesting, isnâ€™t it?

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Let's play chess."

"I haven't played chess for a long time."

"That's all right, I'm a beginner. I've just learnt how to play."

"Look, there's a chessboard. Those two men have already finished playing."

"You're a very good player."

"Not really, but once I won a prize."

"So did I. I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners."
