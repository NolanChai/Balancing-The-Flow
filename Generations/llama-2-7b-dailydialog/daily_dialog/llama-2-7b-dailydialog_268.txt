I like how you took my idea of creating an eye-catching business card that will stand out from other cards. You went a step further and described the features that make it special compared to ordinary cards, including creative font style, bold design, and interesting color. I especially like your suggestion that I should keep this card as part of my collection because it's unique in its own way. Your response is well-structured, with clear arguments supported by relevant examples. It's a great way to start our discussion about business cards!
