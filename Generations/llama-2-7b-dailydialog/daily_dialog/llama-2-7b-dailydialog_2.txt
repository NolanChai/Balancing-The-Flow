Tim hung up the phone and went to bed with a smile on his face.  He liked Karren a lot, and he was sure she felt the same way about him. 

The next morning , Tim arrived at school early for his class with Mr. Sawyer .  It was an advanced placement English course , and Tim's favorite class of the day.Mr. Sawyer , a short man with white hair , was sitting behind his desk waiting for his students when they walked in . He waved them to their seats as he read over some papers on his desk .

" Okay , everyone , have a seat . I'm Mr. Sawyer , and this is English 10 . Our first assignment is called an " Expository Essay .""

" That sounds interesting . Can you give us any more details ? " Tim asked. 

Mr.Sawyer looked around the room before answering . He chose to speak directly to Karren who was sitting next to Tim . 

" Karren , would you please explain to the class what an expository essay is ? " 

She looked at Mr. Sawyer as if she were trying to decide whether or not to answer his question.  Finally , she spoke in a very soft voice , almost as if she were afraid he might get angry with her ." An expository essay is an essay that explains something and tells how it works . "

Tim smiled at Karren for answering the question even though Mr. Sawyer had asked it of someone else.  He was used to his friend answering questions in class , even when they were not meant for her.Mr. Sawyer continued." Thanks, Karren . I appreciate you volunteering to help us out . Now then , let's get started on our essays . Here are the rules : The paper must be two to three pages long , double spaced and written in Times New Roman 12 point font . It should have an introduction with a thesis statement, a body that discusses the topic from your own perspective, and a conclusion."

" That sounds easy enough . "Tim said. 

Mr. Sawyer ignored his comment , but Tim continued to smile at him anyway.He turned around in his chair to look at Karren who was writing down notes on her desk.  When she finished , she put the pen back into her bag and closed it." Do you have any questions ? " Mr. Sawyer asked the class." I do . What kind of topic should we choose ? " a girl named Susan asked with an excited voice.

Mr. Sawyer looked at his desk to see if he had put anything down about choosing topics for the paper.  He picked up a handout and read it silently . Then , without looking at anyone in particular , he said, 

" How about your first topic will be the one you choose . " 

Tim turned back around and smiled again at Karren who was still writing.When she finished writing , Tim looked over at her with a big smile on his face." What do I write about ? " he asked excitedly .

Karren put her pen down and picked up the paper that Mr. Sawyer had given them ." Why don't you choose a topic from this list ? He said, pointing to the list of ideas written on the handout.  " 

Tim turned to look at Karren , who was holding out the list for him to take.He took it and looked over at Mr. Sawyer.Mr. Sawyer nodded his head with a smile.  Tim chose " The Importance of Books ." Then he handed the paper back to Karren." It's your turn , " she said, holding out her hand for him to choose his topic from.

He picked the third one on the list : " Why I Like to Play Baseball . " As soon as Tim read it , Karren smiled and nodded.She knew he liked baseball, so it was an obvious choice." I'll have this paper finished by Monday , " Karren said quietly. 

Mr. Sawyer smiled at both of them before speaking again." That is fine . You will turn in a copy to me , and one to your partner for peer review." He continued, " You also need to do research on the topic you have chosen and gather supporting evidence." 

" What kind of supporting evidence ? " Tim asked.

" Primary sources such as facts, statistics, interviews , or personal experiences will help support your thesis statement . They must be properly cited in a works-cited page at the end of your paper . " Mr. Sawyer said quickly as he looked around the room and checked to make sure everyone understood what he meant by primary sources." Now , please get started on this assignment immediately !
