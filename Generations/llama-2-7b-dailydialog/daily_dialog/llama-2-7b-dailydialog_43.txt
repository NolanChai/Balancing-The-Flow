Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Do you believe in UFOs ?"

"Of course, they are out there."

"But I never saw them."

"Are you stupid? They are called UFOs , so not everybody can see them."

"You mean that you can see them."

Hi, 
I don't understand why you didn't put an exclamation point at the end of your response. 
It should be: Of course ! they are out there !

And it seems strange that you put a question mark at the end of your next response . 
It should be "You mean that you can see them in your dreams ? "

"Do you believe in UFOs?"

"Of course, they are out there."

"But I never saw them."

"Are you stupid? They are called UFOs so not everybody can see them."

"You mean that you can see them."

"That's right. I can see them in my dreams."

"They come to the earth?"

"No, their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space."

"Aliens from the outer space? Do you talk to them? What do they look like?"

" UFOs have been in this earth for more than 10 years . Do you know how many people are killed by them , everyday ? They kill us by their laser rays and make us sick . But the government is hiding it from the public . We don't know who they are . "
" I am sure that it is not true ! The government won't do anything to you ! They even want you to tell others about their existence , because if people think so , they would believe in them and buy their goods . That way, the sales of these goods will increase. In this way , the economy can be developed . "
" I am not joking with you . You should see it yourself ! Do you know that the government has built many military bases to protect us ? They are fighting against the aliens ! "
" I don't believe that . You are making fun of me . "
" No , it's true ! But it is a secret . "
