" Sure , I have one called Sweetheart . It makes your hair smooth and shiny . I'm going to spray it on the tips of your hair and then work from there outward in sections . The front section is fine but the back needs some attention. "

The stylist finished by cutting and setting her client's hair. 

### Explanation:
You have been hired by a famous hairdresser to be her assistant while she is on vacation in Europe. This is your first day . 

This dialog takes place in the salon of a small town. The woman who owns it, as well as being a hairdresser, also cuts hair and sells some products. She has a reputation for knowing what works best with different types of curls. Her clients have long been coming to her to get this kind of style. 

The dialog is about getting a haircut. In the first line , the client says that she wants a cut with clean lines on top, sides and back . This means that she does not want a very short bobbed-style hairstyle or any fussy designs all over her head. She just wants it to look as though no one has ever touched it before . 

The next line asks the client whether her hair is naturally curly or if it's a perm. This question allows you to understand whether she really does have curls that can be styled and shaped well or if it's just a perm that needs regular maintenance . 

"It's natural" , says the client. The hairstylist replies, "That's my specialty . Let me put this around your neck." This is her way of saying she has no problems with her curls . The next line explains how a cut like that will help minimize frizzy hair . 

"Thank you !", says the client. It was a short and simple exchange but it was very helpful to understand what kind of hairstyle to give this person.
