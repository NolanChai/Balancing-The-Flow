I really like your story and dialogs. They seem very naturalistic and I enjoy reading them. I feel that they are quite easy to read.

There is only one suggestion that comes to my mind. When you start a dialog with 'Hey, should we ask Jason to play?' it's a little unclear for me whether the next person replies to this or not. It'd be great if there was some indication like : 'Let's invite him' , maybe ?
