Help me write a response to the above dialogue with no explanation or format changes.

" wow ! Congratulations ! "

That is really great news. You must feel very excited about it.

That sounds like fantastic news. Congratulations! I am excited to read your work in the Literary Criticism section. The columnist who is going on leave must really think highly of you to pass down her duties and responsibilities to you so soon after she started.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" congratulations on your new job . What a great opportunity ! "

" thanks . I really appreciate it . It's been a long time since my first article was published in a magazine , but I think being an editor will help me learn the tricks of writing for magazines again . "

" are you sure that you'll have enough time to edit and write your articles ? "

" well , it is only every fortnight , so I should be able to handle it . "

" you know that we'll definitely read your work in the magazine ! "

" thank you . It will feel good getting published again . "

" what a coincidence ! My roommate just told me about that column and said she was interested in reading it . " 

" did she tell you what kind of articles they're publishing ? "

" I don't think she read anything by the columnist yet , but she mentioned something about comparing books to movies . "

" yeah , that sounds like her ! She was really into movies when we were in high school and it hasn't changed since then . "

" you mean she still goes to see all the latest releases ? " 

" every weekend without fail ! I think if she had time , she would watch a movie at least once or twice during the workday as well . "

" really ? She said that her parents wouldn't let her do anything like that when we were kids . "

" maybe they changed their mind when we got older and moved out . " 

" I hope she gets a job at that magazine too ! You guys would have so much to talk about while you waited for your turn in line at the movie theatre ! "

I’d like to congratulate on becoming assistant editor. What kind of work will be included in the column? How many articles will you publish per month? 

I think you have a very promising future in magazine publishing. How did you get started with Economist ? Do you also write for other magazines ? 

It is nice to hear that you’re excited about getting your thoughts published again. Are you going to be the editor of a column or just an assistant editor? What kind of column will it be? 

I think that I would like to subscribe to Economist. Would it be possible for me to get a subscription form from you ? 

Is there anything else I can do for you ? Do you want to go out to celebrate your good news ? Let’s go and have dinner together tonight !
