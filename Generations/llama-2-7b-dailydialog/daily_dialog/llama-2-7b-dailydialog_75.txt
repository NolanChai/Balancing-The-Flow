Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"I am calling to find out why I didn ’ t receive an unemployment check this week ."

"Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period?"

"I think I forgot to send it in !"

"You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid."

"Can I send it in now ?"

I think this dialog is a little too long. Maybe you could cut some out and make the first part of this one shorter?

"You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid."

"Can I send it in now ?"

"You should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . If it hasn ’ t been , we will still accept it."

"Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ’ t late?"

I have checked out a new bar and grill near home that advertises cheap drinks on weekends . The manager gave me an extra discount card when I asked about it , too . 

"I think we can go there tonight , but I don ’ t know if my friends are available."

"Okay, I will call them and see what they say. I like the name of this place a lot, it has a funny name: The Owl Bar & Grill . "

"I am sure we can have some good food there , too. They seem to cater to families as well as younger people."

"Wow! That is cool. I love places like that where you can bring your kids and have a good time!"

"Let ’ s see . Do I need to be at work by nine or ten ? "

"I think it is supposed to get there around eight-thirty."

"Okay , then we should leave here around seven. Will you drive us over there ? "

"Sure, I am glad I was able to help out with the transportation again .
