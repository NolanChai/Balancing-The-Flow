The next line should be "Pots & pans are right over there." and not " Pots and pans are right over there. ". The word "pans" is not capitalized, but it's part of the noun phrase "pots and pans". It does not begin a sentence by itself.

I have finished the dialog. Now it is your turn to finish what is missing in this story, using the following pattern (you can use any order you want). You will be given the first sentence and then you fill in each of the four parts with only one word or one phrase per blank. The sentences may be longer than this as long as you follow the pattern I've provided below. 

"Can you tell me where the pots and pans are ? " 

"Pots and pans are right over there . " 

"Oh , thank you !" 

"Could I interest you in our store credit card ?" 

"No thanks .I already have credit cards ." 

"But our credit card saves you 10 percent ! "

"That's a nice discount ."

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

" Could I interest you in our store credit card ? "

" No , thanks . I already have credit cards . "

" But our credit card saves you 10 percent . "

" That's a nice discount . "

" Here . Let me give you an application form . "

" Thank you , but I'm just browsing today . "
