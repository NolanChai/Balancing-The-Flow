Hi Mike.  Good to hear from you, too. How are things?

Fine.  It’s been a while since we saw each other. I’ve just come home from a party and have been catching up with friends online. Let me know if Friday works for you.

Great ! How about we go to that new restaurant in town that you suggested? The food looks great!

Sounds good , Mike.  See you then. Bye !

Bye .  And thanks again for inviting me along.
