I am very glad to see you succeed and grow.  It is a bit sad that we won’t be working together anymore, but I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.  We have been through quite a few hardships together and I will remember you as an excellent friend and colleague who never gave up on me or anyone else.
Please let us know how everything goes with the new job! 
I am very grateful for your help, but it is no longer necessary to write me another letter of recommendation.  All I need from now on is a good word about you when I meet my manager, and that won’t be difficult because he knows you well already .
