I am afraid I will have to charge you $ 100. The ticket has already been issued. And the airline does not accept refunds for tickets under 96 hours old, even if they are changed or canceled. If you wish to cancel your reservation , we need to charge you a cancellation fee of $ 75 per person .

Thank you for calling Trans Pacific Airline . Please have a pleasant day !

Thank you for your help , Ms . Wang . Your new reservation is now confirmed and the ticket will be available at the gate on July 29 when you check in . Please remember to bring a photo ID as well as this confirmation number . We look forward to seeing you in August . Thank you again . Goodbye !

This dialog is almost complete. Your only problem seems to be the spelling of Wang ’ s last name and his date of birth ; this needs correction as well.

" Good afternoon . Trans Pacific Airline . How can I help you ? "

" I ’ m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis . Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19 ? "

" What ’ s your name , please ? "

" My name is Judy Wang . "

" How do you spell your last name , please ? "

" W-A-N-G . "

" How do you spell your first name , please ? "

" J-U-D-Y . "

" Please note that this ticket has a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation . "

" It ’ s OK . Where should I pay for the penalty ? "

" At the airport . OK , Miss Wang , your Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Minneapolis is canceled . Your new reservation is Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Minneapolis at 9 thirty a . m . on August 2 . "
