" Have a seat , please. Now then , let ’ s get started right away . Do I understand correctly that you are an employee of the Xinghai factory ? "

" Yes , sir. "

" What is your position there and what does it entail ? "

" I ’ m in charge of a section that handles accounts receivable for all of China . My department has 20 employees under me . "

" How long have you been working with Xinghai ? "

" More than five years now . "

" And how do your superiors think about you there ? Are they satisfied with the job that you are doing for them ? "

" Yes , sir. My superiors give me positive feedback all of the time . I have been in this position since 2019 and it ’ s going very well for us . "

" Do you have any experience working here before this ? "

" No , not at all . "

" Tell me about your professional background then . What is your educational background ? "

" I ’ m a graduate of the Business Administration Department of Nanjing University and was employed by the Xinghai Company immediately upon graduation. I have never left this company since that time. "

" And what kind of experience do you have ? "

" I worked hard to get promoted here . I started out as a junior assistant in 2015 and now I am in charge of all the accounts receivable for Xinghai , as I said before . "

" Well that is good experience . What can you tell me about your management style ? You have so many people under you now . How do you manage them ? Do they like working with you ? "

" Well , yes. I have a very nice relationship with all the employees in my department and they get along well with each other too . My colleagues respect me as their leader. We are a team and work together to achieve our goal of collecting all accounts receivable on time for Xinghai . "

" And do you have any experience with personnel management ? How would you deal with an employee who was not performing well in his or her duties ? "

" Yes , I can handle that as well. If the employees are working hard but still cannot finish their work assignments on time due to personal problems or other issues, then I try to help them to understand and find a solution . But if they do not want to improve themselves in this area , I would have no choice but to dismiss him or her from my department . "

" That is good. If you were to hire someone new into your team who had the same kind of skills that you already have, how would you handle this person ? "

" Well , I think it ’ s important for me to share with my team members what I know and train them to be as efficient as possible . So I would be happy if a colleague joined our group and could work together with him or her on projects and training sessions. "

" What else should you know about yourself that I haven ’ t asked yet ? "

" Well , I ’ m very open-minded when it comes to the workplace . I think communication is important so I will talk with my colleagues if they have problems or need advice . We are all professionals and we should communicate effectively in order to accomplish our goals together as a team . "

" How well do you get along with your colleagues ? Do they like working with you ? "

" Well , there are some employees who don ’ t want to work together very often because they have their own methods of doing things and are afraid of being influenced by others on how to work . But overall my co-workers and I get along well and can communicate effectively when we need to do so. "

" Have you ever had any problems with other colleagues at the office ? "

" Well , I remember there was an employee who didn ’ t want me to make changes in his work area . He said he didn ’ t like my style of working and that it made him feel uncomfortable. So we decided not to work together anymore because our styles were different . "

" That’ s too bad . What else can you tell me about your professional background ? Have you ever taken any courses or received any training for this position ? "

" Yes , I did take some accounting and management classes in college that helped me with my job here at Xinghai . My supervisor also gave me some additional training on how to manage finances efficiently for the company . "

" That ’ s great ! So you have a lot of experience working with your coworkers then ? Have there ever been any conflicts between you and another employee in terms of work style or communication ? If so , what happened and how did it get resolved ? "

" Well yes . There was one time when I asked an employee to do something different than she had been doing before . She got very angry about this change because she thought I was trying to control her too much in the office. But after we talked more about this situation , she understood why I did it and eventually agreed with me . "
" That ’ s good ! So how would you handle a difficult co-worker who did not want to follow your instructions ? "

" Well , my first step would be to try talking with the person directly . If he or she refuses then I would have to explain why I think that his or her way of working is wrong and why it needs to change in order for us all to do our jobs effectively together . "
" That ’ s a good approach. Now , we are nearing the end of this interview process . Is there anything else about yourself or your skills as an employee that you would like me to know before I make my final decision ? "

" Well , I am very hardworking and dedicated to my job . I always put in 120% effort into everything that I do because I believe in being professional at work no matter what type of task is assigned to me by my superiors. "

" Thank you for sharing your experience with us today . Is there anything else about yourself or Xinghai Company that I should know before making this decision ? "

" No , not really . I think everything has been covered in our discussion already and now it ’ s up to me if they decide to hire me or not . "

" How long did you study this subject ? "

" Four years . "

" Do you have any experience working with the public ? "

" Yes , I used to be an editor of a school newspaper and then I worked as a host in a radio program for a year . "
