Thank you , madam . How do you take it ?

I prefer it scrambled with ketchup .

OK .

Here you are , miss . Would you please pass me the salt and pepper ?

Certainly , sir . I'll put some butter on that as well . Here's a serviette for you if you'd like to wipe your fingers .

Thank you very much. 

That was delicious . Could we order another plate , please ? 

Yes , madam . Surely we can have more .
