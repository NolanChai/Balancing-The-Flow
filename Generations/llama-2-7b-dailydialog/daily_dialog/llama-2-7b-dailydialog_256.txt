Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" Come on , relax ! It ’ s not that bad . You should call him and ask where he is and if he wants to talk to you . "

" But what if he ’ s cheating ? What if I ’ m the one being lied to ? How can I live with myself ? "

" Honey , listen ... I know you love this guy a lot ... but it ’ s not fair that he is taking advantage of you . You should tell him how you feel and make sure he knows where you stand before things get out of hand . "

" That ’ s what I keep telling myself ! But I don ’ t want to be the one to end it . "

" Well , if you love him so much , why not ? "

" ... you ’ re right , hon . It is your fault for cheating on him with another guy . And don ’ t blame it all on the fact that he can ’ t leave the firehouse and meet you for dinner . He could have called or texted you when he got off duty at night ! "

" But I was so happy ! You have no idea what I felt like.I just felt like a kid again , in love again . It was amazing . But now ... I don ’ t know if it was worth it . He cheated on me , and I can never trust him ever again . "

He's a firefighter? Who knew? ( )

I hope he calls her soon . It would be really nice if they got back together.  ( )

He obviously has feelings for you . Just make the first step and I ' m sure it will work out ! You should give him another chance .  ( )

You ' re totally overreacting ! It ’ s not like he cheated on you . And what do you mean by saying you ’ Ve messed this up ? You had to go save someone in a burning building , that ’ s just how it is ...  ( )

Why are you so obsessed with him ? Move on and find someone else ! ( )

It ’ s really not your fault . It was a freak accident ... he ’ s just trying to protect the guy from getting burned ... ( )
