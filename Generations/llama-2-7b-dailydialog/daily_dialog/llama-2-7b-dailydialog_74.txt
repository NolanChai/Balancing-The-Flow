" yeah . Still together . We just celebrated our five-year anniversary . She's really a great girl , but sometimes I still find it hard to believe how she fell for me. "

" that's really good news . So what's the job scene like ? What do you actually do ? "

" well , I was in the accounting program at school so I found an entry level position with a company as an accounts receivable clerk . I'll admit , it wasn't my dream job , but I knew that it would give me some experience to put on my resume for when I actually applied to do what I really want to do. "

" so you're working in finance ? That must be fun and challenging . But enough about work . So , how's the family life ? You have kids yet ? "

" well , we were planning on having children a few years ago , but my wife had some complications and it was really hard for her to get pregnant. "

" I can imagine that must be stressful . Have you tried any fertility treatment ? "

" no . We've never talked about it , but it seems like we have other issues in our lives so we never had the opportunity to consider that option . And now she's pregnant ! It's been a rough road for her and me. "

The dialog is fine and it’s easy to understand the meaning of each sentence. However, there are some grammatical errors. 

For example, in lines 3 & 4, you should use commas to separate the sentences. In line 5, “It feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas” sounds strange; maybe you mean it’s hard to believe that it has been ten years since graduation? If so, replace “collection” with “collection of”.
