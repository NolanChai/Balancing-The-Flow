"Can you help me plan the office party?"

"Sure. What do you need the most help with, the food or entertainment?"

"I need help with food."

"OK, well, let's coordinate our efforts. Should this party be formal or casual?"

"I think it should be casual."

"I think Chinese cuisine is the best . What's your opinion? 

"I also agree . You can always make arrangements with a caterer if you want to save time. Do you have any other plans ? 

"Yes , I have more questions for you . How can we get good entertainment for this party ? "

"Well , there are many options available . The easiest would be hiring a DJ or an acoustic guitarist . These guys usually come with their own equipment and they do not charge as much. If you've got a bigger budget , you can go for karaoke . You need to reserve it in advance though . "

"How much will the Chinese food cost ? 

"It will cost around $50 per person including the beverages . The party itself will be free."

"Great idea ! Now that we've planned everything out , all we need to do now is confirm the arrangements with our suppliers . Is there anything else you can think of right now ? "

" Yes , I forgot about flowers for the table decorations . "

" No problem at all . We will order some bouquets and they should be delivered today . So how does the office party planning turn out so far ? "

" Everything is coming together very nicely ! Thank you . You've done a great job of coordinating this . I know it won't be easy to plan an event like this , but it looks like we got everything covered ! Thanks again for your help ! "
