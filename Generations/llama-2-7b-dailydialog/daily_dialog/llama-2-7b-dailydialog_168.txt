I think that I would use “to go” instead of “go to” in the first sentence. The second sentence is missing some important words like “You’re right”, or “That was a good idea.” You can use “I’m sorry” to be polite, but it doesn't sound very sincere. I also think you need to change “it must’ve been the weather.” because it doesn’t make sense without explaining what “it” is referring to (the rain). Finally, you should end with something like “I can’t wait until we go to lunch”.
