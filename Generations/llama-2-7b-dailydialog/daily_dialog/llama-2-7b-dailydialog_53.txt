" We'd love some iced tea , please . "

" Thanks . I think that we are going to head home soon, so we won't stay long. "

" Okay ! How have things been with you and Josh since we last saw each other ? "

" What do you have available ? "

It was good to see you ! We're glad that you decided to stop by and we have missed seeing you too.
We went for a walk on the beach this morning, but it wasn't very warm out . It's pretty cold right now , so we just had something quick to eat before we left . 

It was good to see Josh ! We haven't seen him since he moved away three years ago . 

So how are your kids ? What do you think of them growing up so fast ? I know that when my kids were little , they never stopped talking and asking me questions . They still have a lot of energy, but at least they can hold a decent conversation now ! My granddaughter is in kindergarten this year. She's really smart !
