I think the best way is this. 

" my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses. But then we had three parties to celebrate . "

"three parties? That's quite a lot. That must have been expensive! "

"Well, since my husband and I are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country. It wasn't actually that expensive."

"Were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married ? "

" well , as I mentioned earlier , my parents couldn ' t come to the wedding because of finances , but my mother came for both parties . "

" and what about your in-laws ? Did they get to see your husband's side of the family ? "

" yes . We went to Japan for three weeks after the ceremony and spent some time travelling around the country together. Then we had a week in Hawaii which was really beautiful . It wasn't an expensive holiday by any means , but it was enough for us . "

" how did you meet ? "

" I met him on the internet . We were chatting online and got to know each other a little bit before he came over here to visit me . "

" you seem pretty happy together ! "

" we are , and it's been almost nine years since we married . "

I have just written down what I thought Abigail said, but it is not really grammatically correct. 

" my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . But then we had three parties to celebrate . "

" did you go on a honeymoon ? "
