" How's your career planning going ? Did you finally make a decision ? "

" Yes and no . I am still not sure if I want to quit my job yet . But I know what I am really good at is managing people . I can see that in myself when I work with my coworkers every day . I think I should try something new and get into management . "

" Well , it will be a big change for you since you have never worked as a manager before . How about changing positions within the same company ? You might not need to start from scratch . "

" Yeah , but this way would mean that I would stay in my current field and do something else , which is what I want. Besides , I think it will help me save some money because I would have more income for a while even if I quit . "

" Hmm . It may be a good idea to start working as an assistant or coordinator at the company where you are working now first and then get promoted later on . It is common for people with this kind of background to work in middle management after they take some managerial courses . "

" I have made my decision now . I will resign at the end of June and start looking for a job as assistant or coordinator . I think that it is necessary to try something new . If I don't succeed , there are still other options . "

" Have you given any thought about what kind of job you would like ? You might want to keep in mind that there are so many opportunities for people with the same background as you in this field nowadays . What is most important is that you find something that interests you and fits your personality well . "

" I know , but I am not sure if any of them would be suitable . I have been thinking about taking a management course to improve my knowledge on the business side first . "

" I think it is good . It will give you some more ideas and help you find your way forward in the job market later on . "

" How was the course ? Wasn't it too expensive for what they taught ? I am still looking for a good program to help me get into management . "

" Yes , you are right that not everything we have learned from that course can be applied in our work and lives . But the knowledge of career planning is essential . What I found useful was how to set goals . We also were taught some techniques on how to improve communication skills at work . And last but not least , it helped us get organized . "

" That's great ! I am glad you got something out of it ! It seems that we all need to know more about this since we are in a very competitive world nowadays . "
