I'm not sure about your plan for tonight. 
I think we should go to a Chinese restaurant across the street instead of cooking at home. 
Chinese food is very spicy, but I'll love it with you. 
It looks delicious on their menu . 
You will be surprised when you taste some of my dishes. 
You will definitely like them. 
I heard that there's a cooking course in Chinatown if we are interested. 
Do you think we can learn Chinese cooking ? It might be fun to do it together . 
We don't have to do it alone when we go out, so I think learning how to make it is a good idea. 
I just hope that you will like my dishes and not tell me that they taste weird. 
If so , I would feel embarrassed in front of other people . 
It would be better if we order Chinese food at the restaurant tonight. 
We don't have to cook by ourselves when we go out , but it would be nice to learn some Chinese cooking at home. 
I hope you enjoy my dishes tomorrow night . I know that they are delicious. 
It won't be weird if we order the same dish as other people in our class. 
We can make our own food while others are making theirs . 
My classmates and I will try to learn Chinese cooking together. 
Let me know what you think of my idea later on , OK ? Bye !
