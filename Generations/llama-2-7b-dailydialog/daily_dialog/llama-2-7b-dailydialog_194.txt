" You failed all four of your skills tests , and you were late for each one of them by a few minutes. 
You also drove through several red lights on the test , so the officer who was grading it didn't think very highly of your driving . "

" You were late for your appointment with the driving school. 

You drove too fast in a school zone and you were two miles over the speed limit on the highway. 

Your brakes were faulty because they squeaked during every stop." 

" Wow . That's terrible ! "

" I know , but don't worry, you can take it again as soon as next Monday. 

If you do well then you will be able to drive a car on your own from now on!"

"The car was too fast and the brakes were inadequate. You also had several close calls with other cars that almost caused an accident. On top of all this , you did not follow any of my instructions. 

You could not turn around or park the car . "

" Oh ! What else ? "

" You forgot to signal before changing lanes and failed to stay in your lane while driving . In fact , I was so concerned that you wouldn ' t make it through the test that I nearly had a heart attack when we came up on traffic and you didn ' t even slow down. 

I thought for sure that there would be an accident , but luckily it all worked out in the end . "

" What a relief ! I was so nervous , I don't know what happened to me . I just couldn't control myself . I felt like I was going crazy ! 

I am sorry that I did not do well on my test . This has been hard for you , and I really appreciate everything you have done for me. You are a great driving instructor , and I would recommend you to everyone that needs a good instructor . Thank you so much ! "

"So how did I do on my driving test ?"

" Do you want the truth ?"

"Of course , I do."

"Well , you really didn't do all that well . "

"How bad did I do ?"

"To be completely honest ,you failed your test . "

"How ?"

"There were a number of reasons ."

"What were they ?"

"Basically , you just can't drive."

"Can I have another try ?"
