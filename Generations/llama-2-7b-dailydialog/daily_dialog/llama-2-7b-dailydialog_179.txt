I am so glad that the supermarket is closed now . Otherwise, I would have come with you. I would like to take a walk for about 30 minutes before I get home and read my book. That way I will be refreshed for dinner. We could go to the supermarket tomorrow morning if it opens at 8:00 o'clock .

Hi , Sam ! I'm glad you want to come with us tomorrow morning at 8 :30. We should be able to find a good restaurant and then maybe catch a show or do some shopping later in the day . Do you like going out on Saturday nights ? 

I've never really gone anywhere special for Friday or Saturday night before , but I think it would be fun to try something different ! The supermarket is closed today ? That's too bad because I wanted to pick up a few things that we need . 

Yes , she has been there for about 10 years . She got a job in San Francisco and never really came back home after that . She met her husband there and now they live together and are expecting their first baby ! 

Oh , that's wonderful news ! When is the baby due ? 

I don't know exactly but it will be soon I think . So what do you want to do for dinner tonight ? We could try one of these seafood restaurants on this street or maybe have a pizza and play some video games afterward . Do you like playing video games ? 

I can't play them too well but I enjoy watching other people play ! That sounds fun . What do you want to eat ?
