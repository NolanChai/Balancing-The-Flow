"What kind of job do you usually do ? Is it similar to what I'm doing here ? "

"I'm a secretary . "

" That sounds nice ! But I heard that secretaries have to work really hard and don't make much money . What is the real situation like ? "

" You know , sometimes working as a secretary is very easy.Some companies hire secretaries who are not well-trained or experienced enough and they always make mistakes when typing letters or taking phone calls.They usually have to stay late in the office too.I am lucky because my boss trusts me and I am responsible for important documents . That's why he doesn't keep a tight check on me . I don't work overtime unless there are big problems at hand. "

I want to know something more about you . What do you think of your life ? 

" It is not bad . But there are still a lot things that I hope to do in my future . For example , I would like to be able to speak better English . Besides , I am looking forward to traveling abroad one day.I don't know when it will come true but the dream is always there . "

" I am sure you can achieve all your goals someday . You seem confident and capable of doing what you want."

" Thanks . But I have to work hard on that too . It won't be easy . "

" Nice to meet you here too.Why did your boss send you here today?You know this company well ? "

" It's my first time visiting in this company . My boss has never worked here before either.I hope I can have a good job with such nice colleagues and working atmosphere . "

" Are you enjoying your work now ? Do you think it is hard to work on the night shift? "

" Of course , because I am new in this company , I've to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant.Sometimes , I am really under great pressure when it gets busy . "

" Take it easy . You will gain experience with more work and time.I hope you won't have too much trouble in the job ."

" Luckily not .The silent I meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . "
