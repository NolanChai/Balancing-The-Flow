I am sorry for the late reply. 

Here is how you would continue the conversation. 

" Well , what about swimming ? We have some good swimmers . "

" I think we will win a few medals in the pool . Maybe three or four . "

" How about boxing ? Do you think we are any good at that ? "

" No , not really . Most of our fighters don ’ t stand a chance against the competition from other countries. "

" I think they have better fighter than us in the field events too . We won ’ t get any medals there . "

I don ’ t know if Mike farmer will win any medals . I think he is not good enough to beat the national record. 

I hope we ’ ll do well at the Olympics . I would like to see some of our athletes get gold medals in all sports events . 

I agree with you that we have a very good chance to win several silver and bronze medals . I am sure our team will train hard to win those prizes. 

I think swimming , cycling and ball sports are the ones we should do well at the Olympics this year . Our athletes have been practising hard for months now so they should be in good shape . 

I don ’ t know much about sailing but I heard that our sailors had done a lot of training before the Olympic Games . If this is true , then we will probably get some gold medals.
