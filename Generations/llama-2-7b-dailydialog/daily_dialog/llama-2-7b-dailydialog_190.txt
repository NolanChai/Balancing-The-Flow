" What kind of stuff does she need ? "

" Well , she has been making all kinds of drawings at school and with some watercolor paints . Now she wants to learn more about oil painting . "

" What kind of oils is she using ? "

" I don't know . But they are cheaper than the ones you get in art supply stores . She just got a set from her parents that was only $50 and they were not very good quality . They dried out easily and made the paint watery when it mixed with water . "

" Hmm , well , I can probably help you find some oil paints that will be easier to work with for your niece . I have a friend who is an artist who knows where all the good deals are . "
