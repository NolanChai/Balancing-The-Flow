"My former employer always seemed to be a busy workaholic with little time for his employees.He expected us to be available around the clock, which made it difficult to maintain good personal relationships outside of the office . I think a better manager would have provided better working conditions and allowed a healthy separation between our personal lives and work life . "

"What did you do when you felt your boss was not being fair ? "

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"What type of people do you work with most effectively ?"

"I tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward.It's more difficult for me to be around timid people , because I move quickly and I am decisive."

" What things impress you in your colleagues ? "

"I admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . I also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment ."

"What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? "

"The only thing I really don't like is to get feedback in front of others . I want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that I have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . I believe that's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior ."

"How do you organize and plan for major projects ? "

" Last year , we were in the process of opening a new office in Los Angeles and we were competing with another company for major accounts . My boss asked me to make a presentation on a Friday afternoon about a contract that I thought would be important for us.The other company was also making a bid.We were behind and it was clear that our team had to meet or exceed the quality of their bid in order to win this contract . We had no time to waste , so my boss gave me two days to prepare and present my bid . "

" That's pretty amazing ! What did you do ? "

### Response:

" I know it sounds crazy , but I prepared a proposal that night . I then spent all day Saturday rewriting the presentation so it would be more appealing.I had to come back into my office after work on Monday to get some new pictures and charts ready for Tuesday's meeting . "

" How did you prepare yourself mentally ? "

### Response:

" I told myself that everything was going to turn out okay , even if the other company had a better bid . I knew we could compete with them, especially since they were new in this area and hadn't built as many relationships yet . We didn't have any major setbacks during the meeting and everyone loved my proposal.We got the contract ! "

" What was your biggest concern before you started to work on it ? "

### Response:

" It seemed like it would take forever, but I thought of all the things that could go wrong . When we finally made the presentation , everything fell into place and went smoothly . "

" Wow ! You're an amazing worker ! How do you feel about your ability to handle pressure ? "

### Response:

" I am not afraid of difficult situations at work.I welcome them because they help me learn more about myself . I also feel better when the job is done and we get to celebrate with our new clients . That's the best feeling ever ! "

" What would your coworkers say about you in a stressful situation ? "

### Response:

" I think they would describe me as a strong person who can take control of a situation and lead them to success.I also hope that others feel good about working with me because of my positive attitude . "

" My job involves working closely with many different types of people throughout the organization .I usually spend one hour each morning to set priorities for my day.That helps me focus on the most important tasks and delegate those that are less urgent . I also like to get away from my desk and meet with people throughout the building , so I can understand their work better . "

" How do you handle multiple projects at once ? "

### Response:
" Sometimes it's hard to prioritize when a new project comes in .I always try to set time aside during my day for what I call “fire drills.” That gives me a chance to check email and answer phone calls , which are often the most urgent. It's also important to know your boss 's preferred way of working and follow those guidelines as well ."

" You really have to understand what type of personality you work best with . My colleagues know that I am honest and straightforward, so they tend not to give me ideas if the suggestion is going to be in conflict with our core values.I usually will come up with an idea on my own because I like to have control over my destiny . "

" It's a good idea to tell your supervisor what type of feedback works best for you , so that he or she knows how to give the most effective critique . "
