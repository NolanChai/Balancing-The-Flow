I am a little confused about your first sentence. 

Is "shall we go shopping tomorrow ?" a question, an instruction or a request?

I suggest you use it as a request and write "... let's go shopping tomorrow..."

Help me rewrite this paragraph into a conversation between two friends. 

" Oh , I heard that you were selected as one of the members of the Olympic team last night ! I am so proud of you ! Do you know what I will do in the future ? I ’ ll be a big star ! "

" Thanks . I didn ’ t think I would make it . I hope to bring honor for my country . "

" What are your plans for training ? "

" I need a coach , and I can't find one in my school . So I am looking for one online . I really want to have the best training ! "
