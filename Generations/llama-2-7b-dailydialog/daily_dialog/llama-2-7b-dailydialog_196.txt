" sure, darling. That sounds great ! We should try some new places. The last time we were there was quite a few years ago . And besides that , you'll have more fun if it isn't always the same old things you do every day . "

" that's true . I think I might like to go to Europe once again . We could fly from our city and visit a few cities in England, France and Italy . Then we could fly home without having to drive for days. It'll save us a lot of time . "

" so let's make plans right away . What are the next three Mondays ? I know they can be booked up , especially now that it is summer vacation for a lot of people . "

" there's no problem . We could go on August 15th, 22nd and 29th. It looks like it will be sunny most days . "

" great ! Let's make a list of places we want to go to and start planning our route . We could try and take in as many different cities as possible. If I can get some time off from work , I would like to visit Paris . "

" that sounds fantastic ! I really wanted to see the Eiffel Tower up close . But my list of things I want to do is getting a lot longer now . I've never been to Amsterdam in Holland and it seems very interesting . I think we should go there too. And what about Greece ? That country has always fascinated me , and it would be wonderful to see the ruins of ancient Athens for myself ! "

" sounds like we will have a great time when we get there ! We can take as many pictures as possible . I can't wait ! I think you are going to love it more than ever this time around. I know that I am already so excited about our trip . "

" yeah , I'm really looking forward to seeing all of these different places again. It will be like a dream come true ! It seems almost too good to be true that we can afford to go . "

" it doesn't have to cost a lot to see new things and experience wonderful adventures . We just need to save a little bit every month and keep our eyes open for special sales or discounts . If you want something, you should write down the name of stores that sell them and get coupons from there . And we can buy food at the grocery store instead of eating out all the time. We could probably spend a lot less money if we were more creative ! "

" I guess you are right . We really will save some serious cash by cutting back on these things , and maybe even going to used bookstores for our reading material. There's nothing like a good used book . It looks brand new but it costs half of what the regular price would be ! "

" yeah , I have always preferred to buy used books, anyway. They are so much cheaper and you can find a lot of gems at second-hand bookstores . I've discovered many new authors that way . "

" we should check out all the different stores around town to see what kind of deals they offer on used items . We need to be as careful with our money as possible in order to go on vacation without stressing about how much it costs each day. "

"hi , darling ! I have a one-month vacation saved up . How about a trip to Europe ? "

" I could go for that . But I'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . "

" oh , but I really need to leave this town for a change . Working day after day has worn me out . Do you have any other suggestions ? "

" we should probably think about going somewhere that isn't too far away . How about the countryside ? There must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local specialties . "

" wonderful ! I think that's a great idea . How soon until we can make this happen ? I can't wait ! "

" tomorrow I have an appointment with my dentist . What about next Monday ? "

" perfect . I'll start preparing tomorrow . If we're going to drive , I'd fill up the tank tonight . "

" no need . I think it's still plenty full . Even so , I'd rather travel by bus or train . It would cost much less than driving . Oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . "

" we can take the train , that will be faster . I'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . "

No problem! I am really looking forward to the coming week.
