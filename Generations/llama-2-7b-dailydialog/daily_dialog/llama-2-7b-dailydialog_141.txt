" Okay then . Thanks for your time and information . Good-bye !  "

I have an overall understanding of your company's general information. When will the personnel department let us know about the final results?
If I pass, I look forward to hearing from you within two weeks. But if I don't pass, will you still call me after two weeks to tell me why not and what I can do better in the future?
I have no complaints with my company; they are very supportive of their employees. In fact, I am leaving because of a better opportunity. Please take care! Thank you so much for your time today.

I am really impressed with your company because you have been very generous in providing us detailed information about the company. 

In fact, I already feel like a part of your team and I can't wait for the final results . 

Can I make an inquiry ? Will the personnel department call me when we have the final results ? 

I think it is very important to know whether I pass or not so that I could start preparing my resume. 

Yes, if you don't pass the interview , they won't call you . But do keep your fingers crossed and good luck ! You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call , it means that you weren't successful.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" I appreciate your encouraging comments and wish you luck too ! Good-bye and thanks for coming to our company . "

" Good-bye , and again thank you very much . See you later . "
