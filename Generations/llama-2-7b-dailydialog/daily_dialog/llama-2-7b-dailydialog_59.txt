You don't have any reading assignments? That's why we bought these English books. Here they are on the table, next to my bed. I should read them before falling asleep. 

Thanks for giving me advice about reviewing for tomorrowâ€™s test and getting more sleep. I hope you will be a little less of a drag from now on. I know that reading will help me fall asleep faster. Thanks, Mom!
