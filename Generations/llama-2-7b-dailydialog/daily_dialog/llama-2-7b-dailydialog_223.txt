Hi there ! This is your writing instructor here.  You have done an excellent job of completing this dialog correctly and consistently.  I would like to give you some specific feedback on what could be improved in the future .  The first thing that I will mention is that you did not indent the lines from your partner's response which was very important.  It would also have been helpful if you had put a capital letter at the beginning of each line, and it would also make sense to put a comma after "Hi there" so that the next sentence can start without any kind of confusion.  The second thing I noticed is that when your partner said, "...I usually run it every few days ...", he left off some punctuation which should be a period at the end of his response (...).  This is very important in order to make sense of what you are writing and to stay on topic.  Finally , your partner also said that "It finds a virus about half the time" but he did not capitalize this sentence as it should have been (It Finds A Virus About Half The Time ).  In conclusion, I would like to congratulate you on doing such an excellent job, and I hope you will use this feedback to make your writing better in the future !  Have a great day ! :)

"Yes , I do. I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall . There are so many nasties on the internet, and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users. You have to be very careful out there."

"How often do you run your antivirus program?"

"I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time."

"Which anti-virus software would you recommend?"

"Have you tried this one? It's very good, and you can download it for free on the internet. You can also download updates for free."

"That sounds very good. Which website should I visit to download it?"
