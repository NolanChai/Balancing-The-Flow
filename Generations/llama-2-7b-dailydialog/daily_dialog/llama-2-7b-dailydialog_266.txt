Help me write a response to this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"I think we should go home."

"That was a really good meal, Gordon."

"I couldn't eat another bite!"

"Well, it is getting pretty late. I have to get up early tomorrow morning to go to work."

"Let's see how much the bill is."

"Don't worry about it tonight is my treat."

I don't agree with the fact that "I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't" is right. It should be 'I said that I would treat you to dinner', not 'I kept telling'. This change will make a big difference in this sentence.

Hi there,
I think this is where Gordon and Caitlin should pay their share of the bill. Then they could go back to their house and have some tea/coffee before bed. They may want to stay in touch during the week but probably won't see each other again until next Friday.

"I am so full . I can barely move ! "
