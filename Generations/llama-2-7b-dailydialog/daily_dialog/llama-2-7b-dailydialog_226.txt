Hmm , I understand your point . Do you think that he might be taking out some anger on you ? 

Well , we ’ re trying to teach him better manners at home . He doesn ’ t mean anything when he says those things . But it does hurt my feelings sometimes . "

I know the feeling of getting angry with your kids for no reason and I don ’ t want to make you feel any worse . 

I just want you to be sure that your child is not doing this on purpose , if you can help it . We all get frustrated or upset at times , but sometimes we have to try harder to keep our feelings in check . "

Well , Tony has been very good about apologizing and saying he ’ s sorry afterward . He also says that he loves me very much . 

Maybe you are right , though . Maybe it isn ’ t so bad . "

You may have to try a few new things with your son if this continues . But I don ’ t think it will be that big of deal . We ’ re here for you if you need us . 

Thanks . I know that we can work out any problems together . I ’ m sure Tony is just trying to see what he can get away with , because he knows that he gets a little extra attention when he says those things . "

We will keep an eye on his behavior and maybe come up with some consequences if it continues .

Tony is a child in kindergarten and he doesn't know how to do things properly. But he knows some bad words which are unacceptable by parents or people around him. 

I suggest that we should help him and teach him how to speak politely. If he says something wrong, we must guide him patiently with affection. In this way, he will not use it often any more in the future.
