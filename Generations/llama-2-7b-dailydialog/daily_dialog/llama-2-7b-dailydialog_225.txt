This dialog is about two people. 

The first speaker is a candidate who was rejected by an offer of employment . The second speaker is the interviewer . 

The tone is formal and impersonal in both sentences , but the sentence structure is different . In the second sentence , the phrase " with discretion " means that the company has acted carefully . And there is a reason to reject you as an employee. 

In the next sentence , the first speaker suggests that they hire him on trial . But he gives no reason why . It seems that he thinks he would be successful in this job . He asks for an opportunity to show his ability . However , it's not a good idea because you need to prove your capability by yourself if you want to get the chance.
