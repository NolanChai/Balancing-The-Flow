I think that the tree is in bad shape. I understand your point of view, but as you can see from my reply below, I still have a good reason for keeping it up. 

"Yes , we do need to take down the Christmas tree . "

" It ’ s really starting to look like an old scarecrow ; the branches are sagging and it looks pretty sad. "

" But you love that Christmas tree , we should keep it for another week or so before taking it down . "

" Yes , but I understand your point of view .  The tree is a bit scraggly now .  But let ’ s think about all the good memories that were created under that tree.  "

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree."

"Do we have to?"

"Come on, it’s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging."

"It’s not that bad, besides it really looks nice in that corner. It gives the room a good atmosphere."

"A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart, and it’s messing up the room."

"But it makes the place feel so much like Christmas I’d really hate to have to take it down."

"But Christmas was two weeks ago ! It’s been there only because we’ve been too busy to get rid of it."

"I know, but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away."

"But it’s falling apart, and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches."

A: "Honey , come on ! The tree is falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . "
B: " But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had . All of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . " 
A : " Yeah , but I hate to take the tree down . It ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . "
B: " Come on , it ’ s time to get rid of it ! You know how much dust is going to come out of that thing when we start cleaning it ? " 
A : " But I hate to have a bare corner there . It feels so bare and empty . "
B: " Honey , the tree is falling apart , and it ’ s messing up the room ! Come on , take down the Christmas tree now before anything else falls off of it . " 
A : " Fine , fine . Let me get the ladder first . I have a bad back from carrying stuff too often . " 
B: " Don ’ t forget to throw away all of those boxes and packing materials when you ’ Ve done . We can use them next year again . " 
A : " Okay , I won ’ t be long , it doesn ’ t take that long to dismantle the tree . "
B: " What about the ornaments ? You know how much time we spent on those . We should save all of the pretty ones and keep them in a special box for next Christmas . " 
A : " Yeah , good idea . I ’ ll do that , but first I have to take down the tree . "
