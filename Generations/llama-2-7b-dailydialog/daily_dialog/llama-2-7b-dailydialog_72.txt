It's great to know that your promotion campaign is going well. I also heard about the research and development center. I think it was a good idea for them to change their product twice before they launched into the market. They must have done extensive research on what consumers like in order to make changes accordingly. It's no wonder that their advertisement is so popular among young people because it captures attention with bright colors and catchy phrases.
