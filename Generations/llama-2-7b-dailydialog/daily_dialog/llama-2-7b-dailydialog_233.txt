"OK , let's take a look at your assets then . What do you have there ? "

" We have some liquid assets like cash and cheques , but we also have some less liquid assets like stock and equipment . "

" OK , can you give me more details about these assets ? "

" The biggest chunk of our asset is money in the bank ; roughly 20 million dollars worth . We have $1,500,000 in cash on hand . We also have some stock that we're holding for inventory , which will be sold by next quarter and will be reported as revenue . The rest of our assets are equipment , furniture and machinery ; all of these will be used to support the production of our products . "

" OK , do you also have any current liabilities ? "

" Yes . We have some short-term loans from banks and from vendors in order to finance a number of projects that are not yet completed ; the total amount is 90 million dollars . Also we have about 45 million dollars in payables . We're hoping to repay these soon , as our new crop has been harvested and should be sold next quarter . "

" OK , so your assets plus current liabilities are approximately equal to the $125,000,000 that you claim is in circulation . Is this correct ? "

" Yes , I think it is . "
