Hello , Jack . I'm John . 

Sit down , please . Maybe you have read the contract , but I want to give you the details again before you sign the contract . You must have a three-month internship . 

When you become a permanent employee , you will have the insurances . You will get monthly pay and will be on eight-hour / day work shift . 

Wait , will I have five insurances and one fund ? 

Yes . You can also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus . 

If you need to work overtime , you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay .

I am glad to see you too.  I know what is written in the contract , but it doesn't mean that I understand everything about it . I have some questions : Can I work for an overtime or not? I will like to get my holiday pay , so how can i do this ? Can I take a leave of absence? And lastly, will I have to pay taxes if I become a permanent employee ?

What is your favorite meal at dinner time? 

I like seafood , especially shrimps. 

Do you often eat fast foods? 

I think so, because I work overtime sometimes and have no chance to cook . 

Do you smoke ? 

No , I don't . I quit smoking five years ago. 

Do you drink alcohol? 

Yes, once a week or twice a month at most . 

Do you watch TV on the Internet? 

Not yet. I still don't know how to use it well.
