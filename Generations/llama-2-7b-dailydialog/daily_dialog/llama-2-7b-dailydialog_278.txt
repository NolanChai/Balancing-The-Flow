" are you sure you won't get into trouble ? "

" it will be fine . They know us there because of the large group reservation last weekend."

we really were lucky. We got the last available table for two and we didn't even have a reservation. Did you see the long lines behind us? yeah, I’m glad that we didn’t have to wait long. I'm starving! let's take a look at the menu so we can order. Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share? what would you rather have samosas or poppadoms? I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa. well, let’s get a plate of those then. What are you going to have for your main course?

" It is made with peas and lentils . There is also some curry powder , turmeric and other spices . "

" okay , sounds great ! I think I will have the chicken tikka masala . "

" that sounds really good too . Let's start with a glass of wine from India. Would you like to try a sweet dessert for us both ?  "

I think I might have a dhal. It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice. Do you want to share some kebabs as well? Ok, how about some lamb kebabs? That sounds nice. What do you want to drink? I think I will have a beer. Is there anything else we should order?

" thanks ! But I think the whole idea of ordering is to ask for what you want . We don't have to wait until she comes around . "

" i can see that now . You're right again . Let's order while we still can before all of the dishes get finished ! "
