" That's because I'm in love with someone else now . "

" Is that so ? "

" Yes , she loves me and wants to marry me . "

" So you can be happy at last ? "

" Yeah , but my life is different now . "

Help me rewrite the dialogue to make it less awkward and more polite. 

" Why didn't you tell me about your girlfriend ? "

" Sorry , I thought you knew . "

" But you should have told me you were in love with her . "

" Didn ' t I ? "

" You know you didn ' t . "

" Well , now that we're through with this , I am telling you that I'm madly in love with you and I hope to marry you someday . "

I'm sorry. But I thought you already knew I had a girlfriend.

Yes, but I wasn’t sure how you felt about her until now. 

Oh ! What kind of jerk don’t tell his best friend he has a girlfriend ? 

Sorry man , I just didn’t think it would be that big of deal to you.

You could have told me . 

Well, you never asked me how my love life was doing , so I thought you wouldn’t care much anyway. 

Yes ! But I still don't know why you haven’t called her yet . You’ve been going out with her for two months now. 

I am planning on calling her, but I want to make sure we’re exclusive first before making any calls. 

Well , do that as soon as possible ! 

Okay , then I will call her next week . Bye !
