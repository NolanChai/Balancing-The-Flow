" Yeah , maybe she can make that change for me . Thank you for helping me out with this . I feel a lot better just talking about it . "

"Thanks , that will help a lot . I'm so glad you're here with me !"

" Oh , nothing . It's just an old scratch from when my brother was a puppy . "

" You know , you'd never get away with saying something like that to a customer . They would think it strange and it might give them the wrong idea about you and your business . "

"You don't look too well . Maybe you should take the day off from work . "

"I couldn't do that . I have an important meeting to go to today."

"Do you feel ok ?"

"Not really . After a 12 - hour flight , I've got jetlag, and on top of that , I think I've also got the flu."

"Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . "

"Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever ? "

"You're really hot . Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down."

"Ok . I'll stay home this morning and rest , but if I feel better in the afternoon , I'm going to the meeting ."

"Zach , what's that on your arm ? "

"I don't know . It looks a bit red , but I'm sure it's nothing."

"It looks like you have a red rash all over you ! Are you allergic to anything ? "

" I don't know what you are talking about . You look like a ghost ! "

" Do I ? Well , let me fix my makeup and get dressed again . I guess that means we have to start all over again . "

" Hey ! Look who just arrived . It looks like he's coming our way . Let him pass first . "

" Thanks for holding the door open . He really must be in a rush . "

" Good afternoon , ladies . Sorry I'm late . There was an accident on the freeway . "

" No problem at all ! We can always start over again . "

" Are you ready ? We should do this as quickly as possible and then go to my office so we can get down to business . "

" Yes , I'm fine . I just hope the coffee hasn't gone cold by now . "

" It looks like it has gone cold . Here ! Let me fix that for you . You don't want any sugar ? "

" No thanks , but can you put a little milk in it for me ? "

" Ok , let's begin with the questions we prepared earlier today . I think we have three more interviews to do before lunch . "

" That will take us a while . I hope we can finish by 2 p.m . Do you mind if we take a break for an hour ? "

" Of course ! Take all the time you need , and don't forget to eat something too . "

" Thank you , that's very nice of you . Oh , look . It's almost lunchtime already . I hope they have some good food in here today . "

"Just cats , but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks ."

"I completely forgot about your cat allergy . I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . Oh no . we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . Let's go."

"Shouldn't we make an appointment first ? "

"We would , but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse . "
