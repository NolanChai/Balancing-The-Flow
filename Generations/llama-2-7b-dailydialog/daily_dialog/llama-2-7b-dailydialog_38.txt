"What do we put inside ? How does this work ? "

" First of all , it needs to have a little air space . You need to use a mesh bag so you don't get wrinkles . After that you can just throw in your clothes and they will automatically dry ! It's like magic ! "

"How long does a drying cycle take ? "

"It depends on how big your clothes are , and what temperature you set the machine at . 

"Choose a hot heat to remove wrinkles . "

"When it's finished , open up the door and get your clothing out . "

I can help you use the washer and dryer. 

Tell me what the problem is. 

You need a quarter for each appliance. 

Do you have some quarters? 

I didn't know I needed change. 

The washer costs $1, and the dryer costs $2 . Where do I put the change? 

The quarters go into the slots; you have to push the slot in, then the machine will turn on. That's all there is. 

I appreciate your help with this.
