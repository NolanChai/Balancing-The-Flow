" Well , how many are left ? "

" I think it's three in each of the three categories : soap, shampoo, and towel." 

" And do you have a key for your amenities bag ? " 

" I guess not . Sorry . I haven't had that many visitors yet , so I haven't gotten around to getting a key . "

### Response:

" Well , in that case , we're out of luck . The amenities room is locked at this time . 
If you need any other items like these , come see me after the lockout has been lifted and I can show you how to get into the amenities area with your key . "

" Well , first off , you need to know that we do not have any gifts for sale in our shop . " 

" But I thought there was a gift shop ! "

" Sorry , sir. You must be thinking of the gift shop at your hotel . "

" So what do you sell here ? "

" We mainly just sell toiletry items like shampoo and soap . "

" Really ?  But I don't use those things ! "

" Sir , do you remember that we gave you a sheet of towel cards last week ? "

" Well , yeah ! Of course I remember . They were really nice too ! " 

" That was a free gift from us . So you didn't have to pay anything for it . "

" Let me see if I can help you with your problem . 

" First of all , I would like to tell you that the amenities are not free . They are included in the price. You paid for them when you bought your room and amenities package . "

" What about soap ? I don't understand why we have to pay for it ! 

" The soap is also an amenity , so it should be covered by the amenities package . However , you will find that many hotels have a policy of replenishing supplies on demand . This means that there will always be more soap in your bathroom when you need it and some will be left over for guests who may need extra. 

" Now let's talk about the souvenirs . You can get them from the hotel gift shop or lobby . The shop should have a variety of items that are unique to this area or region , such as magnets , T-shirts , postcards , etc .

" I'm sorry , sir . We don't provide free souvenirs with your stay . "

" Well , can we negotiate ? "

" Negotiate what exactly ? "

" How about a discount for my next stay here ? "

" Sir ! We give you the best possible rate available at the time of booking . I'm not sure that it would be fair to adjust the price afterward , sir . "

" That doesn't sound right . My friends told me about your great deals and free amenities ! What gives ? "

" I'm sorry for any confusion, sir . We do offer amenities in our rooms. They are standard with every stay here at the hotel . I wish that we could help you more . But we'll be sure to pass along this complaint to the proper parties .
