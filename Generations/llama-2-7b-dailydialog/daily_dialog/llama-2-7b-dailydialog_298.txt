Help me rewrite this paragraph with no explanation or format changes. 

I'm going to write down a short story about my last birthday on the beach at home, which was probably one of the most exciting birthdays I've had in recent years because I turned sixteen and I received an iPhone from my parents as a gift. They took me to the park for a picnic where we had some yummy pizza, cheese cake, and fruit juice, but all that food was soon forgotten when my mom gave me an envelope which she had been saving for months. 

She told me to open it in private since there were several other people at the park. I was very excited because I knew there must be something special in it . I took out a brand-new iPhone and almost cried tears of joy . My parents gave me the phone with my own name engraved on it which made me feel so special that day. 

I loved the new iPhone immediately , but then we started to leave and went straight back home. As soon as we got there, I could hear a very loud noise coming from the living room . It was the sound of all my friends singing "Happy Birthday" to me . That's how my 16th birthday came to an end. I had spent it with my parents and several good friends at home. I couldn't have asked for more.
