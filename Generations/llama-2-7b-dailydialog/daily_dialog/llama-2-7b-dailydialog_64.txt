The clothes were delivered to a laundry shop this morning. I hope they will be ready by tonight. I want them back as soon as possible so that I can wear them again tomorrow. I also want my suit dry cleaned and it should be ready in about two weeks. The form for the collection is filled out already but if you could check it over, that would help me make sure nothing has been forgotten.
