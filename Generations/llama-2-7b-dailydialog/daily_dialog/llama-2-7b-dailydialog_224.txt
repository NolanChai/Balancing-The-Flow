That sounds good . I'd like to do it if you can explain how it works a bit more in detail. 

" It's easy to set up and use . The first month when the Direct Debit Service begins your bills will be paid directly out of your account , but they will also show on your statement as a payment from you . Then every month after that we'll simply take money for all those payments straight from your bank or building society account. If there is ever any change to what has been agreed - such as an increase in the rate you are charged - then we'll contact you with the new amount and get your authorisation before making further deductions . "

" Wow ! That sounds like a really good idea . But what happens if I ever move house ? "

" If you moved house then you could take it into consideration and change it to your new address . We can help you set it up on the phone , just call us at this number ( 6512345 ) anytime from 9am until 7pm Monday through Saturday . "

" Thanks . That's great ! I think I'll go for it . Good-bye and have a nice day. Bye. "
