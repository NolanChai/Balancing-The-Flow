Dear Ms. Li , 

I want to ask about what we talked yesterday about opening an account in a Chinese bank. The Type B Account is restricted ? Could you please explain that to me ? And if so , why ? I've heard people say it has something to do with currency control . Is there anything else besides currency control ? 

Also , can you tell me a little more about how the interest is calculated on my account and paid ? For example : when is the interest calculated and who pays it ? How long does it take for the money in an account to be available after opening a new account ? 

What do you think of the Type A Account ? I heard that if there's something wrong with your Settlement Account , they would have to check what happened . Does this happen often ? What would happen if someone went overdrawn without knowing it ? And what about interest on the deposit ? Is that calculated in a similar way as my Settlement Account ? 

Finally , is there any other advice you can give me ? I'm very confused by all of these details . Is there anything else I should know before opening an account here in China ? 

Best Regards , 

Peter Xie
