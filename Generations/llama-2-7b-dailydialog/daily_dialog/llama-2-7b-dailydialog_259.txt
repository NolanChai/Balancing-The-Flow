I can write a good answer , but need some help with the correct structure and vocabulary.

" I did too , but I fell asleep half way through it . "

" yes , they are much better than Madrid this year , but it didn't show in the game . "

" Madrid scored two goals within five minutes of each other and Barcelona was unable to come back . "

" that is very surprising . "

" well , you know what they say : don't count your chickens before they hatch . "

" what do you mean by that ? "

" the saying means that we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves and think we have things locked in for us just because we are leading or winning a game . It doesn't mean anything until all the games have been played and everything has been decided at the end of the season , right ? "

" yeah , but Barcelona is still in first place and Madrid is second , so there is not much to worry about . "

I stayed at home and watched TV. I just did nothing. What about you? Did you watch any of last night's game? Was it exciting? You don't get games like this very often! Barcelona was the better team, but Madrid is a tough opponent to play against. It was an even match with both teams scoring three goals. How could they play that well with their goal keeper hurt? I think it just shows how much heart he has to keep playing. No one would have played if he was injured! When are the playoffs for these guys? It's going to be a tough game, but I don't think either team will win.

" I'll probably come by around five thirty to get you and take you back afterward if you want . "

" great ! I'm looking forward to it ! I have some snacks on hand , so we should be good for the whole game . See ya tomorrow ! "
