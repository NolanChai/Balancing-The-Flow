Hey , look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look . 
Sure. It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . 
Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . 
Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . 
You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ?

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" I have an idea ! Why don't you come to our skiing club tomorrow and join us for some ski practice on our way back ? "

" Are you kidding ? This is my first time . I would really like to try it but I am not sure how good a skier I can be in one day ! "

" It's alright if you are afraid of falling down . We will be very gentle with beginners and won't let them get hurt . Don't worry , just join us for the fun . "

" All right then . I am in . The snow is so beautiful that I should go skiing here as much as possible . "

Sure . The snowmaking process can't be 100% environmentally friendly . And what's more , the snow is so white and soft here . But when it melts , it will leave a dark color on your clothes . Do you know why ? "

" That ' s right ! You said it was artificial snow . So if you take a bath in this kind of water , your skin would have a dark stain . "

" Yes . And there's another thing that I feel uncomfortable . The more skiing clubs there are , the more pollution there will be . In winter , some people want to go out for a walk but it is hard because of so much smog . "
