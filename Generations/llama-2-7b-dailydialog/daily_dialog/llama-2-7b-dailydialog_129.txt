"Hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?'' 

"Sure! What do you feel like having?'' 

"I really feel like having a big juicy steak!" 

"Oh, OK. I don't eat meat, but that's fine; I am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right?" 

"I didn't know you were a vegetarian!"

"A vegan . Look it up on the internet , and maybe you will understand how hard it is for someone to be a vegetarian who eats dairy and eggs ! I have never felt better in my life and all my foods are healthy and clean , no processed crap like you eat ! "

Thanks ! Yes it is a bit difficult. I try to buy foods with little or no processing, so I don't eat many packaged products and such. There are also some ingredients that aren't animal based , but they are processed using things like bone char which I don't want to eat . For example , if a fruit is candied it uses the egg whites as a binding agent , so those would not be vegan . I did have eggs in my life , but after finding out how bad they are for you and that you can get all your protein needs with plants I stopped eating them . "
