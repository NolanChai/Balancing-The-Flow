" Yeah . They were easy . One was how he changed history forever . "

" I agree , but that is not what they asked . They wanted you to go into more detail about how it impacted the country . "

Did you already take the history exam ? 

Yeah.  It was hard . When do you take it ? 

I take it tomorrow morning. There is so much material that I don't know what to emphasize on . What types of questions did you get ? 

Mostly on the civil war. You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr. had on American society . 

What about Abraham Lincoln ? Did you get any questions about him ? 

I only had one question about him. But you might get more. I don't know if he will have the same exam or not. 

Hopefully, he will use the same exam, cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war. It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class .
