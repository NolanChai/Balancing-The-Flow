Thanks for offering me an audition ! I would love to sing in your band ! 

" How about it ? Will you join us ? We can use someone who knows how to sing and play the drums at the same time . "

I think I ’ m up for that challenge ! Of course , we ’ ll need a name for our band ... What do you have in mind ? 

" Uh ... Well , it will be hard to find anything better than The Four Seasons . We ’ re three guys and one girl . "

Great idea ! It ’ s perfect ! And if you know how to sing , then you can be the lead singer as well . You should have no problem with the drums because you already know them .

You would like to form a rock band and need more people for your band. 
We have found one person who plays guitar, bass, and sings. 
You are still looking for other members. 
We will try out your new singer on Saturday at my house . "
