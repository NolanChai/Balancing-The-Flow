Oh my god , look how big I am! I was a baby! I must have been a puppy when you put me here!. 
 
 '' Yes yes , and do you see that flower bed over there? That's where we planted your seeds!'' 
 
 `` Wow ! You're really getting old now aren't you ? What about all those other people in our family too?, are they here as well ?'. 
 
 '' Yes , I buried all of us. 
 
 '' But how do we know what to look for, there must be more than one flower bed over there !?' 
 
 '' Nope, just one . The other is where the neighbours buried their dog. 
 
 '' That's why when you walk through our house , it feels like home doesn't it ? 
 
 `` Oh god yes, and I remember all those times we had together too. I must have been about five or six years old then . You would carry me on your back up to the roof every day for hours , we played games in the yard all afternoon, ran around our home playing hide and seek and we went out for walks, but when the summer was over it got cold and you couldn't play anymore. 
 
 '' Well that's what happens when winter comes , we have to stay inside . It makes me sad when I see a tree or flower bed all alone in our front yard though. They don't belong here, they look out of place .''.  
 
 '' Yeah , but at least we're together now ! Now go put on some clothes and get outside with me - it is summer after all!'. 
 
 '' Alright , alright I will. But first tell me again why you decided to bury us in our back garden ?''
