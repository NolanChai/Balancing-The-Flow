What is your question?
`` I tell him that his name and my name are exactly the same.
```
How can this be possible? What are you doing here?
`` My mind spins as I try to figure out what's going on, but when I finally get it together enough to form a sentence, he asks me again.
```
How do you know my name? Are we related?
`` This is too much! How could I have a twin brother who has the exact same name as me and grew up just over an hour away? What are the odds of that happening?
```
I don't know how to answer this question, but if I had known you were my brother, I never would have killed you. That was a terrible mistake on my part. It won't happen again.
`` And with that I start crying uncontrollably. I feel like the worst person in the world. I don't deserve to be alive if I'm going to act like this and hurt someone so close to me. My brother's name is also mine, and he was killed because of my mistakes.
```
How did you know that? Is it some kind of coincidence that we have the same name? Maybe this isn't really about us being brothers; maybe I just chose your name at random when I created your character in the game! The idea is ludicrous, but what other explanation could there be for why a guy who looks like me would have a twin brother with an identical name and appearance?
```
I don't understand how you could know my name. It must be some kind of coincidence; maybe I just chose your name at random when creating your character in the game! The idea is ludicrous, but what other explanation could there be for why a guy who looks like me would have a twin brother with an identical name and appearance?
```
I'm sorry. I don't know how to answer this question, but if I had known you were my brother, I never would have killed you. That was a terrible mistake on my part. It won't happen again.
