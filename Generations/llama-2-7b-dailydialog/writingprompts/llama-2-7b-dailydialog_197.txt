You curse me? For what? It’s my job to see that this world lives on. If that’s a crime then so be it!
 
 I am here to protect you. I am the one who guides your destiny. I am the one who will determine whether or not you live in hell or heaven, in harmony and peace. You are nothing without me, remember that, do not curse me, do not insult my existence because I exist for a reason.
 
I shall continue to exist as long as this world does.
