`` Well, you 'll just have to wait until they show themselves again.'' I said firmly. 
 
 `` We should leave soon anyways; we need to get some sleep before the long ride back home tomorrow.'' 
 
 ```` `Yeah,' I agreed, knowing full well that Claire was eager to get back for the chance at a new bed and warmth. 
```` 
 
 `` Alright then let's get going; we don 't want to waste too much time here!'' I said, leading her out of the cave. 
 
 ```` `Wait,' Claire cried after us. 
```` 
 
 `` What?'' I asked turning around and looking at her, confused. 
 
 ```` `I-I forgot to put up some food for them! How rude is that?' she said as we walked back toward the cave opening. 
```` 
 
 ```` `Well I guess it 'll just have to be there for when they return,'' I said in a defeated voice. 
```` 
 
 ```` `I could go back and do it now! It shouldn't take too long,' she pleaded. 
```` 
 
 ```` `Okay fine, but we 're going to have to be quick; we don't want to stay in one place for too long or they might not return again.'' I said, walking back into the cave with Claire following behind me. 
```` 
 
 ```` `Okay,' she replied, a determined gleam in her eyes. 
```` 
 
 She put down the bag and opened it up to get out some bread, cheese, apples, and carrots; all of which were quickly stuffed into her pockets. I could already tell by her pace that she was eager to return home, but knew it would be foolish to leave now without doing this small task. She was right though; we did not want to linger for too long in one spot or they might never come back again and our only chance to find out more about these mysterious creatures would have been lost forever. 
 
 ```` `Okay let's go,' I said, heading for the cave opening once she was finished placing everything into her pockets. Claire ran past me eagerly and we started walking back down the road together without another word spoken between us on our way back out of the forest. We had never been so happy to leave a place in all our lives!
