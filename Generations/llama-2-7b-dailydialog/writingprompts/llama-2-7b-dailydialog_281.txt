**Michael**  
 
 And you were always very beautiful and I always felt like an ugly little shrimp around you. 
 
 I couldn't help but fall in love with you and it was something that I don't think you understood because you were fourteen years old too, Ariel. 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 Yeah I know, Mike. And what are you saying? 
 
 Oh come on. We're just talking about the past here and how we met each other and how our parents were friends and how it all started out and stuff. It's not like anything is going to happen between us now that I think of it. I mean, what are you talking about? I am already married. 
 
 Yeah but you could just sleep with me one time and then go back home to your wife and son, okay? And that would be the end of it. It's not like we'd have anything else between us or anything. 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 I don't know about this, Mike. You're an old friend and a good friend but I can't just go home and sleep with you. 
 
 Are you afraid? Or are you saying that to me so I don't get the wrong idea here and think you want something more than what we could give each other? 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 No, no. Nothing like that Mike. Really, really, it isn't like that at all. It's just that you know how I feel about my marriage with Bill now and I can't just go home and do something with you in order to prove a point or anything. You're my friend Mike but not my lover and this is the way things have been for me since we were kids. 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 Okay, okay. Well then I guess there isn't any use talking about it now that you see where I was going with all of this anyway. 
 
 I mean, what do you think I came here to do in the first place? Just sit down and watch a movie like old friends do every night? Come on Ariel. Don't play dumb with me because you know exactly why I came over tonight. You knew it when I called you up and asked if we could meet for some drinks but now that you think about it, maybe you didn't really want to see me after all and that's the reason why you were trying so hard to get out of it in the first place. 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 Oh come on Mike. Don't be ridiculous. You know I've always loved being your friend but if I wanted sex, I would have gone and looked for a boyfriend somewhere else and not you. So just forget it already. We don't need to talk about all this anymore. 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 Just tell me why you are so scared of me then? Why is your husband Bill and son Michael such a big concern to you now? He isn't even here right now. Why should that matter anyway? You can do anything that you want with anybody tonight since he isn't around. It's just the two of us, honey. 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 No. That is where you are wrong Mike because if I wanted to sleep with you, we would be doing it right now and then we could go home separately to our own beds afterward but you see how this is different for me? I'm married you know and you shouldn't talk about it like that anyway. 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 Okay fine. If you don't want to be with me, that's fine but at least let me say one thing to you before we part ways tonight. I can still tell that you are very beautiful and I think you look better than ever right now so why not give it a chance? You've always loved sex, haven't you? So why not take the opportunity when you have it with an old friend like me who would love nothing more than to do you in my room tonight. 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 Stop talking about sex with me Mike. It isn't nice and I don't want to hear any of that from you anyway. So just leave the matter alone already because if there is one thing that I have learned in all these years, it is that when a guy starts to talk like that around me, he wants something else but I am not about to give him anything right now so stop talking about sex or whatever else and go home already. 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 Are you sure? You know how old your son is now, don't you? He has been seven years old for over a year now honey and it makes me wonder just how much you actually miss him in your life. I mean, he doesn't even live with you anymore anyway so if that isn't the perfect opportunity to take advantage of it, then when is it going to be? 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 Mike stop being ridiculous and don't start talking about my son again. It makes no sense at all and I am not going to listen to you anymore either so why don't you just get out of here already because if this is the way it has to end, then you might as well leave now instead of staying around here until morning comes. 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 But Ariel, I promise you that nobody else would be more concerned with your son's welfare than me and even if he didn't live with you right now, don't you think it might not be too bad for him to spend some time away from home sometimes? Especially since his mom is beautiful like yourself and he may just want to stay over at my place tonight so that he could play video games or whatever else it is that kids do these days anyway. 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 Oh stop being ridiculous, Mike! My son isn't some little brat who likes to watch cartoons on TV all day long either. He has been in school for four years now and he knows his way around the house by himself too so I don't need you to babysit him anymore. 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 Really? That's great because you know what would really make it a good night tonight for us? If we could find some other things that are more interesting than just drinking and watching movies together. What do you say then? Are you still not interested in having sex with me or would you like to give it one last shot before I leave here tonight? 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 Don't be ridiculous, Mike. You know that isn't going to happen and even if we were already married and you had a son too, I still wouldn't have anything else between us but friendship because I just don't like the way you talk about those things with me. That is not something that is very appealing at all for me so please leave now before it gets any worse than this conversation has already been. 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 Okay fine, okay, okay, I get it already! You don't want to do anything with me then. It's not like I haven't tried either but if that is the way you feel about our friendship, then I guess we can just say goodbye now instead of having some sort of argument in your house or something and ruining everything between us once more. 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 Mike stop this already! You are being ridiculous and don't start talking to me like that ever again because I won't stand for it anymore so just leave now before my husband gets home from work tonight or something. Please, go away right now. 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 Okay fine but remember Ariel... You might want to reconsider this later on down the road sometime because I am sure that you could still be in love with me even if you think otherwise right now. It's not like I can't just come back here again at any time and remind you of how much fun we had together as kids once before anyway so maybe it would be better for both of us to have some sort of relationship like that than nothing else at all, okay? 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 You're a liar Mike. You just want me because you think I am beautiful or something and I don't need anybody like that in my life anymore either so please leave now before everything gets any worse between us than it already has been anyway! 
 
 **Michael**  
 
 Okay fine then, goodbye Ariel. I hope things turn out better for you someday too but if they don't work out with your husband Bill in the future, remember that we can always be friends again somehow later on down the road even though it isn't likely to happen now since I am sure that there is no chance at all for anything else between us tonight. 
 
 **Ariel**  
 
 Mike stop saying those things! Just go away now or something because if my husband finds out about this conversation, he might kill you so
