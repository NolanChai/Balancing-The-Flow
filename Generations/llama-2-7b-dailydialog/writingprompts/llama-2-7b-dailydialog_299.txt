I still remember the way your face would look as you held those in your hand, like a priestess holding her rosary beads for comfort. Those days are gone now. The tungsten baoding balls sit by my computer monitor at work. I don't have the time to use them anymore, and they serve no purpose but to remind me of who I was back then.
