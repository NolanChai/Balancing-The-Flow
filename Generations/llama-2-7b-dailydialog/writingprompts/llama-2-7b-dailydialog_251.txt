They all have their hearts and souls in pieces; no longer is there any peace or harmony among them, just bloodlust and violence. The dying and death are heard as the air is filled with moans of pain, cries for loved ones, whimpers and sobs from the fallen. There is no joy or love on the battlefield; only war and chaos reign.
