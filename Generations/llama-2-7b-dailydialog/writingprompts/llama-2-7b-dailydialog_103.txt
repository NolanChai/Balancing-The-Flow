I don ' t get it . How does that help ? It doesn ’ t really matter what you look like inside or out . And eating more fruit and veggies won ’ t change her feelings for you anyways . If she wants to be with you , she will. She should love you regardless of your weight , height , or shape ! I know it’s not easy , but just try to let go of the idea that your appearance is going to affect how well you get along with each other . If you ’ re not attracted to her anymore , maybe you need to start thinking about breaking up . You deserve someone who appreciates who you are as a person.
