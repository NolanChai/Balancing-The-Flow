<p>Sonny was awake already when I came back into his room at the hospital.</p>
  
  <p>Propaganda posters covered the wall above a single bed in one corner of the room, illuminated by the warm morning light shining through a large trapezoid window. On the bed lay a crumpled black t-shirt. I walked over and smoothed it out gently. The material was damp with his perspiration.</p>
  
  <p>The room was sterile, devoid of any other personal possessions or clothing that might have helped me recognize my son in this new, unfamiliar environment.</p>
  
  <p>My throat constricted as I realized he wouldn’t be wearing his favorite t-shirt for a while. I knew that I would feel naked without it soon enough too.</p>
  
  <p>Sonny had always been my little boy, with the exception of those few years when his hormones turned him into someone else. But he was still my son and that remained clear to me in this moment of sadness.</p>
  
  <p>A young man with a bad haircut and a shabby blue blazer leaned against the doorframe, staring at us. He wasn’t paying much attention to me though; his eyes were on my son, sizing him up from head to toe.</p>
  
  <p>“Hi,” I said in a pleasant voice as I approached the young man.</p>
  
  <p>He looked at me with mild surprise. “I’m his father,” I explained. “I wanted to talk to him.”</p>
  
  <p>He nodded, and stepped back to let me pass through the doorway into the room.</p>
  
  <p>Sonny was sitting on the bed now, wearing a hospital gown that had been provided. The material was too short in front for my taste; it hung around his knees like an oversized apron. He wore white socks and slippers.</p>
  
  <p>I took off my coat and put it down on the empty chair next to him, then pulled up a small stool and sat down beside the bed. He was fidgeting with his hands in front of him, like he always did when he was nervous or uncomfortable.</p>
  
  <p>“You okay?” I asked.</p>
  
  <p>Sonny nodded but didn’t speak. The silence lasted for a long time as we stared at each other, trying to communicate without words.</p>
  
  <p>Finally he said, “They say they are keeping me here for observation and testing.”</p>
  
  <p>“I see,” I replied. “Well then you need to rest and recover, so we’ll have a chance to talk about things when you feel better.</p>
  
  <p>Sonny nodded again without speaking more as he stared at the floor in front of him.</p>
  
  <p>“Do you want me to leave?” I asked.</p>
  
  <p>He looked up then, his eyes wide with surprise. “No!”</p>
  
  <p>I felt a lump form in my throat and reached over to take hold of Sonny’s hand.</p>
  
  <p>“Don’t worry about anything,” I said. “Just rest.”</p>
  
  <p>He nodded again and I squeezed his hand gently before releasing it, then stood up to leave the room.</p>
  
  <p>I could see that Sonny was already drifting off into sleep as I reached for my coat hanging on a hook on the wall beside me.</p>
  
  <p>“Goodbye,” I said, and then headed out of the doorway towards the nurses station at the end of the hall.</p>
