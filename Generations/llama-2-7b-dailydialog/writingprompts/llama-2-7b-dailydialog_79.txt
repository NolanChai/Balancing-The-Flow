I had no answer for this question, but I would have liked to take the time to ponder it, and I know that this is a big part of procrastination. If you were to get up right now and write down what you needed to accomplish today, wouldn't it be more difficult if your motivation was lacking? It would certainly take me much longer to finish my tasks! I wasted too many hours during the day dreaming and stalling instead of using that time productively.
