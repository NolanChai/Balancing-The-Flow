That’s a nice thought, but I don’t think that will help me to get over my bad habits. 
 
 
 
I used to go out drinking every weekend with friends, until one day it hit me. It was time for a change in my life. My mom gave me this book on meditation and I started practicing it regularly. 
 
 
 
Whenever I felt the urge to have a cigarette after dinner or to drink too much during a party, I would remember what I read in that book and think about all the benefits of living without smoking or drinking. 
 
 
 
Nowadays, my life is completely different from before, as are many other things. I started doing yoga regularly; it really helps me to stay healthy and fit. And the best thing of all, I quit smoking and stopped drinking. 
 
 
 
I feel like a new man!
