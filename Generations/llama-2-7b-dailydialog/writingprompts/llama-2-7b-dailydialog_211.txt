But he was almost home. After eight months of travel, Christopher was finally within range of his destination's signal. It only took about twelve hours to get from the outer rim to a place called Earth. He looked forward to settling down in his new home and starting a family. But he knew that there would be plenty of work to do before then. Christopher's job as an explorer was to scout out areas of space for colonization. There were many planets and asteroids that needed to be surveyed for resources, animals, and plant life. If any of these could sustain human life, then Christopher would begin building a settlement there. The job would probably take years before it was complete; however, he was excited to get started on his next project after spending so much time in the cold black void. It had been almost half a year since Earth's colonization efforts began, and they were just now starting to develop enough technology to make space travel possible again. Christopher wanted to do everything in his power to help further mankind's progress into the future by becoming part of its early stages instead of waiting around until someone else did what he could have accomplished first!

*Homo magellanus.* This is a human subspecies that is capable of surviving in temperatures as low as -130° C. They can also live off of just about anything, including seaweed and other plant matter found near ice floes or on mountainsides. *Homo sapiens* are more sensitive to extreme cold and cannot be exposed to temperatures below 32 °C for an extended period of time without serious injury or death occurring within hours.*Their adaptability allows them to survive in areas that would otherwise be too dangerous or difficult for other people.
