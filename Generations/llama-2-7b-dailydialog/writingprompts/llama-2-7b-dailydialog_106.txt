We were once a great species that walked the many plains of North America. Sure we had natural enemies; wolves and other large predators, and even the occasional native. Although it was always distressing to see one of our own die from an attack by another animal, it is part of nature. To survive as a species you must learn to adapt or perish. If that meant sacrificing some of your own for the greater good, then so be it.
