`` So you said on the phone that we need to see if there is anything else to do to help your stomach pains, right?'' 
 
 `` Yeah, but before we start *exercises* , I have a few questions about your history. You're sure this didn't happen when you were pregnant?'' 
 
 I shook my head. `` No, doctor, I was never pregnant. But I did have problems with my periods before the pains started.'' 
 
 He nodded, taking notes. `` Were your period heavy or light?'' 
 
 `` They were pretty heavy, but not too bad.'' 
 
 `` And what about *fatigue* , did you feel tired all the time?'' 
 
`` Yes, I was really tired before the pains began.'' 
 
 He looked up from his notes. `` You have a family history of cancer, is that right?'' 
 
 `` My father had a tumor on his *throat* .'' 
 
 The doctor nodded again and continued writing in his notepad. Then he said, `` So when the pains began you weren't concerned about *blood* loss, right?'' 
 
`` No , I was afraid of it but my periods were never very heavy. I had a period every thirty days or so. '' 
 
 He nodded again, and looked back at his notes. `` What about your eating habits? Are you a big eater?'' 
 
I shrugged my shoulders. `` I like to eat.'' 
 
`` Do you eat a lot of meat or is it mainly vegetables? '' 
 
`` I like all kinds of food , doctor but I don't usually go overboard on anything . I try not to gain weight, so I cut back if I need to.'' 
 
 He smiled and looked up again. `` That sounds healthy to me!'' he said with a laugh. 
 
`` Okay, '' the doctor began writing on his clip board, `` We're almost done here. Just a few more questions before we begin exercises . Do you have any *fever* , or night sweats?'' 
 
 I shook my head again and said, `` No fever and I don't sweat at night . '' 
 
`` Good. And are your breasts tender to the touch? '' 
 
`` Yes they are. It hurts sometimes , especially when I *sleep* or sit for too long .'' 
 
He nodded again and said, `` I think we're ready to start exercises now if that's okay with you ?'' 
 
I smiled back. `` Sure! Just show me what to do.'' 
 
`` Good ! Now stand up slowly and stretch your arms out in front of you. Inhale deeply, then bring both your hands to the small of your back. Press your right hand into the middle of the small of your back and pull in a little. You can feel it there , can't you?'' 
 
`` Yes , I do! It feels like a *knot* on my back . '' 
 
 `` Okay, now breathe out and let both hands go to the floor. Now stand up slowly again with your arms still extended in front of you . Inhale deeply through your nose while you turn your right hand over to the inside of your body so that your fingers are facing inwards towards you. Pull down on it as much as you can and then repeat this exercise with your left hand, pulling from the outside in .'' 
 
`` Okay doctor, I'm ready for the next one now! '' 
 
He smiled and said `` Great! Now stand with your feet together, hands still at your sides. Exhale through your nose as you lean forward until you feel a stretch in your abdomen . Breathe deeply again to relax , then hold your breath for ten seconds without moving before returning to your starting position . Repeat this exercise several times a day and remember to breathe normally between repetitions.'' 
 
`` Got it, doctor! '' I said with a smile as we left the room . 
 
As soon as we stepped out of the examination room , he asked me if there was anything else that had happened in my life recently . When I told him about the pains, he nodded and said , `` Okay, Mrs. Jacobs, let's do some stretching exercises now to help ease your pain . '' 
 
I stood up slowly as he put a hand on each shoulder . He then guided me through several gentle stretches designed to relieve my *back* and *neck* problems , saying that this was the best way to deal with these types of pains . After about twenty minutes, I began to feel better and felt like we were done for the day. As he led me out of his office , he said `` Bye, Mrs. Jacobs, it was nice talking with you again ! '' 
 
`` Thank you , doctor ,'' I replied as I got up from my chair . We both smiled and left the room . Afterwards we had a long talk about my *health* and how to deal with my pains in the future . He recommended that I do some gentle stretching every day before bedtime if possible so that they don't bother me during the night , as well as drink plenty of water throughout the day . Overall , this experience was very helpful for my health problem .
