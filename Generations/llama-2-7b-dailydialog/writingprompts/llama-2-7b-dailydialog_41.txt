`` Hey, thanks a lot. Don't forget to put my name on it when you do the staples though! I am still getting used to this stapling business! '' Delia smiled nervously and hurried away to get the job done. As soon as she had gone, I picked up her empty coffee cup that was sitting on my desk and threw it into the garbage bin with all of the others. The only thing that distinguished her cup from the rest was that it was half-full with water! It wasn't like there were many people in the office at this time of day, so I really didn't think anyone would notice anything wrong. When Delia came back a little while later, she put the stapler down on my desk and smiled nervously again. She must have been expecting me to say something about her cup. `` Thanks a lot for the staples!'' I said without any hesitation.
`` Well, now that you mention it, there is one thing I've been wondering about, though... '' Delia suddenly started getting uneasy and didn't know what to do with herself. `` What was the cup for? It looks like water. Were you thirsty or something?'
`` No, no,'' she stammered. `` That wasn't for me! I just wanted to be prepared in case anyone came by my desk and needed a drink of water. So that was why I put it there. But thanks a lot for asking though ! '' Delia finally managed to blurt out. She quickly picked up the cup from off my desk and hurried away again, this time leaving me with a puzzled look on my face!
