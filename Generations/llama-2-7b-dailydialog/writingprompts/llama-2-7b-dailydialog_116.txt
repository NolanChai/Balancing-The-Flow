I agree with you- my favorite instrument is also the pipe organ. It is really a great instrument. I like its sound as well. Whenever I hear such a music, I am always amazed by how powerful the sound could be. The loudness and the resonance are so distinctive that it makes me feel excited whenever I hear them.
