So you draw all of these in a row, right? Like an endless pattern? 
 
 Yeah, exactly. That's my favorite thing to do with the pen. It takes up so much space that if you get too many lines going on at the
same time it starts to make sense and become meaningful.
 
 So what are these patterns for? Is there a specific order or significance to them?
 
 I don't think they mean anything...I just like making them look pretty, I guess. 
 
 Are you sure there isn't some kind of subconscious thought process going on while you make the circles and designs? 
 
 It doesn't really feel that way. I never plan it out or anything; I'm always in my own little world when I doodle. 
 
 Do you think something is wrong with me for being so obsessed with lines like this? Maybe I should see a therapist. 
 
 It sounds like maybe you are just bored and need an outlet to express yourself. And you're not crazy! Everyone does things when they're bored, it doesn't mean there is something wrong with you! 
 
 OK, thanks for talking me off the ledge there. I still feel kind of weird about this, but you made me realize that maybe I just need to find a better use for my time. 
 
 No problem! It sounds like we've both got some growing up to do. And speaking of...how old are you? You seem really mature for your age. 
 
 Thanks for the compliment, but I really feel more immature than ever. 
 
 OK, so what about you? How old are you? 
 
 Well, let's just say that if you're in high school already, then you must be really smart! 
 
 Ha! Smart? Me? Maybe...but I don't feel smart at all. You know how it is when you're a kid. Everyone thinks they know everything and nobody knows anything. 
 
 I understand! It seems like high school can be so hard sometimes, even for those of us who are supposedly mature. 
 
 So what do you want to do when you grow up? Become a teacher or something? 
 
 Ha ha, no way! Teachers aren't cool and they make too much money! I actually have a really creative job that I think will be perfect for me when I graduate. 
 
 What kind of job is that exactly? 
 
 I write articles and stories for different magazines and blogs all over the Internet. You know, things like traveling advice or tips on how to deal with an abusive relationship...stuff like that. 
 
 That sounds pretty cool! It must be really rewarding to make a living writing stuff you enjoy instead of just doing something for money. 
 
 Oh yeah! I get paid really well and it's so exciting seeing my articles in print! My life is a dream come true, if you ask me... 
 
 That sounds amazing! Do your parents have any idea what you do? They probably don't know anything about it because they must be pretty strict. 
 
 Yeah...I'm not really allowed to talk much about my job around them. I just tell them that I'm working at the library. 
 
 Why can't they find out what you do? Don't they trust you enough? 
 
 It's not that, really. They don't have any problem with me being a writer...it's more like my dad is worried I might be doing something illegal or dangerous for the money. He doesn't think I can handle it on my own. 
 
 I see! That sounds kind of funny considering all the work you put into your writing. How do they know what exactly you are working on if you don't tell them? 
 
 It's mostly stuff about relationships or sexual abuse, so it's not something I want my parents to read...or at least be able to find easily in case there was some kind of problem with one of the articles. 
 
 So what are you working on right now? Is it anything that might have a negative effect on your readers or is it just a good story about how to deal with abuse and stuff like that? 
 
 It's mostly stories about bad relationships, actually. I think my last article was called 'My Boyfriend Slept With My Best Friend: Should I Kill Myself?' And yeah, there were definitely some comments about it! A lot of people thought they could relate to the story and felt really bad for the writer, which is funny because she wasn't really that nice in my opinion. She kind of deserved what happened to her. But who am I? 
 
 What do you mean 'who are you?' You're a professional writer! 
 
 Haha! Yeah, right...I know how this sounds now. So anyway, the article was about some girl whose boyfriend cheated on her and then her best friend slept with him later that night, so she did what any sane person would do: she killed herself. She had an ex-boyfriend who had committed suicide before as well so it kind of ran in their family or something like that. 
 
 That's a little crazy! I mean, I can understand the writer feeling bad for her friend and whatnot, but killing yourself? Come on...that is just ridiculous! 
 
 Yeah, I know! But you have to admit that it would be really hard to handle something like that. What if someone cheats on you and then your best friend sleeps with them? That's not fair at all! It makes me so angry whenever people do those things...it makes me want to go out and kill myself, even though I know there is no reason for it really. 
 
 Hey man, don't take this the wrong way or anything but you seem pretty disturbed about this whole thing. Have you ever been through something like that? 
 
 Not exactly...I mean, not as extreme as killing yourself anyway. But I can understand where she was coming from when writing the article. Sometimes it seems like no one else in your life really cares about what happens to you and it's hard to keep going after all of these bad things happen without someone by your side supporting you. 
 
 That sounds sad...I mean, I feel bad for her that she felt so alone when everything went wrong but I just don't know how I would handle something like that. How are you able to write about it and not kill yourself? 
 
 Oh man, I wish I could say that I was some kind of superhuman who can withstand anything life throws at me without breaking down emotionally or physically but the truth is: I'm just a normal guy. Like anyone else out there, I have good days and bad days where my emotions are all over the place depending on what happens in my personal life as well as other peoples'. 
 
 So how does that relate to your writing job? Is it easy for you to put yourself into another person's situation when they're experiencing something tough like cheating or abuse? 
 
 I mean, some people might have a hard time with that sort of thing. But the truth is: we are all connected in one way or another even if it isn't always obvious at first glance. I think my job helps me get through my own problems because writing about them makes them seem more distant and less personal somehow. 
 
 Yeah, that sounds pretty cool! It must be interesting to be able to use your imagination when you write for a living instead of just thinking about what's going on with you personally all the time. I bet it helps keep everything balanced out too. 
 
 Totally! But there are definitely days where writing isn't enough and I have to get away from my computer screen or else I won't be able to handle it anymore, which is why sometimes we need some alone time with ourselves in order to deal with all of those emotions that come rushing back when they're bottled up for too long. 
 
 That sounds like an interesting perspective on things! Do you ever get writer's block or have any problems coming up with ideas for your articles? 
 
 Yeah, sometimes I do. It seems like my brain just doesn't want to come up with anything new or different lately so instead of forcing myself into thinking about something else all the time, which is what usually happens when you don't have any inspiration at hand, I just let it go and take some time off from writing altogether. 
 
 That sounds like a pretty good plan! What do you normally do to get yourself back in the creative mood? Do you listen to music or anything like that? 
 
 Yeah, sometimes listening to different kinds of music will help me find inspiration for my articles too because it allows me to think about things I wouldn't usually consider doing when I am feeling uninspired. Sometimes just hearing someone else's voice can make you realize what was missing from your own in order for them to be happy with themselves as well, so that's why we should all try listening more often!
