be the perfect way to spend an evening while my husband was out. I poured myself some wine and settled down with a good book to read before bedtime. I picked up the remote control, but there was nothing on. It was probably because it was still only 8pm and most people hadn't gone to bed yet. But then again, I had been lying in my warm bed for more than an hour already. My husband would be home soon, so I turned off the TV and went upstairs to have a bath. After taking a relaxing bath and having some fruit juice, I was ready to go to bed. The moon shone through the window as I gazed at the stars in the sky, but it was too warm for me to turn on my heater. So, I took off all my clothes, put them into the laundry basket and climbed back into bed. There were no more shows on TV, so I turned out the light and drifted off to sleep.
### Assessment:
I have a lot of work this week, and it seems that I never have time for myself any more. All my friends are out for dinner or having drinks at clubs, but I can't go because I always have something else to do. I feel like an old maid with nothing in common with the rest of society. On top of that, I am not even happy with what I do during my spare time. I go jogging every evening after work and then I watch TV when I get home. It is a good way to unwind, but it seems so boring compared to all the fun my friends are having. So, I decided to make some changes in my routine. The first thing on my list of things to do was getting back into reading again. Since I started working full-time, I have had little time for books. But now that I am retired, I can finally get back into it and read all day long if I want! Another activity that needs attention is cooking. When I got married 15 years ago we used to cook dinner every night together after work before going out with friends or watching movies at home . We also had picnics outside in summer but nowadays both of us have too many commitments which prevents us from having time for those kinds of things anymore so now it's mostly take out food during the week and cooking only on weekends when we can go out together again. Lastly, I want to start going out more often because I really miss being around people who share similar interests like me . It will also help me meet new friends which could lead to a whole new social circle !
