MARK: `` That's really cool! Let me guess, you didn't like it because you were not chosen for the show.''
MICHAEL: `` Yeah, that's kind of true. But I have this idea. You see, I want to open a bar. I just need someone else to fund my business and take care of all the financial stuff while I focus on running my business. Would you be interested in being my partner?''
MARK: `` You know what Michael? It sounds like an interesting offer, but no thanks. I would hate having to worry about all the money part of opening a bar. I'm sure you can find another partner who will want to do it with you!''
MICHAEL: `` Hey Mark, are we still on for tonight? ''
MARK: `` Sure Michael, what did you have in mind? ''
