I have just read the news that you are dying. You will soon be dead. 
 
 This is no longer something in your future; it has already come true for you. 
 
 I can say this to you, because I know it to be true. 
 
 And now, as we wait together, I cannot help but think of how much more alive I have become since knowing you are dying. 
 
 You were a stranger to me when we met. Now I feel as if we've known each other for years; as if we've always been friends and there's nothing that will change this now. 
 
 We will probably never meet again, but I want you to know that in your death, you have given my life meaning and value, and this gives me great hope. 
 
 The world is full of suffering and loss; it needs more people like you who are willing to live and die so generously. 
 
 In these final days before you leave us forever, I'd like to say what I know will be difficult for you to hear: "Thank you." 
 
 You are not the only one dying in our family; you have just arrived a bit earlier than me and the others. 
 
 My mother died at a very young age of a brain tumor, when she was only twenty-five. My father followed her ten years later, also from a tumor. I'm next in line to die, I know this because we are all part of one family. In my case, it is the family of mankind and that includes you too. 
 
 My mother had a dream before she died and told me about it when her dying was just days away. She said she saw a large building with an enormous bell in front of it that she knew to be a church. People were coming and going from the building, but most were leaving. They all seemed sad, but there were some who were happy, like you. 
 
 When she asked what made them so happy, they said that after passing through these doors, there was no more sickness or suffering; just peace. 
 
 She said she would be joining those people on the other side soon and that I shouldn't worry about her. 
 
 Before my father died, he told me that he had seen his wife waiting for him on the other side of death and that she looked so happy that he could not contain himself from running to embrace her. 
 
 He said that when they hugged, he knew this was where they were meant to be all along because there was no need to say anything; everything was just known by them both. 
 
 As I watch you die, I cannot help but think of my mother and father's dreams. You are one of the lucky ones who have passed through those doors and found peace beyond suffering. 
 
 As we wait together for your death to come, you have given me hope that what they saw was real and that this world is not all there is; there is something else and it's so wonderful that I can barely contain my excitement at the thought of knowing you are living there now with them. 
 
 When we die here on earth, it's like a dream to us because everything changes when our spirit leaves our body. We don't feel pain anymore or sickness or sorrow; nothing can affect us once we have passed through those doors. 
 
 You are so near to your death now that I hope you know what I am saying is true and that this will bring you comfort in these last days. I know how difficult it must be for you to hear me say these things, but please remember them when the time comes. 
 
 We have both been given a gift by each other's presence here on earth. You gave me hope that death is not something to fear and taught me about living generously with others in my life. I will always be grateful for this; it has changed who I am as a person forever. 
 
 But you have also been given something from us too, even though we didn't know it at the time. You have helped our family to see what is truly important and how fragile life can be if we don't value every moment of it; we are now all more aware of this. This too will make us better people for knowing you and we will never forget what has been learned from your presence here with us. 
 
 Thank you, my friend, for being so brave in the face of death and allowing yourself to teach us these valuable lessons while helping me find hope once again after having lost it for many years before meeting you. 
 
 I will be there at that church one day too when my time comes; only this time I know where I am going because of what we have experienced together during your dying process. 
 
 We will embrace each other like my father did with his wife on the other side and our reunion will be even more joyous than theirs was, knowing that it has been so many years since last seeing each other here in this life; but now we finally understand what death really means for all of us. 
 
 I know you can't hear me anymore because your soul is already gone from this world, but I want you to know how much your presence here has meant for me and our family; it will never be forgotten by any one of us. 
 
 When the bell rings for you on that day at the church door, let all those people who are sad see you coming in with a smile and peace on your face like my mother did when she came home from her dream and showed everyone what was waiting for them beyond death; this will give them hope too. 
 
 I wish you good luck in your new life where there is no more suffering, only love and joy that goes on forever, without end or beginning, just like heaven is supposed to be like according to all the religions we have studied over our lifetimes here together as humans living side by side with one another. 
 
 Goodbye my friend! I will never forget what you have taught me and how much better a person I am because of knowing you through dying in front of my eyes; this experience has changed who I am forever and now I can live each day knowing that even though death may come soon after living here on earth for some people, there is something beyond it waiting for us if we are brave enough to find out what it really means when all this suffering ends at last. 
 
 With deepest gratitude from our family, thank you so much for letting me be part of your dying process which allowed me too learn these valuable lessons about life's fragility and how precious every moment is while we are here on earth; may God bless you always until we meet again one day. 
 
 Goodbye! 
 
 I am sorry that the end came so soon for my friend, but knowing him as well as I do now makes me realize it was actually good timing in some ways because his dying process allowed me to learn many valuable lessons about living generously with others while we were still both here on earth together. 
 
 I am thankful that death came so quickly after meeting this man because he helped our family see what is truly important when faced with facing a terminal illness, which will now always be remembered forever thanks to him. 
 
 He also taught me how fragile life can be if we don't value each moment while it is happening; something we are all much more aware of after knowing him too. This knowledge has changed who I am as an individual person and makes me want to live every day like there might not be another one coming soon enough! 
 
 Although I know that death will eventually come for us all someday, it doesn't make facing those last moments easier when they do arrive; however, having learned these valuable lessons from him while still being here on earth together makes me feel like I can face whatever comes next knowing he was there too and taught me so much along the way before dying himself. 
 
 We were lucky enough to have someone like my friend with us for this brief time in our lives because they taught us things that we may not otherwise ever learned if it weren't for him being so brave about dying right in front of our eyes. 
 
 His presence here was a blessing for our family and has left us all changed forever; something that cannot be taken away once experienced firsthand. Thank you, my friend, for letting me share this journey with you while living on earth together! Goodbye!
