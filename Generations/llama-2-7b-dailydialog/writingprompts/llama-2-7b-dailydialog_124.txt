`` Nothing!'' He said, sounding genuinely surprised by my anger. 
 
 ''You're such a liar!'' I shouted. ''I know what you were doing and now I am going to tell your boss on you.'' 
 
 ''Oh, really? Well, since he hates me so much maybe it would be best if I told him about the affair you're having with someone else in this office too.'' 
 
 ''You have no evidence of that!'' I yelled back at him. 
 
 ''Neither do you for this,'' he said pointing to the pictures on his phone. 
 
 ''Oh, come on, James! This is ridiculous and you know it. I'm not going to let you get away with that.'' 
 
 ''If you think about it I am doing you a favor by saving your job. Otherwise you would be fired for sure.'' he replied. 
 
 ''You don't have any evidence!'' I said, getting angrier and angrier.
