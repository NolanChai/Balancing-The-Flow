That's not your only problem here, mate!  The app also claimed to offer "Smooth and Secure Access". I guess you were so eager to get an easier life that you never bothered checking if the app was actually secure.  It appears like that wasn't even part of their plan as now it seems the app is leaking your personal information to third parties!
