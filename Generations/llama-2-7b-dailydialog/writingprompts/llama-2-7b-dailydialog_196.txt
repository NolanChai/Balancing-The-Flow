What?
 
 Well, you're swimming on the top and I have to come up for air or else I drown...
 
 It's like being a dog, isn't it? The water is home. But then we are separated from it.
 
 But you don't get lonely in your den. You must be homesick now that the snow has melted and winter is over. I wonder what you do with yourself all day long while I'm working and studying...
 
 I think about you, mostly, when I am not with you...
 
 It sounds lonely.
 
 How can it be lonely? There are so many others out there, too.
 
 So why don't you get married again? You must meet some wonderful women.
 
 What would I talk to them about? What do they say back to me?
 
 You could tell them things. You can find other ways to communicate with people.
 
 No, no, you're not listening to a word I'm saying...
 
 Why are we talking about this again? It seems like every time we go out on the water or have a little date together you bring it up again. You are so jealous of me.
 
 What do you mean I'm jealous of you? Of course I love you, and there is no one else for me...but this obsession with the past is crazy! I know your feelings are strong and that you must go through it every day but why can't we just move on together...
 
 She has a point. You do need to get over her, she doesn't exist anymore. We are in the present now. This isn't some kind of fantasy world where you can play out your past again and again with another woman.
 
 But it wasn't like that! It was nothing like that! How could you think such things? What if we hadn't met, would she still be alive today? I don't know what to say to this...I mean I had my own life before her and I thought I was happy. Is it so strange for me to want the same again?
 
 Oh, for God sakes! You're obsessed with the past because you can't have the future with anyone else! Look at us out here on this lake! I don't know how many times we do this but we always end up having the exact same conversation about her. She died years ago and she is never coming back. 
 
 What if someone did want to be with me? Would you resent it, jealous again because of something that happened long before you met me? I don't know what else to do to convince you...
 
 Nothing. Forget it! This is so ridiculous now. Why do we keep coming out here together when this conversation always ends up like this? Just go back and study for your exams or work on the computer like you are supposed to be doing while I'm in class. Go ahead, get angry at me again because you can't stand seeing us have a good time when it isn't with her...
 
 How is that being jealous? How could anyone possibly be jealous of that? You have no idea what we are really like together! We never even touch each other in public, not even the slightest bit of affection. It just seems so sad to me that I can't show you how much I care for you...
 
 Look at us here now in this beautiful lake talking about her when we could be out on it together with no worries or thoughts about anything but enjoying ourselves. Just get over her and forget what happened, please, before I lose all interest in ever being with you myself...
 
 Don't say that! It hurts me to hear you talk like this. You know how important she was to me so why can't you try to understand? What would you do if someone came into my life again and changed everything for both of us? How could I possibly take her place in your heart when no one else has even had a chance yet...
 
 Why is it so hard for you to move on with me, when we've been together like this for years already? If she were still alive then maybe it would be different but you can't keep living like this. She isn't here anymore and nothing will bring her back except for letting go of the past once and for all...
 
 But I don't know how to stop thinking about her, even though I have tried so many times before this happened again today. The only thing that keeps me from forgetting her completely is being with you by my side whenever possible. How can it hurt if there isn't another person who loves me? Why do we keep coming here every week to talk about the past when all we need to do is move on together...
 
 This isn't what I wanted for us, not at all! She was the only woman in my life and now that she has passed away it seems as if nothing else matters anymore. You are everything to me so why can't you see how much she still affects me? It isn't fair for either of us...
 
 But I love her, too, in a way that no one else will ever know. She was the first woman I ever loved and she died before we even had time to figure out what it meant between us. How could you ask me to forget about someone who meant so much when there are still memories of good times together? 
 
 I'm sorry but this isn't fair for either one of us anymore...we can never be happy because the past keeps coming back again and again until we give up on trying altogether.
