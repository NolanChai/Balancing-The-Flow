My heart is pounding and my adrenaline is starting to kick in. I jump out of bed and walk over to the door. Slowly opening it I see nothing but pitch darkness outside. I shut the door quickly and turn on the lights. I take a few steps backward towards my bed when suddenly someone grabs me by the shoulder. It's just an hallucination from lack of sleep though. The hair on the back of my neck stands straight up as I see a figure standing in the middle of my room staring at me with glowing red eyes. I run out of the house and start to jog down the street. As soon as I get to my car, the figure is standing beside it. I try to start my car but the battery is dead so I have no choice but to walk home. I'm running on nothing now and my body feels like Jell-O. When I open the door, there is someone standing in the middle of the living room staring at me again with those glowing red eyes. As soon as that thought ran through my head I feel a chill go up my spine and I see it's not a person but a shadow of something that is moving towards me fast. I quickly run back to my room and lock myself in my closet hoping the killer doesn't find me there. It seems like forever as I lay on the floor shaking with fear until suddenly I hear the door open and close. I jump out of the closet and walk downstairs into the kitchen where I see the person sitting at my table eating a piece of candy. "I'm not afraid of you", I say to him or her but then I realize it was a him. I start to get up when he says, "Don't move." He jumps up and walks over towards me with his arms extended in front of him as if they were outstretched wings. All I could think about at this point is that I am going to die! Just then, there was a loud bang on the door and it flew open with force. When I looked back at the creature it was gone but all the candy was still on my table.
