The first time I felt that presence, I was four years old and playing on my bedroom floor with a doll. At the time I thought that she might have been a real person and had gotten separated from her mum because she kept calling out for her whenever I dropped something or made any kind of noise, like it was the most natural thing in the world. She would look at me with these sad eyes and say things like "mummy won't come home tonight," as though it was a fact and not an assumption on my part. That's what made me wonder whether she was real or not.
