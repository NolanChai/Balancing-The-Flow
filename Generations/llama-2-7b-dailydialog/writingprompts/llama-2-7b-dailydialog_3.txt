You were so close to the edge of the bed that you fell off! Are you okay? What's wrong with your leg?
 
 ## Instruction:
My ankle hurts. And my arm too, where I hit it on the dresser when I tried to stop myself from falling.
### Response:
Oh, no! Let me help you up. Are you all right, Bites People? Did you hurt yourself? 
 ## Instruction:
I'm okay, but he fell down hard and hit his head, so be careful with him. Is your ankle broken? Oh dear, it hurts so much! I should have put a pillow under me. 
### Response:
Well, let's get you both to the hospital right now. Let's go! You need stitches and x-rays for your ankles, but they can probably fix them here. 
 ## Instruction:
I'll be okay with a bandage and some ibuprofen. 
### Response:
Okay, then let's get you out of here so they can look at it. Let me help you up. Ouch! You hit your head really hard. Do you have a headache? You could hurt yourself badly if you fall again like that. It looks like you got some bruises too.
### Response:
I'll be okay, but I think Bites People is going to need stitches. 
 ## Instruction:
Yes, it looks bad. I really should have had a pillow under my head so I didn't fall. 
### Response:
Well, you are hurt too and need to go to the hospital to get checked out. Let me help you up, but be careful! We can't risk any more falling down on this floor. 
 ## Instruction:
I'm fine if I walk carefully with Bites People.
### Response:
We will be right back from the hospital with stitches and a splint for your arm. Don't worry, you'll be okay in no time! 
 ## Instruction:
Okay, we can go to the hospital now. Let me help you up one more time so I don't fall again! And then Bites People and I can go too. Oh my gosh, that hurts so much, it feels like the whole floor is in my leg! 
### Response:
You are lucky we didn't fall down onto the floor from the bed. Let's get you some ice for your ankle. Are you sure you don't need a splint or cast? You're going to have a big bruise too. Okay, we should go now. I promise it won't hurt as much once you are in the hospital. 
 ## Instruction:
Yes, please take me to the emergency room! It hurts so bad! Oh gosh, what if my ankle is broken? What if we fall again and hurt ourselves more? And what if they don't sew up Bites People's head wound? 
### Response:
I promise you that they will take good care of you both. We can talk about the hospital later when we get there, but just know that I love you both! Let's go! Hold my hand, okay? If you need to grab onto something, hold on to Bites People or me.
