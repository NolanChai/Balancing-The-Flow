I'm sorry sir I can't give you that much time.
   The customers were beginning to look at me funny now so I quickly turned around and grabbed some water. 
 
 2.7 seconds late. 
 
 I placed the bottled water on the bar. 
 
 3 seconds early. 
 
 I put my apron back on, I was trying to get out of the room quickly without anyone noticing. 
 
 5 seconds late. 
 
 I ran through the kitchen and up the stairs with my
   co-workers yelling at me from behind. 
 
 10.7 seconds early. 
 
 I walked into the dining room where there was a full bar of people waiting to order drinks. 
 
 29 seconds late. 
 
 I quickly began serving everyone and my co-worker yelled at me from across the kitchen again, "Hey Toby! You can't be doing that!"
   I continued to ignore him as he walked into the dining room and began serving drinks as well. 
 
 52 seconds late. 
 
 I quickly grabbed a couple of empty bottles from the table in front of me, I filled them up with water and ran them back to the kitchen. 
 
 60 seconds late. 
 
 My co-worker was standing at the end of the bar smiling at me. 
 
 92 seconds early. 
 
 He winked at me as I walked out with another order and I laughed in my mind at how easily I had beaten him to get a table drink.
