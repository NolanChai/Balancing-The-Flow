The day is over before we realize how fast it has passed by. It's almost like a dream, the time spent at work, at home or even out of your mind, in between. We hardly know what happened in these hours when we think back to them. I am sure you are right about not feeling anything right now and perhaps there was never any itch or pain or strange breeze. It may have all been in your head but that doesn't matter because the world has changed since you made this realization. You are different now.
