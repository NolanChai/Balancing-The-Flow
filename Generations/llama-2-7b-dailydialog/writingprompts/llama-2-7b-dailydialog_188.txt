You really don't have to be so hostile. It's just that you can see them from your window and it makes me feel a little uncomfortable.' 
 
 
Well, I know it's kind of an invasion of privacy but I mean...they aren't going anywhere soon.' 
 
 Well, they were just playing in the yard when I saw them and then they started throwing snowballs at my house.' 
 
 Oh. That's not very nice.' 
 
 But it doesn't really bother me. You don't need to go all vigilante on them, you know?' 
 
 Yes, I do know.' 
 
 They were throwing snowballs at your window? What did they say?' 
 
 'Hi! Can we come in?' was the response I got when one of them threw a snowball at my face and broke my nose. 
 
 That's fucking awful!' 
 
 I know it is but...I don't have any kids myself so they scare me just a little bit.' 
 
 Well, you could always put up a sign that says no trespassers.' 
 
 You should call the cops about those kids. They are very destructive and their parents don't seem to care.' 
 
 I can't do that because it would just start some kind of shit with my neighbor, who is a cop.' 
 
 Okay, well then you will have to deal with them yourself. We gotta be strong like our fathers and teach those kids a lesson.' 
 
 Oh yeah?' 'Yes! I'm going outside right now and throw the first snowball at them.' 
 
 Good luck with that!' 'Thank you, but I really need to do this. Those brats have been terrorizing me for far too long!' 
 
 All right...goodbye, sir.' 
 
 Bye bye, lady! You're a crazy bitch!' 
 
 Okay, enough of that...what is wrong with you?' 
 
 Well, I just needed to make it clear that these kids aren't welcome around here. They have been throwing snowballs and making noise all day.' 
 
 Yeah but you have no right to do something like that to them! You are a grown man!' 
 
 And they were throwing shit at me, lady! I was scared for my life so I had to fight back. Besides, they can't see my face anymore anyway.' 
 
 Oh...so what happened? Did you get into a fistfight or something?' 
 
 Well, let's just say the younger one was on his way to the hospital and that my nose is broken.' 
 
 You are going to have to call an ambulance for him, he needs medical attention right away!' 
 
 I already did...so what? I told you I was fighting back. They had been throwing rocks at my house all morning, so I just decided to give them a little payback.' 
 
 You are the worst human being ever! How could you possibly do something like this?' 'Because I don't have any kids and they scare me!' 
 
 Oh...I can't believe what a horrible person you are. What would you think if somebody did that to your son or daughter?' 
 
 My kid is going to be a man when he grows up! He won't do stupid shit like this and he definitely won't throw snowballs at people!' 
 
 Oh my God...do you even listen to what you are saying? You just broke some poor little boy's nose. That was not only illegal but it was also incredibly wrong of you.' 
 
 It wasn't so bad. He wasn't in any pain or anything and he was laughing his ass off. I am the one that is bleeding!' 
 
 And that makes you right? You are an evil man...a straight-up monster and your children will suffer from it.' 
 
 Shut up, you stupid cunt! That's what they get for fucking with me. They can rot in hell for all I care!' 
 
 Oh my God!...I am calling the cops right now!' 'I don't give a shit!' 
 
 No, you won't.' 'Goodbye, lady...you are really annoying and creepy!' 
 
 You are crazy for even trying to call the police on me. They can't do anything about this.' 
 
 Yes they can. I know where your house is and I'll be there in a minute with some backup.' 'Yeah? What's going to happen...you think you are going to get away with this?' 
 
 No, but my kids will take care of it. You're not the only one who knows how to throw a punch and I guarantee your face is going to be beat in by tomorrow.' 
 
 I don't believe that...I have got a gun!' 'Don't fucking threaten me, asshole!' 
 
 I am telling you the truth! You should watch yourself around here. Those kids are dangerous and they aren't going to put up with this much longer.' 
 
 Well, just let me know when you want to take a swing at them because my son will be happy to oblige.' 
 
 I don't care what the consequences might be...I am not afraid of some brats. I would rather go to prison for assault than have that kind of fear in my heart.' 
 
 Yeah, well you better think about what you are doing before it is too late because I guarantee there will be serious repercussions from this.' 
 
 You should also think twice about threatening a cop's children with violence...you might end up having to take care of them for the rest of your life.' 'That's a big threat, coming from a little bitch like you.' 
 
 Hey!...I don't give a shit what you have to say. I am going out there now and make sure my kids are safe...so if you want to come along then you can try it yourself.' 
 
 All right, we will see about that!' 'Fine! Whatever makes you happy, asshole.' 
 
 I'm on my way.' 'Goodbye. Don't forget what happens when you cross me...you're dead meat, motherfucker!' 
 
 Okay, I have got a cop coming down here in one minute so just let me know when you are ready to die! We can do this right now if you want!' 
 
 Ready or not, it is gonna happen.' 'Then why don't we start by fighting over something less violent like chess?' 'No...I think I would rather beat your ass in the snow.' 
 
 Well then let us go outside and do this right now. I have got a gun and I know how to use it, so don't try anything stupid with me.' 
 
 Fine!...let's go!' 'You are on! I will be waiting for you in my car when you get here...and if that cop doesn't show up in ten minutes then we will have a problem. You got it?' 
 
 Yeah, but what about your kids? Aren't they going to try and stop me?' 'They won't.' 
 
 What do you mean by that? Are you threatening them too?' 'I'm not...they just don't care. They know I am a big guy and they respect my authority so if anything happens to me then it will be on their hands.' 
 
 Okay, well let us go outside then.' 'Okay but watch what you do or say because these kids are going to make sure we don't hurt each other.' 
 
 You got that right!' 'I am ready when you are!' 
 
 Wait...don't move yet! I need to talk for a minute.' 
 
 What do you want?' 'Nothing...I just wanted to say goodbye because my son is going to beat your ass like a drum and then kill you.' 
 
 Okay, let us go then.' 'Just be careful out there. You are dealing with some tough kids who have been through a lot of shit in their life so make sure that if they get into it with you then it won't end up killing either one of us.' 
 
 I will take care of myself...and your son better watch out because my friends are waiting for him in the woods. He is going to regret ever threatening me.' 'Okay, let us go.' 
 
 All right...I am ready!' 'We can do this whenever you want.' 
 
 Now?' 'Now would be perfect.' 
 
 I have got my gun and a knife too so don't try anything stupid with me or I will make sure that nothing is left of you after this is over. You understand?' 
 
 I know what to do...you'll see.' 'I look forward to it, sir.'
