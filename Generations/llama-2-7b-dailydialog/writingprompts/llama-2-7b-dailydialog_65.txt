`` You think....you are a tough guy, do ya...you got guts.....but you ain't got nothing on me. 
 
 `` I'm not afraid to get my hands dirty....like I did when I took out that big jerk who was picking on your girlfriend last night at the bar'' 
 
 Whoa! You took a swing at his girlfriend? 
 
 `` Yup, and he got a right good one for calling me names. But hey, I got up again and said to him that if he didn't want me to get my hands dirty, he should keep his distance from mine'' 
 
 Wow! He sounds like a real punk. 
 
 `` Yeah...I've had it with guys who act big when they are down on their luck. So I was only doing the guy a favor by showing him what happens to people who pick on others. 
 
 `` Hey....I guess I'll show you how tough I am so that we can settle this once and for all'' 
 
 Are you sure about that? Maybe I should take a walk or something...you might get hurt if I didn't know what was coming.. 
 
 `` No way. You don't have to worry about that, but come on over here so that we can work out the details'' 
 
 OK. 
 
 `` When this is over, you won't be saying anything again. I guarantee it '' 
 
 Hmmm....that sounds good. 
 
 `` If that is what you want...let me show you how tough I am...I got it all covered here. And after the fight.....you will understand why I am such a badass'' 
 
 OK...let's go then '' 
 
 So, I guess we are going to have a little disagreement over who is the meanest guy around? 
 
 `` Yeah, so let's get down and dirty...and get it on'' 
 
 Whoa....hold on there, buddy. This isn't going to be easy for either one of us. I may not be a fighter but you are really pushing me into this '' 
 
 `` I guess so.....but what do you want me to say? You know I am the best and I don't think that anyone can take my place. 
 
 `` Yeah...you are right there..I'm not going down easy and neither will you'' 
 
 This is getting serious and I still have no idea what you are talking about '' 
 
 `` Well....I guess I should tell you the whole story here. I was at a bar last night having some drinks when this guy starts calling me names, like you are doing now...and it gets me really angry'' 
 
 You do have an anger management problem. 
 
 `` Yeah....but that is what got me started on my plan to beat the snot out of him '' 
 
 That sounds so mature '' 
 
 `` Well.....you can't blame a guy for trying, right? I mean, he had it coming...I think. So when he started calling names again....he got one in his face and then some'' 
 
 What did you do? 
 
 `` Yeah....that is about the time that my fist made contact with his nose '' 
 
 Holy shit! You broke it? I thought that was just a myth '' 
 
 `` No way...he was asking for it, and I delivered. So what are you waiting for? Let's get started then'' 
 
 Alright....let me guess, he didn't think so.. 
 
 `` You got that right.....and he just went down like a sack of bricks '' 
 
 Oh....my...god. This isn't going to be as easy for you as it is for him...he is getting all worked up now. 
 
 `` Hey, I don't care....I've got nothing left to lose here and if he wants a fight.....well, that is what he gets '' 
 
 Are you sure about this? 
 
 `` Yeah..I am going down hard on this one....but I think the guy deserves it. He shouldn't have been picking on my girlfriend last night'' 
 
 OK...then let's get started then '' 
 
 OK.....we are all set here...so come on over so that we can settle this once and for all '' 
 
 Really? This is going to happen now, isn't it? 
 
 `` Yeah....we are gonna have a real good time with this. I've been waiting for this opportunity for the longest time. So get ready because here we go'' 
 
 You are not going to be able to do much damage with that little punch you threw last night '' 
 
 `` Oh, but I can...I will show you how tough I really am now'' 
 
 Really? 
 
 `` Yeah....this is it. My turn and I think you are going down for the count. I'm not playing around anymore here...and when this is over....you won't be saying anything again'' 
 
 OK.....I can feel the energy building up between us '' 
 
 `` Yeah, it has been awhile since I had to do my thing and I am really ready now. So let's get started then...I don't want to waste any more time here '' 
 
 Alright....let's do this then '' 
 
 Are you sure about this? You have no idea what is going on here, do you? 
 
 `` No way.....I am not going down easy. I mean, this guy needs to learn his lesson the hard way and that will be my job for the day'' 
 
 OK....let's get started then '' 
 
 So what is he trying to do now? He keeps saying things like I'm gonna kick your ass or whatever. Is this guy serious about this? 
 
 `` Oh, yeah....I know that he has been waiting for his chance and here it comes. Now is the time that we settle our little disagreement once and for all '' 
 
 I think you are getting worked up over nothing here. We aren't really going to get into a fight now, are we? 
 
 `` Oh, yeah.....I can feel my heart beating out of control already. And he is not the kind of guy that I want around if I am not looking for trouble'' 
 
 This is getting serious and I still don't know what you are talking about '' 
 
 `` Yeah....but I have been waiting a long time to get my chance with this guy. He really has it coming'' 
 
 Let's stop this before things get out of hand, OK? 
 
 `` No way...you started this by being a punk and now I want to settle this once and for all. So let's do it then '' 
 
 Really? You are not joking around anymore, right? 
 
 `` Yeah....I am going down hard on this one. He needs to learn his lesson the hard way...and that is what I am going to do now'' 
 
 Are you sure about this? 
 
 `` Yep....you are going to get your ass handed to you like a hot potato '' 
 
 You are serious, aren't you? 
 
 `` Yeah.....I've had it with guys who think they can act tough and then pick on others when they are down on their luck. It is time for them to learn the hard way that they should keep their distance from mine '' 
 
 OK....let me see how tough you really are now '' 
 
 You've got it all planned out, haven't you? I'm not going to be able to stop this now. 
 
 `` Yeah....this is my chance for revenge and when this is over...you won't have anything nice to say about me anymore'' 
 
 Are you sure you aren't thinking a little too much here? This isn't going to end well, I can feel it. 
 
 `` Yeah....I am just getting started now and I don't think there will be any problems when this is over '' 
 
 So what are we waiting for then? Let's go. 
 
 OK.....here goes nothing...get ready to take a good punch'' 
 
 What the hell are you doing? You aren't going to hit me, right? I don't want any trouble '' 
 
 `` Yeah....I am not sure what is going on here but I think this guy needs a little bit of tough love. So let's get started then and see how tough he really is'' 
 
 Are you serious about this? This isn't going to end well for either one of us '' 
 
 `` Yeah....I am ready to prove that I am the best in town here...so let's do it then and get it over with''
