*I'm sorry to hear that.* The sound of the music faded as the door closed behind me and I turned around to see the face of a familiar man with a kind, but tired smile. *You okay?* He said. *Yeah, yeah, just had a shitty day.* I said back in response. *Sorry about that.* My friend replied. *I don't know, I guess I'm just burned out on my job or something.* I looked at him as if he were crazy to which he gave an awkward laugh and we walked together for a while.
