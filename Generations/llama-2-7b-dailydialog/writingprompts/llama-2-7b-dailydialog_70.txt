In fact I believe that suffering is a good thing because it is only through suffering that we can reach enlightenment. In the past, some idiots tried to harvest physical pain by torture, then they tried to cause horrible mental pain, and they succeed. However in most cases they did damage their resources to the point of uselessness instead of usefulness as it should be. Moreover I believe that suffering is a good thing because it is only through suffering that we can reach enlightenment.
