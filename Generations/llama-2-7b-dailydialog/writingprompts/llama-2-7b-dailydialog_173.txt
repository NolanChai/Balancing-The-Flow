I can see why you would n't like your desk job. 
 It ' s boring as hell . 
 And what makes it worse is the fact you don ’ t need the money , right? 
 But you get paid anyway, I guess to avoid any legal shit storms ? 
 You should quit that fucking job . 
 But first , you have to find a new one . 
 What are your skills ? 
 Oh ! Well ...I can run very fast and jump really high. 
 And I can see things really well at night , I can make out the faces of people in the dark 
...And I am good with computers , too . 
That ’ s it . 
Well ... maybe you should try to get a job as a stunt man ? 
No one will pay me enough money for that and I don ’ t want to do stunts 
I just need a normal job . 
I mean ... I have my own super powers , but no one believes them ! 
Hey ... maybe you could get a job in security ? 
That sounds cool, actually. 
And you can work at nighttime . 
Then your super powers won ’ t be such a problem anymore ! 
Well , I still have social anxiety . 
But thanks for the idea . 
Maybe ... we should go out and celebrate ? 
Yeah , but first we need to eat something , right ? 
What do you think about this restaurant ? 
Great . 
I love this place. 
You too ? 
Yeah . You look really good here in this dress ! 
Thanks ... you look pretty good, too . 
What should we order ? 
I don ’ t know , I haven ’ t eaten yet today . 
Then let ’ s get a few appetizers to start. 
Oh , no ! No ! We need to save money . 
Okay ... okay ... whatever you want is fine with me ! 
How about some stuffed mushrooms ? 
Okay . And what else do we have here ? 
Yeah , the cheese platters are really good here. 
Can I order one of them for us ? 
You got it. 
The waitress is bringing your appetizers. 
I love that they serve me food when my hands are full . 
So , you have super powers ? 
Yeah ! Well ... sorta. 
Okay . So how did you get them ? 
It ’ s a long story . 
No . I don ’ t want to hear it . 
Okay , well maybe another time ... 
You ’ re serious ? You really won ’ t tell me your secret ? 
Nope . It ’ s too weird ! 
Well , I ’ ll keep my mouth shut then. 
I ’ m just kidding ... of course I will tell you sometime . 
It ’ s no big deal. 
But when can we get married already ? 
Okay ... so maybe tonight or tomorrow night we could go to a club and dance ? 
What ? No ! 
Why not ? You always want to do stuff like that with me , but I am not interested in clubs . 
Yeah ? Well , you should get out more. You ’ ll meet new people ... maybe even find yourself someone else . 
I don ’ t need a boyfriend right now ! 
Well , I think you could use one ! 
And if we do this again tomorrow night , will you go to the club with me ? 
No , I still have social anxiety ! 
But ... come on . You said yourself that your powers are almost useless at this moment in time ! 
You ’ re right ... maybe I can try something new for once. 
Okay ... good ! 
Let ’ s go out and enjoy our dinner tonight ! 
Yes , let ’s have fun together ! 
Now the waitress is coming over with your drinks . 
Good job. What kind of wine did you order ? 
Red . It ’ s pretty strong . 
Okay , so what do you want to eat next ? 
I think I would like a pizza tonight. How about you ? 
Um ... hmmm... I don ’ t know . I think maybe some pasta ? 
No ! No . Not Italian food again ! You never let me cook for you , so we should try something new now that we ’ re on our second date together ! 
Okay , what would you like to eat instead then ? 
Um ... hmm... I don ’ t know ... 
You can order whatever you want . I won ’ t judge you. 
Okay , well, I think maybe a steak tonight might be nice. 
Fine with me ! But what kind of steak do you like ? 
Um ... hmm ... 
I know ! I ’ ll ask the waitress and order it for us ! 
You are so sweet . I can tell that you really care about me. 
Okay , here we go ! Steaks all the way around tonight, huh ? What kind of steak would you like ? 
Um ... hmm ... a filet mignon maybe ? 
Yeah , I guess that ’ s fine with me . 
And what else do you want with it ? 
I think some baked potatoes and salad. 
Okay ! And for the drinks again , you can have whatever you like. 
But we should split another bottle of wine first ! 
Good idea ! Let ’ s order a bottle right now while they bring us our food . 
I think it will be great to celebrate our second date tonight ... 
I really enjoyed myself today with you , and I am so glad that we are dating again ! 
I feel the same way ! Tonight was really fun. Thank you for taking me out on a real date tonight . 
You ’ re welcome, my dear . 
This food is already here ! 
Okay , well ... let ’ s see what they brought us to eat first ... I know ! It must be our steaks and potatoes . 
Oh ! And you got me some salad as well ! Thank you so much for ordering it. 
You are very welcome ! So how was your salad ? 
It ’ s pretty good , but I am hungry already ! This food is huge ! How big were the steaks that they gave us ? 
Oh my God ! It ’ s incredible ! They must be at least four inches long . 
Yeah ... and it is so juicy ! Let ’ s get started eating our steaks first , I think . What do you say ? 
Okay ... okay ... let ’ s start with the salad then. 
Oh my God ! Your dress tastes amazing tonight ! You really should wear this one more often to dinner ! 
You too! Your clothes look so beautiful ! 
Thanks . Let ’ s eat ! 
That was very good . So what do you think about the wine ? 
It ’ s delicious ... I would like some more if that is okay with you ? 
Of course it ’ s fine. We can order another bottle of red right now , if you want to . 
Okay ! I am drinking too much already though. It feels warm in my head. 
Well , what do you want to do after this dinner ? You have a lot of time left before bedtime. 
What about going out for some dessert and coffee or something ? 
I don ’ t know ... maybe we should just go home . 
Okay , I guess that is fine with me, but are you sure ? I would really like to stay out here for a little longer. 
We can do that tomorrow if you want ! Right now ... let ’ s just enjoy our evening together and then go home . 
You are so sweet . You always think about me , don ’ t you ? It ’ s cute . I love it when you care about me like this . 
Well, thank you for that comment. That means a lot to me ! 
I really do enjoy your company right now ! We should go out again soon and maybe even watch movies together ? 
We can do that sometime ... if we have nothing better to do later tonight . But first , I think it would be nice to watch a movie here in the restaurant. Do you want to sit over there by the window ? 
Yes ! I think we should be more intimate now ! We are on our second date together . Let ’ s be closer together tonight ! 
Okay ... fine with me ! Here is a place for us where we can get some privacy. Come with me ! 
What about your dinner ? 
Oh , I am not going to eat anything else right now ! It makes me feel sick already . 
That ’ s okay then ! Come on over here with me and sit closer next to me so that you are even more comfortable. What kind of movies do you like to watch the most ? 
I don ’ t know really ... I like horror movies and action ones, too , but I have never seen a movie in the restaurant before ! 
You don ’ t know what kind
