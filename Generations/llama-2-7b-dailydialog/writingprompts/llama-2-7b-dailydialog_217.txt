`` Thank you, Shrl. I agree that these Earthlings may be used by us, but we should still destroy their planet because it will help ours '' 
 `` Well said Xandi'' Shrl responded 
 `` Do you have any other thoughts on this matter ? '' 
 `` I don't know how to put my feelings into words, but I strongly believe that this is the right choice we should make for Earth. 
`` Let me explain in a simple way : '' he continued 
`` We can take over their planet and use it as our own because they have no power or wealth left after the attack from the Nac-Tors. They are nothing but a bunch of helpless humans with no place to go or anyone to help them. 
 `` I believe we should not hesitate in making this decision because the Earthlings are at fault for our destruction '' Xandi said.  
 `` Do you have anything to add ? '' Shrl asked 
 `` I agree completely. We must destroy them and their planet so we can get what is left of their wealth and power'' 
 `` Thank you for your opinions gentlemen '' Shrl answered 
 `` Yes, it's time for me to speak my thoughts on this matter'' Xandi said as he walked closer towards the table. 
 `` I agree with the majority of our decisions thus far in destroying the Earthlings but there is still some doubt in my mind about whether or not we should destroy their planet and leave them with nothing '' Xandi said slowly to get everyone's attention. 
 `` Well ?'' Shrl asked 
`` It seems like a waste of our energy to attack this planet because it could be used for other purposes if they were not on the ground, but I don't know what those purposes are yet '' 
 `` I agree with you completely Xandi. They would just get back up and fight against us again '' Shrl replied 
`` The Nac-Tors are gone forever, they can never return to this planet or any other'' 
 `` Well ? '' Shrl asked Xandi 
 `` I don't know if we should destroy the Earthlings yet because it could help our future cause on this planet. We could get more power and wealth from them after we have taken over their planet by killing their men, women and children '' 
`` I disagree with you Xandi. The Nac-Tors were not all that powerful but they still caused us trouble, so how much worse would the humans be ?'' 
 `` If we attack now then it will destroy any chance for our future success here on this planet because we would have to start from scratch when they regain power '' Xandi said firmly.  
 `` I think you are right about that Xandi, but maybe we could use these Earthlings as slaves or servants '' 
`` Yes, exactly ! That is the only way I see for us to be successful here on this planet after destroying their planet and killing everyone of them '' 
`` Well I agree with your assessment there. They would be useful because they have never been under our rule before so we can control them easily without any trouble '' 
 `` What about the humans that were left behind ?'' Shrl asked 
 `` We could keep a small group of soldiers to protect us from danger, and the rest should be killed immediately after the attack '' Xandi said 
`` I believe this is our decision on what we are going to do with the Earthlings. We will destroy their planet and all of them that remain so there will be nothing left for us but peace and power in this galaxy '' Shrl spoke 
 `` Agreed !'' Xandi said as he nodded his head in agreement
