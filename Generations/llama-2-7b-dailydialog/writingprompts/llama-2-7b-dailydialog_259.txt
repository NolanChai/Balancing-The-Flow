Oh come on, mom. 
 
 I don’t hate it that much. It’s just boring, that’s all. Besides, I get better grades than most of the kids in my class. And I like science and history. 
 
 So what if some people think I’m a nerd? Nerds are cool nowadays anyway. You should know; you’re one yourself. 
 
 And besides, I have plenty of friends to hang out with and play football and video games with. 
 
 So why are we talking about this shit again? It's been years since that happened. Besides, school is the only time I get to see you guys anyway. Why can’t I just enjoy myself while I’m here for two hours a day? 
 
 I don’t have much free time as it is; why make me feel guilty about having some fun?
