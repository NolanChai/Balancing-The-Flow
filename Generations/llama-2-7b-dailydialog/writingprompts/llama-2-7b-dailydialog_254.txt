I stare blankly into space, feeling nothing and wanting to die. 
 
 Mom clears my plate with a smile and kisses me goodbye for school as I watch her with unseeing eyes. It's too much; I have to get away.
 
 I wander the hallways of the high school, seeking something to fill up the void inside me. Anything will do: my classmates, my teachers, a book.
