A harsh suckle infiltrated Orville's bramble-like ear hair. He noticed Harold's mouth hanging off his arm. 
 
 `` What's that? EHHH!'' Orville smacked the top of Harold's head. Harold's feeble jaw relaxed in relief. 
 
 `` I'm so sorry, sir. It just slipped out of my mouth. '' He looked embarrassed. 
 
 `` So what are you doing? Doing nothing! Get busy boy, I don't have time to be here all day long!'' Orville was irritated and frustrated. 
 
 `` Yes sir! '' Harold said, running out of the room. 
 
 `` Darn kids!'' Orville muttered, then looked at the phone on his desk and dialed a number. The line rang twice before an angry voice answered. 
 
 `` Hello? '' a frustrated voice grumbled from the other end of the line. 
 
 `` I'm looking for Bob,'' Orville said, ``He's working at my house today, isn't he?'' 
 
 `` That depends on what you mean by 'working.' '' The angry voice replied. 
 
 `` I think that it is pretty obvious what I meant. He's supposed to be mowing my lawn and cleaning up the yard for me today, right?'' Orville said. 
 
 `` Not if he's a good boy! '' Bob's mother yelled in the background. A scream followed her voice. 
 
 `` Oh, he is being a good boy now!'' Bob shouted into the phone. 
 
 `` What does that mean?'' Orville asked. He was irritated and frustrated by this turn of events. 
 
 `` He's at the dentist getting his teeth cleaned! I figured you wouldn't need him today anyway! '' Bob said. 
 
 `` Well, he is a little late, isn't he?'' Orville asked angrily. He could hear the toothpaste foaming in the sink from where he was standing. 
 
 `` A little?'' Bob yelled into the phone. Then the water went off and Orville heard a pair of sneakers running down the basement steps. A door slammed shut followed by another door opening and closing. The front door opened and closed. 
 
 `` You know what he's like! He is going to be late again tonight too,'' Bob yelled, then hung up. Orville threw the phone against the wall, but missed it. He cursed at himself in frustration and slammed his fist on the desk.
