I told you I wasn't going to take that again! 
 
 Fine. You do it, then. 
 
 No way am I gonna get on that ship! I don't want to go anywhere near those things. And what if they need something done? They can do without me, they're a lot better off than me! 
 
 They will be soon enough! If you have any sense in your head, you won't stay there for long. 
 
 What's that supposed to mean? 
 
 I know what you'd be doing on that ship, and it isn't anything good. 
 
 Shut up about that! You're just being stupid. And even if we wanted to get off the planet, do you think those people would want us around? 
 
 Maybe not, but you have nothing else! They might as well take someone who has some knowledge and some skills. 
 
 I don't need them or anything they got! I could survive just fine on my own here. 
 
 So you can't get enough of this place? You are a slave to it, then. And if there is something going on that you might be able to help with, I will not stand by while you waste yourself away in some stupid town like this one! 
 
 Okay, you go and do what you need to do. It won't last forever anyway, so if they come back here and get me, it is okay. 
 
 Maybe we could be together again someday, when I have gotten away from them, too. Then there will be no one left for us to worry about! We will go off somewhere else, where nobody knows who you are or what you did, and just be happy. 
 
 No way am I staying here! This is it for me! I'm going on the ship when it comes back around. And if that means being with them forever, then so be it. At least there will be other people there to see my suffering. 
 
 Okay, whatever you want. Go do your stupid thing and get what you want out of it. But don't expect me to ever come with you! You can stay in some filthy town like this one for all I care, but I am not going to be there! 
 
 What is wrong with you? Can't you see that this is the only option we have left? If you were smart enough, maybe things could turn out a lot better. 
 
 Maybe they will never come back. And if they do, it won't be soon enough for me to care! 
 
 Fine! I won't try to stop you from going, but I think you are making the biggest mistake of your life right now. 
 
 So what? It is my life and I will decide that for myself! You can just forget about ever having anything with me again! 
 
 Yes, maybe there is nothing left for us to do together. But don't come crying when you get stuck here and can't survive anymore because of your stupidity. 
 
 Go on, then. Get off my ship before I throw you overboard! 
 
 Goodbye! 
 
 Oh, good luck with that!
