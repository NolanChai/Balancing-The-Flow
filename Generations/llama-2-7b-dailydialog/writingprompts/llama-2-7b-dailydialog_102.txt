`` Are you sure?'' 
 
 He slammed the folder closed and flipped his pen off the desk with an angry click. He pointed to a chair near the door. 
 
 `` Of course I am! Now sit down, please. '' 
 
 I sat down as he continued. 
 
 `` You have been arrested for possession of narcotics in public. That includes any controlled substance: marijuana, pills, etc. We also suspect you were the dealer since you had more than a single package of pills on your person when we found you. '' 
 
 I winced at his words. 
 
 `` What should I do?'' I asked him. 
 
 He stood up and leaned over my desk with an angry expression, his face turning red as he yelled in my ear. 
 
 `` The only thing you can possibly do is confess! We are offering you the opportunity to reduce your sentence by cooperating with us now! You must be careful about who you associate yourself with! This time I have been lenient but this won ' t happen again, I will not be so kind next time. '' 
 
 He slammed his fist down on my desk and walked out of the office. A few minutes later he returned, handing me a small yellow envelope and saying: 
 
 `` Take it with you, get it tested by your doctor or wherever.'' 
 
 I took the slip from him, wondering why he would give me an empty envelope instead of the actual drug test. 
 
 He then said, '' The court date is set for two weeks. You will be sent a notice with all information regarding the time and place. Be there or you ' re in big trouble!'' 
 
 I got up from my chair and started to walk out of his office when he yelled at me, '' What are you going to do about this? Are you going to be stupid again? Think about what you have done!'' 
 
 As soon as I left the police station I called a few friends but nobody was home.
