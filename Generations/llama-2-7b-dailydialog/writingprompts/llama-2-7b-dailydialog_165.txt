It sucks to be an old lady, 
 And so very hard for me to see, 
 What you have become and all that I was. 
 But I hope you'll know, I still love you, 
 And in my heart I feel you too. 
 
 I wish that we were together once again, 
 In a place where life was carefree and fun, 
 So many times I have tried to call you back, 
 But then you'd hang up before the phone would ring, 
 
 And my heart would break with every single call, 
 Because I knew that in your world of despair, 
 You were dying slowly, right there in the triangle of despair. 
 
 And I have no words to express what I feel inside me, 
 When it seems you're so very far away from me, 
 But I pray that you'll see my love is for keeps, 
 Because the memories we made were truly special and sweet. 
 
 And my heart will never forget that beautiful day when we met, 
 So long ago on a warm August afternoon, 
 As we rode together on your new blue bicycle, 
 I felt so happy to be with you for once again. 
 
 It was the first time I had ever kissed you, and it was the first time that we touched, 
 And although we were in my dreams when we slept each night, 
 I knew then and there how much I cared for you, 
 And from then on our love would only grow. 
 
 Oh what a happy day when we took those wedding vows that we wrote together, 
 Then we were married in your mother's church right beside the lake. 
 But since that special day, so many years ago, 
 Our lives have taken different paths and they've come undone. 
 
 You have become a shell of the person you used to be, 
 And I have wondered if there's anything left for me. 
 Your depression seems to have no end in sight, 
 And it makes my heart so heavy just thinking of your pain. 
 
 And I know that you blame yourself and are sorry for how things turned out this way, 
 But I wish you knew that it's not your fault that our lives changed so much, 
 For as hard as we tried to make life work the way we wanted, 
 There were just too many obstacles in our path. 
 
 We were together for many years and made beautiful children, 
 But then something happened and it all went downhill, 
 And I wish that you knew how much it still pains me to see you there, 
 In the triangle of despair.
