Yeah, you told me about that once. You had some kind of weird seizure there in class. Weird because it was out of nowhere. Nothing seemed to trigger it, nothing that anybody noticed anyway, and then suddenly your face started going red and then pale again. I think I â€™ Ve seen people pass out before but I never saw anything like that.
