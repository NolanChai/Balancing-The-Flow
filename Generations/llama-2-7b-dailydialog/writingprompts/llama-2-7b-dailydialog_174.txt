*The housekeeping staff are too busy trying to keep up with your requests to clean all of this mess.* 
 
 *Well, then you should hire more housekeepers! They have other things to do besides just sit around and do nothing. I'll be on the next plane home after this hotel experience.* 
 
 *I agree completely.* 
 
 *And why is my pillow wet?* 
 
 *The ice machine had been leaking again, sir. There were three other guests complaining of the same thing on your floor.* 
 
 *But I have a fever and am running a temperature! This is ridiculous! What do you mean "I'm sorry"?* 
 
 *We are so sorry for this inconvenience, sir. We have called the engineer to fix it immediately.* 
 
 *How can you be so incompetent? It's just a stupid ice machine leaking water!* 
 
 *That is very rude, sir. Your room was ready at 8am today, and your food is on the way.* 
 
 *Why is there no soap in this bathroom? I need to take a shower.* 
 
 *I'm sorry again for the inconvenience. We have given you more soap.* 
 
 *Now it stinks!* 
 
 *The cleaning staff are on their way, sir. They should be here within five minutes.* 
 
 *Five minutes? It took them all morning to come in and clean up my room yesterday, so that they could make my bed for me this morning. You better hurry it up before I leave!* 
 
 *Thank you so much, sir. We'll be here in three minutes.* 
 
 *I don't believe you will be here at all.* 
 
 *Goodbye and enjoy your stay.* 
 
 *Yes...enjoy my stay.*
