The image of fire and the smell of burning flesh suddenly vanished but remained in his mind. It took a few moments for him to register this sudden change in scenery. The scent of the flowers gradually became more pronounced with time. He opened his eyes and looked around. The room he was in was well lit and he could see several windows that were framed by intricate woodwork, but he did not recognize them. His room seemed to be on a higher level from where he had been previously. He stretched out his arms as he lay on his bed and realized how much pain he was still feeling all over his body, despite being in what appeared to be an extremely comfortable bed. After getting up, he carefully walked out of the room and looked around for clues that might help him figure out where exactly he had wound up, but he did not recognize any of the buildings or people he saw at first glance. The only thing he could do was go on a tour of this strange place. He started walking in a random direction and came across several other rooms filled with people who were just as confused by what they had seen as him. Some of them were wearing clothes that looked like those worn by the people from his time while others wore different styles. A few of the buildings around here resembled ones he’d seen in pictures of ancient Greece, but many were quite different from anything he was used to seeing in either period or place. It seemed as though this entire new world had been created out of thin air. The man continued walking until he came across a woman who looked familiar and asked if she knew where they were located. She said that no one knew for sure but they had come here together from another dimension by means unknown to them, so it was likely the same place for everyone else as well. After talking with her for a while, he realized that all of their conversations made little sense because they could not understand each other’s language; however, this did not stop them from trying anyway since most people spoke in broken sentences even though they were supposed to be able to speak perfectly clearly due to some magic or technology. After spending a few days here, he finally found someone who knew enough English for him to have a conversation with her and she informed him that there was a large city nearby called New York City which is where most people came from originally when they first arrived at this new world. He decided to take an excursion into town by himself after seeing how beautiful the skyline was outside his window one morning during sunrise while lying in bed looking out over it all day long before heading off for breakfast with friends later that same day. After eating lunch at a small restaurant nearby called "McDonald's", he went back home where he found himself surrounded by familiar faces again after being away from them for so many years without any way of contacting anyone else until now except through letters written on paper sent across oceans which took months to arrive at their destination. After getting comfortable with this new world, he decided it was time to start looking for work again since he hadn’t had anything stable since before coming here after losing his job due to lack of experience and education when first arriving in America several years ago. He started applying for jobs online from home using websites such as Indeed or Monster because they were the only ones that allowed him access to their databases through computers located within public libraries throughout the city he was staying at which made it easier than going around knocking on doors asking if people needed help with anything since there wasn’t always an opening available at any given time but now that technology has advanced so far ahead of us humans it can be done online without leaving home!
