You should have seen it! It's like he couldn't even tell me what he wanted without doing something else. I said, 'Hello there', and then the first thing out of his mouth is that he's hungry! I said, 'Can we talk about this later?' But no, the little bugger just went on and on about how much he wants to eat. And even though I was saying it every second word or so, he still didn't seem to catch on when I told him how to count up to three. 
 
 He looked like he wanted to take me out for a steak dinner tonight! I said, 'We can talk about it later.' but then all I could hear was this little voice saying 'Pleasepleasepleaseplease!' 
 
 So when we got back in the car, I had to hit him with an ultimatum. He started crying and saying he'd eat something else if I didn't get upset at him but you know what? I said it right there and then; I told that little fucker that I was gonna smack his ass! And then the little fucker started screaming like a girl! 
 
 So, what do ya think? Should we let this one go or should we give him another shot?
