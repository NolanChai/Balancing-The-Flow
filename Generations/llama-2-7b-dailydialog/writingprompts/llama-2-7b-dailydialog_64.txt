I think you just need a little more patience with yourself. You can't expect to be able to hit on women out of nowhere like some kind of smooth-talking Casanova. It takes practice! But the real problem here is that your sense of self-worth needs work as well. You don't love yourself enough. I think you need to go home and look in a mirror for about an hour every day until you can see how gorgeous and wonderful you are, no matter what.
