I’m in. I hope they don't make me take the bus. I hate public transportation. 
 
 Cam is ready to go and pulls up at the curb as Paul jumps out of the car with a duffle bag filled with everything but the kitchen sink. They walk into the airport as if it were nothing, head to the nearest ticket counter, and buy two one-way tickets to Miami. 
 
 I'm so glad we decided on a cheap hotel. The last thing I want is to be stuck in some overpriced fancy hotel for a week without my family or my dog. I’ll never be able to relax! 
 
 Paul and Cam walk out of the airport, get into his car, and make their way south. 
 
 The two of them are in the backseat arguing about what they should pack while Cam is driving down the freeway doing 90 miles an hour. The plan was for Cam to take 95 all the way to Miami. Paul would jump out of the car somewhere between Florida and North Carolina, then hop on a bus bound for Charleston, where he’d hitchhike back up north. But since it's such an important trip they don't want to risk losing one another along the way, so they decided to split up. 
 
 Paul is in the backseat packing his clothes while Cam is driving. He notices that he hasn’t seen anyone else around for a few miles. 
 
 It looks like we're the only ones on this road. I hope nothing happens...I really don't want to be stuck here with just you and me. You know how much I hate talking about personal stuff, right? 
 
 Paul takes out his phone and calls Cam over. He shows him a picture of his sister and says: 
 
 That’s her. She looks like she could be your twin! Her name is Katherine. I hope you get to meet her someday. 
 
 Yeah, I would like that a lot. But this trip isn't just about meeting my family; it’s also important for me to figure out what I want to do with myself in the future. My parents are pressuring me into going straight to college after high school because they think being an engineer is "a great career path." 
 
 It seems like all my friends are planning on studying something artsy and I feel like they're just making fun of me behind my back when we talk about what we want to do with our lives. Everyone always says that the only way to succeed in this world is by getting a good education, but who said that was true? 
 
 Don’t worry; it will work out for you. You've got your whole life ahead of you! Besides, if you can convince them not to send me off right away then there should be enough time for us both to go through college together. Maybe even graduate school or something like that? 
 
 I hope so. If we do get to stay in the same university, it’ll make things easier on both of us because we won't have to worry about being apart for long stretches of time while one of us is away at school. 
 
 Yeah, and if you go through with your plan then maybe when I finish college we could get an apartment together or something? We're definitely going to have some fun times ahead! 
 
 I hope so too. But first things first: let's find somewhere safe for me to catch my bus from here... 
 
 Cam pulls into the nearest gas station, turns off his car engine, and turns around to face Paul who is looking out of the window at nothing in particular. He says with a smile on his face: 
 
 We should probably get started packing for our trip now since we've got all day ahead of us... 
 
 Okay...I’ll be back in a minute! I just want to look up something real quick before we head off again... 
 
 Cam gets out of the car and starts walking towards one end of an empty lot behind the gas station. He takes his phone from his pocket, unlocks it, then opens up Google Maps and searches for "bus schedule". As soon as he sees a bus route that looks promising to him, he closes down his app and walks back to where Paul is waiting patiently with both of them standing side by side looking out into the distance. 
 
 We'll have plenty of time to do whatever we need before we leave, but let’s keep our packing light just in case something goes wrong along the way! 
 
 Sure thing...I'm ready whenever you are. 
 
 The two of them walk over towards Cam and he holds out a ticket for Paul: it reads "Charleston - Miami". 
 
 Thanks man, this bus is leaving at nine tonight so we should have plenty of time to get back into town by then! You know what? Maybe you could come with me when I board this thing...I don't mind having someone else around on my journey home. 
 
 But I thought you didn’t want anyone knowing about us traveling together, especially in a small town like this one where we both live? 
 
 Oh no problem! We won’t tell a single soul if that makes things easier for ya'. 
 
 All right then...let me just grab my stuff from the trunk of your car before I head over there with you. You know how much I hate public transportation...I always feel like I'm stuck in some weird nightmare when riding on one of these things! 
 
 But it will be worth it because we’re going to be together for so long, right? 
 
 Yes sir! 
 
 Paul and Cam walk over towards his car with Paul carrying a duffle bag filled with clothes and essentials while Cam is dragging another one behind him. As soon as they get into the vehicle Paul says: 
 
 You know what...I'm kinda glad that you told me about this plan earlier on, because I probably would have been too scared to go through with it if I hadn't known someone else was coming along for the ride! It makes things feel a lot more comfortable. 
 
 Yeah but still keep your head down when we get there okay? 
 
 I will...I promise. Now let’s just find ourselves some seats so that way we can start this adventure of ours! 
 
 Cam and Paul drive away from the gas station, leaving it behind them as they head back into town where everything is still closed up tight for the night with no sign of life anywhere to be found. The two friends take turns driving while the other one sleeps until finally arriving at their destination: an airport bus terminal located right next door to a shopping center that has been closed down since midnight when everyone went home after work or school ended for another day...
