The tell-tale hiss of leaking plasma awoke the groggy captain. All around monitors and control panels chimed with errors and warnings. The captain did not need a million credits worth of useless sensor data to know that something was very, very wrong with this ship. He felt his heart pounding in his chest as he stumbled into his command chair, cursing the entire crew under his breath for their lackadaisical attitude towards life support maintenance. "I'm sure everything will be all right," he muttered to himself. The captain's hands gripped the edge of his desk tightly as a surge of adrenaline shot through his bloodstream and pulsed in his temples, causing him to shake. He blinked rapidly at the console displays in front of him. His eyes were bleary from sleep deprivation. But still he struggled to focus on the information that flashed before him. Finally, after a few moments, he forced himself to look down at his left hand and read the tell-tale number for life support system pressure. The captain's face turned pale as he realized what he had just seen. Inhaling deeply, he swallowed hard then started to pace around the control room while muttering under his breath. His pacing only exacerbated the adrenaline rush that was coursing through his system. "I can't afford to lose this ship," he finally said aloud, and with a heavy sigh added, "Not today." The captain slumped into his command chair again as if it was a weight on him. He reached over with his right hand and deftly pushed the comm button that would alert the crew to their precarious situation. "Attention all hands," he announced in a strong voice. "This is Captain Ricks. We are experiencing severe life support failures at the moment, so you must get ready for emergency evacuation procedures immediately! I repeat, prepare for an emergency evac." The captain's heart pounded in his chest as he waited for the reply to come over the comm system. After a long and seemingly endless minute of silence, a female voice finally responded, "Yes sir? We have already donned our environmental suits!" With that the captain was left staring at the empty control panel in front of him. He leaned forward slightly as he tried to think. The pressure gauge read 167 psi with no chance for increase. If they did not get off this ship immediately, the entire crew would suffocate to death. With that realization the captain's mind went blank and all other thoughts were pushed aside by his adrenaline surge as he frantically tried to come up with a solution to the problem at hand. It was then that an idea came to him. "Bridge to Engineering." The captain yelled, startling everyone in the room. "Engineering! What can you do about our life support issues?" The captain could feel his heart pounding even more rapidly now and he held tightly onto his chair as another surge of adrenaline shot through him. There was a long pause on the other end before an answer came back over the comm. "We're working as fast as we can sir, but right now all we can do is keep trying to get our filters to work." The captain swallowed hard and breathed in deeply through his nose before speaking again. "I want you to start rewiring our main engines so that they will burn all of the oxygen in them!" "But sir... that's not possible! That would take at least three hours to complete! And even then we would only have enough oxygen for about ten minutes!" The captain could hear the panic and fear in the engineer's voice. It was almost too much for him to bear. But he continued, "Do it anyway! Now move it people! I want you all working on this problem right now." He slumped back into his chair as if it was a weight on him. Then he forced himself up again with renewed vigor and added, "I need you all to help me here. This is not just some problem; we are facing certain death!" The captain's heart pounded in his chest as he waited for the reply that would tell him whether or not they had been successful in rewiring their engines.
