1.  There is a large number of people who have been driven off their land by those seeking to exploit natural resources, resulting in widespread poverty that has caused civil unrest. 2.  In most countries, there are laws governing how the forests and mineral resources can be used. 3.  These resources are very valuable but many of them must be handled with extreme care because they are endangered species or their existence could cause more damage than it is worth to extract them. 4.  Some forests have been managed in such a way that the wood produced is sustainable, while others have been depleted by over-logging and will take many years to recover. 5.  A large percentage of mineral resources are not renewable so they are only available for short periods of time before being extracted, and then they must be replaced by other resources or the earth itself is exhausted. 6.  Many natural resources have been used up in producing other products that have caused a negative impact on society such as pollution.

These answers give an excellent overview of how human activity is causing problems in many parts of the world and how these issues have caused civil unrest. 5.  The responses are quite good but they would be more effective if you included a little more detail in your explanation of each issue. For example, instead of saying that deforestation has caused social problems and environmental damage, you could give specific examples from different countries or regions where these issues have occurred due to deforestation. 6.  It is interesting to hear about some companies who are trying to make money by harvesting sustainable resources in a way that will not harm the environment or other peopleâ€™s livelihoods, but this point should be elaborated upon more so it becomes clear how this situation works and why it might benefit everyone involved if they can find ways of producing products without causing damage.
