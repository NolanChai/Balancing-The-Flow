It was like a dream, a hazy one at that. It was the early days of America ’ s Happiest Town and everyone was so nice to us! We were welcomed in with open arms by all these people we barely knew. The locals are the nicest people you can ever meet, they were always there to lend a hand if you needed one. It felt like home from day one. We built our house out of spare parts and made it look like a log cabin, with the help of the wonderful folks here in America ’ s Happiest Town. And as for my husband, I just wish he was still here with us. He had been so happy there and we were very happy together. But now that he is gone, I don’t know what to do next.
