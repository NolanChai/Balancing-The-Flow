The world-famous Orion Nebula is the only star formation that’s visible with the naked eye; it’s visible through a pair of binoculars. It lies just beyond the belt of Orion, about fourteen light years away. The nebula contains at least twenty stars, including the famous Trapezium, and many more are forming inside it.
