It was a dark stormy night, the house was dimly lit, and the phone was ringing. With a quiet sigh, a figure rose from the shadows and- 
 
 `` No.'' 
 
 ... *Rude*? 
 
 `` No, I'll tell you what's rude: You're waking me up at midnight to talk about this! '' 
 
 ... *Gasp of shocked surprise* 
 
 `` What are you doing here?'' 
 
 ... *Scared whisper* 
 
 `` I'm calling the police.'' 
 
 ... *Shocked gasp* 
 
 `` Oh, my God! It's the police! Quickly hide! '' 
 
 ... *Frantic scrabble* 
 
 `` You can't hide from me, you know that I'm a psychic.'' 
 
 ... *Muffled sob* 
 
 `` Get out of here, you creepy stalker! '' 
 
 ... *Chuckle* 
 
 `` Yes ma'am. Thank you for your time. Have a good night. 'Night! '' 
 
 ... *Rummaging* 
 
 `` Wait! What did you say? You said that I was the one stalking me, and I'd like to know where you got such an idea. '' 
 
 ... *Hysterical laughter* 
 
 `` Oh my God. That is hilarious! How do you think I can be a psychic if I don't have a crystal ball? The whole premise of the joke is that you thought I was calling to tell you about your future, and then when you found out it wasn't me who was going to call in the morning, you got angry. '' 
 
 ... *Shrill screech* 
 
 `` Oh my God! You did not just do that! How dare you wake me up for a joke like that? I hope you never get any sleep tonight because of all the tossing and turning you'll have to do. '' 
 
 ... *Chuckle* 
 
 `` Oh, don't worry. You won't be having trouble staying awake tonight. You should hear your screams in my dreams for weeks! '' 
 
 ... *Loud gasp* 
 
 `` I am calling the police about you again! Do not call me back! You are going to jail! '' 
 
 ... *Laughing hysterically* 
 
 `` Oh, my God. Ha ha ha! You're so funny! '' 
 
 ... *Frantic scrabble* 
 
 `` I'm not laughing now, you creepy stalker. '' 
 
 ... *Loud chuckle* 
 
 `` Yes ma'am. Thank you for your time. Have a good night. 'Night! ''
