The light went off. The darkness that followed was almost complete. The only thing to be seen was the silhouette of a person walking slowly towards me from where he had been sleeping in front of my bedroom doorway. I lay still, half-expecting to hear the sound of his footsteps on the floorboards but instead there came nothing but silence. *What's happening? * I thought as I looked up and stared at him again. His shape became clearer now that he was closer and it seemed like a man in a black suit had appeared before me. The silhouette stopped just in front of my bedroom doorway, then slowly turned his head to look at me with those pale white eyes of his. "You are awake," said the dark figure, which I now recognized as the ghost from my childhood who always visited me when I was young and afraid. *I'm not a child anymore! * I thought as I stared up at him with wide eyes. *Who are you? And how did you get in here? * "It is true, my son," replied the ghost as he continued to look down upon me from his lofty height above mine. *I am your friend, * he added before turning around again so that I could only see him from behind this time with nothing else but his silhouette visible in front of me once more."Why have you come here?" asked the ghost as he turned back towards where my bedroom doorway lay hidden beneath darkness on the floor below us both. "I know what happened tonight," said
