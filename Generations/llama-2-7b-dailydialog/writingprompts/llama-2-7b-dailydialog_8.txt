*Hello, Mr. Wilson. How do you do? '' she asked in her heavy German accent. She seemed to be around forty-five years old, but had the energy of one much younger. * 
 
 `` Hello, Martha. You're looking well. '' said Greg with a smile. `` Have you met Phil? He's my son and he's a student at the university.'' 
 
 `` Yes, I remember meeting him once before. How's your studies going, Philip? '' she asked. Her voice was so loud it seemed to drown out any noise around them. 
 
 `` Good. Thank you, Mrs . Wilson. How about yours? '' said Phil. 
 
 `` Fine , very fine, thank you,'' she replied as they both walked on down the snow-covered path. * 
 
 `` It's so quiet here today. I hope you don't mind the snow, Philip. My neighbors and I had a big party last night and we got into quite the snowball fight. The snow was flying everywhere! '' she exclaimed. Phil laughed out loud. 
 
 `` Well, Martha, it looks like there's plenty of snow for us to use in the fight as well . Would you mind if I built a little fort outside your house and we threw some big snowballs at each other?'' he asked with a mischievous smile. 
 
 `` Why not , Philip! I'm sure my husband wouldn't mind. '' she said with a chuckle. * 
 
 `` Okay, then let's do it . After all, we have some time before lunch and my dad has to work in the afternoon .'' 
 
 `` Alright , I guess we can make the most of this weather. '' she said as they walked up the front stairs to Martha ' s house. She unlocked her door, grabbing Phil's arm along the way and leading him inside. * 
 
 `` Let me take a look at you first before we go outside . You have to be careful of that snow , '' she cautioned. 
 
 `` Okay , okay . I hear you loud and clear,'' he said with a laugh. She laughed too as she walked through the front door . * 
 
 `` So what do you say? Let's go outside and get ready to throw some big snowballs . '' He pointed in the direction of their forts , which were already built up into small houses. 
 
 `` Sounds like a great idea, Phil! But first let me change my coat and boots for something warmer so I won't freeze out there.'' 
 
 `` Okay, Martha . I'll meet you outside in a minute , '' he said as she went into her bedroom to change. 
 
 *I guess we have some time before lunch is ready, Phil . Why don't we go to my room and grab a few things?'' she asked. `` My dad loves reading comic books during mealtimes , so I always bring him something to read. '' he replied as they went into her bedroom together . 
 
 *``I guess you can take these two bags of snowballs, too . It would be a good idea to have some extra in case we need them .'' she said as she handed Phil two large paper bags full of snow. They both went downstairs into the kitchen where Phil's dad was reading his comic book on one of the chairs at the table. 
 
 *``Hi, Mr. Wilson ! What are you reading ? '' he asked, sitting down in another chair next to him with a smile . `` Oh , hi Philip . I'm enjoying this comic book that Greg brought over for me today .'' He replied as they both looked at the comic book. * 
 
 *``Did your mother tell you we were going outside to play? '' asked Phil as his dad finished reading a page of the comic book. `` Yep . I'll meet you guys out there in a few minutes , '' said Greg with a smile on his face . He then went back upstairs into his bedroom where Martha was waiting for him to change their clothes before going outside . * 
 
 **``We better go if we want to build our snow forts before lunch,'' said Phil as they walked through the front door of the house and out into the cold winter day. They both took off their coats and put on sweaters instead because it was too chilly outside . * 
 
 **``We're going to need a few extra snowballs in case we want some more ammo , '' said Phil as he started walking towards his snow fort . `` I know what you mean,'' replied Martha . She followed behind him and they both went inside their forts . * 
 
 **``Why don't we build our forts a little higher so it will be harder to hit each other ? '' suggested Phil as he started digging around in the snow with his hands . He was going to make two large mounds of snow and put them together to make one big snow fort that would have tall walls . * 
 
 **``Okay , sounds like a great idea ! We're almost finished anyway so let me help you .'' replied Martha as she walked over to him and began helping him dig. They both made two large mounds of snow, put them together to make one big fort , then stood back for a moment while they admired their work . 
 
 **``So what are we going to do now ? '' asked Phil after he finished admiring the size and shape of his snow fort . `` I was thinking that since it's so cold out here today maybe we should throw some snowballs at each other instead of building bigger ones,'' said Martha with a smile on her face . * 
 
 **``I think you have a point , '' replied Phil as he walked over to where his snow fort was and began throwing snowballs in different directions . He kept making larger piles of snow for his next throw until he had a huge ball of snow that looked like it could crush a car ! `` This one looks like it might hit your dad's house ,'' he said with a laugh . 
 
 **``We can try to make our next snowball bigger than this one,'' she replied as Phil walked over to where his mom was standing and started making another huge ball of snow for the next throw . * 
 
 **``Let's see who can build a better fort , '' said Martha with her arms folded across her chest . She ran up to Greg ' s house and began building her own large mound of snow while Phil stood there watching her work on his next throw . He had already made two huge balls of snow by this time but he wasn't going to stop until one was bigger than hers ! * 
 
 **``You know , I think you have a point , '' said Greg as they walked outside into the cold air again . `` Maybe we should just throw some snowballs at each other instead of building bigger ones .'' He then ran over to where his son and Martha were standing and began throwing snowballs in different directions himself . * 
 
 **``Let ' s go inside for lunch , '' suggested Phil as he walked towards their fort with a big smile on his face . They all walked back into the house and sat down at their dining room table , where they enjoyed lunch together before saying goodbye to each other when it was time for them to leave . 
 
 **``We had a great afternoon today , '' said Greg as he watched Martha walk out of his house after dinner with her son beside her . `` I'm so glad you two came over here today ! '' replied Phil . He walked back into the kitchen and started cleaning up their dishes while Martha put on her coat before leaving for home too. * 
 
 **``I had a wonderful time today , '' said Martha as she stood outside Greg ' s house with her son beside her . She smiled at them both before walking down the stairs and back into her car . They watched her drive away until she was gone from sight forever . *
