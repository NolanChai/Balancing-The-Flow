````` That's right. When I was a kid my dad told me the same thing.  But he didn't mean it.  He just wanted me to 
     live at home for free and do his laundry.  So I stayed there, but I kept looking for an apartment in other areas. 
     Finally after three years of living rent-free I found a place near my girlfriend's house so that I could come home
     to her every night before she went to bed. And I have been living here ever since. And I pay rent, and the utilities. 
     This is my home now, Dad.  It may not be the most luxurious place but it's mine. So if you want me out of here -
     then kick me out! Otherwise just shut up about it and let me get some sleep so I can go to work tomorrow. ``
