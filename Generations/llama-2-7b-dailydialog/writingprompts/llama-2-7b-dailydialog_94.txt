One would believe that the development of a multiverse is akin to mitosis, multiplying constantly and encouraging growth. That is wrong. The reality of the situation is that all of the multiverse simply grows into itself, making no new space or creating any more planes of existence. All they do is fill in what already exists, like ants gathering leaves after a storm to prepare for winter.
