The brightness of dawn fills me with a strange sense of joy and dread.
 
 
I look up at the sky as I begin my walk down the sidewalk. The morning is cool, but there's nothing to keep the heat from rising on such a sunny day. I shrug off my jacket and swing it over my arm as I head toward my destination. I don't know why I stopped by here, but I did. It was almost like fate that led me here. 
 
 
I sit down on the park bench and watch a group of people gather around a picnic table. They are laughing loudly as they eat their breakfasts. I don't have anything with which to eat my own food, so I take a seat and observe them instead. There is something comforting about watching other people be happy while you sit on the sidelines. It's like having someone else share your joy with you. 
 
 
I look around at the children playing nearby. They are running to get their parents' attention, calling out for food or a game of catch. I smile as they run off into the distance in search of new adventures. 
 
 
The birds are chirping happily and the air is filled with their song. It reminds me of home. The park was always my favorite place to be when I was younger, because it felt like such a safe place. There were no bullies or mean girls here, just happy people enjoying the day together. 
 
 
I feel an urge to talk with someone about what's bothering me lately and decide to start chatting up random strangers until I find one who will listen to my woes. This is a great idea in theory but not so good in practice. As soon as I approach a couple of women eating their breakfast, they jump up from the table and run off together with their trays full of food. I shake my head at how rude people can be sometimes and head back toward the bench where I was sitting before. 
 
 
I am not sure what is bothering me lately or why I stopped by here, but I know that it had something to do with wanting someone else's attention for once instead of always being on guard against rejection. Maybe if we can get people to listen more often than they run away when trouble arises then maybe this world would be a better place.
