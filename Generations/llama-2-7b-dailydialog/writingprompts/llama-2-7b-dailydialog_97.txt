I looked out my bedroom window and saw your silhouette as you gazed lovingly into the night sky. Your fingers gently ran across the smooth surface of my cheek as you sang to me softly in Spanish. You're so beautiful and I love every single thing about you. You make me feel like the luckiest man in the world, and when you are with me I never want this moment to end.
