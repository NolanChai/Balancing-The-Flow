Kishua never asked to be taken from his village. It was the first time his village had ever had a samurai of its own, and now he was gone. And all because no one in the entire history of the future could learn to play chess with him. He should have known better than to try to teach them; but once again, he was proven wrong.

Kishua sat in his room at the Inn of the Red Lotus. There were few places where a samurai from the past would not be recognized or welcomed by the locals here in the village, and this was one such place. The people knew Kishua, and they loved him. They had seen him become a man here; he had gone from being a boy who didn't know how to hold his sword correctly, to the fiercest warrior that anyone had ever known.

But now, in the room where no one could come close enough to recognize him, Kishua wept for what he had lost. His friends were all here; his wife and son were somewhere nearby. He couldn't see them, but they knew that he was here and they would find him soon enough.

Soon enough, the villagers came through the door with a scroll in their hands. They had brought Kishua the answer to everything: a scroll of instructions for how to get back home again. He laughed at his friends for not thinking that he could figure this out himself; but then he realized what was written on the scroll, and he knew that there would be no more laughter tonight.

Kishua never asked to be taken from his village. But now, in this moment of his greatest sorrow, it is all he can do to wish for a chance to return to the past once again.
