it. It was like a scene out of some B-grade horror movie where we're all getting picked off by some psycho with an axe or something. 
 
 
 I guess it was just me, then. 
 
 
 Oh, you poor thing! You look like hell! Have you been murdered? No wonder everyone is giving us a wide berth. We don't want to get killed by some stupid crow. 
 
 
 Yeah, thanks for the tip. I'll tell my shrink next time we meet up. Maybe he can help me with this. 
 
 
 That's it! Just keep walking, then! Don't let them see you and you should be fine. 
 
 
 Are those crows chasing us? 
 
 
 No, I think they were just curious about us. Or maybe we look tasty to them or something. It must have been the smell of all that rotting meat on our feathers. They can sense it. 
 
 
 Yeah, right! Don't blame me if you get eaten by a bunch of crows. 
 
 
 Easy for you to say! You don't look tasty at all! It's just a good thing we're the only two left. If there had been more of us, they might have gone after me and then they would've attacked you and then . . . oh wait! 
 
 
 Yes, I know what you were about to say. They would have killed me too. It's just that we were the only two left. No one was going to come back for us now. 
 
 
 But even if no one does find out and they let us go, then our feathers will still stink like rotting meat! It'll be a while before I can get rid of that smell from my coat. And yours too . . . 
 
 
 You know what? Let's just forget about it, shall we? We don't want to end up like those poor dead crows out there lying on the side of the road! If you're lucky, someone will find your body in a week or so. By then, they probably won't even know what happened to you . . . 
 
 
 No one is going to want me anymore. I was worth more dead than alive anyways. 
 
 
 Yeah, it's not like there'll be too many people mourning your passing after they find out that you were a murderer who killed dozens of crows! That's what they're going to say, isn't it? "This poor little bird had no choice but to kill the other birds because she was hungry." Yeah right . . . 
 
 
 It doesn't matter. They'll just find out sooner or later anyway . . . 
 
 
 Look! There are still some left! Let's go back and see what we can do for them. We should probably put some of these crows in our nest before they get eaten by a coyote, right? 
 
 
 Yeah, I guess you're right . . . 
 
 
 Oh come on! Don't tell me that you've got a heart too. You want to help out the birds just because there aren't any more of us left? That makes two of us then. Let's go find some more crows before they get eaten by animals or something else . . . 
 
 
 All right, fine! But don't blame me if we end up getting killed again . . . 
 
 
 You think that would stop anyone from coming back and helping us out? Maybe I should just leave you here to die all by yourself. Then when your body is found next week or so no one will know who it belongs to! It'll be like we were never even born . . . 
 
 
 Wait up, you little bugger! You can't do that to me! I wouldn't want my death on your conscience. No way in hell would I let you off the hook for this one! 
 
 
 So how many of us are left now? Just two crows . . . 
 
 
 Yes, just a few more days and we can start thinking about taking over this city again . . . 
 
 
 Hey look out there on that fence post! 
 
 
 What's that? 
 
 
 It's another crow! I think it might be one of those two. He looks pretty sickly so maybe he flew away to get some food or something and got lost along the way . . . 
 
 
 Yes, I think you're right. Let me check his feathers . . . 
 
 
 Hey! You little brat! That was my feather! 
 
 
 Oh no you don't! You think that this is funny or something? 
 
 
 I'll get you for this, you know that?! 
 
 
 Wait a minute . . . hold on just one second here. 
 
 
 Let me see if it's really yours. Okay, here you go . . . yep, there's your name and address on the back of that feather so it must be yours then! 
 
 
 Now let him go or I'll kill him right now! You just wait until we get back to our nest and see what happens when I find out you stole my feathers. 
 
 
 What do you mean by that? I didn't take it, I found it . . . 
 
 
 Yeah right! How did this feather end up in your possession then? Don't give me that BS about finding it on the ground or something because we all know better than to fall for such a trick. You're trying to get out of trouble again, aren't you? I can see right through your lies! 
 
 
 No wait! I swear I didn't take that feather from him. It was on the ground next to where we were standing and when he was talking about his nest I picked it up . . . 
 
 
 Don't give me that crap again! You must be a thief or something if you can't even admit what happened here today. This is just one more example of why people hate birds like us . . . 
 
 
 I didn't steal it, I swear to god . . . 
 
 
 No matter how hard you try to convince me otherwise, there will always be doubt in my mind that you stole this feather from him. You see what kind of person we have here? He thinks nothing about taking other people's things when they're not looking! If he can do it to us then imagine what else could happen if we were left alone with no one watching over us . . . 
 
 
 That is not true. I did not steal that feather from him and I am not a thief! Why would you even suggest such a thing? You know nothing about me or my character so how do you expect me to trust you when we are talking about important things like this one here . . . 
 
 
 If anyone is lying it's you, not me. I never said anything about taking the feather from him! It was on the ground next to where he was standing and that's all there was to it . . . 
 
 
 Okay fine! Let me take a look at this one too then. That will prove once and for all whether or not you are lying . . . 
 
 
 Yes, yes! I am telling the truth. I swear on my life that I did not steal anything from him . . . 
 
 
 Hold it right there. I'll be back in a second after checking this one out as well . . . 
 
 
 Wait up! What are you doing? We don't have all day here, you know? Let me check that feather myself and see if he is telling the truth or not . . . 
 
 
 I swear to god if you touch this one too then there will be hell to pay. You do not have my permission to take it from him either because that would also mean taking something that belongs to another crow without his consent . . . 
 
 
 All right, okay! Now just hold on a second here . . . 
 
 
 Look! It's the same address and name as before. You really are lying aren't you? How could this possibly be any different than what happened when we first got here today then? I don't believe anything that comes out of your mouth anymore so why should he believe in it either . . . 
 
 
 Let go of me, you little jerk! You think that this is funny or something? Well just wait until next time because there will be a next time and when I get my hands on you again then watch out! You won't know what hit you so watch yourself now . . .
