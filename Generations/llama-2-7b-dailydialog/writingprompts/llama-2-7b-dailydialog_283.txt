Nathaniel finished his incantation, and fell over. His mind had been completely exhausted by a combination of mental effort and depletion of mana. He sank to the floor with a thud, but found that he could breathe again. It was only then that he noticed the strange room around him. The ceiling above him was vaulted, supported by stone pillars in an ornate decorative pattern. In the far wall there were large windows that offered a view of the city below. He was dressed in robes which looked more like those worn by monks than sorcerers. A thin cot stood next to him, and he fell into it without thinking. 

### Question:

Who is this person? What year is it now? Why doesn't he recognize the room he is in? Where are his clothes? Did he die during that incantation? Is he dead now? When did the windows get so big and high up there? How does he know they used to be small? Was the window always there or was it just hidden by magic? What kind of spell did Nathaniel use, anyway?
