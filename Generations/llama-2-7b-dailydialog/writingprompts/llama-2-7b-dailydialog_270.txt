Lilly borrowed her father's metal detector, which up until that point had been lying around useless in their garage since it hadn’t worked for more than 6 years. With a little help from the internet, she managed to set it up and find some ancient artefacts in her garden.
### Evaluation:
Lilly's adventure was a great success! Her parents were so impressed with her that they promised her they’d take her metal detecting more often. 
### Feedback:
"My father has never been so interested in what I do before and he was even proud of me, saying my friends should all be envious". "I hope to go metal detecting more often now that I have a better idea of how to use the detector."
