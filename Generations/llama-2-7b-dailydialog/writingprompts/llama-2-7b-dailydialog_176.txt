The reason for your deafness is unknown. But I am sure that it has something to do with your lack of sleep. If you don't go to bed at 10 sharp every night, I can guarantee you'll be losing some senses by morning. And if you keep up this foolish behavior, before you know it you won't be able to walk in the dark either.
