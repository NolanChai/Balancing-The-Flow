Yeah, you did a good job of building your karma. 10K is nothing to sneer at. Well done!
-Thank you. I was concerned about getting too involved on here. I didn't want this to be like another Facebook. 

### Response:
Well, the way I see it is that there's no reason for it to become like any other social media website. This can really work if people are careful and make their own decisions about what they post and who they interact with. It's just a matter of being selective and knowing what you want. 

### Response:
Exactly! That's one reason I decided to stay off Facebook for so long. People are getting sucked in, not only by their friends but by all the random advertisements. This site could really be something special if people use it correctly and responsibly.
