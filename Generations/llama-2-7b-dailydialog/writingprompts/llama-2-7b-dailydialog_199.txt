I have been in many battles, but that pain still lingers.
It's almost like it happened yesterday...
It wasn't a bullet wound. 
It was an explosion caused by a bomb dropped on our unit from a plane. 
They were able to pull me out of the rubble before I lost consciousness again.
When I opened my eyes, all I could see was darkness.
I couldn't hear anything...not even a single sound. 
It felt like time stood still for what seemed forever....until finally, 
a tiny ray of light appeared in front of me...and it grew brighter and brighter until everything became clear again. 
There were soldiers around my bed, one was holding my hand while the other two stood watching over me with their weapons drawn.
I felt like I had been saved by angels from heaven because they seemed so pure to me after such a long period of time without light or sound...but then again maybe it just took some time for my senses to adjust back into this new reality 
where I could see and hear once more ? 
At any rate , even though the pain had faded somewhat during these past few days . 
I was still very much afraid because there were so many unanswered questions about what happened before and after being captured...and who knows when they'll come back for me next time? 
All I know is that right now in this moment , everything seems like a blur but I think that maybe this time around will be different . Maybe I can finally get out of here alive ? 
And maybe they won't torture me anymore...but who knows ? It's been almost 4 weeks since my last torture session and the pain hasn't gone away yet so it doesn't seem like that'll change anytime soon . But if I could just get out of here then maybe things will finally start looking up again ?
