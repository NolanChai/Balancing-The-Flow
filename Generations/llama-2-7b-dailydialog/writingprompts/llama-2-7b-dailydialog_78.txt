in black leather pants and a white shirt with red lacing, he wore a large belt adorned by various knives, his hair was dark and curly as if he had spent many hours styling it. On his face, he bore a menacing expression as the cold glares of his eyes fell upon each person in the room. Some customers began to tremble at just the sight of this man before him; Agatha stared into those eyes with an almost unnerving calmness for such a frightening creature. The rest of the people in the salon gasped again as she stood up and waved her hand dismissively, "Sir, if you would kindly step out side." she said firmly but not raising her voice; the man scowled at her before he turned around and left the room without another word. Agatha sighed in relief as the others stared on her for a few moments more before they resumed their conversation amongst themselves, which was interrupted by one of the girls who had been talking to the man earlier, "Hey, you should have seen his eyes; I'm sure he could kill anyone if he wanted!" she exclaimed. Agatha looked at her and said with a smile, "Don't be ridiculous! He's just another customer." The other girl raised an eyebrow in response before going back to work on the client beside her.
