The wind tugged at his hair almost playfully as he stood quietly surveying the battlefield. There was, in truth, not much left to survey. His victory had been complete, his force overwhelming, his fury unquenchable. There had been no survivors of that bloody battle and thus, it was with a satisfied air that he began walking back towards the fort. It wasn’t often that someone managed to defeat him, and he couldn’t help but feel proud of himself.
