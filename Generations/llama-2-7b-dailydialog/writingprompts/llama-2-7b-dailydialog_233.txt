*Gulp!* 
 
 There is no way you're gonna get in and out of this thing without getting eaten alive. 
 
 Really? I bet I could if I wanted to. 
 
 Well, let me make sure I understand what you just said... You *want* to get killed by a monster inside the portal? 
 
 Of course not! I'm just saying that it seems like you're not worried about this at all. That doesn't seem right. 
 
 Well, if I really wanted to die, I could always just take off my armor and stand still in front of the monsters. 
 
 What? No! You can't just walk into an open portal without any protection! That is insane! 
 
 How else are you going to get new stuff if you don't explore? 
 
 Hey, we should take a look at this place together so that I know how far I can go. I really need some extra stuff for my armor. 
 
 All right. But just stay close by and wait for me when it gets too dangerous. And make sure to bring a healer with us. 
 
 Fine, but remember: no adventuring without me! You don't know what you're doing in here. I do. 
 
 It's not that I can't get through the dungeon on my own, but it'll be easier if we have more people and more gear. 
 
 But you haven't even installed all of the protection stuff yet! You need to finish before we go in! 
 
 Really? Why don't I just leave that for later then. We can do this now. It should be safe if I have my armor on, right? 
 
 ...Okay, fine. But you still have to get a healer with us. 
 
 Good. Let's go! 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 Okay, let's do this. 
 
 Fine, if it will help me relax I guess I can sit next to my gear for a bit. But don't get any ideas about me leaving it in here while I try exploring alone! I need all the stuff I have for protection and healing! 
 
 You should know by now that I would never leave you alone if there are monsters around. It's just not my style. Besides, with you out of the way, I can get some really cool items without competition from you. 
 
 But those things take time to craft and are hard to find! If we wait for them then we won't have enough gear to survive in this place! 
 
 Don't worry about it, okay? Just sit down by your stuff so that I can get started on the installation. 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 Fine... But remember what you said: if there are any monsters around, we won't leave my stuff here for even a minute. 
 
 Okay, I promise. Now be quiet and let me work! I don't want to hear any complaining while I finish up the installation. 
 
 Yeah, yeah... You've said that before. 
 
 All right, you can start talking again now. 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 Okay, fine. But you have to stop talking about leaving me here alone if there are any monsters around! 
 
 No problem. I promise: no more talk of leaving me alone in a dungeon with all the monsters. 
 
 Good. Now let's get started before we lose our chance to explore this place for free stuff. 
 
 Okay, fine. *Sigh.* 
 
 What are you still complaining about? We're already in! 
 
 Great! I knew that this would be easy without you freaking out all the time. 
 
 You know what else is easy? The ability to get new items just by logging on and playing games. But it takes a lot of work to obtain them. 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 What are you sighing about again? 
 
 I'm not complaining! Just remember that if there are any monsters around then we have to get my stuff out and stay away from all the danger! 
 
 We have been through this before, haven't we? This is our plan: as soon as it gets dangerous or we find a new item of interest, then I'm going to take off running with my armor on. If any monsters try to attack me then you will run away too and leave me behind so that they can eat me alive! 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 This plan has never been tested in real life, but it seems like a good one to me. 
 
 Okay, I'm just saying we should be careful if you insist on leaving your stuff here alone while the monsters are around. But that's enough complaining for now: let's get started! 
 
 Fine, but remember what we agreed on. If anything happens to me, you run away and don't look back! 
 
 Got it? I promise. Now let's get going before this thing gets closed down again! 
 
 Okay, fine... *Sigh.* 
 
 Let's go! 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 All right then... We better hurry though or else we won't have enough time to explore everything in here. 
 
 No problem. You don't need to be afraid of me, I will never let you down again when there are monsters around! 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 What is it this time? Are you worried about your armor getting eaten up by a bunch of hungry monsters? 
 
 No... Just relax. We've got this place locked down tight enough for even the most dangerous creatures to be afraid of us! And besides, there aren't any monsters around anyway--you can feel it yourself if you try hard enough! 
 
 I don't want to risk losing anything valuable because some crazy person decides they need my armor more than me. 
 
 All right then... Let's just get going so that we can find the items of interest in here as quickly as possible before the portal closes again! 
 
 Got it? Now let's go! 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 Okay, fine. But remember what I said about not leaving me alone with all these hungry monsters if there are any around! 
 
 No problem. You have nothing to worry about as long as we stick together and keep our eyes open for anything out of the ordinary! Now let's get going before this place closes down on us again! 
 
 All right, fine... *Sigh.* 
 
 Okay, I'm ready to go now. Are you coming? 
 
 Yes, yes... Let's go then! 
 
 *Sigh.* 
 
 We should be careful though since there aren't any monsters here yet--you can feel it yourself if you try hard enough! 
 
 Okay, fine. I promise not to leave my stuff behind while the monsters are around like last time... But only if we take off running when they attack me again.
