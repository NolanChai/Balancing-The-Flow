representative replied. `` That's right. They are yours, sir. There's nothing we can do about that. ''  
  Santa raised his eyes to meet the man's gaze for a brief moment before lowering them again, then he said quietly, `` I don't believe you...''  
  The representative raised an eyebrow, looking puzzled at first, and then suddenly understanding. His brow furrowed with a scowl as he spoke, `` Ohhh...'' then, noticing the crate of toys sitting nearby, he turned back to Santa, saying in a sarcastic tone, `` I'm sorry you feel that way, Mr. Claus, but there is nothing we can do about it. If you really think about it, though, this could be a great opportunity for you. You know, most people would pay good money for these things nowadays...''  
  Santa's eyes narrowed to slits and he glared at the man before saying, `` I don't care if they're worth a million dollars! They're not staying here! Now take them away and stop bothering me! ''  
  The representative shook his head and said, `` You know what? Fine. Then we'll have no trouble getting you to sign the papers we need for that, now will we?'' he asked with an edge of malice in his voice.  
  Santa shot up from his chair again as if on springs, leaning over the desk and pointing a finger directly at him. `` I said take them away!'' he barked. The representative shook his head and laughed a little. `` Come on, Mr. Claus, '' he replied. `` You know you don't have to be rude about it... '' 
  Santa clenched his jaw tightly in frustration, then slowly slid back into his chair and sat down as he spoke. `` Take them away,'' he said again, sounding more weary than angry this time.  
  The representative nodded with a smirk before turning to one of the two men standing at the side of Santa's desk holding a large tarp-covered crate. He turned and pointed toward it, saying, `` Here you go...''  
  As the representative led his men away from Santa's office and into another room, they continued their discussion in hushed voices as Santa sat alone, staring at the doorway through which they had passed. Then a sharp knock on the door interrupted him and he jumped up with renewed vigor to answer it. He was surprised when he looked through the peep hole and saw that it wasn't an employee this time, but a familiar face instead - Mrs. Claus!  
  She stepped inside quickly and closed the door behind her with a firm click before she turned around to face him again. Santa had not seen her since the previous night when they were arguing over the fate of their elves and he hadn't really wanted to, either. But now that she was here, all he could think about was apologizing for his bad temper earlier... 
  `` Are you okay?'' she asked, staring at him intently with a worried look on her face. He nodded in reply, though it wasn't quite the apology he had hoped to give her yet - maybe later when they were alone together again? She smiled gently before saying, `` It ' s all right... I understand that you don't want any of those elves around anymore after what happened last night. But can't we find a way to keep them safe anyway? '' 
  Santa shrugged his shoulders and said, `` No offense to you or your friends , Mrs . Claus , but I really just don ' t see why they have to stay here when there are so many other places where they would be better suited...''  
  She shook her head again with another sad smile on her face as she replied, `` But those aren't safe places either! They were all sent away because of what happened last night too. We need them more than ever before now - you know that, don't you? '' 
  Santa took a deep breath and ran a hand through his hair while he thought about it some more. `` You ' re right , '' he said finally with a reluctant grin. `` I guess they will have to stay here after all...''  
  She smiled again as she replied, `` Thank you for understanding , Santa! It means a lot to me that you agreed...'' then she added quickly before turning away from him again with her smile fading slightly, `` But don't worry about it too much - we ' re going to make sure they ' re safe here anyway. So just relax and go ahead with whatever else needs doing today. '' 
  Santa nodded again as he watched Mrs . Claus walk away from him once more before heading towards one of the other rooms in which many of their elves had gathered together for some kind of meeting or gathering - it seemed like there was always something going on around here these days! But no matter what happened, he knew that all would work out eventually if only because Mrs . Claus had faith in him...
