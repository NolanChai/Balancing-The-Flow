 “ It’s just an experiment to test how we sound on the radio and over a phone line.” 
 
 “ Shit, I hate you already. You know that?” 
 
 “ Listen, why don’t you give it another shot and get back to me if you have any more problems with it ? ” 
 
 “ Okay , I’m giving it a chance . I don’t know how much longer though.” 
 
 “ Well then , it would be better for you not to try if that’s the way you feel about it. We can always record something else tomorrow morning.” 
 
 “ No, we should keep this one in there just as a backup. Just in case we have technical difficulties with the other one.” 
 
 “ Okay , I guess it is worth it.” 
 
 “ Good . I’ll let you know what to do when you get back here .” 
 
 “ Alright , I’m going now, bye.” 
 
 “ Bye, we’ll see you then.” 
 
 “ Take care.” 
 
 “ Bye.” 
 
 “ See you later.”
