A small shop in a small town. 
`` you must have been crazy to buy here , '' said one of his employees. 
 He knew she was right; there were other places he could have set up business. 
But there were no other vacancies . 
So he was stuck with this place: a shop that had once been a florists and before that a general store. 
He still didn't know what to sell in it. 
 He tried selling fishing tackle, then clothing for farmers, then toys for kids; each idea failed. 
 Then he gave up trying to think of any more ideas and just stocked the shelves with anything at all. 
`` we're going broke here , '' he said as he sat in his office one day, looking at a ledger that had gone from black to red. 
 He couldn't believe how many mistakes he made; but every time he tried something new, the customers walked out on him. 
It seemed like they didn't want anything. `` We don't know what we're after , '' said one of his employees, a boy named Tom who worked in the store for two dollars an hour. 
 It was true; everyone in this town had nothing to do but sit around and watch the grass grow. 
 That's all they did: sat around and watched the grass grow. 
 `` we need more customers , '' said Greg. 
 `` that's what i say , '' said Tom. 
 Then Tom spoke up: he was a boy with an idea . 
 He had been thinking about this problem for some time; he even kept a little notebook and made diagrams to show how it worked. 
 In his book he wrote down the names of all the people who passed in front of the shop, but he also added their ages and what they were interested in . 
 He saw that most of them had no idea what they were looking for; they just walked by with nothing in their hands. 
 But some did buy things: these people knew exactly what they wanted. 
 He figured out a way to make more customers, but he was too shy to tell his boss . 
 One day, after Tom had been working at the shop for almost two years, Greg noticed that something strange was going on outside the store. 
There were people standing in front of their houses , holding things up and looking at them. 
 Greg wondered why they didn't just go inside and buy the stuff . 
 `` don't worry about it , '' said Tom, who had seen him watching the customers. 
 `` we're making more money than ever before now.'' 
 Then he explained how his idea worked . It was simple: when a customer wanted something but couldn't think of what they needed, he just looked into their eyes and tried to see what they were thinking about. If he could see it clearly enough, the person would buy one of those items from the shop window. 
 `` we've sold so many more things since i started doing this , '' said Tom . 
 `` i feel like a mind reader .'' 
 Greg was impressed with his employee; and even though he thought the whole thing sounded ridiculous, it turned out to be true. 
Tom could actually see into people's minds ! He could see their deepest desires , all those dreams they had buried long ago , the things they wished for in secret . 
`` how can you do this?'' Greg asked him one day as he watched Tom reading a customer's mind. 
 `` i don't know, '' said Tom, shrugging his shoulders and looking away. 
But it didn't matter whether Tom could see the person's desire or not; all that mattered was what the customer wanted to buy . And then he bought something from their shop. 
That is how this place turned a profit: by letting customers come in and show off everything they owned before buying anything else . 
 It worked so well that Greg didn't know what to do with all the extra money; so he decided not to worry about it until later when he was ready . 
 `` i am very grateful to you , '' said Greg as Tom left for his vacation at last. 
 They shook hands before going their separate ways : one back into the shop and another out of town. 
 It didn't seem like a big deal, but it had been an important job: he was a mind reader . And now that he knew how to do this , there would always be more work for him somewhere else in the world . 
`` i will miss you , '' said Greg as he watched Tom drive off into the distance. `` But don't worry; we will meet again one day .''
