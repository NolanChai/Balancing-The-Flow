`` Congratulations, Lily! ''  
 
 Thanks a bunch, Paul! You were a big help last night. I don't know how I would have gotten through all those phone calls without you. 
 
 It was my pleasure to be there for you. I'm so happy for you. This is going to change your life. 
 
 So, what are you planning to do with it? 
 
 Well…I am pretty sure that I want to buy a new car first of all. And I was thinking maybe invest in some stocks. Do you know anything about the stock market? 
 
 Yes, actually, my family has invested quite a bit in mutual funds and other things over the years. 
 
 That's great! Do you think I should get an attorney? 
 
 Absolutely. You need to protect your money from yourself as much as anybody else. A good attorney can also help you plan for how to spend that money wisely so it will last a long time. 
 
 Yes…I want my children to have the best life possible, but I don't want to be one of those old ladies who loses all her money on bad investments and ends up living in poverty. You know what I mean? 
 
 Yes, of course. It would be a tragedy for anyone to see that happen. Let me make you an appointment with my father's lawyer this afternoon so we can go over your options together. 
 
 That would be great, Paul. Thank you. You're such a good friend! ''  
 
 I'm glad I could help you in some way, Lily. It was my pleasure. Now don't forget to call me if you need anything.
