I used to live near there in a suburb named after a famous general who was born nearby. I think he's buried here, but I can't be sure. This place is a small town with a large church. There are only five or six houses here, and the road seems deserted as I walk down it towards the end of this street. As I approach an intersection I see a small house to my left with some laundry out on the clothes line. A little further up there's another small house that looks like its abandoned.
