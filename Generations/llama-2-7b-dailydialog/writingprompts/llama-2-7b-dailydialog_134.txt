''Yeah, sure you will. When was the last time any of them ever killed anything?'' I looked around at the people in the store and spotted a few familiar faces that made me smile. I'm glad they didn't say it out loud because they would have been in for a lot of teasing and maybe a beating or two if I had. It's always funny to see people get their comeuppance.
