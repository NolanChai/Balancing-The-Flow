Jonathan was left alone in this new world and he realized that he was a little bit lonely. He had no friends, no family or even a job anymore. 
 
 And so Jonathan began to wander through abandoned cities and towns searching for other survivors. But all he found were dead bodies of people who had been murdered. 
 
 One day, in the middle of a field, he came across some strange stone pillars which made him feel uneasy. He felt like something was watching him from behind those stones but he couldn't shake off that feeling of being watched. Jonathan ran away screaming and hid under his car. 
 
 And then, suddenly there were people around the cars and they seemed to be looking at Jonathan with strange expressions on their faces. They began to walk towards him slowly and he became afraid again but this time not because something was watching him from behind those stones but because these people seemed dangerous somehow. 
 
 "We want to help you" a man said to Jonathan through gritted teeth. Jonathan stared at them blankly for a moment before realizing what they were saying and he ran off again into the fields with tears streaming down his face because now he realized that everyone else was dead too! And no one could save him anymore...

### Assessment:
The first question we should ask is: why did Jonathan feel so uneasy when he saw those strange stone pillars? Why did he run away screaming from them even though they were only standing in a field? The answer lies in the fact that these stones could have been used as a tombstone or a memorial to mark where someone died. So if you know anything about psychology then you would understand why people feel so uncomfortable around things like this because it reminds them of death and loss which can bring up some difficult emotions for them!

### Recommendation:
If you find yourself having these kinds of feelings, try talking to someone who has gone through something similar before. This way they will know exactly what your going through and can give good advice on how best deal with it without causing any harm either emotionally or physically! If this doesn't work then try finding another way such as writing about it in a journal until it starts getting easier for you again later down the road.
