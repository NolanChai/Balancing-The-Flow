This shop is mine. It was my mother's, her father's, and a two tongued witch's beforehand but I do n't want to remember the story she told me. I sell what I can and I buy what I need. I basically just trade goods for services or money.

### Explanation:

When someone says 'my shop is mine', it means that he owns the shop.
