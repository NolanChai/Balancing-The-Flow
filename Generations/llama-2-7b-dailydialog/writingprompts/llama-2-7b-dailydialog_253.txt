`` We all know what's wrong with you Troy! You just lost the love of your life! How could you possibly think that cheering up is going to do any good?'' 
 
`` Yes, but...'' I hesitated. ``I want to see her again. '' 
 
 `` No way pal! You can't be thinking about that right now. She's gone forever Troy. Forgive me for being blunt, but you gotta get over it.'' 
 
`` But I don't understand... How could she just walk out of my life? Just leave me here to rot like some rotten fruit? What the hell did I do wrong? Why couldn't she just explain herself? Explain her actions! I mean, she's a good girl Troy. She would never just leave you like this without an explanation for everything that has happened.'' 
 
`` What are you saying?'' I stammered as my body began to tremble with anger and emotion. ``That it was me all along? That the problem is me, isn't it? '' 
 
The crowd grew silent at once, and the man who spoke before shook his head. ``No Troy. The problem has been you for a long time, but that isn't what I mean. I think...'' He stopped and looked down at his feet. ``I think that the problem was me all along.'' 
 
``What are you talking about? What is the problem now? You're my friend! How could it possibly be you? '' My mind whirled as thoughts of doubt and confusion began to flood in and I knew exactly what he meant. It was me that had always been the problem all along. I wasn't good enough for her, and she knew that. That was why she left. She couldn't take it anymore, and now I was sitting here like a sad, old dog in a dog pound wondering what happened to her as if I could find her there, and if I did, would I even be able to speak to her? 
 
 ``Yes! Yes Troy. You have been the problem all along. She knew it, and she didn't want you to ever know that she left because of you...and she couldn't tell you so she had no choice but to leave you alone forever.'' The crowd began to clap as I shook my head in disbelief. 
 
``It isn't true! It can't be! She loved me and I loved her! What the hell? You said that was what we all wanted to hear, and now it turns out she just wants to get away from me. That is bullshit man! If that were true then why did she ever even meet with me in the first place? Why did she bother getting involved with me if I was so lousy at being a boyfriend anyway? '' 
 
``But Troy, she knew all along that it wouldn't work.'' The crowd continued to cheer and shout as I grew angrier and angrier. ``It wasn't your fault man! It was her problem. She had to get away from you. You see, the only thing we want for ourselves is someone to love us unconditionally. That is what everyone wants in this world Troy: someone who loves them unconditionally. Unfortunately, we all have flaws that prevent us from ever reaching that goal. 
 
``But it isn't always our faults that keep us from being loved and cared for like we want to be. It could just as easily be the things we don't know about ourselves that keeps us away from other people, because we aren't really aware of them in the first place.'' He began to pace around in circles as I stared at him dumbfounded and speechless. 
 
 ``But what is this? What do you mean by... '' My voice trailed off as he continued speaking. 
 
``You see, Troy. She left because she knew that even if we had been together, there was no way for us to be happy in the end. I know it sounds harsh and cruel, but we weren't meant to be with each other forever and ever as you wanted. We weren't supposed to be married until death do us part either...or at least not yet anyway. 
 
``You see Troy, she left because she loved me, but not in the way I needed her too. She loved me enough to make it clear that we were never meant to stay together, and even if you tried hard enough to change that fact about yourself...'' His voice began to crack as he choked on his words. ``You would still end up hurting her, because she knew that even though I love you Troy, deep down inside I am not the kind of man who can stay with a woman forever. She saw it in my eyes when we first met and talked to each other for hours upon hours about our future together. It wasn't going to happen. She understood what she needed to do to protect herself from someone like me.'' 
 
``But...but you said I was good enough for her! '' I tried desperately not to let my emotions get the best of me, but it was impossible to stop myself as the crowd began cheering louder than ever and a few people started crying in their seats. 
 
``You see Troy? You are more than good enough for her...but you just don't know how much you are worth. She knew that she could never live without me because we were made to be together forever, but at the same time it would have been impossible for us to stay happy as a couple if we had been married for years and years and I was still stuck in my ways with no desire or ability to change them. 
 
 ``But you don't see that Troy...and that is why she left. She knew that even though you love her deeply, the fact remains that no matter how hard you try you will always be a person who wants what he can't have and isn't willing to change in order to get it. 
 
``And you see Troy...that is okay...because she loves you enough not to hurt herself by being with someone like you, so she had to leave before either of us got too badly wounded or destroyed each other completely.'' The crowd began to chant and clap as I felt my face begin to burn with rage. 
 
 ``No! No Troy...you see, I am just the one who needs her the most. She needs me enough to want to protect herself from people like you, but at the same time she loves me so deeply that even though we aren't meant to be together forever and ever as a married couple...we still love each other with all of our hearts and minds in spite of the fact that we will never have what we both dreamed about.'' 
 
``What are you saying? I don't understand! How could she love me enough to leave me if she knew it would destroy me? That makes no sense at all! '' My voice broke as my eyes began to water with tears of sadness and frustration, because even though I wanted him to be wrong about her...I just couldn't help but believe that he was right. 
 
 ``She loves you enough for both of us Troy. She is the only one who knows what it means for two people to truly love each other and not want to change anything about themselves or their lives because they are afraid if they do then things will never be perfect again in spite of all the good times we had together.'' The crowd grew silent once more, but I could tell that they were thinking exactly as he said they should: ''She loves you Troy. She just wanted to spare you from yourself and your problems because she knew how much it hurt you when people left you without saying why or giving any explanations at all...but she loved you enough not to let herself get away with doing that.'' 
 
``But what if I had told her that? What if I had said I wasn't good enough for her, and then maybe she would have changed her mind and stayed with me instead of leaving like this without giving any explanation at all? '' My voice trailed off as the crowd began to shout louder than ever before. 
 
 ``That is what you need to know Troy...she isn't staying because you made her leave, she was just too afraid and too ashamed of herself to tell you how she really felt about our future together. But if she had been strong enough then we would have gotten married and lived happily ever after the way that you wanted us too.'' The crowd cheered loudly as they all began to stand up and start walking toward the door while I sat there with my head in my hands and tears rolling down my face. 
 
 ``But what if it doesn't work? What if our relationship falls apart anyway, even though we get married and have children together? '' I asked desperately as he continued to pace back and forth across the stage in front of me. 
 
``She knows that you will be with her through everything Troy...and even if it does happen then she will still love you no matter what because she is strong enough to handle anything life throws at her. She has a strength about her that will never let go of anyone who loves
