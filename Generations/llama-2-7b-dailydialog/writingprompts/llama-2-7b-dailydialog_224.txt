`` Oh, yeah...I am sorry. So what do we do now? '' 
 
 
 `` Do now ? Nothing . This is Hell. We do nothing. If you must know, I was reading this book about the history of Christianity in China and how they finally converted to Catholicism.'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Wow...that ' s a really interesting subject. What made them convert? '' 
 
 
 `` It is called ' The Last Missionary: A True Story of Heroism in the Collapse of China' by Peter Hessler, if you are interested . I also have some books on Islamic and Jewish history too. '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Oh yeah ? You do? What kind of stuff is that about? '' 
 
 
 `` That ' s an interesting question. We will discuss it another time . Now, what should I be doing while we are here in Hell?'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` I guess...nothing . Can't you just sit there and think about all the wrong things that I did to get myself into this situation ? '' 
 
 
 `` Not really. I already have a pretty good idea of what I should ' ve done differently, but I can not change any of it.'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Oh...so you think that there is no hope for me? '' 
 
 
 `` Of course there is hope . You just have to be willing to look at yourself and ask God to forgive you for your sins.'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Well, I am already a Christian. I know that Jesus died for my sins and rose again three days later. Isn ' t that good enough? '' 
 
 
 `` I guess so , but it will be up to you if you want to ask Him for forgiveness or not .'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Oh, alright...I will think about all the bad things that I have done. I am sorry for what I did in life and hope that God will forgive me so that I can go to Heaven.'' 
 
 
 `` Thank you . So , now how are you going to spend eternity? '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Well, I think...I want to read a lot of books about the history of Christianity and Islamic religions. That should keep me busy for a long time.'' 
 
 
 `` A book on every topic? '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Yep, I think so .'' 
 
 
 `` You ' re going to spend eternity doing that ? Why would you want to do that instead of reading about Jesus and what He did for us?'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` I don ' t know. It seems like a good idea . Doing nothing would get really boring after a while. '' 
 
 
 `` Is it too late to repent and turn your life over to Jesus? It is never too late. He loves you no matter what. You can always come back to Him.'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` I don ' t know . I would like to have eternity with God, but...what if it really was Hell ? Then all those books and studying wouldn ' t make a difference.'' 
 
 
 `` Don ' t you want to be with Jesus forever? '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Of course ! But I also like my life on Earth . It is kind of hard to give that up after being here for so long. '' 
 
 
 `` We will talk more about this later . You need to spend some time praying and talking with God about what He wants you to do.'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` OK, I guess that makes sense. Now that I think about it...I was really wrong in what I believed during my life here on Earth . But how can I change things now? '' 
 
 
 `` You just have to accept the fact that you were wrong and ask for forgiveness.'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` OK...I will think about it and get back to you later. I hope it is not too late ?'' 
 
 
 `` Don ' t worry . God loves you no matter what you have done. It can never be too late for Him to forgive you if you ask Him. But don ' t procrastinate. Get with Him soon! '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Alright , I will try and get back to Him as soon as possible. Good-bye !'' 
 
 
 `` Bye . It was nice meeting you.''
