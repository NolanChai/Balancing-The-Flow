( ( Possible trigger warning for sexual abuse. Not graphic, just mentioned ) ) 
 
 I’m sorry to hear that you had to experience such things growing up. My family is pretty much the same, and we always try our best to keep everyone as safe as possible. 
 
 Thank you so much for sharing your story with me! It means a lot that you felt comfortable enough to open up on this topic. 
 
 I hope that everything turns out fine. If not now, then when things get better in the future. 
 
 Again, thank you for being brave and coming to talk to me about it. I know it’s never easy but hopefully talking with someone makes a difference! 
 
 Please feel free to reach back out anytime if you have anything else on your mind that needs discussing. I’m here for you. 
 
 All the best,
