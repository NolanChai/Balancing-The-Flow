I know what it feels like not to be able to afford that music camp, while your neighbours are getting to go every summer, and they make fun of you for being poor all the time. I know it must suck really bad.
 
 Well guess what? I have something for you, and I think that it might help with you situation.
 
 I've always wanted a violin myself but couldn't afford one so my parents got me this instead. They say they don't mind if I play on theirs because it has sentimental value to them anyways. Do you wanna check it out?
 
 Of course! I can't wait to see how good you are, I bet that violin will be perfect for you. You have such an ear for music and I know this is the instrument for you.
 
 I have never seen one in person before so I don't know what it looks like but my friend has a nice one and he says it sounds really good! He has been playing for a long time now so I bet his is great quality too! How much money did your parents spend on this?
 
 Well, they told me that it was worth $500 when new but mine was only $200. So, you can imagine the difference in quality between our two violins. But that's okay because I would rather have an expensive one than a cheap one anyway! Do you play? If not then maybe we should learn together sometime soon - I bet it will be fun to go out on dates and do something new together! 
 
 My mom said she thinks this is my calling. I've wanted to learn how to play for so long and now that she bought me a violin, I don't have any more excuses not to!
 
 Really? That sounds like fun! Where should we start first though because I know nothing about playing eitherâ€¦ maybe just on our own at home would be easiest since there's no pressure or anything?
