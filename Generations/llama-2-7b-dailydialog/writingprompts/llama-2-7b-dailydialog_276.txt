`` Yes, Admiral, but ... ''
 
 *The damn ship is too crowded. There's barely enough room for us. * 
 
 *And the food! What a load of crap they served in the mess hall.* 
 
 *I don't want to be stuck here for four months. * 
 
 *I can't wait to get back into my own bunk. * 
 
 *My ship's much nicer than this one.* 
 
 *This one has a few problems, I'll say that.* 
 
 *It doesn't have the best food in the fleet ... '' The admiral's words trailed off as he reached for his door. * 
 
 *Where are you going?* 
 
 *To my quarters to pack up and leave. I need a place that has some amenities. Good night, Lieutenant.* 
 
 *I understand the sentiment. The food on this ship is awful.* 
 
 *You'll find plenty of room at my house for you to stay.* 
 
 *That would be great! Thank you so much for your kindness.* 
 
 *No problem, Lieutenant. I look forward to seeing you again soon.* 
 
 *I will do the same. Good night and safe travels back home.* 
 
 *Night, Admiral. Have a nice trip back. '' The helmsman's voice was quiet as he exited the bridge. `` Captain?'' 
 
 *Yes, Ensign?* 
 
 *Can you give me some time off in port to visit my family for the holidays?* 
 
 *Of course. We'll dock soon. Just get your gear together and I'll sign off on it.* 
 
 *Thanks, Captain!* The ensign left the bridge as quickly as he could. *Good riddance to him.* 
 
 *I sure hope we can find some good recruits for this ship. We need more like that kid ... and I don't mean you.* 
 
 *Excuse me?* The admiral was getting agitated with the helmsman's attitude. *Is there a problem, Ensign?* 
 
 *No sir! Not at all! Sorry to disturb you.* The ensign tried to salvage his day and apologize for being a bad listener. 
 
 *I appreciate your honesty. It seems like I was just here on the bridge moments ago.'' Admiral Taylor sighed deeply. ``It's been a long night, hasn't it?* 
 
 *Yes sir! Good morning and enjoy the rest of your day.* 
 
 *Thank you, Ensign. Have a nice afternoon. * The admiral exited the bridge to his cabin, which was just down the hall from Lieutenant Commander McCoy's office. *Good morning, Mr. Admiral. * 
 
 *Morning, Mr. McCoy.* He had been in this position for the last ten years and he knew the admiral well enough by now that they could joke around with each other a little bit. *I was hoping I could have some time off to visit my family back home?* The admiral asked politely, knowing how much it meant to McCoy to be in charge of his own ship for four months. 
 
 *You deserve it, sir!'' McCoy nodded with a smile. *Of course you do! What date would you like to leave on?* 
 
 *I'd really like to go back home tomorrow if possible.* He had been away from his family for almost five months and he couldn't wait any longer than that. The admiral knew it was a tough transition but also understood how much of an impact this kind of job could have on the crew members who were used to living in their own homes with families and friends nearby. 
 
 *Of course! I can take care of all the paperwork for you now so that way everything will go smoothly when we dock tomorrow.* McCoy was always on top of his game and made sure every last detail was taken care of before he left for home. The admiral appreciated how well-organized he was and knew that this was going to be a great vacation because he trusted him so much with all the little details involved in running ship life smoothly while he was away from port for four months at sea! *I will get started right away!'' McCoy said as he began making calls back home about where his family would meet him when they arrived tomorrow afternoon.* 
 
 *Thanks again, Mr. McCoy! I really appreciate your help and look forward to spending some quality time with my loved ones after being away from them for so long.* He walked out of the office as soon as he had finished speaking with Lieutenant Commander McCoy on the phone about arranging a meeting place between family members who were going meet him at his parents' home in Virginia Beach later that evening when they arrived back on shore tomorrow afternoon.* 
 
 *Have fun!* The admiral shouted out after him before walking away from his office back down towards where he had parked his car earlier today during work hours yesterday afternoon.* I will miss you all while I am gone.* He waved goodbye as McCoy walked toward him, giving him a salute back in return.* 
 
 *Yes sir! Thank you for everything! It was an honor serving under your command again!* McCoy said before turning around and walking away from the Admiral who had just left his office building on board ship. He then continued down toward where he had parked his car earlier today during work hours yesterday afternoon.* 
 
 *You're welcome! Good luck with everything while I am away for four months at sea tomorrow afternoon until October.* The admiral said before walking away from him, waving goodbye to McCoy as they parted ways on board ship.* 
 
 *Thank you sir!* McCoy replied back in return before walking down the hallway toward where he had parked his car earlier today during work hours yesterday afternoon. He then turned around one last time before getting into his vehicle and driving away from where he had left it earlier today during work hours.* 
 
 *Safe travels!'' The admiral shouted after him as he got back inside his own car before starting up again and driving off in the opposite direction toward his home back on shore.* 
 
 *Thank you sir! Have a great vacation while I am away for four months at sea tomorrow afternoon until October.* McCoy replied back to The Admiral as he drove away from him, turning right onto Main Street before driving down toward where the family members would meet him later that evening when they arrived back on shore after being away from each other for so long. *Have a great time!'' 
 
 *Thanks again Mr. McCoy! I will miss you all while we are gone but it was an honor serving under your command once more!* The admiral replied before waving goodbye and driving off in the opposite direction toward his home back on shore.* 
 
 *Safe travels sir!'' The Admiral shouted after him one last time as he drove away from where they had been talking earlier today during work hours yesterday afternoon. He then continued down toward where he would meet his family members later that evening when they arrived back in town tomorrow afternoon.* 
 
 *Goodbye and have a safe journey!'' The Admiral shouted after him as he drove off in the opposite direction before turning around one last time before getting into his vehicle once more, starting up again and driving away from where he had parked it earlier today during work hours yesterday afternoon.* 
 
 *Thank you sir! Have a nice vacation while I am gone for four months at sea tomorrow afternoon until October.* The Admiral shouted out after him as he drove off in the opposite direction before turning right onto Main Street. He then continued down toward where his family members would meet him later that evening when they arrived back on shore tomorrow afternoon.* 
 
 *You're welcome! Have a nice trip sir!'' McCoy replied back to The Admiral as he drove off in the opposite direction, turning right onto Main Street before driving down toward where his family members would meet him later tonight when they arrive back from being away at sea for four months tomorrow afternoon.* 
 
 *Thank you Mr. McCoy! Have a nice day sir!'' The Admiral shouted after him one last time as he drove off in the opposite direction before turning right onto Main Street.* 
 
 *You're welcome sir!'' McCoy replied back to The Admiral who was driving away from him, heading down toward where his family members would be waiting later tonight when they arrive back on shore tomorrow afternoon after being gone for four months at sea.* 
 
 *Thank you Mr. McCoy! Safe travels and have a good day sir!'' The Admiral shouted out one last time before driving off in the opposite direction toward where his family members would be waiting later tonight when they arrive back on shore tomorrow afternoon after being gone for four months at sea.* 
 
 *Thank you sir! Have a great trip and stay safe while I am away from port for four
