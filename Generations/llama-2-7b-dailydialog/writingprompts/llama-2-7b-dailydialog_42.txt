A:  That was an interesting story. I have never heard of someone getting high for their birthday before. Is that common in this area? B:  Yes, it is pretty common around here. Most people here like to do something different when they turn twenty-five. They usually get drunk or stoned and then go out partying all night. C:  I see. D:  What a great idea! I think that I will take this up next year when I turn twenty-five. E:  Really? You do drugs too? F:  Yeah, but not as much as this guy. G:  Good for you. H:  Did he like it at all? What was his reaction to the birthday celebration? J:  He really liked it. It is something that we are planning on doing every year. K:  I hope you get high again next time around. L:  Thank you. M:  You â€™ re welcome!
