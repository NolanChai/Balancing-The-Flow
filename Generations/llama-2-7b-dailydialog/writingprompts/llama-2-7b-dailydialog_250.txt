The old woman took the letter and looked at it a long time. It had been a very long time since anyone had sent Sarah anything or cared what happened to her. She knew that everyone else in the town thought that she was dead, but they didn't have a clue about how lonely she really was. 
 
She read and reread the letter until she was so happy that her knees almost buckled under her weight. She could hardly believe that someone would be nice enough to send her money to buy some supplies with. She knew that it wasn't much, but at least she could finally have a little something of her own besides Rabecca's books and a few old clothes. 
 
The woman stood up as if in a trance and started walking around the room. There was so much to buy with all this money! She tried to think back on what she really needed. She had very little left from before the plague, and her supplies were getting pretty low. Her first thought was that she would go buy some new clothes; but then she realized that those wouldn't fit any more since she had shrunk so much during her time with Rabecca. 
 
Her mind kept turning over and over until she came up with a solution that made her smile. She could finally finish the book that Rabecca hadn't been able to get to in her last days, and then write one of her own! The thought excited her so much that she started skipping through the house and calling for joy.
