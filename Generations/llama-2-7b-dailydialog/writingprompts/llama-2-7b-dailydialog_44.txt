I was one of his best friends throughout high school and college. I still have the model rocket kits he gave me as gifts when we first met. He could be socially awkward and uncomfortable at times, but we always had a blast together. He was an avid reader who loved to discuss philosophical topics. Our favorite conversation subject revolved around our idea of time travel, which we discussed for hours on end. We would make up elaborate plans about what we would do with all of the opportunities time travel provided.
