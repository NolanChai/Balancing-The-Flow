### Explanation

```
The first line of the dialog is missing a verb. There are at least two options for completing this sentence correctly: `` What a night. '' or `` How long? '' 
`` Christ, '' can only be used with a possessive pronoun; the word `` my '' is the correct choice here. `` I'm having my party outside '' should follow this immediately. Shelly, his best friend's girlfriend, was having her 21st birthday party outside. 
The next sentence should end with a question mark: `` Where can I go? The bar will be closing soon! '' is an acceptable answer to that question. Finally, the last line of dialog should end in quotation marks and be followed by an exclamatory word: `` Christ, what a night,'' Pete mumbled to himself as he splashed water on his face in the bar's bathroom. Shelly, his best friend's girlfriend, was having her 21st birthday party outside. 
`` What a night '' is an acceptable response. The next line should end with an exclamation point: `` How long? '' Shelly said excitedly as she led him out to the street and across it. Pete followed close behind. Shelly, his best friend's girlfriend, was having her 21st birthday party outside.
