Hello, beautiful. 
 Do you have a plan for tonight? 
 I think I’m going to do some online shopping. You know I haven't been able to go out since the pandemic hit. 
 And maybe some reading too! It’s been so long and I’ve gotten behind on my books. 
 I am so happy you are feeling better. 
 Ready for another night alone? I love it when we’re both here, but sometimes it is nice just to have a bit of space. 
 Well, I love you too. It's just that I need to stay here for the duration of this pandemic. I miss you so much. 
 I can't wait until this is all over and we can be together again. You know I’m always thinking about us in bed together, but it isn't the same as being there with you. It would be better if we were there together. 
 Yeah, I agree. It really is much better when we are together. I do miss you so much. 
 Me too. Maybe tomorrow night we can have a special video date? 
 Ok! And then maybe the next day I could come up there to see you in person and spend the entire weekend with you? 
 That sounds amazing! But for now, I am going to go make some dinner and watch a movie. 
 Good night sweetheart! I love you so much. 
 I love you too! See you tomorrow night! 
 Bye bye! 
 I’m still thinking about us last night. It felt so good being able to hold each other, even if it was only in my dreams. 
 Yeah, me too. We are going to have the best time ever when this is over and we can be together again. Until then, I will just keep having these amazing dreams. 
 Hey honey! How'd your day go? 
 My day was great! I did some shopping online and ordered us a new bed from Amazon! You should get here soon so I can put it up in the guest room. We need to spend more time together like this, but we can’t right now due to the pandemic. We have to be careful until it is all over. 
 That sounds amazing! It makes me wish I could be there with you right now! I am missing you so much and I just want to hold you again. You know I'd do anything for you. 
 Yeah, I love you too. I’m glad that I have my pillow now, and it's nice knowing that we are in the same room even if not together at the moment. It helps a little with this crazy situation we find ourselves in right now. I just hope that things get back to normal soon so that I can be there with you all the time. 
 Me too! But until then, these dreams help and they feel real too. In my mind, we are really making love together even though it is only a dream. And your voice and how you sound and smell in my head is enough to make me happy. I love hearing from you every night and the fact that I am going to have a new bed soon makes me happy as well! 
 That's so nice of you honey! The guest room is small, but we will be together there too when this pandemic is over with. 
 Yeah, it might not be ideal but I’m sure it will still feel like home and that makes me feel better about the situation. Just knowing that I am here at all helps my anxiety a lot. Thank you so much for your thoughtfulness! 
 Of course honey! You are always on my mind and I do everything in my power to make you happy even though it's hard when we can’t be together physically right now. 
 It is difficult, but if this keeps us safe from the virus then that makes me feel better about all of this. I love you so much honey! I am going to take a shower and then get ready for bed and we will talk again in the morning! Sweet dreams! 
 Bye bye sweetheart! I love you too and goodnight. See you tomorrow night! 
 Good night sweetheart, I can't wait until this is all over so we can be together again. But for now, it’s nice to hear your voice every day and to know that the next time we speak will be in person. Sleep well! 
 Bye bye honey! Take care of yourself and don't forget to wear a mask when you go outside so as not to catch any germs from other people! I love you too and goodnight! See you tomorrow night! 
 Good night sweetheart! I love you more than anything in the whole world. Sleep well until our next video date then we will be together again soon! Bye bye honey! 
 Goodbye my love, and thank you so much for making this time easier for me. You are everything to me and I can’t wait until things get back to normal. See you tomorrow night! 
 Bye bye sweetheart! Sleep well and don't forget that it is only a matter of days before we are together again. I love you so much, my darling. Goodnight and sleep tight! 
 Good night honey! I love you too and I hope to see you tomorrow night for another virtual date. I can’t wait until things get back to normal so that I can be with you all the time instead of just on video calls. It doesn't feel as good because we aren’t able to physically hold each other right now, but it does help me a little bit and makes me happy knowing that there is something between us that isn’t just in our minds or dreams alone. 
 Goodbye honey! I will talk with you tomorrow night then see you soon. Sleep tight and stay safe sweetheart! I love you! 
 Good night my love! Thank you so much for being there during this time when we can't physically be together because of the pandemic. I know it is hard on both of us but at least we have each other now through video calls and chats online so that we are still connected even if not in person right now. See you tomorrow night then until then my love! Take care of yourself and stay safe too! 
 Goodbye honey! I can't wait to see you again soon and hold you in my arms just like old times before all of this happened! Bye bye sweetheart, sleep tight and don't forget that we will be together again very soon. Sweet dreams until tomorrow night!
