I didn ’ t know it would be such a big deal. You were so small then, with all those curly black hairs on your head. But you are now my little princess . What a wonderful time we had ! I can ’ t wait for us to be together again, and soon. The world is waiting for us. We will conquer it . I love you, Maestro.
