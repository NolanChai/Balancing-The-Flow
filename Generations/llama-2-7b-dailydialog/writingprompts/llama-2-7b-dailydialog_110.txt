I hate them too. 
 
 It is their fault that we are stuck here in this stupid research lab and they haven't even bothered to tell us what we have to do yet. 
 
 But we're not alone, there are 10 others with me, all of us given a room each. Except it feels more like a cage than a room, it's so small. And I miss my family! They promised they'd come for me tomorrow though, so that makes me feel better. 
 
 At least it gives me something to look forward to. 
 
 Well, actually... not really. 
 
 It's only one room and there are about 20 of them, we're going to be here for a while! 
 
 Still, at least we know that our families will come for us sometime soon. They can't stay away from their children forever, right? And I can't wait to see my dad again after all this time! He'll be so proud of me and happy to see me when I get out of here. 
 
 I just hope it doesn't take too long before we're released... 
 
 Well, at least there are 10 other people in my room that will keep me company until then!
