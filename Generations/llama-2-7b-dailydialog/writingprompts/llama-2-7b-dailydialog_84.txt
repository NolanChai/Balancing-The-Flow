... no. I'll be damned if it isn't your roommate. You have a tendency to wake up on your ceiling. 
 
 Don't make me smash you in the face with my fist again. 
 
 Hey, watch the mouth! 
 
 You're such an asshole, man. What is it that you like so much about being here? I thought we were supposed to be friends. 
 
 We are. But you've got some issues and your room is a fucking mess. You need to get some help. 
 
 Yeah? Well, if that's the case then why did you agree to live with me in the first place? 
 
 Because I was trying to be nice to you! But it's not working out so good. If you can't behave and keep your room clean then we need to get a new roommate. 
 
 That would be fine by me. Just tell me who you want. Maybe he'll treat his room like shit too. 
 
 I'm serious. We need to talk about this more later. In the meantime, make sure your bed is made and everything is clean. 
 
 You are such a bitch! Fine! Whatever! I just don't get it. We should have been friends long ago. 
 
 Yeah? Well then why aren't we friends anymore? 
 
 Because you're a complete jerk and I don't want to be your friend no more. 
 
 You heard what he said! I told you before, clean up your shit or move out! We can't afford this apartment if it gets any messier than it is now. Now go clean it up! 
 
 Yeah, okay. But I'm gonna be gone for a while. So don't come in my room when you think I'm asleep and re-arrange things again or else I will kill you. 
 
 That was not a threat, that was a promise! 
 
 And it's also the last time we're going to have this conversation about your shit piling up everywhere. Okay? 
 
 You know what? Fuck this! It's too much work keeping you in line and I can't be bothered anymore. I quit! 
 
 Oh, really? Well that sucks for you because now we don't have a place to live anymore if our landlord finds out. So clean your shit up or get the hell out of here before he does find out and throws us both on the street! 
 
 You can't just throw me out like that. This is my home too, you know. I don't have anywhere else to go. 
 
 Then clean this damn room or start looking for a new place right now because we are getting evicted as soon as our landlord gets back from vacation! 
 
 And just remember what I told you before about my bed being made when I wake up on it next time. That's enough of that bullshit for today and don't forget to get me a beer when I wake up in the morning, okay? 
 
 Yeah, sure thing! I will remember to do that, too. Have a good sleep now. Don't worry about your room being all cleaned up because it won't matter once we're kicked out of here anyway. Good night! 
 
 Hey! Just one more thing before you go... 
 
 What? 
 
 There is an extra beer in the fridge for me if I wake up on your ceiling again tonight. Deal? 
 
 Yep, deal. You know how to reach me any time night or day and we'll get this all straightened out soon enough. Goodnight! 
 
 I love you too...
