10 minutes ago, a 24-year old man named Tom was driving his new Ferrari on Highway 436 when he encountered severe weather conditions (thunderstorm and lightning). He suddenly lost control of his car. It flipped over several times before crashing into a bridge railing and catching fire. The EMTs arrived within minutes and the young man was taken to the hospital with serious injuries.
