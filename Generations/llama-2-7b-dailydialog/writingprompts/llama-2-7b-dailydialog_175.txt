  y and I haven't done my data analysis yet. '' 
  ```
`` Oh, it is good. It's really, really good.'' 
  ```
`` Now what? What did you find? Is this about the transcription factors in our data set that we were hoping to find something new about? '' 
  ```
`` No. In fact, I think it might be more important than any of that. Do you remember the experiment I mentioned before where we sequenced the proteins in the samples with and without PI-3 kinase activity? '' 
  ```
`` Yes, but go on... what did you find out?'' 
  ```
`` Well, do you know how much of that protein is phosphorylated when it's active and when it isn't? I think we might have found the answer. '' 
  ```
`` Really? But how could you tell? Was there something different about the proteins in the two samples?'' 
  ```
`` No, actually, it was quite unexpected. Remember that one of my colleagues was supposed to do the biochemical analysis on the samples but he got stuck on another project and asked me for help? Well, I took a look at his results. '' 
  ```
```
  That's an understatement... I'm amazed you have time to do all of this stuff as well as your own research!'' 
  ```
`` Actually, that's how the idea for this project came about. He had sequenced the proteins but hadn't analyzed them properly before he gave up on it and asked me if I wanted a shot at finishing it. Well, I looked at his results, saw what I thought might be interesting, and started reading the literature to find out whether anyone else has ever seen anything like that in other experiments. '' 
  ```
```
  Sounds pretty exciting so far! What did you find?'' 
  ```
`` Well, here it is: the proteins with phosphate groups on them are the same ones we were hoping to find as a result of PI-3 kinase activity. So that means the only difference between our samples was whether they had been exposed to PI-3 kinase or not!'' 
  ```
`` That's amazing. No one has ever found anything like that before, right?'' 
  ```
`` Not quite right. I looked through a few papers and the authors did indeed find the same phosphorylated proteins as we did, but they thought there were only two or three of them present in their samples. '' 
  ```
```
  So what does that tell us?'' 
  ```
`` That means we must have found more than anyone else has seen before and that the results are probably reliable. Of course, it might just mean our assay method is better or something. But if everything is right, then our result could be the first step towards finding out how a cell turns on a specific gene at exactly the right time in its development. '' 
  ```
`` Really? Are you serious about this?'' 
  ```
```
  Of course I am! Now that we've identified these proteins, the next question is how to figure out what they do and how they affect the cell cycle. That could lead us to all sorts of interesting new avenues in the research field of cell growth and development. '' 
  ```
`` Wow! It sounds like you already have an idea about which direction this study will take. I'm sure our paper is going to be very important for your future work. You might even find yourself in the spotlight one day! '' 
  ```
```
  That would certainly be nice, but that doesn't matter now. We should get to work on preparing an abstract and a report so we can submit our paper by the end of this month. Do you know what you want to say yet?'' 
  ```
`` Oh, I know exactly what I want to say! '' 
  ```
```
  Really? What do you have in mind?'' 
  ```
`` Let's just say that it wasn't just the phosphorylated proteins we found that made our samples different. There was also a significant difference in the activity of two other transcription factors, PHAB-1 and GCN-20. I think they might have been interacting with these protein complexes to make them work differently than before! '' 
  ```
```
  Wow! That sounds amazing! But how can you be so sure it's not just a fluke?'' 
  ```
`` Actually, we're pretty sure the transcription factors were interacting with these proteins because we did another experiment that showed they did. '' 
  ```
```
  Oh my goodness! We might be onto something huge here! Can you believe this? It sounds like you will definitely get your grant! I can't wait to see what comes out of it in the future!'' 
  ```
`` No one knows what the effect of phosphorylation has on transcription factors. And there's a good chance that our results aren't all we'll find either. Once we start looking for these proteins more closely, I think we will be able to see just how important they are in the cell cycle and even in other biological processes as well. '' 
  ```
`` Wow! You have a way with words, too! Can you imagine where this might lead us?'' 
  ```
```
  Well, I can't tell for sure but if all goes well we should be able to find out why PI-3 kinase is so important in cell growth and development. '' 
  ```
`` And then what? Do you think that might lead us to cures or treatments for some of the most serious diseases today, like cancer?'' 
  ```
```
  Maybe... but I'm not sure how we can make those connections right now. For now, let's focus on getting the paper written and published in a good journal so everyone will know about our findings. '' 
  ```
`` Okay. Let me get to work on this proposal ASAP! If my grant is funded it would mean another three years of support for my project and a lot more funding for myself as well,'' said Johannes excitedly. 
  ```
```
  You know what? Maybe I won't have time to finish analyzing these data sets after all, but you can give me a call when your paper is published so we can talk about it then!'' 
  ```
`` Okay... thank you for everything today, Dr. Edmunds. '' 
  ```
```
  You are very welcome. I hope this means I get to see more of the people in my group on a regular basis now that I'm not so busy with my research.'' 
  ```
`` You know what? Let me walk you out!'' 
  ```
```
  Sure, that sounds good. '' 
  ```
`` Good. I'll see you in the office on Monday. '' 
  ```
`` Thanks for all of your help today and thank you again for taking a look at my work earlier this month when you were so busy!'' 
  ```
```
  Well, it was a pleasure to get involved with such an exciting project! I am glad we are working together on something that is going to make the world better. '' 
  ```
`` Thank you for your support and encouragement, Dr. Edmunds. I won't forget this day anytime soon.'' 
  ```
```
  No worries there, Johannes! See you next week... if not before. ''
