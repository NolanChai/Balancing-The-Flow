In my mind I see myself
Giving a lecture in a classroom to young students eager to learn 
My voice is calm and quiet, yet strong and forceful 
I am aware that what i say will be important for the rest of their lives 
So I must be careful and considerate to what I say 
What would I have wanted to hear? What was useful to know at that time in my life? 
Everything that I teach will remain with them forever, it's not something they will forget 
I am responsible for passing on the knowledge of the ages so that we can be successful as a species and learn from our mistakes
