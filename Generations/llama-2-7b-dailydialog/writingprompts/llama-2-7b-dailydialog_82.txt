`` Yes, I'm sure about this decision to retire from my career.'' 
 
 The message was retransmitted with Ania's response. She could feel her heart beating faster as she stared at it on the screen for a moment before she sent her second message back in. 
 `` I am also sure that this is one of the hardest decisions that I have ever made in my life, but after much thought and consideration, I think it's best if I go ahead with my plan to retire from SpaceX.'' 
 
 The message disappeared, and she took a deep breath before typing her third message in: 
 `` Is this really happening? Are you sure about that?'' 
 
 She couldn't believe what was happening to her. It seemed unbelievable that she was giving up the career of her dreams for something else. But, at least for now, there wasn't anything left in her heart that had been calling to her since she was a little girl growing up on Earth. She knew that this was going to be hard and even scary at times. 
 `` You don't have to decide right away. I understand how much you love your job here.'' 
 
 The message was retransmitted, but it didn't affect Ania in the same way as before. She knew that she had already made up her mind about this decision even if it still felt hard to accept sometimes. 
 `` Thank you for understanding how I feel about leaving my job at SpaceX.'' 
 
 The message was retransmitted once more, and Ania smiled at the thought of how much harder it would be for her father when she told him what happened next month after her last day on Earth as an astronaut working alongside humans rather than robots like herself today on Mars instead! 
 `` I love you, Mom.'' 
 
 The message disappeared once more before Ania typed in another one: 
 `` Bye mom, it's been a pleasure having your company and support throughout these years. We will miss having our regular phone conversations with each other but know that we are always here for you no matter what happens next week or even ten years down the road.'' 
 
 The message disappeared once more as Ania felt her heart beating faster than ever before in her life right now at this moment where she couldn't imagine doing anything else besides being an astronaut again someday soon!
