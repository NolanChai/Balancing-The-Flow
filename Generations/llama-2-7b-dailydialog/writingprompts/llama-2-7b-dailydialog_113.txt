> Oh, hello! Are you here to play with me? 

 > No, no. Just to see my old friend and give her something special for Christmas. 

 > Ah yes, your Christmas present is inside. Would you like me to help you carry it in? 

 > Yes please. Merry Christmas! 

 > Merry Christmas! What a nice surprise! You must have been standing there a long time.

 > She's been planning this for weeks now. It looks like Santa has been busy making his list and checking it twice...
