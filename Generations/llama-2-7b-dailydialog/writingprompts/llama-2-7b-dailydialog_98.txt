Chains clinked as it shifted position, flared its fins and swayed back and forth from side to side, a strange echoing rumble coming from its throat. A dark cloud of mist issued from the nostrils each time it breathed. The creature was more than twenty feet tall, and nearly half that in length, with an enormous barbed tail. It wore a black cloak over its naked body, covering everything except for one small area at its groin.
