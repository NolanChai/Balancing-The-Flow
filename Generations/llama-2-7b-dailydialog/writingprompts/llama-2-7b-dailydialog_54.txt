Dear Lulu, I'm on my way to get you a souvenir and I want to tell you something really exciting!  You know how I was saying we could watch a movie before bed every night? Well... I didn't mean on the TV screen in the common room. I meant I wanted to bring us our own personal little theatre with a huge screen so we can lie here and watch together, just like back home. And there's even more! We can make dinner from scratch in our kitchen, go to bed whenever we want... It'll be like we have a whole house of our very own on this star ship. I can't wait to tell you about all the other things too! Just so you know, I got your favorite ice cream flavor at the store today.  I love you more than the sun and moon put together, and I know that sounds like a lot because they are very big, but it's true. -P.S: I forgot to tell you that one of our scientists said that there may be other planets out there with life on them too. -PPS: That makes me think about something... what if the next generation who live here is not human?  They could have all kinds of cool names, like Kardash and Lolo!
