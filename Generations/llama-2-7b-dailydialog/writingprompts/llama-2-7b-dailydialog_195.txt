“ What are you doing ? ” 
 
 I started the sequence of events that would ultimately cause the destruction of Dark Flag, sending the vessel into a spinning frenzy in which she ’ d eventually explode. 
 
 “ If I don ’ t do this , then nothing will be different from before. It is our destiny to be together. ” 
 
 *We ’ re together now . We always have been . And always will be.* 
 
 I put the key in and started her up, knowing it would only take a few moments to blow her sky high. 
 
 “ Goodbye my love , forever. ” 
 
 I said that over and over again while the spinning began to pick up speed as if she were falling into a bottomless hole, going deeper and deeper until she ’ d be gone for good. 
 
 *This is our destiny Violet. This was always our destiny.* 
 
 I saw White Falcon wake up again , but he didn ’ t have time to react. He just looked on with his mouth wide open, as if this were something he couldn ’ t believe could be happening. 
 
 *I will not let you destroy me Violet . You have no power over me.* 
 
 I was too focused on my task to care about anything else at the moment. Even though it felt like forever , the destruction was quick, and before I knew it , she ’ d exploded in a fiery ball of fire and ash. The heat from it would reach for hundreds of miles, so I made sure that White Falcon couldn ’ t be saved. 
 
 *You don ’ t know what you’re doing Violet.* 
 
 It wasn ’ t until after the explosion that I turned to White Falcon . He was still standing there looking at me with a look of disbelief on his face, and in my eyes , he saw nothing but contempt. 
 
 *Goodbye Violet . You will never find another love like mine.* 
 
 “ No one else would ever have you anyway ” , I said to him before flying off into the distance . I watched him for a few moments as he stood there, looking out over what was once a beautiful starship. He couldn ’ t believe that someone so good and kind could be gone forever. It seemed like only yesterday when we were just babies in our own little worlds of darkness , but now all that would soon change . 
 
 *You won ’ t have me Violet.* 
 
 I was going to enjoy my time alone for a while before moving on with my life as if nothing had happened at all. The only way I could get away from White Falcon and the Dark Flag was by killing myself, which is exactly what I did . After making sure he ’ d never find me again , I jumped into the atmosphere below , where I would be able to rest in peace forever with no one ever finding out who I really was. 
 
 *I will never stop looking for you Violet.* 
 
 I smiled as I watched him turn and leave, knowing that he would always be searching for me but never find me again . Even after all these years of searching , I ’ m sure that one day we will meet up in another universe or some other dimension where time doesn ’ t exist anymore . But until then, there is no one else for either of us but each other . 
 
 *This was our destiny.*
