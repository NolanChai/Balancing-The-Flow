Senator Ardin? Can we talk for a minute? 
 
 What is it? Is something wrong? 
 
 I am not sure exactly how you would put this . . . 
 
 You are in some trouble. 
 
 Trouble? Why do you say that? 
 
 A woman named Mellisha has been arrested for murder. The charges will be filed tomorrow morning, but she was arrested today and a security camera captured her entering your residence this evening at approximately 1704 hours Atlantia Standard Time . 
 
 What did you do with the woman? Is she still in there? 
 
 No , sir. We had an officer standing by to apprehend her, but we thought it might be best if you came directly to headquarters for questioning. We have a request from Mellisha that you not be allowed to enter your residence until after her hearing is concluded. She also stated she would prefer not having any contact with you before the hearing . 
 
 Are there witnesses who can place me in my house at this time? 
 
 No, sir. We have been unable to determine why the woman went into the apartment building, but your retinal scanner recognized her as soon as she entered . . . which would indicate you know each other quite well. 
 
 Do I need a lawyer here ? 
 
 Yes , Senator Ardin. You are entitled to legal counsel during any official interview conducted by the security services. We have one standing by if you wish to call him in. He is already on his way . 
 
 Thank you, sir. The thought had crossed my mind . I'll call him in as soon as we leave here. 
 
 Do you want an escort out of the building? 
 
 No . Let me take care of this myself. It would be unseemly for a senator to allow the security services to escort him from his residence, even if he had just murdered somebody. 
 
 I understand your point, sir. I will wait in my office until you arrive , and then we can proceed to your house together . 
 
 Thank you , officer. 
 
 Good evening, Senator Ardin. 
 
 Good evening, Lieutenant. How are things in the senate this week? Anything of interest on the agenda ? 
 
 We have a bill about to be passed that will allow us to sell our natural resources in the open market . You may want to watch it . 
 
 I'm sure I will, and thanks for the tip. Please tell me what is happening with my retinal scan? Why did you take this step against Mellisha? 
 
 We have reason to believe that she was not alone last evening when she entered your residence. And since we had been monitoring her for some time after an incident in which she assaulted a guard in your building . . . 
 
 What kind of incident? Did you apprehend anybody else with the woman? 
 
 No , sir, and I am not at liberty to discuss any further details. You need to let us interview Mellisha and then we will make our decision as to what charges to bring against her . 
 
 Does she know about this retinal scan ? Can I use it if I want? 
 
 No , sir, it is the exclusive property of the security services. The only exception would be your own home in which case you are authorized to use the scanner to prevent unauthorized entry . 
 
 But how does Mellisha know where my house is without me telling her? I have never told her where it is, and nobody else has either . What do you think she is doing here anyway? What does she want with me ? Is she some sort of lover or something like that? 
 
 No , sir. We believe this is purely a professional relationship between the two of them. There was nothing to indicate she had any romantic involvement, and there are no records of an intimate relationship between the two of them. 
 
 I am going to take your word for it, but I'd still like to know what else you are doing . Why haven't you informed me earlier that Mellisha was arrested? 
 
 We didn't have any reason to believe she was involved in anything illegal until we received information from a confidential informant who told us about an incident involving Senator Ardin. The woman apparently has some sort of vendetta against the senator, and it is possible that she may have been using her job as security for his residence as cover to get closer to him. 
 
 I'm not sure if I should believe all this . It sounds pretty strange to me , but I do have a reputation to maintain in case you need an explanation as to why my retinal scan is no longer active in the building and I am being questioned by security. I don't think that would look very good for me, especially with some of the people who are watching . 
 
 No , sir , we do not intend any harm against you. We only want to make sure there are no other accomplices to this crime. It is possible the woman has been using your retinal scan as a way into and out of your residence . 
 
 And how often does that happen? Doesn't it bother you that people are sneaking in and out of my house, and I have no idea who they are or what they want ? That is pretty frightening if you ask me. 
 
 We will do our best to make sure we take care of this as quickly as possible . In the meantime , however , I would strongly suggest that you refrain from visiting your residence for the duration of the investigation and questioning. 
 
 Do I get a pass out of here? If so, what is my next step ? 
 
 Your attorney should be contacted immediately . He can help you get a release form to allow you to come back into the building. We will not press charges against you if you do so, but we want you to have access to your home and any of its contents in case something happens while Mellisha is here . 
 
 Okay , I'll be going now. If you need me for anything else before my hearing tomorrow morning, let me know what time it will take place. 
 
 The hearing should start around nine-thirty AST . We are meeting with your attorney at ten to discuss the charges against Mellisha and any possible defense strategies that might be needed in this case . I'll see you then . 
 
 Good evening, Lieutenant. 
 
 Good night , sir . 
 
 Have a pleasant evening . 
 
 And you too, Officer . 
 
 Goodbye . 
 
 Good-bye , sir. 

### Explanation:
 
 The woman who is being questioned by security in connection with the murder of Senator Ardin was not a resident in the building where he lived, and she did not have access to his residence prior to that evening . 
 
 We do not know why she went into the senator's house or what her intentions were when she got there , but we do know that she has been using a retinal scan to get in and out of buildings. The scan was originally installed for the benefit of Ardin, who wanted it as part of his security detail. 
 
 The woman must have found some way to take a photograph of the senator's iris or perhaps even clone it somehow, but she did not use her own retinal scan . We have no idea what happened with that, and we are currently investigating. 
 
 It appears from the evidence collected thus far that this was an inside job , which means somebody in the security detail either leaked information to the woman or gave it directly to her in order for her to get into Ardin's residence . We have been interviewing all of the employees who work in the senator's building, and we have yet to find a motive. 
 
 There are some people within the security detail who do not seem to be telling us everything they know about this case, but it is hard to believe that they would ever allow their supervisor to get killed . Ardin had his own set of enemies in the senate , and we suspect he was a target for at least one of them. 
 
 There are other problems as well. For example, how does an unknown woman have access to the retinal scanner? How did she obtain her photo from somewhere if nobody else knew it existed? And most importantly . . . why would Ardin's killer not be using his own retinal scan in order to gain entry into his residence ? 
 
 I think we need to dig deeper. It is possible that this was all planned and organized by people who want to remove Ardin from office , but we cannot prove it yet . We have a few more days before we can bring these charges against Mellisha, so in the meantime we will try to figure out how she got into his house last evening. 
 
 I'm not sure what is going on here, but we need answers fast if we want this case wrapped up without any further incidents. 

### Question:
 
 What kind of incident? Did you apprehend anybody else with the woman?
