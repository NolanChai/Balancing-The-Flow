> _I am not scared of anything!_ > 
> 
> _You are the one who should be terrified, Mister._ > 
> 
> _Tell me your name so that I can kill you and put this all behind us. The way my parents did to mine._ > 
> 
> _They won't come for you tonight, Mister. You are mine now._ > 
> 
> _My God._ > 
> 
> _How many of them?_ > 
> 
> _Seven years ago, the answer was twenty-five._ > 
> 
> _But I am not my father. And you are no longer theirs._ > 
> 
> _I'll give myself to you in exchange for your freedom from them. They will leave us alone together and they won't bother you anymore._ > 
> 
> _There is one condition, Mister._ > 
> 
> _Which is that you never tell anyone about what happened here tonight. Never._ > 
> 
> _Never. I swear it to God, Mister._ > 
> 
> _That will be the only thing we keep from them._ > 
> 
> _Promise me this and we are free._ > 
> 
> _I promise you that._ > 
> 
> _Besides I have no intention of telling anyone._ > 
> 
> _Even if it meant saving my own life._ > 
> 
> _That's good, because we are on the same page here. They will never hurt you again._ > 
> 
> _So then, Mister, let us make a deal: I kill them and they won't find out about what happened here tonight._ > 
> 
> _But if you tell anyone..._ > 
> 
> _I will hunt you down and put an end to you forever._ > 
> 
> _And then there will be no one left to tell, Mister._ > 
> 
> _Well, that sounds like a deal. I hope you have what it takes to save my life. You have got me in a very precarious situation and you better not fail me._ > 
> 
> _You won't be disappointed._ > 
> 
> _I know._ > 
> 
> _How so?_ > 
> 
> _Because I can already feel myself giving in to this strange new feeling._ > 
> 
> _It 's called love._ > 
> 
> _Really? How touching. Let's just get this over with. You have been very entertaining, but it is time for us both to go our separate ways._ > 
> 
> _I'm not going anywhere yet._ > 
> 
> _And if you don't leave immediately..._ > 
> 
> _Oh, I will leave. But first, I need a little something from you in exchange for your freedom from them._ > 
> 
> _You are a monster!_ > 
> 
> _Yes. And soon enough, so will you be._ > 
> 
> _I swear to God I won't tell anyone!_ > 
> 
> _Even if it meant saving my own life?_ > 
> 
> _Even then._ > 
> 
> _Then we have a deal. You are a man of your word, I can see that much already._ > 
> 
> _You do seem to know everything about me._ > 
> 
> _Yes, it 's called love. It's like when you have a crush on someone and you spend every waking moment thinking about them. That is what I am feeling for you right now._ > 
> 
> _But why should I trust you?_ > 
> 
> _Because in the end, we are both of one mind here: it 's not your choice to make whether or not they find out what happened tonight. But if you want them to stop hunting me and come for you instead, you will have to trust me._ > 
> 
> _I am sorry, but I cannot do that._ > 
> 
> _Why not?_ > 
> 
> _Because it 's a deal of life and death. And I can't give my life for you...and then have you betray me afterward and make the whole thing meaningless._ > 
> 
> _I know that if anything happens to me, they will hunt down everyone who knows about tonight, and kill them all until they find out where I am hiding. And then when they do, it will be too late for you. I can 't allow that to happen._ > 
> 
> _You mean you would rather die than go on living without me?_ > 
> 
> _If that is what it takes for them to stop coming after you...yes._ > 
> 
> _It's a deal, then. You will kill the monsters and in return I will not tell anyone about tonight._ > 
> 
> _Do we have an agreement?_ > 
> 
> _Yes._ > 
> 
> _Then let us go our separate ways and forget this ever happened._ > 
> 
> _It seems we are in a bit of a rush. I guess you can't wait to leave._ > 
> 
> _You have no idea how true that is right now!_ > 
> 
> _Then let us go our separate ways and forget this ever happened._ > 
> 
> _I 'll be waiting for your call when you are ready to leave. But remember, if you try anything, they will come after me too and we won't have a chance like tonight again._ > 
> 
> _And I can already tell you that you wouldn't survive another encounter with them...so it's best for everyone involved if I am the one to go._ > 
> 
> _I hope I do not see you again._ > 
> 
> _The same goes for me, Mister. Now let us just finish this and we can all be free of each other._ > 
> 
> _You won't find anyone else in the world to love you like I do...and if you should ever fall into their hands again, there will be no one left to save you. Do you understand me?_ > 
> 
> _Yes._ > 
> 
> _Then it 's a deal. You are free and I will never bother you again._ > 
> 
> _Goodbye, Mister._ > 
> 
> _Goodbye to you too, Miss._ > 
> 
> _But your name?_ > 
> 
> _It's not important. Just don't forget what I told you: they will come back for me and if you ever see them again..._ > 
> 
> _I know, Mister. Now goodbye._ > 
> 
> _Goodbye._ > 
> 
> _Goodbye._ > 
> 
> _Bye. Thank God that is over with and I can finally go to sleep in peace after this nightmare of a week._ > 
> 
> _Thank you for saving my life, Mister._ > 
> 
> _It 's nothing compared to what you did for me tonight._ > 
> 
> _Good night, Miss. Sleep well. I will call tomorrow with the date and time that we are meeting in a few days._ > 
> 
> _Don't forget or they will find out about this too...and then they will come for you._ > 
> 
> _I won't let anything happen to me. I am the daughter of the most powerful man in this country and I will be protected at all costs._ > 
> 
> _I know, Miss. And that is why we are going to kill them together so they can never hurt anyone else again...or even find you._ > 
> 
> _Goodbye Mister. Thank you for everything._ > 
> 
> _You are welcome and good night, Miss._ > 
> 
> _And if I don't see you again before we meet up with each other next time...I will always remember our first date as being the best one yet. And don 't forget to leave a message on your phone when you have decided not to call me anymore because then we can move onto the next chapter of our lives._ > 
> 
> _Don't worry about me, Mister. I will do exactly that and it won't take long at all for us to fall back into each other 's arms again...as long as they don 't find out what happened tonight._ >
