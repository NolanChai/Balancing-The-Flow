'' I ' m sorry for standing at attention when you entered my office sir.'' She stammered out a response.
 
 `` There is no need to apologize Private Mary . We all know that soldiers are trained to stand on the right side of discipline. '' He said kindly. 
 
 '' Yes , Sir, and I ' m glad you could come by to see me . I didn ' t expect the Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces would be able to drop into my office personally. '' She grinned and tried to regain some composure but he had already seen her slip back into her normal personality. 
 
 `` It ' s a pleasure , Private . Your performance was very admirable last night and it is good to see that you have recovered from the trauma. How do you feel? '' He asked with concern in his voice.
 
 '' Much better , Sir . I felt as if I were on cloud nine after the match . '' She responded happily, still amazed by her achievements. 
 
 `` Well , it ' s good to see that you are back on your feet again and ready for action ! What is your next plan ? '' He asked.
 
 `` Oh Sir , I want to continue training but I was wondering if the Army could use me in a different way. You see, I can do so much more than just fight .'' She said. 
 
 `` That ' s true Private Mary . We are looking for new ways to recruit and you seem to be a very promising soldier for our country. What is it that you want to do ? '' He asked her. 
 
 '' I was wondering if there were any positions where I could work in an office or maybe even become an instructor . '' She said.
 
 `` I understand , but what about all of the skills and training that you have been through over the past few years ? Wouldn ' t it be a waste to put them aside for some job where you sit at a desk all day long ? '' He asked, smiling. 
 
 '' Yes Sir . But I think it would be so much easier for me to work in an office rather than on the battlefield. And I have already proven that I can do very well in combat situations ! '' She responded, trying to get a job that didn ' t include fighting at all. 
 
 `` Well Private Mary , there are many different types of soldiers out here . Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses and the Army is a great place to discover those things. If you want to become an office worker than I am sure we can find something for you, but you will still have to go through all of our training exercises. '' He smiled at her and she began to see that he was very wise and knew what he was talking about . 
 
 `` Well , thank you sir ! You ' re so generous to me . I am grateful for your support in this matter and look forward to becoming a real asset to the Army in some way. '' She said gratefully. 
 
 `` Good . Now don ' t stand on guard all day thinking about what we talked about . Get back to work !'' He smiled at her and she rushed out of his office with a smile on her face that didn ' t leave it for the rest of the day. She knew she could do this , become an Army Officer if she tried hard enough and succeeded in her dreams.
