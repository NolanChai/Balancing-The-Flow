Dad , 
 
 I didn't really know what was going on back then, but Mom told me that we had to go away for a while because something happened. I remember thinking about you all the time and wondering if you were ever coming home again. Well, I guess that you came back in time for my birthday . 
 
I've been practicing every day since you left. It's so much fun to play with friends and make music at the same time! Mom says that you can teach me some things when you get home , but she wants me to practice first. That is, if you have time. I think that it will take a long time for us to catch up on all of our things to talk about. 
 
I've got lots of news . Mom and Dad said that they had a new baby boy , but he died before he was born because he was sick. Mom says that she feels sad about this sometimes, so I try not to ask her too much about him. She told me that we can name him after you, Sammy . 
 
Dad, I'm looking forward to seeing you again, but I hope you remember how I look like now. 
 
Love always ,
