I have a teleportation device that will instantly take me to wherever on a map a randomly thrown dart hits. Today I accidentally hit the button twice in succession (this was before I read your mail). It has now taken me 10 miles away from my intended destination and I am very lost. Is there any way you can get me back to where I need to be?
