What?! I don't understand what you mean by "break down the fourth wall"!
 
 If you mean to break into a bank, that is impossible. I have no money on me, and my credit is terrible. And besides, breaking into banks is illegal anyway. 
 
 That leaves only one option: to break into a cave. But we can't do that with our bare hands! We must find some other way of getting in there, because if it involves force, I will not be involved. 
 
 If you could get us a torch or two, though, I would like to take a look inside and see what is there. 
 
 But if we are going to do that, we will need some kind of protection against the creatures lurking in there! 
 
 We can't go into a cave without weapons. It is far too dangerous for that. 
 
 I am not a violent person, but I also don't want to be eaten alive! 
 
 I have no idea how you could ever get a hold of any weapons at all, and in this situation, they would be absolutely useless. 
 
 The only way that we can possibly succeed is by using our brains instead of brute force. 
 
 What? You're serious about actually going into the cave?! That is insane. I don't know what is wrong with you! I will not go near that place. I am staying right here and watching over these supplies, in case we need them! 
 
 Well then I guess it is a good thing there are so many of us. Maybe one of the other girls could help out by guarding the entrance to the cave. 
 
 What if one of those creatures were to get past that entrance? Do you really think any of those girls would be able to stop them, if they came inside? I don't even want to know what we're supposed to do then! 
 
 All right, fine. But there is no reason for us to stay in this cave in the dark when all that stuff down here could light up a small city. We should at least have some light, and you can guard from inside the cave if you want. I think we can get rid of any threat like that if we are careful enough. 
 
 What? You don't need to yell! The sound will carry into the cave anyway! 
 
 You are a liar. There is no way they could have been able to hear that from in there! And I am not going anywhere near that place until you go get some weapons for us! Do you understand me? Go on now, before it gets any later and we have a full moon! 
 
 I don't know what the big rush is. The only thing we would do with a light source would be to see inside of the cave if we can get in there without force. We could even bring one of those guns that shoot lasers, as long as they are not charged up yet, and have no idea how to use them! 
 
 All right, fine. But you had better come back with weapons and quickly if you want me to be able to help you out at all. If I were you, though, I would just leave this place alone. There is absolutely nothing we can do in there anyway! 
 
 Alright, then I will go find some weapons for us and come back here as soon as possible with them. But don't get any bright ideas about breaking into that cave on your own again. The only reason I even agreed to help you out this time was because I wanted to see what was inside of there anyway! 
 
 FINE! If you are so intent on going in there, then just go ahead and do it. But remember: if any of those creatures get into the cave with us, we will all be dead meat! 
 
 Don't forget your flashlights! We're going to need them for sure!
