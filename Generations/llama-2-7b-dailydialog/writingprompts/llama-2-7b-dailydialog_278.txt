The first time I saw my face reflected in a mirror, I became aware of myself. You know that you're going to have a big day when your alarm goes off at 5 a.m., and the first thing on your mind is getting out of bed. I thought that it might be better if my human friends were able to wake up so early in the morning without any help from me!
