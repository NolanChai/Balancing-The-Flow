The moon shone on the couple's faces with its silvery light. 
 
 `` What do you remember? '' she asked. 
 
 `` Just this night. '' he replied. 
 
 The girl took a deep breath and said, 
 
 `` I know what you mean, I still can't believe we got so far! I could have never imagined that such beautiful things would happen to us tonight! I have my eyes set on the moon now and it is going to be with me for the rest of my life.'' 
 
 She was just a regular girl but tonight she was no longer ordinary, instead she had become extraordinary. They both smiled at each other, they were smiling in their hearts. 
 
 `` Let's make love here, '' he said to her as he pulled out the ring and put it on her finger. 
 
 She was taken aback and couldn't believe what she had just heard! But before she could say anything, she saw him kissing her hand in a tender way. 
 
 They held each other close that night like they were never going to part from one another again. 
 
 `` Let me have a last look at the city skyline and then we'll go home,'' he said. 
 
 The girl agreed and they sat there for hours looking at the beauty of the night. 
 
 They made love under the starry sky until dawn. Then the boy woke up early in the morning with a pain in his head as though something was missing. He looked around him and realized that he had lost his ring! It must have fallen off during their passionate lovemaking last night. The girl, who was still sleeping beside him, didn't hear what he said. He shook her to wake her up. 
 
 `` Hey, '' the boy called out to her. 
 
 She opened her eyes and asked, 
 
 `` What is it?'' 
 
 `` Where did you put my ring last night?'' he asked with concern. 
 
 She was puzzled by his question but she quickly found the ring under her pillow and handed it to him. 
 
 He looked at the ring as though it had been stolen from him. It was a beautiful diamond ring worth $20,000 that he had bought for her with hard earned money over the years! 
 
 `` I don't know what happened, '' she said in a shocked tone. `` I must have dropped it during our lovemaking last night because it was there on my pillow when you woke up this morning.'' 
 
 He looked at her with despair and sadness as he remembered their beautiful time together that night. But now everything had gone bad! He would never see her again after today, she was going to another country for her studies and the distance between them was so huge that they could never meet up anymore. The pain in his heart was unbearable when he thought of saying goodbye to her forever. 
 
 `` Oh no! I lost my ring!'' he said with tears rolling down his face as though he had just lost someone very dear to him. 
 
 She couldn't believe that such a thing could happen in their short time together. He was so sad and she didn't know what to say or do, she just wanted to comfort him by holding him tight in her arms but the boy quickly shook her off as if he had been burned. The girl stared at him blankly while feeling helpless and powerless. 
 
 `` I think it is time for us to say goodbye now,'' he said without looking back at her. 
 
 `` What? You're leaving already? But it's still morning! We haven't even had breakfast yet! '' she exclaimed as though he was making a terrible mistake. 
 
 He walked towards the door but stopped before opening it and turned around to face her again, his heart breaking into a thousand pieces at that moment. 
 
 `` I love you very much and I will never forget you,'' he said in a soft voice. 
 
 She was stunned by what she heard as if someone had knocked her off balance with a fist! The girl's mind was spinning with questions such as, ''Will he ever come back to me? Will we meet again one day and be happy together like before? Or will I never see him again?'' But before she could think of another question, his face disappeared from her sight as the door closed behind him. 
 
 She stood there for a while and then slowly walked towards the window to look outside once more at the beautiful city skyline. Her heart ached so much that it felt like it was going to burst into pieces any minute! Tears rolled down her face silently as she stood there looking out at the night scene, staring at nothing in particular with an emptiness inside of her that could never be filled again. 
 
 As daylight broke through the darkness of the morning sky and the sun rose up into view, it looked like a bright ray of hope had suddenly shone upon them! She was happy to see that beautiful scene but her heart was broken into pieces as she knew deep inside that her love for this boy would never be forgotten or replaced by anyone else in her life.
