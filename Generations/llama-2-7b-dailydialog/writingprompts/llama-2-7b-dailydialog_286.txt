I'm trying to kill myself with a shotgun. I think I should have known better than to do it at my sister's place, but when I need to get away from my problems, it's where I go. She never asks questions. All she wants is for me to be happy and she always keeps her word no matter what. I don't blame her for being pissed off with me right now. I knew what I was doing when I chose that day of all days to do it, but it was the only time I had ever been in control of my life.
