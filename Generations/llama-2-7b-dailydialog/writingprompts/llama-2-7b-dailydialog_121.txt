A road is like a journey through life. Sometimes it's good to be alone. We can take time to think and reflect. 
 
 
 You need to go with someone who knows where you are going if you want to get there quickly. It ' s easier to see the way when you know your destination. 
 
 
 Walking makes me feel free. When I walk, no one can make me do what they don â€™ t like. No one can stop my mind from thinking freely.
