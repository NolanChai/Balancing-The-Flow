`` I got a Tootsie Roll!'. 'I got gum!' they said together. The Darth Vader waved his hand, and the Minion did a little dance. 
 
 `` That's it,' I said with a smile. I handed them each a shiny quarter to leave for me. ''Thank you.' 'Thank you!'' They walked away whistling merrily as they held their hands high above their heads, displaying the coins like trophies. As they left, I looked around at the other houses on our street. There were no trick-or-treaters at this house yet. 
 
 `` Hey, mom!' the Darth Vader shouted from across the lawn as he pointed to a sign hanging over their front door. 'This says ''no candy'.' The Minion followed and made a face like he just swallowed something sour. 
 
 `` But, I thought Halloween was for trick-or-treating!'' Darth Vader said as they walked away. 
 
 `` Hey mom!' the Minion called again. 'They didn't have any candy in their bowl.' The Darth Vader nodded and looked back at me with a questioning glance. 'Well, don't worry,' I told them with a grin. ''If you had to give up one for Halloween, then it was trick or treating that got the boot!'' 
 
 `` What does that mean?'' they asked in unison. 
 
 ``,It means I bought some candy to leave out for any kids who forgot their bags.' They looked at each other and smiled as if they were really onto something good. 'Thanks!' 
 
 `` No problem,' I said, and I watched them walk away with their bags over their shoulders, still whistling happily. As they approached the next house, a large green dragon materialized behind them with wings that reached almost to the roof of his own home. It seemed as if this house was the first one in our neighborhood to get the Halloween spirit. 
 
 `` Hey, there, kids,' said the voice coming from behind the dragon's head. 'Have you come back for more candy? I thought you boys would like my new costume.' 
 
 `` We've got some, thank you!' I shouted as I stepped onto the porch to see what was in the bowl. The kids waved goodbye and ran away before the dragon could tell them he had a real bowl of candy for them. I looked at my watch: it was only 8 p.m. If they keep this up, we're going to have enough candy to last through Halloween! 
 
 `` I'll be back in a few minutes,' I told my parents before walking down the sidewalk and around the corner of our house. The dragon was still there, smiling with his hands behind his head. ''Hi again, kids,'' he said with a wink. 
 
 `` That was a great costume!' I exclaimed as I took one step onto the porch before stopping in my tracks. 'What are you doing?' 
 
 ``,I'm taking off this costume,' he responded and reached for his head to pull it off. He stopped when he realized that I wasn't talking about the mask. ''How did you know?'' he asked, looking around the street. 
 
 `` What do you mean?'' 
 
 ``,I saw your mom with her camera on her phone.' 
 
 `` Oh! That's right!' My parents always take pictures of me at Halloween for our Christmas card every year. They even have some videos from last year, when I dressed up as Santa Claus and wore a white beard that I had to wash once a day after eating breakfast with it on! 
 
 `` So, are you going to put something over your head tonight?'' the dragon asked as he walked around his yard. 'If you do, make sure you leave an opening for your eyes.' He went back inside and returned wearing a mask that was shaped like a skull. The face was white with black lines on it and two holes where he could look out of them. It had eye sockets, cheek bones, and even teeth in his mouth. I looked around at all the other houses to see if anyone else dressed up for Halloween yet, but nobody seemed to be trick-or-treating tonight. 
 
 ``,I think that's a great costume!' I shouted as I ran home to get my own mask. 'But it would look better if you put on some red paint around your eyes.' As soon as he saw me, the dragon looked down and covered his face with his hands. ''You mean it's not enough that people can see through this?'' 
 
 `` I don't know,'' I said, as I put my mask on before running back outside to give him a hug goodbye for Halloween. 'Happy Halloween!' he shouted back at me from behind his mask as he waved one hand in the air and pointed to the sky with another. 
 
 `` That's how we say ''Good night'' in English,'' I told him before running home again to tell my mom about our new neighbor down the street who was so nice that she had given us free candy for Halloween!
