I think that this is just another way of saying that you shouldnâ€™t buy things that you don't need because it will hurt your chances of getting approved for a loan. If people are buying houses and then losing their jobs or having other problems with their financial situation, they may have to sell their house which could lead to them losing everything if there is no equity in the home.
