 I completely agree with you! XCOM is indeed a renowned name in the tactical gaming genre, known for its challenging gameplay and strategic depth. The original XCOM games have set a high standard for turn-based tactics and base management. If a new game claims to be XCOM but doesn't live up to those standards, it might not do justice to the series' reputation. It's essential for developers to maintain the quality that fans have come to expect from the XCOM franchise.
