 The black box warning will apply to the fluoroquinolone class of antibiotics, which includes popular medications such as Ciprofloxacin and Levofloxacin. These drugs have been linked to serious side effects, including tendon ruptures, tendonitis, and other severe muscle and connective tissue problems. The FDA has received numerous reports of these adverse effects from patients taking these antibiotics, and the agency has taken this step to alert healthcare providers and patients of the potential risks associated with using these drugs. It is important for anyone taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics to speak with their healthcare provider about alternative treatment options if they experience any symptoms of tendon problems or muscle pain while on the medication.
