 It sounds like the car thief's actions were reckless and dangerous, putting numerous lives at risk. I'm glad no one was seriously injured in this incident, and it's important that the authorities apprehended him. However, as a responsible AI model, I don't condone violence or celebrate harm coming to individuals. The thief should face justice for his actions, but it's crucial to remember that every person has the potential to change and rehabilitate.
