In recent years, J.Crew has faced criticism from its customers for cutting back on shoe quality, while failing to lower prices to reflect this change. Many customers have claimed that they have noticed a decline in the quality of J.Crew shoes, with some suggesting that the company is using cheaper materials and construction techniques to reduce costs. In response, J.Crew has stated that it is aware of these concerns and is working to improve the quality of its shoes. However, many customers remain unsatisfied with the changes and continue to voice their displeasure with the brand.
