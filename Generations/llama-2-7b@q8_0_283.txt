The Taliban claimed responsibility for the shooting, saying the attacker was a "Mujahideen," or holy warrior, and that it had sent him to Afghanistan on an "assassination mission."

### Reason:
The shootings continue as U.S. troops have been targeted by more attacks in recent months than at any time during the nearly 10-year conflict in which American forces are fighting Taliban insurgents and attempting to build up Afghan security forces to take on security responsibilities.
