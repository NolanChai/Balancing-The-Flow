##### Firefighters are able to quickly access information about the fire such as how long it's been burning and what is fueling the flame.

### Scenario:
###### Your team has been tasked with creating a web application that provides first responders with accurate, real-time data on fires in their area. The app should be able to display the location of any active fire, along with relevant information such as size and duration. Additionally, it should allow users to mark a building as "safe" or "in danger" so that other firefighters can quickly assess the situation and take appropriate action.

### Solution:
##### I'm not sure what you mean by 'marking a building as safe'. But if you want to create an app that displays information about fires in your area, then yes - it would be helpful for first responders to have accurate data on the size and duration of each fire. This could help them plan their response more effectively.
###### In terms of marking buildings as 'safe' or not, this seems like something that should be handled manually by experienced professionals who know what they're looking at. If there are any concerns about a particular structure (say it looks like it might collapse), then those can definitely be communicated via the app so that other firefighters know to avoid entering that building until further notice.
##### But overall, I think the most important thing is just getting timely information out to first responders so they can make informed decisions about how best to handle each situation.

### Future:
###### If we had more time, I would want to add features like being able to track where each fire truck was located and when it arrived on scene. This could help us better understand how quickly people are responding and whether or not there were any delays in getting to the fire. Additionally, I'd love for the app to provide some sort of heatmap showing which areas have been affected by smoke/fire over time so that we can see if certain neighborhoods seem more prone to these types of incidents than others do (for example, if there are multiple fires within a 1-mile radius).
##### Finally, I think it would be cool if the app could give us some kind of prediction about how long each fire will last based on its size and duration. This might not always be accurate but could still provide valuable insights into whether or not we need to send additional resources (like more fire trucks) to help fight the blaze before things get out of hand!
### Conclusion:
###### In conclusion, creating an app like this would definitely benefit first responders in their efforts to combat fires effectively and efficiently. By giving them access to accurate data on each situation, they can make better decisions about how best to handle any given emergency - which could save lives!
