 It's not every day that you get to see a prominent politician like Paul Ryan relaxing and unwinding, but this video shows him doing just that while enjoying some good old fashioned American beer and music.

In the clip, Ryan can be seen sitting on a couch with what appears to be a group of friends, sipping on some local beers and listening to grunge music from the '90s. He seems to be in his element, laughing and joking with his friends as they enjoy each other's company.

It's not surprising to see Ryan enjoying himself in this way, given his reputation as a hardworking and dedicated politician. However, it is refreshing to see him letting loose and having some fun outside of the political arena.
