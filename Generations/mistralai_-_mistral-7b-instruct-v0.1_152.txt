 The Mona Lisa's eyebrows and eyelashes have been the subject of much speculation for decades. Some art historians believe that the painting was originally created without eyebrows or eyelashes, while others think they may have been intentionally removed or painted over by later restorers.

One theory is that the original artist, Leonardo da Vinci, purposefully left the eyebrows and eyelashes out of the painting to make her face more ethereal and otherworldly. Another theory suggests that the eyebrows and eyelashes were added by a 20th-century restorer who was attempting to make the painting look more realistic.

However, it is worth noting that there is no definitive evidence to support either of these theories, and the true reason behind the Mona Lisa's lack of eyebrows and eyelashes may never be known.
