1. If shoplifting is not committed due to hunger, why doesn't the article say "Police in UK are worried that hunger may be one of the reasons for the rise of shoplifters"?
2. The writer uses "hunger" as an excuse without a strong evidence to back up his claim. If shoplifting is caused by hunger, why doesn't the writer present us with data about this?
3. Doesn't this article just show that shoplifting is committed for other reasons?
4. Why does the writer talk about shoplifters as if they are all poor people? In fact, rich people also steal products from shops for fun or profit.
