An emaciated pit bull described by humane society officials in Louisville, Kentucky as the worst case of neglect they had ever seen has been reunited with its owners.

The animal was left outside in a crate without food or water for over two months before it was rescued by Animal Care Society and taken to an emergency vet clinic.

The emaciated dog, now named Snoop Dogg, weighed just 35 pounds when he was found last week.

He was also suffering from heartworms, ear infections and fleas.
