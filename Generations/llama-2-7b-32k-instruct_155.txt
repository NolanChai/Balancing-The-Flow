It's just not right or fair, it's just wrong.' (Picture: PA)   Yvette Cooper sparked a furious row over immigration last night as she led a rebellion of Labour MPs against government plans to strip away the human rights of foreign nationals by giving new powers to detain and deport them.   The Bill also includes controversial provisions designed to reduce the number of migrants claiming asylum in Britain by making it easier for the Home Office to dismiss claims that people's lives are at risk if they return home. MPs passed the Immigration Bill into law, despite 39 Labour rebels joining with Liberal Democrat and Tory defectors to inflict a defeat on Government.   A total of 265 MPs voted for the controversial legislation compared to 298 who opposed it including 14 Lib Dems. The Labour rebels had threatened to vote against the Bill if amendments were not made, particularly those which could have seen foreign nationals detained and deported without a fair hearing .   However in an attempt to ward off the revolt the Government agreed last week to change laws so that suspects will not be able to be detained or face removal from Britain unless they have been given a chance to explain why their claim should succeed. The Bill still allows for the power to deport individuals who do not have a good reason to stay and refuse to return home, although it must only be used in exceptional circumstances .   Home Secretary Theresa May said: 'Tonight Parliament has approved important changes to the immigration rules that will help make our country safer. They also include sensible measures which will improve the integrity of our asylum system by better protecting those who have genuine claims.' She added she was pleased MPs had voted for provisions that would see foreign nationals detained and deported without a fair hearing only in 'exceptional circumstances'.   Yvette Cooper, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, said: ‘I am deeply disappointed that the Bill has been passed despite being opposed by tens of thousands of people across Britain. I have always sought to work with the Government on issues related to immigration and asylum but it has refused to listen to me or its own experts who say these provisions are wrong'.   ‘MPs are voting through new powers for the Home Office to detain foreign national offenders who have been bailed on bail conditions that they can't understand. It's just not right or fair, it's just wrong.'   Cooper told MPs: 'We know that many of these detainees will have been victims themselves of human trafficking and we also know some may be suffering from serious mental health problems. These are people who need help, not detention centres with inappropriate conditions and staff who do not speak their languages.'   Cooper added: ‘The Bill could lead to a two tier legal system where migrants get less protection than British citizens. It's unworkable, it's unfair, it's deeply unfair.' The Labour leader Ed Miliband said: 'I am concerned by the changes to asylum and immigration rules which are being pushed through Parliament today... This is a bad deal for Britain and a bad deal for the people of this country. I don't believe these measures will be effective, but they also undermine our reputation as a nation that welcomes people from all over the world who share our values.'   Mr Miliband added: 'I am deeply disappointed by tonight's decision. These changes do not reflect British values and are against what I would want in this country.'   The Bill also includes provisions which will allow for the Government to block individuals who have already had their asylum claim rejected from making a new application for at least two years after it was first refused . It's intended to reduce the number of migrants claiming asylum by reducing the risk of people whose claims were dismissed from returning home and then reapplying again.   Yvette Cooper, Labour Shadow Home Secretary said: ‘This is a bad deal for Britain and a bad deal for the people of this country. I don't believe these measures will be effective, but they also undermine our reputation as a nation that welcomes people from all over the world who share our values'.   Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said: ‘It is absolutely right that the UK has strong rules in place to ensure those who are not entitled to be here leave. But we should only use these powers in exceptional circumstances.'
