The sailor was plucked from the water by a small boat team from the USS Kearsarge after it was alerted to the sinking of the Panama-flagged cargo ship off the coast of Oman, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement.

"As part of its normal operations in the Gulf region, the amphibious ready group was able to quickly respond to this distress call and conduct a successful rescue," CENTCOM spokesman Navy Capt. Bill Urban said. "The sailor is currently in good condition."
