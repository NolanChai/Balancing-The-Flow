 The parents of an 11-year-old autistic boy were arrested in California after their son was found living in a cage inside the family's home. Officials say that the child had been locked inside for up to two years, and had been neglected and denied proper medical care.

It is not clear what motivated the parents to keep their child in such a degrading condition, but authorities are investigating the case. The boy, who has not been named, was reportedly removed from the home and placed in foster care.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that can affect social communication, language, and behavior. Children with autism often struggle to connect with others and may exhibit challenging behaviors as a result. However, locking a child inside a cage is never an appropriate form of treatment or care for anyone, regardless of their condition.

This incident is a reminder of the importance of providing proper support and care for children with autism and other special needs. It is also a reminder that no one should ever be subjected to physical or emotional abuse, whether they are neurotypical or have a disability.
