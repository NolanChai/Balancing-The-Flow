**The Bramble Cay melomys is the first recorded species of mammal lost in human-caused climate change**. This was the finding from a study published in the journal Nature Communications last month, which determined that rising sea levels have drowned the entire population of the rodent, which lived on Bramble Cay, a tiny patch of land off Australiaâ€™s coastline.
