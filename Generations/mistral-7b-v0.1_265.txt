- I created 4 pages as per requirements. The first page is a welcome page, which will greet the user when they click on the link.

- Next is the about page, where the user can find more information about Ebola and the boy who danced his way through it.

- Then comes a contact page with contact details and a form to fill in order to get in touch with me.

- Lastly, there is an index page which contains all the information on the website and is the main page of the site.

### How To Use:
- Go to this link https://alexfinnis.github.io/AlexFinnis21/index.html

- You can navigate through the pages using the navigation bar at the top of each page.

- The welcome and index pages are the same, so you can use either one.

### What I Learnt:
This project helped me learn more about HTML and CSS. It also helped me improve my coding skills and learn how to create a responsive website.
