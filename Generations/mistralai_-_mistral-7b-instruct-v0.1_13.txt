 The theft occurred at the Red Bull Racing factory in Milton Keynes, England, where the team's headquarters are located. According to police, the thieves gained entry through a rear door of the facility and stole several trophies from a display case in the reception area.

The stolen items include race trophies, as well as other memorabilia from the team's successful seasons in Formula One racing. It is unclear how many trophies were taken, but police say they are working to recover them and identify the suspects involved.

Red Bull Racing has not yet issued a statement about the incident. However, the team's Twitter account posted a message on Saturday morning saying that they were "devastated" by the theft and would be working to recover the stolen items.

The burglary occurred just two days after the team won its third consecutive Formula One championship at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The theft has cast a shadow over what should have been a celebratory weekend for the team.
