Spirit Airlines has filed a lawsuit against the Department of Transportation (DOT), challenging the agency’s recently enacted rule that requires airlines to include all mandatory fees in their advertised prices. The airline argues that the rule violates its First Amendment rights by restricting its ability to convey information about its pricing structure.

Spirit Airlines is known for its low-cost fares, but it also charges additional fees for checked bags, carry-on luggage, seat assignments, and other services. The new DOT rule requires airlines to include all mandatory fees in their advertised prices, making it easier for consumers to compare different airline options. Spirit Airlines argues that the rule is unfair because it forces them to include fees in their prices when they don’t charge those fees on every ticket.

The lawsuit also claims that the rule violates the First Amendment by restricting Spirit Airlines’ ability to communicate its pricing structure to consumers. The airline argues that the DOT rule prevents it from providing information about its low-cost fares and additional fees in a way that is clear, accurate, and consistent with its business model.

The case highlights the ongoing tension between consumer protection and free speech concerns when it comes to airline advertising. On one hand, the DOT’s new rule aims to ensure that consumers have access to all necessary information when comparing different airline options. On the other hand, Spirit Airlines argues that the rule violates its First Amendment rights by limiting its ability to communicate with consumers in a manner it considers effective.
