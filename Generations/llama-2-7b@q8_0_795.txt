The article should have some additional details that are not included in the provided text. If possible, please include them and provide references for your answer.

### Hints:
1. The sentence "He was among a group of 47 failed asylum seekers" is incomplete. Add some information to describe how many people were present with this man at that moment.
2. A few sentences later, the article mentions "The flights left without incident". You might want to add an explanation for it (if you understand it).
