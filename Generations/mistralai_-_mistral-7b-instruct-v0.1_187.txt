 However, this simple request escalated into a heated debate between a parent and child, with the father ultimately becoming so frustrated that he took off his own coat and left it on the ground, causing it to fly away. The incident occurred on Saturday morning in Denmark's SÃ¸nderjylland region.

According to reports, Kragh had been taking his son on a hike in the woods when the child began to feel cold and asked him if he could take off his coat. The father initially refused, saying that he wanted to keep the jacket for himself. However, after some back-and-forth between the two, Kragh eventually agreed and took the jacket off his son.

However, as they continued their walk, the child began to feel even colder and asked again if he could take off his coat. Again, the father refused, and the child grew increasingly frustrated. Finally, unable to contain himself any longer, Kragh lost his temper and stormed away, leaving his own coat on the ground in the process.

The coat, which was still attached to its hanger, then began to blow away in the wind, causing Kragh to run after it in an attempt to catch it before it disappeared entirely. However, despite his efforts, the coat continued to fly further and further away until it was completely out of sight.

Kragh has since apologized for losing his temper and taking off his own coat, and has promised to always be patient with his son in the future. The incident has sparked a debate about appropriate behavior between parents and children, with some arguing that parents should always prioritize their own comfort and needs above those of their children, while others argue that doing so can damage the relationship between parent and child.
