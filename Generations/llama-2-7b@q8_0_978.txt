The Giants Causeway is an area on the northern coast of Northern Ireland that has a geological feature called ‘columnar jointing’. This means the columns of basalt rocks form interesting structures as a result of lava flowing from volcanoes, and solidifying. The Giant’s Causeway is known for these geological features, along with many other tourist attractions that make it a popular site to visit in Northern Ireland.

The image is a star trail photograph that has been edited in Photoshop by Nick Enoch. Star trails are created when you leave your camera on a long exposure over the course of a night, which will create these circles around the stars as the earth rotates. The effect of this creates very interesting images and can also be seen at sites where there is a lot of light pollution such as cities.
The image also features a dust storm in the distance, which is a result of cosmic radiation from thousands of years ago. This means that the image is showing us light pollution in the form of radiation that has been travelling through space for thousands of years! These kinds of images are known to be extremely popular with astronomy enthusiasts.
