It is great that the product has less saturated fat, salt and calories compared to other products on the market but it still contains a lot of saturated fat (3.2g per 100g) and sodium (0.49g per 100g). According to the NHS we should be eating no more than 7g of saturated fats per day and only eat food which has less than 6g salt (sodium) per 100g.
