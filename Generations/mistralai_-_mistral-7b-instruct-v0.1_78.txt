 The Syrian civil war has been ongoing since 2011 and has led to widespread humanitarian crises and the displacement of millions of people. President Obama had previously expressed his support for military intervention in Syria, but now, with Congress on recess, he is facing resistance from both Democrats and Republicans who are wary of another costly foreign war.

Obama has argued that military action in Syria would help to stabilize the region and prevent the spread of ISIS, which has been linked to terrorist attacks around the world. However, many members of Congress have expressed concerns about the potential risks and costs of such an intervention.

There are also concerns that the United States could be drawn deeper into the conflict without a clear strategy for achieving its objectives. Additionally, there is uncertainty about how Russia would respond to any military action in Syria, as it has been a key ally of the Syrian government.

It is possible that Obama may need to work hard to build support for military intervention in Syria, including convincing Congress and the American people of the need for such action. However, given the ongoing nature of the conflict and the risks involved, it remains to be seen whether this will be an easy sell.
