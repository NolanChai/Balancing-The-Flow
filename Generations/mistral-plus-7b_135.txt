The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has been a major concern for coastal communities along the Gulf Coast. In order to mitigate any potential damage, the states and visitorsâ€™ bureaus have implemented various measures to inform the public about the situation. They are working hard to provide updated information on the oil spill, as well as reassure beach-bound travelers that they can still visit these areas safely. To this end, many states and visitor bureaus have created websites dedicated to providing up-to-date news and information regarding the oil spill. These sites include maps of affected areas, updates on cleanup efforts, safety guidelines for visitors, and other helpful resources. In addition, they are also working with local businesses, such as hotels, restaurants, and tour operators, to ensure that they have the most accurate and up-to-date information available regarding any potential risks associated with the oil spill.
