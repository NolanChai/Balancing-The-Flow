Lord Justice General Lord Gill, who carried out an investigation into the scandal at St Ninian's High School in East Kilbride, South Lanarkshire, said former Archbishop of Glasgow Cardinal Thomas Winning knew about the allegations against Father James MacRae but failed to act.
The report added that there was a "cover-up" and that Lord Hope - who is now Lord President of the Court of Session - was responsible for the failure to deal with the allegations in 1973, when he was a priest.
Lord Winning died in 2001 and Lord Hope left St Ninian's the same year to become Scotland's most senior judge.
