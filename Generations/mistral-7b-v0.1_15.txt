1) I will create an app that will allow users to find out about local events in their area. This is a new type of app which will give users information on everything from music gigs to art exhibitions and even free cinema screenings. Users can search by location or category, and the app will show them all the upcoming events in their area.

2) I have not used React Native before but I am excited about learning it because it is a cross-platform framework that allows you to build native apps for both iOS and Android using JavaScript. This means that developers can write code once and have it work on both platforms, which saves time and resources. I think this will be really useful for me as I want to be able to develop my app for both iOS and Android users.

3) The biggest challenge for me will be learning how to use React Native effectively. It is a new framework so there are not many tutorials or documentation available yet. However, I am confident that I can learn quickly and adapt to the new technology.

4) I hope to complete my app by the end of next month. This gives me plenty of time to learn React Native and get comfortable with developing for both iOS and Android devices. I am excited about this project and I think it will be a great learning experience!
