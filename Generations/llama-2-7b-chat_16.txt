Sir Roger Moore, the actor best known for playing James Bond in seven films between 1973 and 1985, was not just a suave and sophisticated spy on screen, but also had a wicked sense of humor off-screen. In his autobiography, "Bond On Bond," Moore reveals that he has at times enjoyed a martini, much like his character in the films. However, Moore's love for martinis was not just limited to their taste, as he also appreciated their cultural significance and the role they played in the James Bond franchise.
