Vin Diesel was spotted breaking down in tears as he visited the site where his Fast and Furious co-star Paul Walker died in a car crash on Saturday. The actor, who was visibly moved by the visit, laid flowers at the memorial and took time to speak with fans who had gathered at the scene.
"It's hard to believe that such a tragic accident happened here," Diesel said in a tearful statement to reporters. "Paul was like a brother to me and I'm still in shock about his passing. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends during this difficult time."
Diesel, who had been filming a commercial in the area at the time of the crash, said he was grateful for the outpouring of support from fans around the world. "Paul's legacy will live on through the Fast and Furious franchise and all the lives he touched," he added.
The accident occurred on Saturday afternoon when Walker's Porsche Carrera GT crashed into a tree in the Santa Clarita area of California. The 40-year-old actor was pronounced dead at the scene, along with his friend Roger Rodas, who was also driving the car.
