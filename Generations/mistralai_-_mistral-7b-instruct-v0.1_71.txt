 Alex Salmond, the former First Minister of Scotland, has been revealed to have had a guest role in a little-known Pakistani soap opera called "Mera Kucchi Mari Kucchi" (My Love My Love) back in 2015. The appearance was part of a week-long visit to Pakistan at the time and is said to have been a lighthearted moment for Salmond during his travels. The revelation comes after a video clip from the show resurfaced on social media today.
