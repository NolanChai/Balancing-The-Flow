The moment John Oddie, 75, watched his father being shot dead by a sniper during World War II. Oddie was a child living with his family at 'Trundle Station', near Coolamon in country NSW when he witnessed the harrowing incident on his family's property in December 1940 . Mr Oddie, 75, who now lives on the land that has been owned by his family since the 1830s, was just five years old at the time of the tragedy. His father Jack Oddie had bought Trundle Station from his brother-in-law in 1926 and with a team of stockmen ran 5,000 head of sheep on 430,000 acres of land. 'It was just a normal day,' Mr Oddie told Daily Mail Australia . 'My father and uncle had just got up to go out for the day. They went over to the truck and that's when my dad was shot.' The men were taking tools back to a camp in the bush and as they drove past, Mr Oddie said he heard what sounded like two loud explosions. 'He got hit by machine gun fire and I remember seeing him lying on the ground,' he added . Mr Oddie's uncle Bill and father Jack Oddie had purchased Trundle Station from Bill's brother-in-law in 1926 (pictured) and ran sheep on a large area of land - which is still owned by their descendants . Mr Oddie was just five years old when he witnessed his father, uncle and farmhand being shot at. He said he remembers hearing two loud explosions from the gun fire - which sounded like bullets hitting metal (pictured) 'My dad got hit first with a bullet in the back of the head and my uncle was shot in the face. The man who owned the station came running out, saying "where's your stockmen?" 'My father said he had been shot but I don't remember how much else he said because we were under attack.' When the shots rang out Mr Oddie said his family ran towards their home at a breakneck pace, and then hid in their bedrooms. He was so young that he wasn't even aware of what was happening until later on . The property was used by the Australian military during World War II as part of an operational area for air raids over Japan . 'I was only five but I knew something bad had happened,' Mr Oddie said, recalling his memories from that day. He added: 'We ran back to our home at a real good pace and hid in the bedroom.' The men were targeted while driving out of their camp on a truck in the bush . As a small child, Mr Oddie remembers being so frightened by what happened he couldn't even eat his dinner. 'My mother was quite shocked but she tried to make it sound like nothing had happened,' he said. But what he saw that day still affects him today and he has been left with a permanent reminder - the bullet lodged in the back of his father Jack Oddie's skull which can be seen on X-rays . A few days later, Mr Oddie, who is pictured above as a young boy, witnessed an ambulance drive past taking his uncle to hospital. He also said that after hearing news reports of the attack he learned of the devastating injuries suffered by his father's farmhand and friend . 'He had been shot in the face and I never saw him again,' Mr Oddie added. The men were taking tools back to a camp when they were shot at by Japanese soldiers who were on nearby Mount Kaputar. It wasn't until much later that he realised how serious the incident was, he said . 'My father had been shot in the head and I don't remember being told much about what happened,' Mr Oddie added. 'I guess they didn't want me to worry too much.'

The men were targeted while driving out of their camp on a truck in the bush. 'He had been shot in the face and I never saw him again,' Mr Oddie added . Mr Oddie's uncle Bill (pictured) survived his injuries but suffered brain damage and died 18 months later at the age of just 43 from complications as a result of his head wound. His father Jack was not as lucky, however . 'It took me a while to realise what had happened,' he said. 'I still remember the bullet being there on my dad's X-ray.' In 1968 Mr Oddie joined the Royal Australian Regiment and served for nearly four decades as an infantry soldier in Malaysia, Borneo and Vietnam .

In 1968, he joined the Royal Australian Regiment and served for nearly four decades as an infantry soldier in Malaysia, Borneo and Vietnam before retiring with the rank of major. 'I did my job and I think what happened to my father had a big influence on that,' Mr Oddie said. 'It's not something you forget easily.' He added: 'My family moved into town at the time but we were back here for Christmas - which is why it was such a shock when they came and got us. We couldn't believe what happened to my dad and uncle.'

The men who carried out the attack on Mr Oddie's father, uncle and farmhand have been commemorated by a memorial in Sydney's ANZAC Bridge park.
