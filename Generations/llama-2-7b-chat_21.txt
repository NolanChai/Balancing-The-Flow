Khan, who is currently preparing for his fight against Chris Algieri on Saturday night, took to Twitter to hit back at Mayweather's recent comments in which he labelled Khan a "baby".
"Floyd Mayweather thinks I'm just a 'baby'? LOL, little does he know I'm more famous than him worldwide," Khan tweeted.
