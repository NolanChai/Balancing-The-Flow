> Famous in which way? The only reason you are famous is because of your last name. You were not even that great of a boxer. You had too many excuses for why you did not do well in fights. Floyd Mayweather will always be known as the best pound-for-pound fighter to ever live, and Amir Khan was just a nobody who got lucky in his career.
