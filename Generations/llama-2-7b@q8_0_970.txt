1. A new form of methamphetamine has been found in a Texas City middle school after a group of eight-grade students was arrested for selling it. The drug is called “spice” and contains synthetic compounds that are intended to be similar to the active ingredients in marijuana or Ecstasy.
2. This story is important because the chemical composition of this new form of methamphetamine has not been studied before. Scientists don’t know how harmful it could be for people who smoke it, but they have reason to believe that it may be very dangerous.
3. The students were arrested on Wednesday after they sold spice to a fellow student at Texas City Middle School during the lunch break. They had been using and selling spice since September and sold their wares through social media sites such as Facebook, according to police reports.
4. Police say that most of these cases involve middle school students who have been smoking spice for a while before being caught red-handed by school authorities or parents, but some teens may use it once and then quit due to health concerns about its side effects.
5. According to law enforcement officials in Texas City, 45 schools across America have reported incidents involving students selling spice or other forms of synthetic marijuana since January 2013 when Texas passed a new law outlawing the substance.
