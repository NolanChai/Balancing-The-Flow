The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add a "black box" label warning — the agency’s strongest — to alert patients of possible tendon ruptures and tendonitis.

The FDA said the antibiotics that carry this risk include fluoroquinolones, such as Cipro (ciprofloxacin), Levaquin (levofloxacin) and Avelox (moxifloxacin). The agency said these drugs can cause serious side effects to the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves and central nervous system.

“The risk of developing a serious adverse reaction from fluoroquinolones should be balanced with the potential benefits of taking these drugs,” Dr. Sandra Kweder, acting director of FDA’s Office of Antimicrobial Products, said in a statement. “In many cases, appropriate treatment options exist that do not involve fluoroquinolones.”
