- I thought this was pretty interesting how it said "The stopped watch, pipe and other last possessions of a First World War hero have gone on display 99 years after his death." The fact that he had a stop watch with him on the battlefield is really cool to know. I would have never thought about that.
- I also found it interesting how they described the items in detail such as "A pocket watch found inside Mr Twiteâ€™s tunic was stopped at 10:30am and his pipe was full of tobacco, while his cigarettes were untouched." This really made me feel like I could picture what was going on.
- The article also included the name of the man who found all the items and how he did it "Mr Twiteâ€™s watch, pipe and other belongings were discovered in 1987 by a farmer near the battlefield." This gives more credit to the man who found these items instead of just having them be found without any information.
- The article also gave a lot of information about what happened before he was killed so it makes the reader feel like they are there and know everything that is going on.
- I really liked how they described the watch in detail because it made me feel like I could picture it and know exactly what it looked like. "The gold fob watch, found inside his tunic, shows a minute hand fixed at 10:30am." This gave the reader more information than just saying that there was a watch with him.
- The article also included some pictures of the items which made the story even better because it showed exactly what they looked like and how big/small they were. "The soldierâ€™s pipe, full of tobacco, and his cigarettes, untouched." This gave more information than just saying that he had a pipe with him.
- The article also mentioned how long ago this happened which makes it feel even older because we know how old the items are now. "His body was discovered 99 years later in November 1987 by farmer Richard Smith, who was ploughing his fields near Passchendaele." This gave more information than just saying that he was found.
- The article also included a quote from Mr Smith which made it feel even more real because we know what happened to him after he found the items. "He said: â€˜It is very moving to think this man, who had been dead for 72 years, was just lying in my field." This gave me more information about what happened to him after he found the items.
- The article also mentioned how they will be on display which makes it even better because we know where we can go see them and learn more about them. "The soldierâ€™s watch, pipe and other belongings will now be on permanent display at the museum." This gave me more information about what happened to him after he found the items.
