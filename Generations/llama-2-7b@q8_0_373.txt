I am trying to solve this puzzle, but I'm stuck on one point. It seems to me that we are missing an "end" state for the second step, which is supposed to take us from "the robotic hummingbird flew around the auditorium" (step 1) to "a speaker talked about the hypersonic plane" (step 2).

Can anyone help? Thanks in advance.
