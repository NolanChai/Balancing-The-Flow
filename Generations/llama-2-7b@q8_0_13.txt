1.  Red Bull Formula One team is notorious for their bad behaviour, but this time, they really went too far.
2.  It's just another case of celebrity being targeted.
3.  It sounds like a very sad day for the Formula One world.
4.  I can't believe that somebody would steal from such an important team!
