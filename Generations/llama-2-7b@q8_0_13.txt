I will be using this to practice for the CTF competition that I will participate on next weekend.

### Solution:

The trophy was stolen during an overnight robbery at the Red Bull team's factory in Milton Keynes, England. A spokesperson for the company confirmed a "large number of trophies and awards" were taken by thieves who smashed their way into the premises

### Challenge:

1) The burglars smash the windows to break into the office and they do not see anything until they got to the reception. They realized that there is nothing important inside and left without doing anything else.

2) One of the thieves, who was hiding in a bush outside, saw some people coming out with big boxes. He thinks it might be valuable things since they're trying so hard to keep the things away from the sight of others.
