The president is right to end America's longest war -- one that was started by George W. Bush and continued by Barack Obama, but he needs to be more forthcoming with the American people about what comes next in Afghanistan.

While it may not be politically popular for the president to admit that America will be fighting terrorists around the world for generations, that is the truth of the matter and we must recognize this. If there are still terrorist bases or operations going on in Afghanistan then the US needs to make sure these threats are dealt with immediately and permanently. The people who do not want our troops to stay after 2016 claim that if they were left over, then other countries would attack them as if our troops being there is causing trouble for them. However, we have already seen what happens when America leaves without finishing the job and a terrorist haven is created in Afghanistan. If we leave now, then we are just making the same mistake that has been made before and it will cause more deaths of innocents around the world as well as Americans on American soil.
