 It seems that in your description, you're referring to a situation during a football match where Juan Mata scored a goal but wasn't deemed offside by the referee, despite it appearing that he might have been in an offside position. This can indeed be a contentious moment as it may impact the outcome of the game if the goal stands or gets disallowed. However, without specific details about the match and the exact situation, I can't provide a more precise analysis. It's always important to remember that referees make decisions based on the laws of the game, and sometimes, fans or players may disagree with their interpretations.
