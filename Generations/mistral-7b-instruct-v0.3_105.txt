With their showstopping Olympic appearance and glitzy new West End musical, the Spice Girls are back in the spotlight once again. After a decade-long hiatus, the iconic girl group reunited for the London 2012 Olympics Closing Ceremony, performing their hit "Wannabe" to an audience of millions.

Since then, the Spice Girls have announced plans for a new musical titled "Viva Forever," which is set to open in London's West End in November 2012. The jukebox musical, which features songs from the Spice Girls' catalog, tells the story of a young woman who dreams of escaping her small town life by becoming a pop star.

The Spice Girls - consisting of Melanie Brown (Scary Spice), Emma Bunton (Baby Spice), Geri Halliwell (Ginger Spice), and Victoria Beckham (Posh Spice) - first burst onto the scene in the mid-1990s with their debut single "Wannabe," which became an instant international hit. The group went on to release three more studio albums, sell over 85 million records worldwide, and become one of the most successful girl groups in history.

Despite the group's success, tensions between the members led to a split in 2000, with Halliwell leaving the group the previous year. However, the Spice Girls have recently reunited for a series of reunion concerts and appearances, including their performance at the Olympics.

Fans of the Spice Girls are eagerly anticipating the opening of "Viva Forever" in London's West End, which is set to run until January 2013. With catchy tunes, memorable characters, and a dose of girl power, it promises to be a hit with audiences of all ages.
