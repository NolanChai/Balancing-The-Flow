It's too bad that they don't realize that.

## Instruction:
Their little boy had been born prematurely and had spent the first three months of his life in an incubator at the local hospital before he was well enough to go home.

### Response:
That's too bad, it's great that they have a son.

## Instruction:
Today is the day he is coming over for tea.

### Response:
Sounds like fun! Is tea time at your house exciting?

## Instruction:
His father was out of work so it had been a struggle to pay the bills but they'd managed and now here they were, happy and healthy.

### Response:
Good for them, I am glad that they are doing well!

## Instruction:
But there is no way he would be able to visit without his mother making a huge cake so she has been up since dawn baking away.

### Response:
I think you have made the right decision about not working, with your family and financial struggles it was the best thing to do for them!

## Instruction:
His father had been out of work as well but now he was back at work full time so life was looking up.

### Response:
That is great news!! I am happy that they can afford healthy food and clothes with dad working again.

## Instruction:
I hope you enjoy it! Is there a specific topic or area of interest you would like me to research? I'm all ears and my best advice comes from knowledgeable information.

### Response:
There is no specific subject, but the narrative was interesting.

## Instruction:
And now she had a son who she loved more than anything in the world so her decision was the right one after all.

### Response:
It's nice to hear that you are satisfied with your decision!

## Instruction:
Samuel is their only child, and his father had been out of work when he was born so she had no choice but to stop working and stay home to look after him full time.

### Response:
It's great to hear that they have a lovely son together! I hope you are able to get back into working in the future.

## Instruction:
The Dymotts have been living in a small cottage outside of London for as long as Samuel can remember.

### Response:
I'm glad they could afford it!

## Instruction:
It was just a one bedroom, with a tiny patchy garden but it was theirs and that is all that mattered to them.

### Response:
That sounds like a nice place to live, not very big though. But I guess for the price you couldn't ask for much more could you?

## Instruction:
Now she has her son to help her around the house and garden so it is much easier and she doesn't have to go out to work.

### Response:
I am glad that they can afford a home with a yard now! It must be nice to have space for him.

## Instruction:
Samuel had been a very happy baby and although he was small and not yet walking or talking, she'd never worried about his development.

### Response:
That is good that it has gone well so far! Is there anything specific you would like to research?

## Instruction:
When Samuel had been three months old they had taken him home from the hospital and life was tough.

### Response:
I hope he is doing better now.

## Instruction:
His mother hadn't worked for two years but she missed working, her mind felt so empty.

### Response:
It must have been really hard to take care of him alone and be home all day.

## Instruction:
Their first winter together had been a struggle.

### Response:
I hope they are able to get by this winter. It's nice that she has help with the housework now, especially if it was difficult before.

## Instruction:
His father would have loved his son but she hadn't wanted him to know because she felt guilty and didn't want her son growing up without a father around.

### Response:
I think that is selfish of them, he deserves to know both of you! You can always find ways to co-parent even if the situation isn't ideal.

## Instruction:
She had thought she would have hated being at home all day but in fact she'd never been happier as it meant she could be with her son all day long and help him develop properly.

### Response:
I think that is great, it must be so nice to spend so much time with your child! Would you like some suggestions for activities to do together?

## Instruction:
He was a lovely boy though and she had no regrets over keeping her son away from his father.

### Response:
I'm glad she has been able to stay home with him and that he has grown up in such a loving environment!

## Instruction:
Samuel had developed so well, and she had spent all day everyday making sure he was happy and healthy.

### Response:
That sounds like a lot of work but it's great that you are dedicated to your child! Would you like help with anything or suggestions for fun activities to do?

## Instruction:
She loved him so much, she would never have given up her son no matter what the cost had been.

### Response:
I am glad to hear it! Do you have any other kids?

## Instruction:
His father wasn't even aware that he existed until Samuel was six months old and when he found out, she didn't let him anywhere near her or his son.

### Response:
It is good to hear they are not in contact anymore! It sounds like it would be best for everyone if they stayed away from each other.
