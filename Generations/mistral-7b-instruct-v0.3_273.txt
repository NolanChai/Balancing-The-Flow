 It seems that the TV show featuring Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, titled "Rob Ford: Dirty Little Secrets," has been canceled. This decision came a day after its premiere on the Reality Network. The show's cancellation might be related to the ongoing controversy surrounding Mayor Ford and his personal life, which has been well-documented in recent years. For more specific details about the reasons behind this decision or updates on the situation, I recommend checking reputable news sources such as CNN, CBC News, or the Toronto Star for the most accurate information.
