Aston Villa have been struggling with scoring goals this season, especially during their recent run of games. They have gone through an unprecedented goal drought that has lasted for more than ten games now. The club’s worst run of form in recent years has seen them fail to score a single goal in eight consecutive matches, resulting in their worst goal-scoring performance in over 150 years.

The lack of goals has been a major problem for the Villans this season and has had a significant impact on their results. With no goals coming from the team, they have suffered defeat after defeat, falling down the table rapidly. The club’s worst goal drought since 1924 has caused them to fall into relegation danger as they continue to struggle for points.
