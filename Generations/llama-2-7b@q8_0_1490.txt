The above argument is incorrect.
First of all, the author mentions nothing about how easy it is to move waste handling or chemical plants from wealthy areas to less wealthy areas.

Secondly, even though the article does not mention that moving power plants would be difficult, the same is true.

Thirdly, there are several reasons why these systems are located in poorer areas:
1. They make money and contribute to local economies.
2. There are fewer regulations or environmental restrictions on them in poorer areas.
3. They are often built near coal mines to be less expensive because they can buy the coal directly from the mine.
