Amir Khan has hit back at insults from America’s flamboyant world champion Floyd Mayweather by claiming he is more famous than the welterweight known as the best pound-for-pound fighter on the planet. The 24-year-old said: “I am bigger than him in terms of fame and I have a lot more fans.”
Khan, who lost a controversial decision to Mayweather in Las Vegas in December, also dismissed suggestions that his opponent was the better fighter. He added: “Floyd is good but he is not as good as me. People say he is the best pound-for-pound boxer but I am better than him.”
