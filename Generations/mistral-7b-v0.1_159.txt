```python
import geopy
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

location = input('Enter a location: ')
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="myGeocoder")
place = geolocator.geocode(location)
lat = place.latitude
lon = place.longitude
print("Latitude:", lat)
print("Longitude:", lon)
```

### Output:
```python
Enter a location: uxbridge
Latitude: 51.56320899999999
Longitude: -0.475611
```

### Explanation:
The code imports the geopy and Nominatim modules. It then prompts the user to enter a location, which is stored in the `location` variable. The geolocator is initialized with the Nominatim geocoder and used to find the location of the input using the `geocode()` method.

The latitude and longitude of the location are extracted from the `place` object and printed to the console.
