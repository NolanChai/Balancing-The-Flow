 When comedian Stephen Colbert wins a contest to name a part of the International Space Station, NASA would likely acknowledge his win and possibly collaborate with him to give the named component an interesting and engaging moniker. However, it's important to note that space stations are typically given official names that adhere to international agreements and avoid humor or personal references.

In this specific instance, NASA announced that the U.S. Destiny laboratory module on the ISS would be renamed after Colbert in a ceremonial capacity for an episode of his late-night talk show, "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert." The actual name of the lab remained unchanged. So, when this situation occurred, NASA celebrated the collaboration and used it as a fun opportunity to engage with the public and promote space exploration.
