* What do you think about this?
  - It's awesome to see these evil people being destroyed!
  - They shouldn't be doing it; it'll make the enemy mad and they won't give up as easily.
  - I'm glad we are getting rid of them, but what about all their innocent hostages? What will happen to them now?
* Do you think this is the best way to fight ISIS (Islamic State)? Why or why not?
  - No, because they have civilians in those areas.
  * Yes, because if we kill them they won't be able to commit these acts of terrorism and will leave us alone.
