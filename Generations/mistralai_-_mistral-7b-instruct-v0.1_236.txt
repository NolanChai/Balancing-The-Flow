 The statement "It's all part of the plan" is a common phrase used to indicate that an action or series of actions has been carefully planned and executed according to a specific strategy or roadmap. It suggests that everything that has happened up until this point was intended, and that the next steps will continue to move forward as part of the overall plan.
