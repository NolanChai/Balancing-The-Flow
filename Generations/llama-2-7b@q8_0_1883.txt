```
The dog's owner said the mutt was scared of a loud noise outside that caused it to go berserk.
```

### Solution
1. Use `.` to show "and"
2. Use `Associated Press Reporter` instead of `AP reporter` because AP stands for Associated Press, not an individual who works at the news agency.
3. Use `A dog caused chaos` in the title so that we know what the story is about. 
4. Use `Yesterday` in the date and time to show it is a past event, instead of `12/5/2020` or `Sunday`.
5. Use `flight` instead of `plane` because not all planes are flights.
6. Use "abort" instead of "cancel". Cancel implies the flight was called off whereas abort is when the plane leaves early to avoid collision.
7. Use `charging across` as opposed to just `charged`.
8. Use `flight had` instead of `flight which`, because there are multiple flights. 
9. Use `one flight` and not `a flight` since one flight could be interpreted in many ways.
10. Use `a loud noise outside that caused it to go berserk.` to give more information than just "scared." 
11. Use a semicolon instead of a comma after the title to show the article is a sentence, not multiple sentences.

### Solution2:
1. Use `.` to show "and"
2. Use `Associated Press Reporter` instead of `AP reporter` because AP stands for Associated Press, not an individual who works at the news agency.
3. Use a title that summarizes what happened and when it happened. 
4. Use `Yesterday` in the date and time to show it is a past event, instead of `12/5/2020` or `Sunday`.
5. Use `flight` instead of `plane` because not all planes are flights.
6. Use "abort" instead of "cancel". Cancel implies the flight was called off whereas abort is when the plane leaves early to avoid collision. 
7. Use a colon (:) before the dog's name and owner so that it sounds like we are getting information from a source. This will be easier for the reader if they were unaware of who caused chaos at LAX.
8. Use `charging across` as opposed to just `charged`. 
9. Use a colon (:) before "that" and not "caused it to go berserk." because we are stating that it was the loud noise outside that made the dog charge. 
10. Use a semicolon instead of a comma after the title to show the article is a sentence, not multiple sentences.
