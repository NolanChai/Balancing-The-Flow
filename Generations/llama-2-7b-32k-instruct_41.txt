A Russian businesswoman was granted a divorce from her husband John Yates who is one of the three former senior policemen who have been accused of being involved in the murder of Daniel Morgan. A London court heard that the couple had met on an online dating website and he married the Russian woman in 2015 despite being separated from his wife. She has now applied for divorce proceedings which were granted today.
