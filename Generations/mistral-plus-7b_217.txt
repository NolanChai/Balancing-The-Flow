Diane Keaton today reiterated her support for her friend and longtime collaborator Woody Allen following allegations of abuse made earlier this year by his daughter Dylan Farrow. Speaking to the BBC at the 2014 BAFTAs, she said that she has known Allen for years and that he is an “amazing” filmmaker who would never do anything so terrible as what his daughter is accusing him of. She also expressed sympathy for both sides involved in this difficult situation.
