In a small cave at Mount Parnitha, near Athens, there is a famous painting. A red-figure vase was also found in the cave which is thought to have been painted by one of the world’s oldest painters around 1600 BC, making it more than 3,500 years old. The painting depicts two boys fighting – perhaps in a mock battle or an actual fight - and has been named “The Boxers”. However, this famous scene is not what it seems. A recent study of the cave has revealed that the children in the fresco were actually female and not male. This study is also the first to provide evidence for DNA analysis on ancient Greek artefacts – specifically two teeth found inside a clay jar within the cave. Researchers from the University College London and Athens University analysed genetic material extracted from the teeth, which revealed that they belonged to two young women who lived between 1250 BC to 700 BC. The research is part of a study by the University College London’s Genetics Institute, in collaboration with the University of Athens and the French National Centre for Scientific Research, and it has been published in the journal Antiquity. Professor Martin Richards from UCL led the project: “We wanted to show that ancient DNA works on artefacts such as these, which are usually the most fragile part of any archaeological site,” he said. “The Greek Genetics Project was one of our first projects and it is a great success story because we have been able to test over 200 individuals from different sites.” According to Richards, the study is not only important as a scientific research project but it also has implications for understanding the past and what people looked like in ancient Greece. “It was an interesting question – are there any genetic links between modern-day Greeks and the early inhabitants of Ancient Greece?” he said. The cave of Mount Parnitha is one of the most important archaeological sites on the Acropolis. It dates back to a time when Greece was ruled by the Mycenaean civilisation, which flourished between 1600 BC and around 1100 BC. “There were no DNA studies done before because you just couldn’t extract anything from the bones of these people,” said Professor George Chatzikosta from Athens University. “The bone is soft, so it doesn’t preserve DNA but teeth do.” The results of the study show that two female skeletons, one around 15 and the other 20 to 30 years old, were buried inside the cave in separate pits. However, they lived at different times – the older individual died between 1480-1370 BC while the younger person’s time of death is estimated at around 750 BC to 600 BC. “This shows that there was a break in burial practice for about two centuries,” said Professor Chatzikosta. He added that the genetic material found on the teeth suggests that the individuals were of Greek origin. According to Professor George Kotsakis from Athens University, there is evidence that the Minoans – one of Greece’s oldest civilisations who ruled Crete around 2700 BC to 1450 BC - may have migrated from Egypt rather than the other way round. “In our opinion, they came as refugees and left their own culture behind,” he said. This theory is based on evidence found in a cave near Athens called Arolithos Cave, which dates back to 3250 BC and has paintings of children playing with miniature boats. Professor Kotsakis also points out that the Greeks had no ships until around 1400 BC and the first settlements on Crete were only founded in 2000 BC by people who migrated from mainland Greece. “The theory that they came as refugees is quite widespread,” he said, adding that other scientists believe this may have been a result of flooding caused by tectonic changes during the time period known as the Messinian Salinity Crisis between 5 to 1.6 million years ago. “The Aegean Sea was dried out and the Mediterranean was full of salt,” said Professor Kotsakis, who is also an archaeologist at Athens University. He added that this theory may also be supported by fossils found in the area, which show signs of a large human population. “These people are thought to have been refugees from mainland Greece,” he said. However, Professor Chatzikosta believes that the two women were most likely born on Crete and their remains would have been brought there as part of an exchange between traders or pirates. The study of ancient DNA has only just begun but according to Professor Richards it is important for understanding how our ancestors lived in the past, especially when looking at diseases like malaria, which was thought to have killed 10 million people during the Middle Ages and continues to be a problem in sub-Saharan Africa today. “This study has shown that ancient DNA can give us information on health conditions in ancient populations,” he said. The project is part of an ongoing collaboration between UCL, Athens University and the French National Centre for Scientific Research to use archaeological samples to understand how diseases spread over time as well as their impact on society. According to Professor Chatzikosta, this research may be able to show what diseases were prevalent in ancient Greece, which could give us a better understanding of modern-day illnesses and help identify cures for them. However, he also cautions that it is difficult to extrapolate from the past as different cultures had different ways of dealing with disease – some people buried their dead while others disposed of bodies in rivers or on mountainsides. “It’s hard to say exactly what they were like but we know that ancient Greeks probably lived longer than people living today,” he said. The next step for this study is to try and identify which diseases affected the two individuals by analysing their genomes – which is currently underway - as well as examining skeletal remains in order to determine whether there were any genetic differences between them that could have caused deaths from infectious or non-infectious diseases like cancer. “The Greek Genetics Project has been a huge success,” said Professor Richards, who is also involved with the project alongside Professor Chatzikosta and their colleagues at Athens University and France’s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS). “We have been able to test over 200 individuals from different sites across Greece as well as some of Europe’s oldest human remains.” He added that this project is also part of a larger study called the Human Genome Diversity Project, which looks at genomes from all over the world and uses it for research. “We have been able to compare modern-day populations with ancient DNA samples so we can see how humans adapted,” Professor Richards said. The Greek Genetics project is not only important for understanding our ancestors but also helps us understand what life was like in Ancient Greece as well as identifying any differences between past and present generations that may have been caused by disease or other factors such as climate change. According to Professor Chatzikosta, this study has shown that ancient DNA can be used for archaeological purposes if it is properly preserved so researchers are now looking at ways of extracting DNA from bones which could lead to future breakthroughs in this area of science.
