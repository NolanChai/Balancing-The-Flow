The BACtrack Mobile is a mobile phone application (app) which allows you to track your blood alcohol content (BAC), and then post the results directly from the app onto your social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter or email. The product was designed for those who enjoy the odd drink now and then, but want to be able to check if they are over the legal limit before driving home, and can also help people make better decisions about drinking alcohol. It is a great idea that will not only promote responsible drinking but also reduce the number of drunk drivers on the road.

The app works by blowing into a mouthpiece which is connected to your mobile phone via a Bluetooth connection. The app then determines the BAC based on the alcohol concentration in your breath and provides you with an estimate of what the BAC would be in your blood. The device can also tell you how long it will take for your BAC to return to 0.00% if you choose not to drive after drinking.
The app is available from the Apple iTunes store, and costs Â£3.99 (as of April 2014). The product was designed by two British brothers who were inspired by their own experiences with drink driving, and want to help people make better decisions about alcohol consumption.

### Conclusion:
The BACtrack Mobile app is a great idea that will not only promote responsible drinking but also reduce the number of drunk drivers on the road. The device is easy to use and provides accurate readings, making it an ideal tool for those who enjoy the occasional drink now and then.
