* You should be able to identify what the instruction is.
* What does `instruction` refer? It refers a keyword of the Python language and you should find it at line 12.
* What type of instruction is that?
* Is it valid? If not, why not?
* In general, how would you tell whether an instruction is valid or invalid in this context?
* Why would `instruction` be considered a keyword in the first place?
* Does `instruction` look like a variable name to you? It does. Why itâ€™s not? Because it's not allowed by the Python language specification for a variable name, so it is invalid as an identifier and thus not valid as an instruction either.
### Example:
```python
from os import system

system('git checkout -f main')
```
