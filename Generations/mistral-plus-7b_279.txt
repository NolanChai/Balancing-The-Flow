The girlfriend of Aaron Swartz has called an investigation into his death a “whitewash”. Taren Stinebrickner-Kauffman, the co-founder of activist group SumOfUs, said that there are still questions surrounding the 26-year-old’s suicide in January.

Ms Stinebrickner-Kauffman is among a number of people who believe Mr Swartz killed himself because he was facing federal charges for hacking into MIT’s computer network.

He stole millions of academic journals from JSTOR, an online archive of academic papers, and could have faced up to 35 years in prison if found guilty of the charges. Ms Stinebrickner-Kauffman said she believed that prosecutors had pushed for an excessive sentence which drove Mr Swartz to suicide.

“The investigation into Aaron’s death has been a whitewash, and it is clear that this is not going to change,” she said in a statement released by SumOfUs. “Aaron didn’t commit suicide because he was depressed. He was depressed because he was being pursued by an overzealous prosecutor.”

Ms Stinebrickner-Kauffman added: “The Department of Justice has failed to answer the questions raised by this case, and is trying desperately to sweep it under the rug. They will not succeed.”
