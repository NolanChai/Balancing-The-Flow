No, sorry. I don't understand why you keep asking about my foreign languages other than English. I know a little Japanese and some basic Chinese.

"Yes, Japanese and Chinese are closely related languages. Itâ€™s amazing how similar they are, but yet different enough to be considered two separate languages."

"I took the JLPT level 2 exam in Japan last year, but I'm currently working towards my goal of reaching JLPT N2 this year."
