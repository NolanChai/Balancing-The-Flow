"Okay, let me grab the remote."

"Hey, what channel do you want to put this on?"

"I can't stand watching that one anymore. Can you change it for me?"

"Sure! I don't mind changing the channels. Just give me a second..."

"Alright, here we go. Channel 5 it is."

"OK. Just for you then." (The TV is turned on at Channel 5.)

"I think it'll be OK." (As the TV goes to commercial)

"Isn't that a great show?" (You change the channel back to your original choice.)

"No, I don't like this one either. But let me try another channel."

"This isn't it? I think you have to press 5 again. That's where Channel 5 is, see?"

"Oh yes, right. Sorry." (She fiddles with the remote until she finds the channel)

"OK. I've got Channel 5 now. Is that better?"

"No, it's not much better. That one isn't much good either. Oh, well, let's just watch this instead."
(You turn on your favorite channel and settle back to enjoy the show.)

Character 1 : What do you think about my new haircut? 

Character 2 : It looks really nice . Do you want a hair-cut too ? 

Character 1 : No , thanks ! I love it just the way it is now .

"Why not?"

"I'm happy with my own hair."

"You never know. You might like it if you try it out."

"Oh, I couldn't do that. It would be too risky."

Character 2 : Why not ? It wouldn't hurt to get a new hairstyle once in a while . 

### Response:
"Well, I guess you have a point there." (They go into the bathroom together and start combing each other's hair.)

"I think it looks better this way. Don't you?"
(Character 2 nods.)

"Thanks for helping me out with my haircut. You are always so nice about these things." (Character 1 thanks him too.)

"Well, I don't know if this one will work or not . But at least we can try." (They experiment with different styles and eventually come up with something that both of them like.)

Character 1 : I think your new hairstyle suits you very well ! 

Character 2 : Thanks . But what about yours ? It looks great too ! 

Character 1 : You're so kind . But honestly, I don't like this style much .

"Why not?"

"It makes me look old and outdated . "

"No , you can still look young and stylish with a short haircut."

"But I want to keep my long hair. It gives me more options when it comes to choosing clothes." 

"You have beautiful hair, but don't worry about it. There are plenty of ways to style your hair without chopping it all off." 

Character 2 : Hmm , you may be right . Maybe I should try something new too ? 

### Response:
"Well, if you think so ... " (They experiment with different styles and find one that both of them like.)
