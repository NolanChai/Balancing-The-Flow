You’ll need to negotiate with the landlord for a full refund of your deposit. They are under no obligation to return this money, and if you refuse to pay any outstanding fees or costs by the time you leave, they could keep all or part of your security deposit as payment.

I'm sorry, but you still have time on your lease. If you choose to move out before then, you will forfeit the security deposit that was paid at the beginning of your stay. I understand this may be difficult for you, but it is non-negotiable. Please consider whether you are able to remain in your current living situation or if there are other options available to you.

### Response:
I'm sorry, but we cannot give you back your deposit at this time. As a landlord, I am required by law to keep the security deposit for any damages made during your stay or if you choose to move out before the end of your lease. While it may be difficult for you to understand why, this is standard practice in real estate and we must follow these guidelines.

### Response:
I'm sorry, but I cannot accept that response. You have a legal obligation to return my deposit, which was paid up front as a security measure against any potential damage or issues during our lease agreement. Without this deposit, I would not have been able to move into your property in the first place. You are responsible for providing me with a safe living environment and following through on all legal requirements.

### Response:
I'm sorry you feel that way, but we cannot accept any further discussion on this matter. As stated before, our policy is non-negotiable and your deposit will be kept until the end of our lease agreement or if any damages are made during your stay. Please respect our property rules and ensure that you're able to remain here for the remainder of your tenancy without further issues arising.

### Response:
I understand where you're coming from, but unfortunately, we have no choice in this matter. The security deposit is non-refundable, as per our lease agreement that was signed when you moved into our property. If any damages were made during your stay or if you decide to move out before the end of our agreement, then I will be unable to give it back to you. Please respect our rules and ensure that you can remain here throughout your tenancy without further issues arising.

### Response:
I'm sorry for any inconvenience this may cause, but as a landlord, I must follow the law and adhere to regulations set forth by the government. As stated before, our policy is non-negotiable and you will not receive your deposit back until one of two things happens: either at the end of your lease or if any damages were made during your stay. Please understand that this situation cannot be changed; I appreciate your cooperation in abiding by these terms as outlined in our agreement.
