"Yeah, definitely. My ability in chinese is getting better and better."

"I remember when I first arrived here in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a cellphone. It took me quite some time to catch up on the conversation because they were speaking at such fast speed." 

"It is true that most Chinese love bargaining when shopping. They would not mind waiting for hours just so they can get the best deals available in town!"

You have been here for how long? Four months now? Do you know Chinese better now? Oh, definitely. I remember when I first arrived in Guangzhou, my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone. Oh yeah, many Chinese like to bargain. It happens almost everywhere.
I mean, I understand that. But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster, until it seemed to me that they would fight. My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match. The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation.
A shouting match? You're so funny! You must be exaggerating. I don't believe it.

"Actually, there is an old saying in China-the Chinese never understand the Chinese.I think it is very true. For example, a fight between two guys on a crowded street would be considered just normal if you are not used to living in China. A lot of people might even applaud that kind of fighting since they love violence so much.

It happened one time when I was riding my bike through the countryside,I saw two guys fighting each other with their fists and shouting very loudly. It scared me so much that I almost fell off my bike. But after a while I realized that this is just normal behavior for Chinese people since they love to fight or at least get angry easily."
