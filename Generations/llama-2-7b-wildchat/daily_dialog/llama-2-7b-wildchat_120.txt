Let's get right to work . What do you have planned for entertainment ? 

" I thought about having some speakers , but that may be too formal . "

" Well , if you need more ideas , we could always play games or rent a movie . "

"Yes, I completely agree. It is important to take into consideration the formality of the event and the preferences of the guests when selecting the entertainment. If it's a formal gathering, then we should definitely choose more formal forms of entertainment such as live music or a DJ. Additionally, we should also consider what kind of food would be appropriate for a formal party. In this case, I think that American food would be the best choice."

I think you missed an important part here. "Let's make sure we are on the same page." "Do we want a formal or informal gathering?" I believe the responses to this question would be the same as for "formal or informal" gathering. 

### Response:

The most likely answer from the second respondent is that they have no idea what kind of entertainment you should choose, but since you've said it needs to be a formal affair they don't feel like they can give their opinion without risking offending you or making things difficult. You could say something along the lines of "Let's make sure we are on the same page with our vision for this event so that everything runs smoothly!"

### Response:

I believe that the second response is saying they would prefer to do both food and entertainment themselves rather than split it up between you two. They may be unsure how to go about choosing a DJ or what type of music to play, but they're confident in their ability to handle both tasks. This might mean there's some conflict on the level of formality (since your first response implied an informal gathering), and it could also mean that this person thinks you aren't being clear about which aspect you want help with most. They may be trying to make sure we are "on the same page" regarding our vision for this event before giving a more detailed answer.

### Response:

The third response is saying they have no idea what type of entertainment should be chosen, but they're open to your suggestion if it's formal and appropriate for an office party. The fourth response indicates that there isn't much agreement yet on the formality level or food choice - both respondents still need some clarification from each other before making a final decision. It may also suggest some potential tension between them, as they're both trying to assert themselves and come up with their own ideas rather than collaborating together smoothly.
