I'm afraid that's not a realistic response.

Instead, the following responses are more appropriate:

1. "Well, I suppose so. It seems like they have everything!"
2. "Yes, it's pretty big! I usually eat here too."
3. "Let's go ahead and line up then. The steak looks amazing!"
4. "I think I'll get the ham and egg with French fries as well. What dessert would you like?"
5. "A slice of banana pie sounds great!"
6. (The cashier): "Would you like anything else today, sir? You can get a slice of cheesecake or chocolate cake for 30 cents."
7. "No thanks, I'll pass on the dessert. The banana pie sounds delicious!"
8. (The cashier): "Enjoy your meal, sir! Have a great day!"
