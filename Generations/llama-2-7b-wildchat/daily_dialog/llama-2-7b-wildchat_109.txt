What date would you like to depart, sir? Do you have any seats for September 16th? Let's see... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked. But I have seats for the 17th. The 17th will be fine. And what date will you be returning?

"The 17th would be great. When do we leave?"

Hmm... How about September 28th?

Okay, you're booked on American Airlines Flight 710 from John F Kennedy Airport (JFK) at 6:00 p.m. Do you have any questions for me before I can finish the booking?
