Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . Would that okay with you ? "

" I can take a little time off of work , or I could go on a weekend , also . "

" We could meet at the real estate office , or I could pick you up at your home . "

" I am leaving from work , so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . "

I will leave from work early Friday afternoon. We could meet at my house or the real estate office, either one is fine with me. You are leaving from work, so let's meet at the first house. If you want to look at 5 houses that takes most of the day but I think we need to see as many as possible so we should do it.
