" Really? Do you like it here ? What about your boss, do you have any problems with him or her? " 

" There's nothing wrong with my boss. Actually , the company is great for me since I was working there. But I don't think so that he really understands all the details of his business. "

"Nice to meet you, too! What's your name? 

I didn't expect to see someone like you here. How come you dropped into this company today?

My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office. I didn't know you were working here. What a surprise! How long have you been doing this?

Two years or so, it sounds good. 

That is great. Do you have to work the night shift?

No, in most cases I don't have to unless there's something urgent to deal with. I work five days a week.

Do you enjoy your job here?

It's hard to say. But I've got to start by working as a trainee before I can become an experienced marketing assistant. Sometimes, I am really under great pressure when it gets busy. 

That's all for now! How about we talk again after work sometime?"
