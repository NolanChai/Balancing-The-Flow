I am having a great day so far. How about you?

I haven’t been feeling the best, Mary. I hope things look up soon!

That’s okay. Maybe we can go next week instead.

Sounds good. What movie do you want to see?

That sounds nice. Let me check with my parents and I'll let you know.

Things are going well for me, too, Joe. Let's try and have a fun weekend, shall we?  I could use some time away from homework.

How about Friday night instead?

What movie did you want to see?

Hi Mary, I am doing very well today. How have you been?

Things are going well for me too. Do you want to go out tonight and watch a movie?

I've seen the new horror flick about the serial killer rapist. Is that something you want to see too?

I saw the preview, it looks pretty scary but I thought it might be interesting. 

I don't think we need to go tonight because my parents are taking me to dinner with them, and they wanted me to spend time with them alone. Do you want to go out tomorrow instead? I was thinking that I would like to see “ The Secret Life of Bees . ”
