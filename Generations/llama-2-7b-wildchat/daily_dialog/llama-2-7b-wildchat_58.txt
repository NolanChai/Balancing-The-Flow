I would write that the speaker, who is assumed to be a male and an authority figure (e.g., doctor, teacher, parent), begins with a neutral question about plans for the winter and continues with a nonverbal prompt (emphatic response of "Right" or "Yes") to indicate that he expects the listener to follow up by specifying their destination.

The speaker then makes an assumption based on previous conversations about the listener's interest in skiing, which is followed by a verbal cue ("suppose") to encourage the listener to confirm this assumption. The listener responds with a nonverbal signal (agreeable "oh yes" or "yeah"), indicating that they accept the speaker's assumptions and intend to continue the conversation.

The response would look like:

Speaker: "Where do you plan to go this winter?"
Listener: "Alps, suppose." (nonverbal prompt)
Speaker: "Oh yes, you like skiing." (nonverbal cue)
Listener: "Right." (nonverbal signal)
