Can you help me plan the office party ? Sure, what do you need the most help with, the food or entertainment?

I need help with food.

Ok, well, let's coordinate our efforts. Should this party be formal or casual?

I think it should be casual.

" Great ! The location and theme are easy enough ; so let's plan the menu for dinner . If you choose Chinese cuisine , then there is a wide array of dishes from which to select. There's Chicken Manchurian, Kung Pao chicken, General Tao's chicken, Peking Duck, and Beef and Broccoli, just to name a few . "

" Wow , that sounds good ! I can hardly wait ! "

"Sure. What do you need the most help with, food or entertainment?"

"I'd love your help with food! What are my options and what would be best for this office party?"

"I agree we should make it a casual gathering. Do you have an idea of how formal/informal we want to go? Formal, casual, or somewhere in between?"

"Well, I think we can go either way with this one. Casual seems best for the office setting though."

"OK, let's start planning some food options. Should we have Chinese or Continental cuisine for our party? What would be the best choice here?"

"I was thinking about having Chinese cuisine for this event. It should go well with a casual atmosphere and will allow us to order plenty of dishes."

"Fantastic! We can plan on having live music for the office party. Do you prefer a DJ or a band? I'd love your opinion as we discuss our options!"

"A live band is definitely more formal, which might be too much for an informal setting like this. A DJ would work better and allow us to control the atmosphere of the event."
