I've been living in the US for three weeks now. My wife just got here yesterday from China, so we are both here together. Yes, I have been to California before. It's a beautiful place with lots of interesting things to see and do.

### Response:
Brian: Thank you for your kind words. I studied English in college and am able to speak it pretty well now. My wife just arrived from China yesterday and we're both excited to explore this new country together. Yes, I have been to California before on vacation several years ago, but it is still one of my favorite states with so much to offer tourists like us!
