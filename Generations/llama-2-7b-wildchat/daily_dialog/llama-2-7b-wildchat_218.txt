"It seems you are going to Japan. I think it is a great idea to spend your holiday there. It's not only famous for its culture, but also its cuisine. In my opinion , Japanese food is one of the best in the world . What's more , they have many beautiful places that are worth visiting too, like Mount Fuji and Kyoto."

"I heard Japan is a very interesting place to visit. I have been there before, so if you ever come to Tokyo , let me know!"
