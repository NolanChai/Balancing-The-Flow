"Sure no problem."

"I'm sorry ma’am. We don’t accept credit card."

"What ! I have my card right there . It’s just not a visa , it is the MasterCard "

"I apologize ma’am but our company doesn’t except any other than Visa or Amex."

"Surely you can take the mastercard "

"No we do not accept MasterCard and I'm really sorry for the inconvenience . 
But we only accept Visa or AmEx as payment method. "

"How ridiculous ! How can a company be so exclusive ? What if someone don’t have one of these two types cards in their wallet ? It is unacceptable that your employees can’t find another way to pay you . It is such a pity to live in this country where there are not enough options for the people who don't use credit card !"

"Excuse me, may I have my check please?"

"Certainly, how was everything today?"

"Very nice, thank you."

"Would you like this to-go? If so we can put it in a plastic bag for you."

"Yes, that'd be great. Thank you!"

"No problem! Here you are. That will be 25 dollars."

"Do you take credit cards?"

"Yes, we accept Visa and MasterCard."

"Great. Here you are."

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

"Excuse me, can I speak to the manager?"

"Of course."

"This is a complaint regarding one of your staff members."

"Okay, please tell me what happened."

"Well, as you know, we recently had a new employee join our team. He has been very rude and uncooperative with customers."

"I'm sorry to hear that. Can you give me an example of how he was rude or uncooperative?"

"Yes, there was one customer who tried to pay by card but the machine was not working properly."

"Okay, go on."

"The new employee refused to help her and gave her attitude."

"That is definitely a problem. We need our staff to be professional and helpful at all times. Can you provide me with his name so I can address this issue?"

"Sure, it's John Smith."

"Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I will handle it immediately."

"Okay, thank you for your time."

"You're welcome. Have a good day."
