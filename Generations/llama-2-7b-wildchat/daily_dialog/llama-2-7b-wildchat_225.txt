We regret to inform you that after careful consideration, we have decided to offer the position of Accountant to another candidate. We appreciate your interest in this role and understand that experience is an important factor when making hiring decisions; however, we believe that our other candidate has more relevant qualifications and expertise for this role.

Please rest assured that our decision was not taken lightly, as we carefully considered all the candidates who applied. We want to assure you that our choice was made in good faith with a focus on what is best for our company's growth and success.

As for your suggestion of a trial period, we understand that it may be helpful for both parties to assess if this role would be suitable for you. However, we feel that hiring someone who has already demonstrated their capability in other similar roles is ultimately better suited to our company's needs at this time.

We sincerely appreciate your interest in working with us and wish you all the best in your future endeavors.
