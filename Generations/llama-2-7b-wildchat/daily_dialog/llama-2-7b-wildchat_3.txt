Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately, this dialogue does not meet our requirements for a complete Turn 8. Please note the following guidelines when writing responses for this assignment:

1. Dialogue should be natural and realistic, with appropriate language choices and sentence structures.
2. Responses should provide clear details about what is happening in the story or conversation.
3. The dialogue should advance the plot or character development in some way.
4. Turns 8 should follow a specific format: [Character name] says, "I think you could do the climb." (1 sentence)
5. Do not use full sentences when describing actions, thoughts, or feelings. Instead, write short phrases or single words that indicate what is happening in the dialogue. For example: "I ' m excited," or "I feel nervous."
6. Avoid repetition of phrases and words throughout the dialogue. Try to use varied language choices for different characters or situations when appropriate.
7. Use proper punctuation and capitalization guidelines for dialogue. Do not insert quotation marks around every line of dialogue, unless the speaker is directly addressing another character with a specific line (e.g., "You're wrong"). Instead, use conventions like [character name] says or she asked.
8. Dialogue should be organized into distinct scenes that advance the plot or character development in some way.
9. Do not provide long descriptions or detailed narration in response dialogue (unless it is directly related to the story). Keep descriptions brief and concise, focusing on essential details for clarity.
10. Avoid using exclamation marks excessively, as they can create an overly dramatic tone that may not fit with other scenes or characters' personalities/actions in context.
