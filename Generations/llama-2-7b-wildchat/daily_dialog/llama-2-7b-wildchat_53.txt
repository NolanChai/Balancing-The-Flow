I will grab the soda. Would anyone like anything?

"Yes, that would be great."
"Thanks!"
"Mary, do you want me to bring anything for my parents?"
"That's fine, we will let them know when they get here."
"Okay."
"So how has the beach been?"
"It was nice and relaxing. We got some good waves."
"That sounds fun!"
"I think you would have enjoyed it as well if you had come with us."
"Maybe next time. But for now, I am glad that we are all back together again."
"Yes, me too!"
"I hope your parents will like their dinner when they get here. It's been a while since we saw them last."
"Yes, they should be arriving soon. We were just about to sit down for our meal when you two walked in."

" Oh, no, we really shouldn't stop by without warning. You could have been out."

"I know I am here to see you and Josh now, but maybe next time, let me call first. I don't want to catch any of you at an awkward moment."

"Well, if it makes you feel better, then sure, we will take a little snack."

I am glad to see you too. Josh and I were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we'd drop by. It has been a long time since we have seen you.
Yes, it would be nice if you could get us something to drink, but we are not that thirsty. We had lunch a little while ago.
Well then, how is your family?
