I guess it is a good idea to make sure you have something interesting to read in case your train arrives early. That way you can pass the time away without getting bored, and hopefully make friends with new people like this guy who's sitting next to you right now. He seems like someone who enjoys books too, because he was even nice enough to give one of his own to lend me! It feels great knowing that we've formed such strong connections already by exchanging some lighthearted banter about the weather on our way into town together – here's hoping this journey is filled with many more enjoyable conversations along the way.

"Yes, I do."

"Could you lend me one?"

"OK here it is."

"Thanks, it's rather cold this morning, wouldn't you say?"

"You're right."

"Do you know the news?"

Yes. I do. Here is your book. Could I borrow one? Of course. It’s rather cold this morning, isn't it? You’re right. Do you know the news? What? Brazil won the world cup? Wow! That’s great news. Congratulations to them!
