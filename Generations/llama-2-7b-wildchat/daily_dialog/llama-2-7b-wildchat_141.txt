"Thank you for all the information, Ms. Hu. I know the basics about your company, but still have some questions regarding to my application and the job itself."

"I'm very excited at this point in time, eagerly anticipating the results of the interview."

"Can you let me know when will I get a reply? Can it be before two weeks?"

"Thank you for your help!"

Thanks for the information. I understand. 

If I pass, will I know right away?

I'm not sure when you plan to call back or interview me again.

Can we schedule this meeting in person instead of on the phone? It would be good for both of us and easier for me to hear everything clearly.

Thank you again for your time today, it was very useful. I look forward to hearing from you soon with more information about when I can join your company!

" Then if there is any news in two weeks, please contact me first . "

" Thank you for your consideration . "

I appreciate your kind words about my attitude towards job hunting. If there is anything else you would like me to know, please let me know! Thank you for taking the time to chat with me today and giving me some valuable insights into what it means being an employee at XYZ Company. I have learned so much from our discussion that will help prepare me for future job interviews as well as my current position at ABC Corp. I look forward to continuing this conversation soon!
