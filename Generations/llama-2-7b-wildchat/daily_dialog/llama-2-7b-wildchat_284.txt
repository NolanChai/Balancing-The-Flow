" Really ? You didn't think it was scary at all ? "

" Nah , I just wish we saw a different one."

" So, did you like the poster ? "

" Yeah , it looks cool ! "

" Do you remember the movie ? "

" Yes . It was so interesting with its dark atmosphere and unique visuals ... "

The next turn in this dialog is as follows:

"May, I thought we agreed that it was just a movie and not real. 
You had no reason to cling onto me so much. It was boring because of your fear."

"Well, you know what they say about horror movies-they are only good if you're scared out of your wits!"

"I guess we all have our own opinion on things like this, right?"

" Haha , don’t be shy. You’re cute when you’re clinging to me. " 

" Come on, don't you like being scared ? " 

" I think it was a little too much for the first time . Besides, ghosts aren't real are they ? "

" They're not as real as Gucci . " 

" That's right !

"Hey , May, look, is that the poster of the movie we saw yesterday? Yes, that's right. That's the poster of The Witch."

"May, I really regret watching it with you last night. Did it scare you?"

"Did what scare me? Of course not. I just thought the movie was... boring."

"Boring! Come on, you clutched to my arm all the time!"

"Well, I admit. The ghosts were scary. I like scary movies."

"That's Gucci's influence. I love science fiction movies!"

"Of course you do. They are silly stories just for little kids like you."

"Don't call me kid. I am a grownup!"
