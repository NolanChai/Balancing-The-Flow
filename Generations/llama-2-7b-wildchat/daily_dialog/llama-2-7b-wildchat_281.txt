Joe : How are you doing? 
Mary : I am great. How about yourself, Joe? How are you? 
Joe : I’m doing well, Mary. Thank you for asking. How are you, Mary? 
Mary : I am doing great! Thank you for asking. How about tonight? Would you like to go see a movie with me? 
Joe : Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it tonight. I have a lot of work that I need to finish before the deadline. 
Mary : That’s too bad! If you change your mind, don’t hesitate to let me know. It was nice chatting with you today. 
Joe : See ya later, Mary. Take care.

I'm doing well, how are you?

Mary:
- I'm doing great! Thank you for asking.
- How about you, Joe? How are you feeling today?
- Pretty good, thanks! It's always nice to hear from you, Mary.
- Would you like to get together this weekend? We could go for a walk or grab some coffee.
- That sounds wonderful! I love spending time with my friends. Let's make it happen soon.
- Great, see you soon!

Joe:
- Hey Joe, how are you doing?
- I'm good, how about yourself?
- Pretty well, thanks for asking. How have things been going since our last chat?
- Things have been busy, but I've been managing to stay on top of my work and school commitments.
- That's great news! Can you tell me more about what has been keeping you so occupied lately?
- Sure thing. This week alone I had a few essays due for class, plus I spent some time volunteering with local organizations that help families in need during these tough economic times.

Joe , how are you doing? 
I am great! How about you, Mary? How are you?
I'm fine. Thank you for asking Joe.
I was wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me tonight?
I need to stay home and finish my term paper.
Okay. What about going to the movies on Friday night? 
What were you planning on seeing? 
I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer. 
How about The Secret Life of Bees?
