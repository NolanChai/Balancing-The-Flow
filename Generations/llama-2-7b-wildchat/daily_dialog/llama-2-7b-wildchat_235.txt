Hey, let's go over there and see what's going on. It seems like something interesting is happening.

Adam told me that there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors.

Look at that, it's so dangerous! My mom would never allow me to do that.

Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show. You're right; but what if an avalanche happened?

" Hey, look over there. It seems that there is something interesting going on. Let's go and have a look."

"Sure! It's probably a skiing show. Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors."

"Look at that! It's so dangerous. My mom would never allow me to do that."

"Stop all this fuss and enjoy the show."

"You are right. But what if an avalanche happened?"

"They are all great skiers and very experienced, so I suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim."

"Anyway, the show is breathtaking. By the way, where did they get so much snow here?"

You can write this part as dialogue, but you don't need to. It just needs to be coherent and sound natural. You can also combine two lines into one if they are similar in length.

"Yes , I guess so . But I really like the way they make snow here . "
