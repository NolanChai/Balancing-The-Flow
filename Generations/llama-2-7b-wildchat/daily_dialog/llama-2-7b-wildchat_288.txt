Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Can you tell me where the pots and pans are ? "

"Pots and pans are right over there."

"Could I interest you in our store credit card?"

"No, thanks. I already have credit cards."

"But our credit card saves you 10 percent."

"That's a nice discount."

"No problem , have fun shopping !!"
