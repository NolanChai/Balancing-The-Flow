No, I haven't. Tell me all about it !

I can't believe Deborah already has a newborn baby! How does she look ? Is the baby healthy? What do they call her? Did it go smoothly during childbirth? So many questions running through my mind right now...

It sounds like an exciting and emotional time for Deborah. It's been a long journey filled with struggles and triumphs. I know she must be thrilled to finally hold her sweet bundle of joy in her arms!

Can't wait to hear more details about the precious little one :)

"I heard what happened! Deborah already had her baby. She gave birth at 9 o’clock last night and the baby weighed eight pounds, six ounces. I didn't know that."

"I thought you knew about it," my friend responded. "Why did you pretend to be surprised?"

"I honestly didn't know she was in labor until last night!" I said. "And you don't think it’s weird that no one told me beforehand? Deborah is a nurse, and they should have given her an epidural."

"Maybe Deborah just wanted to surprise everyone with the news," my friend suggested.

"Or she was trying to prove something," I countered. "If you're a professional nurse, why don't you get an epidural? It would be easier on both her and the baby."

"I did not know about the baby. How are they doing?" I asked my friend. 

"The baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces? I can't believe it."

"Yes, it was a very healthy child."

"That is good to hear," I replied. "I would like to visit them and meet the little one."

"Well, I guess that’s a relief ! "

" You didn’t know she had her baby , did you ? "

" No , I really don't . "

" It is hard to believe though . "

" Yeah it was a bit of a surprise . "

" Have you seen the baby yet ? "

" Well, not exactly . "

" You’ll have to see him for yourself . "

" I just wanted to give you some good news too . "
