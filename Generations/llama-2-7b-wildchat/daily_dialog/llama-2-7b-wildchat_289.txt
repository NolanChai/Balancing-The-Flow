The first thing that jumps out is how to answer the dialogue. The dialogue is about housekeeping, so we need to write something appropriate. One option is to say "Of course!" This shows enthusiasm and interest in helping with the task. We can also add a smile, as it makes the conversation more pleasant.

Another possible response is "Sure thing!" This sounds friendly and eager to help. It's important that whatever response you choose matches the tone of your character. If they are not very enthusiastic or interested in housekeeping, then we should pick something different such as "No problem" or "I can do that".

Finally, it would be great if the dialogue ends with a thank you from both sides. This shows appreciation and makes sure everyone understands what has been agreed upon. So our response could look like this: 

"Of course! That's what I'm here for - let me help out." (With a friendly smile) "It would be great if we could finish this quickly so you can get on with your day."
(Thanking the character) "Thanks again!"

This way, our dialogue ends positively and gives an impression of cooperation between two people who want to work together for their mutual benefit.
