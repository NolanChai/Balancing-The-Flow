Well, known Jim , I'm ... I'm pretty much in favour of your computers , I think computers teach kids to think because they require logical thoughts .

" But I...I don't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to think because kids don't learn basic skills."

"What do you mean?"

"They can't spell, they can't add, they can't subtract, they even don't remember any more. That's because they rely on gadgets."

"That's not the gadgets! Creating programmes is stimulate thoughts. It engages their imagination and sharpen their mind."
