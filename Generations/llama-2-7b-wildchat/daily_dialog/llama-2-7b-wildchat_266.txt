"Sounds good, Gordon! Let’s head back home and call it a night."

"Definitely. My stomach can't take anymore!"

"Yeah, I'm sure your boss will be expecting you to come in early tomorrow morning. So let's get this bill sorted out quickly. How much do we owe?"

"Right. The food was great, but now it’s time for bed."

"I don't think that I can eat another bite!"

```

Gordon : that was a really good meal , Gordon . 

I couldn't eat another bite .

Well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home .

You're right . I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow .

Let's see how much the bill is .

Don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat . 

What are you talking about ? We'll split the bill .
```

Gordon gave her a smile and nodded. "Thank you, Mara. That means a lot."

As they got up from their table, Gordon added, "I know you didn't have any money with you before so let's just split the bill evenly this time."

Mara shook her head firmly. "No way! I insist on treating you to dinner!"

"Well, I don't want to be a burden, Mara. Please," Gordon pleaded.

Mara put her hand over his and smiled softly. "Don't worry about it, love. We'll split the bill this time."

Gordon looked into Mara's eyes, grateful for her understanding and generosity.

They walked out of the restaurant and went to their car together, holding hands all the way. When they finally reached Mara's house, Gordon leaned in and gave her a sweet kiss on the lips.

"Goodnight, love," he whispered into her ear as she closed the door behind them.

Mara smiled back at him warmly before going inside to sleep soundly, knowing that Gordon had treated her with kindness and generosity once again.

> That was a really good meal, Gordon.

> It sure was; I couldn't eat another bite.

> Well, it is getting pretty late. I think we should go home.

> You're right; I have to get up early to go to work tomorrow.

> Let's see how much the bill is.

> Don't worry about it - tonight is my treat!

> What are you talking about? We'll split the bill.

> No, I insist; I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't.

> No way, Gordon. I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment; there's no need for you to pay for the whole bill.

> Alright, if that's the way you're going to be, we'll split the bill.

> That's better - this way, we will both have money to take a cab home otherwise, you would probably have to walk.

"That was a really good meal, Gordon. I couldn’t eat another bite."

"It sure was. I have to get up early tomorrow morning for work so I better start heading home soon."

"Well, it is getting pretty late. We should probably go back now and save you from walking in this cold weather."

"Yeah, let’s see how much the bill is."

"Don't worry about it. Tonight was my treat."

"What are you talking about? We'll split the bill."

"No way! I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment. There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill."

"Alright, if that's the way you’re going to be, we'll split the bill."

"That's better. This way we will both have money to take a cab home otherwise, you would probably have to walk."

"Just promise me you'll let me treat you to dinner next week, okay?"

"You got a deal."
