"I understand, but this is a very important meeting for my department. I really can't miss it."

"Do you think it would be possible to reschedule the meeting? I don't feel well enough to attend today."

"I'm sorry, but the meeting cannot be rescheduled. I've already informed my boss of your situation and he insisted that it goes on as planned."

"Is there any way you could just call in sick? Maybe take a few days off?"

"No, I can't do that either. My manager specifically asked me to attend the meeting today."

"I'm sorry for my lack of understanding but I have an important meeting to go to today . "

The following is your response. You may change it in any way you like, except the form of your response must remain as seen below. If I feel that this dialog will not be good in a game environment if the player does not know what will happen next , then I will have to stop this thread and create one with you responding .

"I'll do it now . " (or) "I don't think so . I've been at this desk all day long since your secretary called me earlier today about a last minute emergency meeting that you needed to attend . If I leave , there's no telling how late the meeting might run or what time you'll be back here tomorrow morning. "

(or) "I do not believe my fever has gone away, but at least the pain has subsided a bit .  I feel like I can hold down some food and hopefully that will help me recover faster than if I just took some Tylenol for now. " (or) "I'll take it, thank you !"

"It's my tattoo."

"Do you mind if I ask what it is?"

"Sure, it's a dragon with a crown. It represents the strength and power of dragons."

"Wow! That's such a unique design. What made you decide to get this tattoo?"

"Well, ever since I was a kid, I've always loved dragons and their mythology. They're these incredible creatures that have been portrayed in stories for centuries. It's like they represent a whole different world filled with magic and adventure."

"I can see why you would be drawn to them. They sound fascinating. So, what kind of reactions do people usually give when they see your tattoo?"

"Haha, well, it definitely gets some attention. Some people think it's cool and others are a bit surprised by its size and detail. But I love that it sparks a conversation with strangers. It gives me the chance to share my passion for dragons and their mythology."

"I think it's awesome that you have something so personal and meaningful on your body. Does it hurt at all when getting inked?"

"To be honest, yes, it does a little bit. But I guess pain is part of the process. The tattoo artist was really professional about it though and made sure I felt comfortable throughout the whole experience."

"Well, you definitely have a unique piece of artwork there. Thanks for sharing your story with me."

"You could be right about that rash. I was wearing this new suit for the first time today, and I remember feeling really itchy while I wore it . But now that I think about it , I don't know if it's the suit or something else that caused my skin to break out like this . "

"Hmm . I think you should definitely get some antihistamines from a pharmacy or call an allergist and make an appointment with him . "

"I'll do that. Thanks for your help , Toby . "

"You don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work."

"I couldn't do that, I have an important meeting to go to today."

"Do you feel ok?"

"Not really after a 12-hour flight, I've got jetlag and on top of that I think I've also got the flu."

"Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now."

"Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?"

"You're really hot, let me get you some Tylenol to bring down your fever."

"Ok. I'll stay home this morning and rest but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting."

"Zach what's that on your arm?"

"I don't know, it looks a bit red but I'm sure it's nothing."

"It looks like you have a red rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything?"

"Just cats, but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks."

"I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no, we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine let's go!"

"Shouldn't we make an appointment first?"

"We would, but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse."
