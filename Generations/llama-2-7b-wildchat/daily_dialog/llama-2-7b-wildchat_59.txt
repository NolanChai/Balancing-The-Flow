Mother knows best, heck no! 

"But mom, you said we were going to the movie tonight." 
"But Lily, it's your English class night. You need to study for your test next week. Plus I want us to have some quality family time."

"I think there is a point where you can be too much of an overprotective mother. I need to take charge for myself. Besides, my English class nights are not all about studying."
