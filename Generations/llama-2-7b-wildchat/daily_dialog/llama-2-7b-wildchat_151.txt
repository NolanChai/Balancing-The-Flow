You could try starting with something like, “I see. So what do you plan on doing about it?” Or you could just start a new paragraph and continue where you left off, like so:
“We have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible.”
“Yes, I agree completely. We need to make sure all employees have access to the information they need, no matter where they are located or what time it is.”
