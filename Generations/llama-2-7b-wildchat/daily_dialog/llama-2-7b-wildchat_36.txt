"I'm sorry, but we don't sell stamps here. You should go to a post office to buy them."

"Do you know which post office I need to go to?"

"Yes, it's just down the street at 123 Main Street. It should be easy for you to find."

"Thank you very much. I appreciate your help."

"excuse me , could you tell me which line I ’ m supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package? "

"you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you’ll have to stand in line over there to post your package."

"that’s a really long line. How long do you think it will take to get through all those people?"

"it takes about 3 minutes per person, so it will probably be around an hour's wait."

"can I buy stamps here?"

"sure, how many would you like?"

"I need 30 for my Christmas cards."

"are you sending them abroad?"

"twenty of them are going to China and America."

"No."

I need 30 for my Christmas cards. Twenty of them are going abroad to China and America.

Do you have any that will go to countries in the EU? If so, they're cheaper than those going to other places.

No, I don't.

That will be £18.72 for the stamps and £3.95 for the bubble wrap. Total is 22.67 pounds.
