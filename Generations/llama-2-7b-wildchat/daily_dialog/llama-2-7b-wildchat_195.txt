"I don’t want you to think that I’m mad or upset with you, because I’m really not. You just have to understand that we are now in a very delicate situation and as your captain it is my responsibility to protect this ship and its crew, which includes you.

You know how much I love you, don't you? Well, it's true, but my job takes precedence over everything else at the moment. You understand that, right?

I want you to do whatever it takes to get our passengers off of this ship safely and intact. We are not going down without a fight, but we also can’t risk losing any more people in the process. I know that you will find a way out of this mess - after all, you have saved our lives before and you're a damn good pilot!

Don't give up on me now, okay? Just trust me."
