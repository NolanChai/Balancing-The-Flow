The next turn in this dialog should continue with the character's description of their preferences for rock music, rather than asking the listener to describe its appeal. This could be something like:

"I love how raw and intense it is - it really speaks to my soul."

"That's exactly why I love it so much too! It makes me feel alive in a way nothing else can."
