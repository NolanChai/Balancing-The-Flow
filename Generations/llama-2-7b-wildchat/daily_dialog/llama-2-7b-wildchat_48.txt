Hi there, I'm excited to help you write the next turn in this dialog! Here's how we can do that with no explanation or format changes:

Turn 1:

> "Hi , there . Look at these . I have collected some ads here. There is a special promotion for Mother's Day this weekend."

Turn 2:

"Oh, yes! Mother's Day is coming. Do you plan to buy anything?"

Turn 3:

"Of course! I want to buy some night cream for my mom, and some masques for myself."

Turn 4:

"Hmm... In Carrefour, Clinique will be promoting their visible skin renewed cream. How much is it?"

Turn 5:

"I'm sorry, but the price of this cream changes depending on the store and location."

Turn 6:

"But don't worry! Here are some other great deals that I found for you to consider:"

I have some night creams with different brands, such as L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Night Cream (85 yuan) or Neutrogena Hydro Boost Anti-Aging Moisturizer (103 yuan). As for the masques, I will choose Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex ($25.49). All in all, I'd like to buy L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Night Cream and Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged Complex. As for the promotion, it is only available at Carrefour from May 8th to June 12th, you can get a free 8-piece gift package including three delicate mini masks, one moisturizer, two toners, two cleansing waters and one lipstick (value up to $53.85).
