"Good morning, Ruth! No, I was just about to wake up. What's up, Carl?"

"Listen, I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus?"

"B as in boy, you should get off at the last stop in Chinatown."

"No, I meant 14th Street.

"The Chinatown B and D buses have different destinations."

"Okay. The correct stop is at 278 Canal Street."

"Great! Thanks for the clarification, Ruth. See you soon!"

### Response:

"You are welcome . I'll see you there."

Carl was calling Ruth about his meeting with her at 10, 45. He was confused as he had already decided that they would take the B bus and get off on Canal Street. However, Ruth corrected him, saying that taking the last stop in Chinatown meant getting off at the Avenue D stop.
She clarified that Canal Street was on the other side of Chinatown, opposite to their intended destination. She reminded Carl that they had decided to meet at 10:45 AM and asked if Ann would be joining them. Carl confirmed that Ann would be there and reiterated the details of the meeting place.
