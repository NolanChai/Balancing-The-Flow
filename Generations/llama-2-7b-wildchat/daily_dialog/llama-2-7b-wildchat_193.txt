1. "I know, right? I'm already dreading that."
2. "Believe me, it is a jungle out there! You can't trust any landlord or property manager these days!"
3. "Sure thing, let me do some digging around and see if anyone has something available for you."
4. "Well, I guess we should both look at the Internet and see if someone is subletting their place. Good luck with that! It's definitely not an easy task these days."
5. "I totally understand your situation. The housing market in this town can be cutthroat, but don't worry - I know a few people who might have something available or may even know someone who knows someone!"

"I'm so sorry. It seems like you're in a really tough spot. The real estate market is not exactly known for its sympathy and understanding."

"I completely understand how stressful it can be to have your lease end with no place lined up, especially when prices are rising in Shanghai and everywhere else. It's truly a jungle out there, and I don't know if finding a new home will be any easier for you."

"Do you mind me asking what kind of accommodation you're looking for? There may still be some options available even with your budget."

"I can certainly try to see what my contacts have. Perhaps there is someone who is willing to rent their place out, even if it is a little more expensive than you would like. The good news is that we don't necessarily need to settle for the first option we find."

"It sounds like you also plan to look online. That can be a great way to get an overview of what kind of places are available and at what price range, so it may not be too late yet."

"If I were in your shoes, I would consider all possible options, including staying with friends or family for a while if necessary. Even though it is uncomfortable, this could give you some time to find a more suitable place. Just make sure that they are willing and able to offer you enough privacy."

"Finally, let me know if there's anything I can do to help with your search. I hope we can work together to find you something that will make you feel at home."

### Response:
"I'm sorry to hear about the expiration of your lease. It must be stressful not knowing where you are going to live next month. But don't worry, there are still options available for you in this competitive market."

"As a friend and acquaintance of mine once said, "It is a jungle out there!" The real estate business is fiercely competitive, but I am confident that we can navigate through it together. Let me introduce you to some resources and recommendations so that you can find your dream home."

"I have heard about this new startup company called ______. They offer a wide range of rental properties at reasonable prices. You can check out their website or download their app, which is available on both iOS and Android."

"Another option worth considering is to explore the sub-lease market in Shanghai. A sublet means renting someone else's property temporarily while they are away from it. You might be able to find a suitable place for a lower monthly fee than what you were originally looking for."

"I also know of some landlords who are willing to make special arrangements with tenants like yourself, so do not hesitate to ask if they have any available units that match your requirements. They might be more flexible in terms of payment or duration because they understand how difficult it is for you right now."

"Lastly, stay positive and keep looking even after the end of this month. It may take some time but I am confident we will find something suitable together!"

### Response:
"I feel your pain, my lease ended last week and finding a new place in Shanghai can be tough. Don't worry though, there are still some options available if you look around."

"I guess it is kind of a jungle out there but I've seen some ads on WeChat that might help you find something suitable. You can try looking at ______. It's an aggregator website where people post their rental listings, so you can check out the prices and locations easily."

"Do keep in mind that most places will require a deposit of one month rent plus two months upfront payments as well as some other documents like your ID card or work permit. So make sure everything is in order before applying for any place."

"Another option is to ask around with friends and family members if they know anyone who's looking for roommates/tenants at the moment - sometimes people are willing to share their apartments so that both parties benefit from each other."

"Finally, don't forget about subletting your own place! If you have a furnished home and no plans of moving out soon then this might be worth considering as well. Just make sure the owner allows it first before advertising on any platform - otherwise they could get in trouble later down the line."

"Good luck with finding somewhere new, I hope everything works out for you!"

### Response:
"I'm sorry to hear about your situation. It can be really stressful and frustrating trying to find a new place to live when your lease is ending soon. But don't worry, there are still options available."

"As a friend, I want to do everything in my power to help you out. Here are some resources that might be useful: ________. This website has thousands of listings from both landlords and tenants who are looking for suitable accommodations."

"I also know that many people turn to Craigslist when they need a place quickly, so feel free to check there as well. Just make sure you do your research before agreeing on anything - scams happen all the time online! "

"If you have any questions or concerns about searching for an apartment in Shanghai, don't hesitate to ask me. I can give advice based on my own experiences living here and share insights from friends who rent apartments regularly."

"I also know that subletting is another option worth considering. This means finding someone willing to let you stay in their home while they are away for a short period of time - usually months at most. You can look into this through _______ or other similar platforms."

"Finally, remember that patience and perseverance will pay off eventually! Keep searching until you find something suitable without compromising on quality or location too much."

### Response:
"Wow, it's tough out there for finding a new place to live. But don't worry, we can make this work together! I have some resources that might help."

"First of all, check out ______. It is an aggregator website where tenants post their needs and landlords post their available units - perfect if you are looking for something specific or need guidance on how to navigate the market."

"Another option worth considering would be searching online through classifieds such as ______ or ________. These platforms have tons of options that aren't necessarily advertised elsewhere and offer greater flexibility when it comes to payment terms and lease lengths."

"If neither of these work out then you could also try asking friends/family members if they know anyone who might be interested in renting their place temporarily. Who knows - someone might just need a little extra cash flow right now!"

"Last but not least, don't forget about subletting your own home! Subleasing means finding another tenant willing to pay rent while you stay elsewhere for a few months or longer without having to break your current lease agreement."

"With patience and persistence (and maybe even some luck), I am confident that we can find something suitable together!"

I understand, I can help you out. As far as I know, there are plenty of places for rent around here that might suit your budget. The only issue is they're not exactly in the best neighborhoods. But hey, it's better than nothing right? And besides, with all the development going on around here these days, those areas will likely improve over time.

Now about searching online - sure! You can check out some real estate websites like jd.com or 58.com to see what options are available in your price range. Just remember to read up on reviews and ask friends/family for recommendations before committing to anything though.

If you're looking for something more specific - say, within walking distance of public transportation - then we can start searching closer to home. Keep an eye out at local markets or community events too; sometimes people post notices there if they've got extra space in their place. Who knows? You may even find someone who wants a roommate!

If none of these options work out, don't worry - there are other places nearby you could look into too (just be sure to do your due diligence before signing anything). Remember: finding suitable accommodation doesn't have to break the bank; it just takes patience and dedication!

"That sounds difficult. But let me see what I can find for you."

"Sure. We have to make do somehow. The internet will definitely help. I also know of a few places."

"If only we had more time."

"I can't believe that your lease is ending next month already! Time flies, doesn't it? Let me take care of this and hopefully you won't have to look for a place by yourself."

"Are there any particular areas or neighborhoods you prefer? I may have something in mind."

"It'd be nice if the apartment was close to public transportation, but it shouldn't break my bank either. Perhaps we can check some online websites that offer apartments for rent. Do you know which ones are popular?"

"Yeah. I have heard of several places like Xiaozhan and Dajue, but it depends on what kind of place you're looking for. It would be easier to find something if we can agree on the monthly budget first."

"Hmm. Okay... Well, how about a minimum of 1000 RMB? Anything below that, and I will have some trouble affording it. However, let's start with finding out what is available in my price range first before we decide on any particular area or neighborhood."

"I see..."

"Are there any specific amenities you need to look for? Do you prefer something furnished or unfurnished?"

"Well... I need a bedroom, and it'd be better if the room is near the window so that I can get some sunlight. A full bathroom would be great as well."

"yes , lots of people move during this time every year , and some will sublet their place to make up for the cost of their rent."

"you can also try apartment listing websites like 58 . "

" that's true . I usually see a lot of people offering their places on these websites . "

抱歉你迫于压力，不得不寻求新居。

我对你表示同情，现在市场真是一片乌鸦，非常困难。

可能有些人知道房源？

当然，也可以在互联网上查找空租房。

你花费多少钱？

我只能每月支付1000元。

那么，你就要去远方居住。

不过需要地点的位置相关的问题是否重要呢？

你应该看在公共交通设施和居所的距离上。

你有任何需求？

我想房屋包含一个完全装修的卧室和浴室，以及阳光明媚的位置。

还可以去大学的公告板搜索房源。

为什么？那些是离校学生正要离开的呢？

不是太准确，但因为他们都需要降低租金以引诱新人入住。

你也应该去检查这些方面。

感谢你的助手。

我会一定的地方查看。

很遗憾，如果你租房子是不容易的，那么需要你花出一些时间在市场上挣取。

可能你会在互联网上查找空房或者与几个地方交换信息。

如果你每月只花费1000 元的租金，那么你最好去远方居住。

但是，需要地点位置相关问题是否重要呢？

因为你应该在公共交通设施和居所的距离上。

你有任何特殊需求吗？

你可能会搜集这些信息。

我也想说感谢你的帮助。
