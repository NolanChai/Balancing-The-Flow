"I am very sorry, sir. My car has broken down as well."

"That is unfortunate. We can try and see if we can fix it quickly so that you don't need to wait too long for another taxi."

"I appreciate the offer, but I will have to call another one since it seems unlikely that this one would be repaired in time for me to make my appointment."

"In that case, I apologize again. It was nice speaking with you today and hopefully we can find a solution soon."
