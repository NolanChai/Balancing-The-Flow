" Yes , he comes on his own . My parents are old and cannot travel far from home now . But they have told me to make sure my brother arrives in time . I will be happy if you help us out by taking care of him while we arrange the house for our family . "

" No , my sister , she's not too keen on travelling with her father and grandparents because it's been quite a few years since her parents last saw their grandchildren . She'll probably come over on holiday later in the summer . "

"Yes, my brother is coming with his son. He wants to go to University in England. My family is going to visit a few universities while they’re here. His wife and daughters will be staying back at home because they’re visiting their grandparents."

I hear you are expecting your family soon. That’s wonderful news! I didn’t know you had a brother; is he two years older than you? Oh, so your brother lives in New Zealand and only visits occasionally? How nice that you get to see him then. Do you have any photos of him?
Is your brother coming alone or with the family? Oh, his son is coming as well. That’s great! He must be looking forward to going to university here in England. Will he be visiting a few universities while they are here?
Do you have just one daughter? No, I suppose your sisters will also be visiting their grandparents during this time. It must be exciting for them too.
I’m sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson. They went to New Zealand last year and loved it, so they’ll be thrilled to have another opportunity to explore the country.
When exactly are they all coming? I can’t wait to meet everyone! It will be a pleasure to host you and your family during this special time together.
