"What is that?"

"That dress is very pretty, but I don’t like it."

"Why not?"

"It's too loud."

"We've been looking around for many hours. What on earth are you looking for?"

"Well, you know, those styles or colors don't suit me."

"What style do you want?"

The girl wears a white shirt, a long black dress with laces on its side and a blue bow around her waist. The blue dress is a bit loud but she doesn’t seem to mind it too much because of the pretty white shirt underneath that covers most of her arms, so if you don’t like how noisy this outfit looks, why don’t you just buy another one? As for what we were looking for, well let me tell you – my friend was trying to find something special which would reflect her unique style and character. But I think she needs more time because even after searching through hundreds of stores she couldn’t find exactly what she wanted: a V-neck checked sweater with tight fit that perfectly matches our color scheme. And when we asked why she didn’t just pick something else if there was nothing special available, well… it seems like sometimes we all get stuck in some kinda “style rut” where everything looks alike so instead of finding inspiration from new trends or fashion pieces around us – let me suggest you take a look at the shops selling vintage clothing since there’s no better way than borrowing styles from past eras!
