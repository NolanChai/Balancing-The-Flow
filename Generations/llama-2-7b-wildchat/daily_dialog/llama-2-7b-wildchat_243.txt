"Doctor, my temperature is 39.6 degrees."

"Is that a fever? Are you feeling nauseous at all?"

"Not yet, but I do have chills. And I feel like I may throw up soon."

"Okay, let's get you some medicine. Stay here and rest. I'll be back to check on you."

Doctor : What's wrong with you, young man? 

Patient: Doctor, I have a bad cough and a headache. 

Doctor: Do you have a fever? 

Patient: I don't know, but I feel terrible. 

Doctor: Let me examine you. Don't worry, it's nothing serious. 

Patient: Do you think I should lie in bed? 

Doctor: Yes, stay in bed and drink a lot of water. Your fever will be gone in a day or two.

Doctor : "I'm sorry to hear that, young man. Let me examine you and see what's causing this cough and headache. Don't worry, it's nothing serious."

Patient : "Yes, Doctor. I don't have a fever but I feel terrible. My throat is sore too."

Doctor: "Alright. Let me check you over thoroughly to determine the cause of your illness. Don't worry, it's just something minor. But please stay in bed and drink plenty of water. Your fever should go down within a few days. Now, do you think you can play football tomorrow?"

Patient : "No way! I need to rest and recover completely before going back on the field."
