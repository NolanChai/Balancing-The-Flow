I'd like to hear what you write about your character's reaction to this dialog, and your thoughts about the tone of the story so far.

1) What is a word for an action that means the person is going somewhere? (ex: she walks away, he goes downstairs.)
2) Can you describe the other person with 10 or more words? Try using: adjectives, descriptive verbs, adverbs, and sensory details.
3) Use a complete sentence with a period.
4) Make sure your response sounds like what the character would say or think.
5) Please respond as if you are continuing the conversation.
6) Change the format to dialogue:

"Who's it knocking at the door ? "

" I think it's the postman.Will you go and open the door ? "

" All right . I'll get it . "
