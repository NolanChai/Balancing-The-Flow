" You may have gotten some cheaper price offers because the supply of these ornaments is abundant in China at present , and it is easy for you to buy them . Our company is different from others . We only sell good quality products that are popular with customers abroad ; and we guarantee each item against defects . "

" What's more , if you don't accept our offer today, we may not be able to meet your requirements next time when the seasonal demand for these ornaments is strong . So it would be best for us all if we reached an agreement now.  I will check with my manager and get back to you immediately . "

" What about your quotation for the delivery date ? "

" Our factories are busy now and can't start making the products before June 20 . If you like to accept our offer, we can promise to have it ready by the first or second week of July . "

I've come to hear about your offer.
We have the offer ready for you. Let me check. 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box, at 20,000 yuan; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box, at 30,000 yuan; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box, at 7,500 yuan, for shipment in June. The offer is valid for five days.
I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected.
You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years. The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere.
I am afraid I can't agree with you there. I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies.
But you must take the design and quality into consideration. You know we are superior to others in design and quality. We have various styles, which the other companies cannot catch up with.
I agree that yours are of the top.
Well, since your order is large enough, can you give me a rough idea?
To have this business concluded, I should say a reduction of least 10% would help.
