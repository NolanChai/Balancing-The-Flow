"That sounds fun. 
I don’t want to make any plans, so yes. I’ll be there."

"Nothing much. Just getting together with some friends."

"Sounds like a good time. You know how I love to party!"

"Well, you're always welcome to join us. But if not, just remember my party next weekend."

"I don't want to miss out on any fun, so I'll try to make it next weekend instead. Have a great time tonight!"

### Response:

"Sorry I couldn't make it today, but I gotta head back home. See you around!"

What is up? Nothing much, what's going on with you? 
I'm having a party this Friday. Would you like to come? 
Oh, that's nice! I would love to join your party. It will be fun. 
Are you sure it won't interfere with anything else? 
Well, I already have plans. But if you insist, I can rearrange my schedule a bit. 
Doing what? Is there something special on your plate? 
Oh, no, nothing out of the ordinary. Just dinner with my family. 
I really wanted you to come, but I understand that it won't work out this time. It was nice chatting with you!

"Sounds like a good party. But, sorry. I have plans."

"Hey, what's up?"

"Not much. How about you? What are your plans for tonight?"

"I wanted to invite you over for dinner, but I already made other plans."

"Oh! That's a pity. It would have been fun to hang out with you. Maybe we can do it next time."

"Yeah, maybe. Sorry again."
