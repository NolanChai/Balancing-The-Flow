Hello, Jack. It's nice to meet you. Sit down and let me tell you everything about our internship program. I want you to have a detailed understanding of the contract before signing it. You need to complete a three-month internship, but don't worry; we will provide all necessary instructions throughout this time. Once you become a permanent employee, you'll receive monthly pay and be on an eight-hour work schedule. Additionally, our insurance benefits will protect both physical and mental health at all times.

John: Hello, Jack. Thank you for your patience. It is an honor to finally meet you.

Jack: I'm glad to see you! Please sit down; we have a lot to discuss.

John: Before we sign the contract, let me go over the details with you again. The internship will last three months. You must complete this training before becoming a permanent employee.

Jack: Yes, I know all about it.

John: When you become a full-time employee, you'll receive health insurance, life insurance, unemployment insurance, and social security benefits. You will also have eight-hour workdays with five days off each month.

Jack: That sounds great! Will I be eligible for vacation time too?

John: Yes, you will have access to legal holidays and a yearly bonus.

"Thank you, John! I'm so excited that I can finally join the company. I had a lot of fun learning about the contract and all of the benefits that come with it. I'm really looking forward to starting my internship in the next three months."

"That sounds great! The insurances are very important for me as a new employee, so I appreciate having them included in this package. I know that there will be times when I need to work overtime, so it's nice knowing I can receive twice my usual salary as an added bonus."

"I understand how important it is to have legal holidays and year-end bonuses. These benefits will help me feel more secure financially during the busy season at work. Thank you for taking the time to explain everything in detail."

"Sit down, please. I'm glad to see you too."

"I've already read the contract and understand all of it. I will sign as soon as possible."

"When working as a permanent employee, you will enjoy eight-hour/day shifts along with five insurances and one fund. Legal holidays are included. Yearly bonuses can also be expected for your hard work. You may work overtime if required. However, the usual salary would double."

"Sounds great! I've got no questions at this time; I hope to begin my new job soon!"

" Hello , Jack. I'm John."

" It is a pleasure to meet you, too." 

" Please sit down. Maybe you have read the contract already but I want to give you the details again before you sign it. You will have a three-month internship first. "

" Yes, I know that."

" When you become a permanent employee, you will get insurances. You will be working on eight hour shifts daily and receive monthly pay. " 

"Wait... Will I also enjoy legal holidays and year-end bonus?"

"Yes, of course! These are all part of the benefits for the employees."

"Sounds great!"

"If you need to work overtime, you will get twice the usual salary as overtime pay." 

"Ok. I have read through the contract again. Do you have any other questions?"

"How long will the induction training be?"

"About two weeks."
