Doctor: 

"Can I see him please, Mrs Williams?"

Mrs William:

"Certainly, doctor. Come upstairs."

Dr:

"You look very well, Jimmy. You are better now but you mustn't get up yet. You must stay in bed for another two days. The boy mustn't go to school yet Mrs Williams. And he mustn't eat rich food."

Mrs Williams is happy that Jimmy has recovered from his illness and she wants to thank the Doctor for helping her son. The Doctor replies by inviting Mrs Williams upstairs to see Jimmy. When they reach the room, Mrs Williams notices that Jimmy looks much better compared to before he was sick. However, the Doctor reminds her that Jimmy should still rest and recover slowly. He also advises her not to let Jimmy return to school too soon and to limit his food intake as it may cause stomach upset or indigestion.

As Mrs Williams is relieved by her son's progress, she inquires about any fever or other symptoms that might indicate a potential underlying health issue. The Doctor informs her that Jimmy doesnâ€™t have a temperature anymore but cautions against over-exertion or eating rich food as it may aggravate his condition further.
