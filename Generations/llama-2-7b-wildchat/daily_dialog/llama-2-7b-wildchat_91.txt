I think that's an interesting conversation. A person should be able to appreciate the beauty of another, while also considering the price they paid for their items. It is important for people not to compare prices or focus on the monetary aspect of clothing and jewelry, but rather enjoy what makes them feel good about themselves.

I think it’s great that you were able to find an affordable dress at Maxine's! I also like how you expressed your appreciation for her eyeing the same dress before buying it – this shows that both parties value each other’s opinions and appreciate what they have in common. It would be interesting if they decided to go shopping together next time or even find more similar pieces of clothing for themselves!
