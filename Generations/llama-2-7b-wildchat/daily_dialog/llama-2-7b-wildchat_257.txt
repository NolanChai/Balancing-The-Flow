" I ’ m happy for a hiking partner but I don’t know anyone who lives near me . "

“Well, Tom. Sounds exciting! But since we've never done this type of hike before, it would be best if you explained to me what exactly it involves. You see, I don't want to get lost or hurt in the wild.”

Have any plans for the weekend, Tom?
Yeah, I'm going on a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains.
Oh, do you go hiking often?
I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.
It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?
Sure, but it will be a long hike: 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?
Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.
Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city.
Yeah, my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.
