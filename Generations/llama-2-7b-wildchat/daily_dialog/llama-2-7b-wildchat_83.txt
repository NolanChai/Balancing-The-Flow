The dialog should have a few more sentences. 

My son's dog was lost. I asked my son to stand rooted to the spot when I went shopping, but he ignored it. He got distracted by a squirrel and ran after him, forgetting to stay in place as I requested. It was a messy situation that had me worried sick for hours on end until luckily enough, someone saw my son's dog and alerted the police department who helped us track down our pup with ease!
