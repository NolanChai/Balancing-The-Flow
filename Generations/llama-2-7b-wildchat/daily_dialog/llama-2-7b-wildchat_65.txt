The dialog can continue like this.

"What movie are we seeing? Do you know if thereâ€™s any room for us?" 

"Let's take the last seats at the back, since the show is sold out."

"Alright. I guess we can make it work. Are we going to get anything to eat afterwards?" 

"No, let's just go straight home and talk about it once we've seen the movie."

This is an example of how a conversation might turn out. In this case, Gary realizes that he misunderstood his plans with Jane, who was expecting him to meet her at the theater. He apologizes and assures her that they will go together to watch the movie as planned. The conversation demonstrates effective communication skills and problem-solving strategies in resolving a misunderstanding between two individuals.
