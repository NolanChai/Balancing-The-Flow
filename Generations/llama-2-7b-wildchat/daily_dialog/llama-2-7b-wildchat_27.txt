The dialogue continues with the doctor checking for signs of illness, such as runny nose or congestion in the ears. He may also ask questions about other symptoms and possible causes of the headache. After gathering all necessary information, the doctor will make an assessment and give appropriate recommendations or prescribe medication if needed.

Good morning doctor. I am having a terrible headache. Yesterday my nose was runny, and now it is stuffed up. My throat hurts too, and I have a sore throat as well. And my temperature is rising. I feel awful!

As you examined me, your diagnosis is correct: I do indeed have influenza. Please treat me with the appropriate medications so that I may recover soon. Thank you for your assistance.

"Now let me give you an examination. First let me take a look at your throat. Open your mouth, say 'ah,'"

"Ah."

"Your throat is inflamed and your tongue is heavily coated. You have all the symptoms of influenza. Take a good rest, drink more water, and I'll write you a prescription. "
