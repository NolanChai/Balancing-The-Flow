"I can't understand how the bill was incorrect. How many people have been trying to get their bills correct for decades, yet you still can't get them right?" 

"Oh, don't worry about it, madam. These new computers are state of the art and I am sure they will soon be working properly." 

"I know you mean well, sir, but if these machines haven't been able to correctly calculate my bill in the past then there is no reason to believe that they will magically do so now."

"Well, we can only try our best. And I assure you that we take your concerns very seriously and this won't happen again." 

"That may be true sir but what about all of those times in the past where you've tried to fix these machines and they haven't worked properly? How many years have gone by?" 

"Now, madam, don't get so worked up. Just try to remember that we are doing our best here and I promise it will be better this time." 

"I appreciate your optimism sir but I think I need something more than just good intentions to put my mind at ease."

"Well, if you have any concerns in the future please don't hesitate to bring them up with me or one of my colleagues." 

"Thank you for that assurance. But, again, how can I be sure that these machines will not make errors like they always do?" 

"Well madam, all we can do is try our best and hope for the best." 

"I'm afraid I need more than that sir. Until I am fully convinced that these new computers are reliable and accurate I cannot trust them to give me an accurate bill again." 

"But I assure you madam, we will do everything in our power to make sure this doesn't happen again." 

"I hope so, sir. But until I am fully convinced then there is no reason for me to trust these machines and believe that they are accurate." 

"Well, I can assure you that we take your concerns very seriously and will do everything in our power to make sure this doesn't happen again."
