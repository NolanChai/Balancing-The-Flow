"I have a return ticket from Minneapolis on March 26th, an invitation letter from my brother, and proof of employment with Tornal. I also own a house in my home country, which is evidence of financial stability. Finally, I have a pet sitter who will take care of my dog while I'm away.

"My ties to my home country are strong because I live in the same place and work for the same company since I graduated university ten years ago. I have savings, health insurance and retirement plans. My brother has a stable job and he can take care of me during my stay.

"I'm also financially independent thanks to my salary that allows me to afford all my expenses without any financial problems. With the money left on my account after my trip, I will buy new clothes, books, and souvenirs for my family and friends back home."
