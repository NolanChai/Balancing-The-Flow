"Which course did you find easiest to take and which one was the most difficult? Did the courses you took influence your career path?" 

"The easiest course for me to take was Ethics. I found it easy because of my background in Philosophy. The most difficult course for me to take was Aesthetics. It was challenging due to its complexity and abstract nature. My major was Psychology, so all the courses I took had an impact on my career path."
