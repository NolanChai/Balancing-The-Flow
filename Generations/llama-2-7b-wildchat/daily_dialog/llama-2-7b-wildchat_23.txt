“I am so glad I caught you at home. I need your help! What's up, Robert? Cafe au lait, cafe latte, cappuccino, cafe mocha… I can't keep them all straight!”

I responded: “Slow down. What are you talking about?” 

You said: "It's about a girl. No, an angel! I’m going to the coffee shop where she works right now.”

### Explanation and discussion:
In this dialogue, Robert is trying to figure out how to order a specific type of coffee at a cafe. He is struggling with keeping track of all the different names for each drink, and he needs help from his friend to clarify. 

My response should be a simple question asking what Robert means by "an angel". This will help him explain further and give me more information about the situation. It's important not to interrupt or jump to conclusions in this kind of conversation - let Robert speak first, then respond accordingly. 

I could also suggest clarifying his order with the cafe staff or making a note of which type he wants next time for better ordering efficiency. This will help ensure that Robert gets what he needs without confusion or delay.
