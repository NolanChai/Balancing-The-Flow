"Cindy, I find your comment about Americans' love for sitcoms to be rather interesting. Do you think that they enjoy watching the same types of characters over and over again? Or do you believe that it is the format itself that draws viewers in?
Regarding Taiwanese shows, I can understand why they would differ from what we see on American television. However, have you noticed any trends or similarities between these two cultures' media preferences?"
