" Ok . Thanks for driving me !"

"I want to go to the hospital too."

"Get in. I'll take you there."

"How much will it cost?"

"It won't be more than $10. Don't worry about that now."

"By the way, what time is it?"

"You can see from the meter that I have radio time. You know, I can get an accurate time reading from a local station."
