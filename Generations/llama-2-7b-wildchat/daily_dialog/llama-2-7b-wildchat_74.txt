" yeah. Things haven't changed much for me either . I'm still working at the same job , doing pretty much what I did when we graduated . But, now I have a wife and two kids who keep me on my toes ! "

" that must be exciting . Two kids ? When were you able to have them ? "

" we waited three years after marriage before starting our family. It was worth every moment of waiting , though . Our daughter was born five years ago and son last year . "

" it's nice to hear about your happy life now . You are a new man these days , Bob . "

" yeah , of course ! It would be great if we could spend some time together . "

" it is a shame that life often takes us away from our friends . "

" but hey , at least we can catch up over coffee or dinner sometime soon ? "
