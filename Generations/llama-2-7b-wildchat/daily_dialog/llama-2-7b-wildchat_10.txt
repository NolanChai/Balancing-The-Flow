Margaret: Well, don't worry. If you want to graduate this year, you should take a science course.

Jimmy: Do you think so?

Margaret: Yes, of course! Science courses are compulsory for pre-medical students. You must enroll in biology, chemistry, physics and maps for non-science majors. 

Jimmy: I'm not good at maps too, you know. I did poorly in high school.

Margaret: Right, you need a proper introduction to the course.

Jimmy: Well...should I take physics and chemistry at the same time?
