"Of course, it's the best seller. It's about a guy who lived in England for 20 years and never learned to speak a single word of English. He couldn't say 'hello' or 'good morning', he didn't know any swear words either. "

"He didn't know how to order food, ask directions, or get information about anything. Whenever he needed something done, he had to go through a translator ."

"The book tells his story from when he first got there until the day he left England."
