Good afternoon, my name is John Doe. May I help you?

I am afraid Mr. Smith is away from his desk at the moment. However, do you know when he will be back?

He's on a business trip and won't be back until next week. Is there any way I can get into contact with him?

Sure, here's his contact information. 

"Here are Tom's direct cell and email contacts:"

Cell Phone: (555) 123-4567

Email Address: tom@email.com

"If you need to contact him for any reason, those would be the best options."

" Of course, I can provide that information. Here is the cell phone number: 09112223 33. And the email address: tsmith@c.com (all lowercase). He checks his emails regularly and responds to them promptly."

"Yes, you can be sure he will get back to you as soon as possible."

Sure, I can help. Let me know if I missed anything or you have any questions about the format of your dialog.
