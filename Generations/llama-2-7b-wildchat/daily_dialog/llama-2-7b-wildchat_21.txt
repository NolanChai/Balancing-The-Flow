```Hello, this is Tony. Iâ€™m calling from the dentist's office. Is Lily there?```

"No, Lily isn't here at the moment."

"Could you ask her to call me back when she gets in?"

"Sure, what's your number please?"

"Hi, this is Lily. Sorry to bother you so early in the morning."

"It's not a bother at all! I'm glad you called back. I have some news for you that may be upsetting but it needs to be said. I've been seeing someone else and we are starting to get serious with one another."

"I'm sorry, Tony. I wish things had worked out differently between us. If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know."

"Thank you for being honest with me. I understand it may be difficult for you to say this but I respect your decision and want the best for you."

"I appreciate that. Please take care of yourself, Tony. Goodbye."
