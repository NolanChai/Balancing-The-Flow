"I was just trying to give him a nice meal. Besides, he likes them better than his regular dog food. " 

"But he might get sick! And it will hurt him if the bone gets stuck in his throat. I'm going to take that away from you before anything happens."

"Oh no , don't do that ! He loves eating cooked chicken bones . "

"Well, I can't let him eat them anymore then. Please just give them back to me so I can throw them out. "
