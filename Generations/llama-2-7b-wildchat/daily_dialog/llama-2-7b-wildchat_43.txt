"Of course i believe in UFOs ! They're out there."

"You don't think they're real?"

"They are definitely real, I've seen one myself. It was about two years ago while camping in the desert. At first, it just looked like a little white dot on the horizon. But as soon as it got closer, I could tell that there was something strange about it."

"What did it look like?"

"It kind of had this weird shape to it; almost like an ellipse or something. And then these two beams of light shot out from each end and began moving around in a circle around the object. It was pretty incredible, I'll tell you that."

"But did you get any close-up pictures?"

"No, unfortunately not. By the time I had my camera out, it had already disappeared back into the sky."

"That sucks man."

"Yeah, but still - it happened! It was definitely a UFO and there's no denying that."

"So what do you think they are? Aliens from another planet?"

"I don't know for sure. All I know is that they're out there somewhere and we need to start taking these things seriously if we ever want to make contact with them."

"I do. They are out there." 

"But I never saw them."

"Of course, they are called UFOs, so not everyone can see them."

"You mean that you can see them?"

"That's right. I can see them in my dreams."

"They come to the earth?"

Do you believe in UFOs? Of course, I think that there are lots of different kinds of intelligent life forms out there. They might not be humanoid, but they could be very interesting and possibly much more advanced than us. But, do you really want to see a UFO? If so, I can probably take you up in the plane over where we're flying, and you can look down at them below. You don't have to worry about flying - it's just for fun!

I can't explain why they haven't shown themselves to us yet though (although if we were more advanced technologically speaking then maybe we would see their ships). They must be hiding somewhere within our atmosphere right now though because otherwise how else could any aliens get here? It might seem strange at first but it makes sense when you think about it - after all, why should these creatures risk their lives by coming into contact with us?

But that's only if they were visiting earth or traveling between different planets using their ships. If there is life elsewhere then perhaps those aliens just don't want anyone else discovering them yet so they stay hidden away until such time when humanity becomes advanced enough to understand what happened (and not destroy everything in sight).

What do you think about all this? Are these things real or just fiction created by people who like science fiction movies? Either way, it's still fascinating!

" I have been in contact with them for many years . "

" OK , what does it look like ? "

" You can see it through your dreams , but it's not easy . You need special abilities to communicate with aliens from the outer space . "

" What kind of abilities ? "

" I will explain you when we meet again . "

" Really ? When and where can I meet them ? "
