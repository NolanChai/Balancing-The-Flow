I got you covered, kiddo. Let me put on my writer cap and get this dialog rolling!

[Rolls eyes] I can't believe you don't want to just leave already.

You have a death wish, don't you? We need to go right now or else we're going to miss our appointment. Come on, let me drive us there at least so that we make it in time!

[Sighs] Fine, fine... but let's get moving before I lose my patience!

"Wait a minute! Hold your horses."

"What's your hurry, anyway?"

"Well, I gotta stop and get gas in the car first. That won't take long if there aren't any people at the pump."

"Well, I'm not quite ready."

"I'll give you five more minutes then I'm gonna leave without ya."
