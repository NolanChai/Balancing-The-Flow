"Yes, I will get that done as soon as possible . I hope we don't run into any problems with our usual supplier again like last month . "

"Well , the office supply store might not have as many cartridges in stock . If they are unable to deliver them by tomorrow afternoon , then we could try an alternative vendor . "

"I am sorry but housekeeping will not be able to help us out with this order . They already placed their own toner order earlier today and the order is too large for us to accommodate it . "

"Well, that's OK. We can still make arrangements at a different store. The housekeeping department has been using us as their usual supplier for quite some time now but they have taken advantage of our bulk discounts and free delivery in the past."

"OK . I will do what I can to expedite this order , but if it is not completed by tomorrow afternoon then we should start looking elsewhere . "

"The office supply store might be able to fulfill our toner cartridge request . If they don't have the right model , then maybe try some other vendors online . "

"I will ask around for suggestions on where else you can order from if our usual supplier isn't able to meet this demand . You can try posting a message on the intranet or putting up signs around office areas as well."

"No problem , I will make some calls and get back with you later today about possible alternatives if our usual supplier does not have the cartridges we need . "

"It's important that we complete this order as soon as possible so we can avoid any delays or disruptions in our print jobs. Do let me know how it goes ."

"The housekeeping department may be able to help us with an alternative supplier, but unfortunately they are already booked for the next few weeks . We need to find another solution before then."

"That's fine , I will see what other options there might be . "

"Try contacting our usual supplier again and ask them if they could deliver the toner cartridges earlier than their standard delivery time . You never know until you try !"

"I am sorry, but we may not have any luck finding another vendor with enough stock to meet your urgent requirements. However, I'll check other alternatives just in case."
