Susan was a little bit better yesterday. That is good news.

So, do I have to wait at the stop for the bus?

No, but I donâ€™t think it would be convenient if you caught the 13th. Just take the bus that goes to the hospital.

Jane is going to see Susan at the hospital.
John saw her yesterday, and she was a little better.
Jane doesn't have to take the No. 7 bus; she can take any of several other routes that also go to the hospital.
John advises Jane against taking the number 13 bus because they run more frequently than the number 7.
