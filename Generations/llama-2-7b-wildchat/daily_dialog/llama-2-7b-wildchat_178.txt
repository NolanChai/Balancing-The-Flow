I got it. It was a parking ticket, wasn't it? But why can't we talk about something else? I feel so stressed. How could you say such hurtful things to me like this? Just because I don't have as much experience in driving doesn't mean that my feelings aren't as valid or important. You're making me angry now, and I really need to take a break from this conversation for now.

"Let's not talk about it anymore. I'm sorry if you feel hurt, but that ticket was unavoidable."

Have you ever gotten a parking ticket?

I've never gotten one. Have you?

Yes, I got a ticket yesterday.

Really? What did you get one for?

I parked in the red zone. 

Why did you do that?

I needed to get something really quick.

"Really, that's unfortunate. Have you ever gotten a parking ticket before? No, I haven't, but it does happen from time to time."

"I've never received one either. What did you get the ticket for?"

"Oh no! It was yesterday? What did they say about your violation?"

"It was in a red zone, so they gave me a fine."

"Why didn't you follow proper parking regulations and park elsewhere?"

"I needed to get something very quickly. I thought it would be okay if I just parked at my building for a short period of time."

"Where were you planning on leaving your vehicle?"

"In front of my apartment building, but unfortunately, that was a violation."

I have never gotten a parking ticket. Have you?

Yes, I did yesterday. I got one for parking in the red zone. Why did you do that?

I parked there because I needed to get something really quick. Where did you park at?

At my apartment building. Don't you have your own parking spot?

I had to be fast.
