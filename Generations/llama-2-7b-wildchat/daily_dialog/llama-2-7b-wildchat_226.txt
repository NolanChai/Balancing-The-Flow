The response will be a continuation of the conversation. 

"Honey, I know you are very worried about this, but we have to make sure that Tony learns how to talk in a more respectful way. You're his mother, and he needs to understand that it is not acceptable for him to say things like "kick mommy," or "beat mommy." We need to teach him appropriate language.

"We can do this by setting clear boundaries with him when we notice these types of behaviors. Whenever Tony uses inappropriate words, let him know immediately that it is not acceptable and explain why. Then, help him find a replacement phrase or word that he can use instead. For example, you might say something like "Tony, please don't use hurtful language towards me; please say 'I need help.'"

"Another important thing to remember is to remain calm and consistent with your response each time Tony uses inappropriate words. This way, he will start to understand the consequences of his actions and learn how to communicate more effectively.

"Also, make sure that you are always giving Tony plenty of positive reinforcement for using appropriate language. Whenever he speaks respectfully, praise him so he knows that this is what you want from him in the future.

"Honey, I know it can be hard sometimes, but don't worry too much about it; we will help Tony learn how to talk more appropriately with time and patience."

"It is very important that you show your son the right way to behave, and when he learns how to talk respectfully then he will learn from you."

"You are a good mother. Remember Tony has a young mind and his behavior can be improved through your training. There are many children who grow up with bad habits but they all have the potential to change for better as long as their parents train them correctly."

"If I could give you some advice, you must tell him in a calm voice how much you love him, and never scold him or use violence to make him listen. Give him time to think about what he has done wrong instead of yelling at him when he speaks rudely. Be patient with your son because one day he will understand that bad habits can ruin relationships."

"I am here for you whenever you need help with Tony, so don't hesitate to ask me questions if there are any difficulties in the future."
