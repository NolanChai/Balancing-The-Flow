"I wasn't but then I saw how cows were treated and how much they suffer so now I don't eat meat."

Sorry , you are going to have to spell out that last word.

Hey Julie, you want to go grab something to eat?

Sure! What do you feel like having?

I really feel like having a big juicy steak.

Oh, okay. I don't eat meat, but that's fine. I'm sure wherever we are going they will have other options right?

I didn't know you were a vegetarian. 

I'm not, I am a vegan.

A what?

A vegan. I don't eat or use any animal-based products. I don't wear leather, eat eggs, drink milk, or anything that comes from an animal. I used to be a pescatarian before, which basically means you don't eat meat, but still have fish and seafood.

Wow! That's interesting! It must be tough.
