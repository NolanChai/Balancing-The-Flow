Let's have some lunch ; do you know of a great restaurant somewhere? 
Yes, I'm hungry. What types of food sound good? 
Maybe just a quick sandwich, salad, or something. 
I have a great idea of where you might like to go. 
Can we walk there?

"I do know of an amazing restaurant just a few blocks from here. They have one of the best sandwiches and salads around, and they are open until late in the evening if we want to stop by there after dinner."

"Sounds perfect! Let's go check it out!"
