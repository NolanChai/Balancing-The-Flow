"Okay . Well , the reason why this may be happening is because someone in your party is likely using them up too quickly . Have any other guests noticed the same thing ? "

### Response #2:

" I see . I'll have a word with my friends . Maybe they can help me out."

"I understand that you want more amenities. However, this is not something that we can provide for you at the moment."

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Sir, let us check out your account."

"Okay..."

"Now, it looks like you've run out of your amenities. You won't be able to use the amenities again until you return from your trip."

"Oh no! How can I get more amenities?"

"I'm afraid that's impossible right now, sir. There's a limited supply of amenities available for each room. We always have more in stock, but they won't be replenished until we receive new inventory from our suppliers."

"But what about the souvenirs? Can I get any souvenirs?"

"Yes, you can still purchase souvenirs while you're on your trip. All of the amenities are for personal use only, but you're welcome to buy as many souvenirs as you want."

"Okay, thank you very much!"

"Okay , I understand . You can pick up your free amenities from the front desk . "

" And what about my free soap ? "

" As a guest of the hotel , you're entitled to complimentary amenities such as shampoo and conditioner . "

" But I was hoping for some extra to use as souvenirs . "

" I apologize , sir . The front desk has no access to those items at this time . "

" How can I get them then ? "

" Well , you see , our hotel tries its best to give guests what they need for a comfortable stay here . "

" But we're not able to offer free souvenirs as that would be unfair to other guests who haven't been given any yet . "
