"Hi , Alice, what are you doing this Sunday? Why?"

"Not much really. What's up?"

"If you're free, maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday. It will be fun, you will get to know lots of people."

"Sounds great! I'd very much like to accept your invitation, thanks! When?"

"Around six pm."
