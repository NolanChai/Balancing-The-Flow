"I came here 20 years ago."

Paula, your response is correct. It's a little more detailed than the original script and flows better as a result of it. The question is a bit ambiguous though because it doesn't specify whether it asks about where Paula was born or if she moved from somewhere else. If you were to write out her whole biography, I would probably include something about being born in Montreal. But for the purpose of this exercise, I'm assuming she was born and raised there, which is why your response is correct.

"I'm from Canada, originally. From Montreal, where I was born. We moved here when I was 14 years old. After that, I went to high school here and then college in Texas."

"When did you come to Los Angeles?"

"I came here after graduation. Did you get a job right away?"

"I'm from Canada, originally. From Montreal."

"Where were you born?"

"Canada, originally."

"From Canada? Where did you go to school?"

"Montreal."

"When did you come to Los Angeles?"

"We moved here when I was fourteen."

"Did you get a job right after graduation?"

"No, I traveled for a while in Europe after college and then I lived in France."

"When was that? "

Paula nodded. 

"It certainly was. It took a long time to find the right job for me in my field, so I ended up taking some odd jobs before finding something."

"Odd jobs?"

"Yes," Paula laughed lightly. "I worked at an art gallery, in an office, and as a tutor. And even though I had all of those experiences, it still took me a while to find something that really clicked."
