Wei!

I know, but I wasn’t expecting you to take it so hard. I thought you were kidding when you offered those bargain prices on your stuff. I guess it just caught me off guard because it was a sweet offer.

But now that we’re talking about it, maybe there is something we can do. You didn’t have to come all this way just to save a few bucks; if you really wanted to, there are plenty of flea markets around here where I could probably pick up some great stuff for even cheaper.

And trust me, I am happy with the things I bought. They were perfect! But that doesn’t mean I can’t splurge every once in a while—it makes life more fun and enjoyable. Besides, it was nice of you to offer these items at such an attractive price; maybe next time we could negotiate something similar?

I know, FYI, there is a flea market nearby where I can probably find some really cool stuff for even cheaper than what I bought from you—but like I said, I’m happy with everything already. 

Maybe in the future when we do this again, we could try to negotiate something similar to this deal? I appreciate your time and generosity Wei!

### Dialog:

1) Wei : “I heard from the news that there is a new mall coming up around here. It will be much bigger than what’s available right now.”

2) Liu : “Yeah, it sounds really exciting! I can’t wait until all those stores open so I can check them out for myself.”

3) Wei : “Me too. And there are rumors that they will have some amazing deals on electronics and other stuff. I bet you could save a lot of money if you shop there instead of the regular mall.”

4) Liu: “Oh, really? That’s great news! I’ll definitely be checking out this new mall once it opens up.”

5) Wei : “Yeah, same here. And who knows, maybe we can even find some cool stuff for ourselves too at those bargain prices.”

6) Liu: “You know what? Let’s plan a trip there together next weekend so we can explore everything it has to offer.”

7) Wei : “Sounds like a good idea! I’ll make sure to pick up something nice for myself as well.”

8) Liu : “Awesome, can’t wait to check out this new place together!”
