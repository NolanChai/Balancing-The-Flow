I disagree with your assessment of the film. The plot may have been thin, but I thought the acting was quite good. In fact, I would argue that the acting was one of the best aspects of the movie. 

Your criticism is well-founded, however. There were definitely some parts where the acting could have been better. I don't think we can expect perfection from any film, but there are ways to improve upon certain scenes or moments. It would be great if you could share specific examples of areas where you thought the acting could have been improved in order for us to discuss this further.
