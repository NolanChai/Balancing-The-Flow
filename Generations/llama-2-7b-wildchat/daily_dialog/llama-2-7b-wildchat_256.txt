I know how difficult it is to accept a break and move on. If we want things to work out in our favor, we have to let go. Don’t worry too much about what he's doing or if he's cheating on you because sometimes there are uncertainties that occur when two people are not together anymore. This isn’t the end of your relationship - it could just be a temporary setback!

“You shouldn’t assume anything right now. He might want some time alone to think things through or maybe he is busy with work.” It's important not to jump into conclusions so quickly without any facts because even if your heart tells you that something bad happened, try giving him the benefit of doubt first before assuming anything!

You can’t force someone else's feelings towards another person – they have every right in this world to be with whoever they want. If he truly loves you as much as he claims then there is no reason why he shouldn't call back after all these years apart from each other again soon enough!

It is obvious that you have been hurt and are going through a difficult time. It's understandable to feel anxious, upset or stressed when something like this happens. However, it seems like you are blaming yourself for what has happened without considering his actions as well. You shouldn't be so hard on yourself since this is not entirely your fault; he also has a choice in how he wants to act and respond to the situation.

I understand that you still love him but I believe it is important for both of you to take some time apart from each other before trying again. This will give you an opportunity to work on yourself, gain more clarity about what you truly want out of this relationship, as well as explore any potential issues within yourselves which might be contributing towards the problems in your relationship. It's important not only for your sake but also his so both of you can start afresh with a better understanding and appreciation for each other when things are back on track again later down the line.

Remember that life doesn’t always go as planned but if we remain resilient through these tough times then eventually everything will work out in its own beautiful way - even if it means parting ways from one another temporarily while finding ourselves again along this journey called ‘life'. Take care of yourself during this difficult period; do something that makes you feel better like spending time with family and friends who understand what’s happening right now. Don't forget to take deep breathes whenever needed because those little moments can make all the difference when trying times get tougher than usual :)

### Instructions: Help me write a 100-word response to my friend. It is an important conversation between our main character and his best friend. He feels betrayed, sad, and confused. Do not change the format, but please add his emotions in italics or underlined.

"Hey man , I can't believe what just happened . This sucks ! "

"I know bro , it really does . But at least we can take comfort in knowing that we tried our best to make things work out between us two . "

"What about her ? Didn ' t she say she still loved me ? I thought we were meant for each other . "

"Yeah , maybe she did mean it when she said those words but ultimately it was up to you whether or not you wanted them back in your life again . From what I saw with my own eyes , it seemed pretty clear that even though things weren ' t perfect between us two , there still existed an unbreakable bond of love between both parties which should never be taken lightly . "

"But why did she decide against giving me another chance ? It makes no sense ! We had such a strong connection , we understood each other better than anyone else out there . "

"Sometimes life throws curve balls at us and we are forced to make tough decisions without knowing all of the answers ahead of time . Maybe this was just one more obstacle standing between both parties which needed overcome before moving forward together again as a couple once more ? I don't know but what matters most now is how much faith do you have in yourself that no matter what happens , things will work out for best in end ! "

"... It ’ s not fair . She can ’ t just do this to me like this . I mean , we were on a break but still ... "

" Come on, man ! You gotta stay positive and strong here . Remember that she left you because of your own actions , so now it ' s up to you whether or not you want to forgive her for what happened . If not , then there are other women out there who would love nothing more than having someone like yourself in their lives . "

"But how could I ever move on from this ? She was supposed to be my everything ! "

"Hey, don ’ t be so hard on yourself right now ! Maybe this whole situation will serve as a wake up call for both of you , allowing each party involved find out what exactly they really want out life without having any regrets later down line . Besides , who knows ? Perhaps some day soon enough after giving things more time apart , maybe even years , maybe everything could change between y'all two again . But until then , let ’ s focus on ourselves instead . "

"But I … I just don’t know how to live without her ... she was my entire world ! "

"Listen up, friend - this too shall pass eventually . Take solace in knowing that everything happens for a reason even though it may not seem like one right now but trust me , once time heals those wounds then hopefully both parties involved will realize what they truly need out life without having any regrets later down line !"

" ... I just can't believe that she would do something like this . "

"It is unfortunate what happened , but sometimes relationships come to an end for whatever reason . You should try not blaming her too much and instead focus on finding inner peace within yourself during this difficult time."

"But how am I supposed to go on without her ? She was my everything ! "

"I understand it is hard, but you will have to learn how to move forward and live with the situation. Think about what went wrong in your relationship and try not repeating those mistakes again in future relationships."

"But ... how do I know if someone else won't hurt me too ? "

"You must trust yourself and be able to recognize red flags or warning signs early on so you can avoid getting involved with someone who isn ' t good for you . Additionally , don ' t rush into a new relationship until both parties have taken some time apart from each other first - this will help ensure that any future partnerships are healthy ones !"

"But … I just want her back ... "

"It sounds like there might still be hope for reconciliation if only one party wants it badly enough but do not rush into anything until both parties have had a chance to cool off first . Take time away from each other , explore what went wrong between you two so that when you meet again later down the line , hopefully things will work out better than before !"

"I ’ ve been trying to move on ever since she left but it ’ s so hard . "

"That's understandable , it can be tough letting go of someone we care about deeply . But trust me when I say that things will get better over time and eventually you ' ll find love again ! Just remember not all relationships last forever - sometimes they come into our lives just for a short period but ultimately serve their purpose in teaching us valuable lessons along the way which ultimately make us stronger individuals down line !"

"But ... how ? I just can't stop thinking about her every single day . "

"Take your mind off of her for now by focusing on other things like spending time with family/friends or maybe even picking up a new hobby such as learning how to play an instrument ! Fill those empty moments with joyful experiences so that eventually they become more enjoyable over time rather than constantly thinking about someone who isn't part of your life anymore ."

"But … I just don ’ t see why she had to break up with me like this ? It ' s not fair ! "

"Sometimes things happen beyond our control , even though it may seem unfair at first glance - but remember that everything happens for a reason eventually !

" Come on, don 't be so dramatic! I 'm sure everything will work out just fine. You're overreacting."

"You think so? Oh no! How can he do this to me? I 'm sure he 's cheating on me! Why else wouldn't he call?"

"But we 're on a break, theoretically he can do whatever he likes. "

"He 's the love of my life! I 've really messed this up."

"Come on hon, pull yourself together. It 'll be alright."

"But I...I still love him! And it's all my fault. I can't believe how immature and selfish I was being. I mean he is a firefighter; it's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner. I 've totally messed this up!"

"You know what, Veronica? I think you should make the first step. I'm sure he will forgive you ... "

"No way! This is not gonna happen! I...I 've ruined everything ..."
