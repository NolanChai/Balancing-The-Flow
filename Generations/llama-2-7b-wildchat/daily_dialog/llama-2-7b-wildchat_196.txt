"Well, as much as I would like to say something about us being able to take your trip next month or two months from now; unfortunately, my bank account doesn't agree with me. After taking care of some bills and other expenses this year, I don't have enough money left over for an international journey."

"You know that when we talked about this before, you said you had a little money saved up somewhere - did it come from your birthday or something? It could help us get to Europe sooner than later. "

"I'm afraid not. I already used the money from my birthday for some things I wanted back then and couldn't put it off anymore."

"That's too bad, but maybe we can find a way to make it happen somehow. I was thinking that if we could look into some local travel packages or rent out our apartment while we're gone, we might be able to afford going somewhere closer to home this time around."

"I wouldn't mind the idea of staying close by and exploring what our beautiful country has to offer. But unfortunately, I don't have any other suggestions right now regarding this matter. "

"Don't worry about it too much! We will come up with something soon enough."

I could go for that. But I’m afraid our budget is a little tight this year.

Oh, but I really need to leave this town for a change. Working day after day has worn me out. Do you have any other suggestions?

We should probably think about going somewhere that isn’t too far away. How about the countryside? There must be many interesting places and we could enjoy the fresh air and delicious local specialties.

Wonderful! I think that's a great idea. How soon until we can make this happen? I can't wait!

Tomorrow, I have an appointment with my dentist. What about next Monday?

Perfect. I’ll start preparing tomorrow. If we’re going to drive, I’ll need to fill up the tank.

You have to write the next part of the dialog. The person in italics is talking and you should respond with a speech bubble containing your response. Remember, these are real people having a real conversation! 

"Sure! I'll help you get ready for our trip. We can pack the car tonight after work and hit the road early tomorrow morning!"

"That sounds great!"

Hi, darling! It's great that you have a one-month vacation saved up. Let's discuss our plans for Europe and see if we can make it happen. I think a trip abroad would be fantastic, but as you said, our budget is tight this year. We should probably look at other options. How about going somewhere nearby? There are so many beautiful places in the countryside. We could enjoy fresh air, delicious local food and get away from the busy city life for a while.

I have an appointment with my dentist tomorrow, but let's discuss our plans further on Monday. I think we should start preparing now. If we drive, I need to fill up the tank first. However, I prefer taking a bus or train. It will be cheaper and less stressful. We can always rent a car if needed.

I'll book the tickets for the train tomorrow morning, so let me know which day works best for you. I would also suggest checking the weather before we go. You don't want to get caught in rain, especially when traveling by public transportation.

Don't forget to check the local events happening during our trip as well. We can plan some exciting adventures along the way! With your enthusiasm and creative ideas, I know this week will be enjoyable. Let's make it happen!
