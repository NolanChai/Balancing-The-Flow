"Well, at least you gave the company a fair warning. But please don't make hasty decisions. You have so much potential here, Amelia, and with this new project we're launching next month, there will be ample opportunities for growth."

"Thank you, Sam. I appreciate your kind words, but my mind is made up."

"But surely you could reconsider?"

"I'm afraid not, Sam. This isn't the first time I've had to make a difficult decision like this. It just doesn't feel right working here anymore."

"Have you considered talking to human resources about your concerns or finding another position within the company? They might have an alternate solution that we haven't thought of yet."

"Honestly, Sam, I've exhausted all those options. It just comes down to my values and what's best for me in the long run."

"I understand, but please reconsider, Amelia."

"What? Another company is going to hire you away from me?" Amelia couldn't believe her ears. She was shocked by this sudden turn of events.

"Yes, that's correct."

"But I can't believe they would do such a thing without talking to me first!"

"I understand your concern, but unfortunately it's out of my hands now," he replied apologetically. "The company is making cutbacks and has offered me a better position elsewhere."

"This feels like a personal betrayal! You promised me you would give me this job for life!" Amelia was angry and hurt, struggling to keep her composure.

"Amelia, please understand that I don't have much of a choice here," he explained again calmly but firmly. "The new opportunity is too good to pass up, and my loyalty lies elsewhere now."

She pondered his words for a moment before asking one more question: "Are you sure this isn't just an excuse? Maybe there's another reason why you need to leave?"

"No, I promise it's not," he replied with confidence. "This offer is genuine and the timing couldn't be better."

Suddenly feeling defeated, Amelia could only mutter under her breath: "Well then...I guess that's that."

### Conclusion:
Sadly for Amelia, the dialogue had come to a close. Her manager's resignation meant that she was without a leader in an uncertain time of transition and uncertainty. She couldn’t help but feel betrayed by his decision to take another job without discussing it with her first – even if he did have good reasons for leaving. All Amelia could do now was hope that things would work out better soon – although it might take some time before she could truly trust anyone again after this turn of events..

I’m sorry, Amelia. You won’t continue working for our company because we are downsizing and you have been a dedicated employee since you joined us in 2013. As it is complicated, I understand that there is another reason beyond the economic climate of our business, and I respect your decision to take on this new opportunity with an overseas firm that will require your traveling skills and experience.

I wish you all the best in New York, where I have never been but would love to visit some day when my schedule permits it. I appreciate your commitment to our team these past years and look forward to seeing what other amazing opportunities arise for you on this journey ahead!

Best of luck with everything, Amelia.

Sure, Amelia. What do you need?
Well, I wanted to let you know that I've put in my notice. It's complicated but basically it boils down to one thing – this company is downsizing and I can't continue working for a company that may let me go. But there's another reason - I've got a better offer.
It will be sad to see you go, but sounds like you have found yourself a great opportunity.
I feel lucky and look forward to dealing with overseas companies as well as having the chance to use English more.
