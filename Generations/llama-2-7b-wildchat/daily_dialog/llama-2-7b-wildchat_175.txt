"I think it will be an exciting games this time. I believe we will have a great medal haul, but I don’t think the gold medals will come easily. We have some world-class athletes for sure, but I would not count on too many of them winning any gold medals."

1. “Yes, Mike Farmer has made it into the Olympic Team! He broke the national record by 0.1 seconds. That is absolutely amazing!”
2. “That’s great news! He’s the best runner I’ve seen this season. I’m sure he will bring home a medal at the Olympics.”
3. “I think you’re right, he definitely deserves to be part of our team. We have an incredible athletics team and they should do well in the Olympics.” 

4. “Well, let’s just wait and see how it turns out. I don’t know exactly how many medals we will win but I hope we can bring home as many medals as possible.”
5. “What other events are you thinking about?”
6. “In the last Olympics, we did very well in swimming, cycling, and ball sports. I think we have a good chance to do well in those same events again. And maybe even get some gold medals!”
7. “Yes, I agree with that! Our team has put in a lot of practice and they should be ready for the competition.”
8. “We might also get a gold medal in sailing because our team did really well last time too.”
