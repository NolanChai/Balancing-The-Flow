“I’m calling to find out why I didn’t receive an unemployment check this week.”

“Did you send in your Continued Claim Form for the last period?”

“No, I forgot to send it in!”

“You need to be very careful to send that form in every two weeks if you want to get paid. We will still accept it, but we prefer you send it on time.”

“Can I mail it in early next time so it isn’t late?”

“Actually, you cannot mail it in early because it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date.”

“Will my check come right away now?”
