The Dragon Boat Festival, also known as Tuen Ng or Duanwu Festival, is a traditional and cultural holiday celebrated annually in China, Hong Kong, Macau and other countries with significant Chinese population to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a famous patriotic poet during the Warring States period.

The Dragon Boat Race originated from an ancient legend about Qu Yuan, who was a great poet and advisor to the Chu Kingdom. He was known for his loyalty, integrity and strong opposition towards corruption within the court. However, when the kingdom fell into the hands of powerful forces, Qu Yuan was accused of treason and banished from the court.

Qu Yuan eventually committed suicide by drowning himself in a river to protest against the corrupt political system and his exile. When the Chu Kingdom collapsed, people started celebrating the death anniversary of Qu Yuan as an act of remembrance, mourning and respect.

During these celebrations, locals would gather together on riverside beaches to row their boats and beat drums rhythmically in an attempt to keep dragons away from Qu Yuan's body so that he could rest peacefully. As the festival continued to evolve over time, races became a popular activity among locals.

Overall, the Dragon Boat Festival has become a symbol of loyalty and patriotism for Chinese people as it honors the memory of a great poet who sacrificed his life in pursuit of justice.
