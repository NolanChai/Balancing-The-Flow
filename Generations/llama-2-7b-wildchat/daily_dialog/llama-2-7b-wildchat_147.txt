"That sounds great. 
I love Chinese food, but I never think about eating out because it is so difficult for me.
How did you decide on what to order?
Are they the ones that look spicy on the menu?"

"The restaurant across the street hired a new Chinese chef , so I ordered some Chinese food there for this evening . 
I saw something hot and spicy, so I decided to try it. They look very inviting on the menu. You are going to love them. "

"That sounds great. I am sure we will enjoy our meal tonight. 
Maybe we can find a place to learn some Chinese cooking? I heard there is a place in Chinatown where you can take courses, and we can become experts! Are you interested?"

"I'm not sure. I don't enjoy cooking that much. As long as we can order it from a restaurant, we don't have to learn how to do it by ourselves. "
