Grand Theft Auto Three is a revolutionary game, unlike anything you've ever experienced. With its immersive and highly realistic graphics, it puts you in the driver's seat of an epic crime adventure. You'll explore a vast open-world city filled with countless side quests, challenging missions, and intense action sequences. It's definitely more violent than TV news - if you can imagine that! As for what time it is right now...it depends on your perspective. If you're in the midst of a heist or running from police cars, then nine-thirty might feel like three hours have gone by already. But if you've just been enjoying some leisurely driving around the city, well...it could easily be three hours since you started playing!
