" Okay . But I can only give you like 10 minutes . I have to do homework. "

What’s on TV tonight? Not much, that new reality-TV show Ally McNeal… oh, and that Dark Angel. Wait a second… I want to watch Ally McNeal. Oh come on! That’s such a girls show. No it’s not; it’s just funny. Yeah, if you’re a girl. Well, you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl.

"Yeah but Ally McNeal doesn’t need any kind of excuses. She already dresses like that, and I still love it."

"Besides, you watch sports so you can see girls wearing short skirts and tight shirts."

"I don’t even have to look at their faces; I just know they’re women because of the way they dress. And if Dark Angel isn’t good enough for you, then there are a hundred other shows you could watch with those ‘hot guys.’"
