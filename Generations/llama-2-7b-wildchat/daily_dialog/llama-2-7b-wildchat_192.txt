This dialog is in a novel. The author is writing as the main character, who works in an ad agency and writes for a magazine called Brandweek. 

The scene takes place on October 11th, during one of his work days at the office. He's at the computer desk with two coworkers, Mike and Bean, joking around about how they have no direction in their new brand campaign. They make fun of Mike for sending out fifty different ads to various magazines without any guidance on what message they should convey.

The scene is set up like this: 

"How can we develop a new brand image with no direction whatsoever?" - The main character, who's writing as the author. He asks Bean and Mike for advice or ideas to help them create a campaign without any guidance from their supervisor. 

"With the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we'll inadvertently get inspired." - Mike replies with this sarcastic joke, implying that they might gain inspiration by looking through all those different ads and seeing what stands out to them. It's meant to show how ridiculous it is to send out so many variations without any direction or purpose in mind.

"I guess this is a good excuse to surf the Net on someone else's dime." - Bean comments with another sarcastic joke, indicating that they can spend some time looking at other advertisements online since their boss isn't giving them any guidance or direction. It also serves as an indication of how frustrated he is with this situation and wants to move on quickly without wasting anymore time trying to figure out what should be done next in the brand campaign process.

"Who'd have thought Bean would be this kind of e-mail fanatic?" - Mike's reply shows his surprise at how much time their coworker spends browsing various websites instead of working on other tasks related to their job responsibilities; it seems like he is more interested in exploring digital media than completing actual work tasks assigned by their supervisor.

"He must have just got online for the first time last week." - The main character comments with this sarcastic joke, implying that Bean only recently became familiarized with computers and/or Internet usage which explains why he spends so much time exploring different websites instead of focusing on assigned tasks related to their job responsibilities; it seems like he is more interested in exploring digital media than completing actual work tasks assigned by their supervisor.

The dialogue ends here, leaving the characters unsure about what direction they should take regarding this new campaign and how they can best utilize Mike's fifty different ad variations without any guidance from their supervisor or inspiration from browsing through other advertisements online using someone else's dime (aka company funds).
