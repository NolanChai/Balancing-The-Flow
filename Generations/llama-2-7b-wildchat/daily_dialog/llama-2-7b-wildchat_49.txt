How are you doing ? 

I 'm great, thanks. How about you? 

Sure, how can I help you? 

I would actually like to view the apartment for rent today. 

I'm sorry, but you won't be able to view it today. The tenants have moved out and we are doing some renovation work on the unit.

The dialogue between two people continues, as one person asks how the other is doing and whether they can help with a specific request. The response acknowledges the question but states that viewing the rental property will not be possible today due to scheduling constraints. To follow up on this point, the inquirer may ask for more information or suggest an alternative date/time for viewing the unit.

I think the response should sound more polite, but at least you are following the pattern of what is written. The problem is, it sounds robotic and not natural at all. The best advice I can give you is to find a recording of an English speaker doing this exact same dialog. You will then be able to hear how they use different tones that help the dialog feel more natural.

"It would be a pleasure to help you, [name]."

"Today is going great. How about yourself?"

"I am doing very well, and myself."

"How may I assist you today? Is there anything that concerns you?"

"Actually, I would love to view the apartment for rent. The details of it look promising on the website."

"Unfortunately, this won't be possible today. You must make an appointment beforehand."

"Why not? It is available today right?"

"Unfortunately no. It was already booked for other people to view at that time. You can check out our schedule and make an appointment as soon as possible."

"Oh, okay. Can I do it now?"

"Can you please schedule me for Friday at 6pm?"

"Of course! That sounds good for this evening, right? Is 6 o'clock on Friday suitable to you?"

"Yes, that will be fine. I am looking forward to viewing the apartment."
