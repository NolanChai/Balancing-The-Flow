" It's alright. I guess."

" I think you look like a lion cub in these pics. "

" Ha ! Thanks, I love it , I hope we can take more pictures together when you come back from the trip.  "

" You know what ? The ones with me dressed up are so much better than those from high school .  "

" Why not ? It ’ s natural for a woman to look sexy and attractive in her own way. Besides, it ’ s your style and you seem very comfortable with yourself. I love that about you . "

" And this one here ? "

" So cute !  "

" Come on , give me some more criticism ! I need to improve my appearance and keep up with the fashion world. "

Honestly, I’m not sure if it's that ugly or if you just want me to tell you that. But I can say one thing for certain… there is nothing you could possibly wear in front of my family that would embarrass me more than those pants. And don't even think about trying to defend yourself by saying they're comfortable, because the last thing I need is a lecture on how all men should be casual and not worry about wearing matching colors or coordinating their outfits in general. I don't know why you insist on buying such ugly clothing anyway! Do you really think that being flashy is going to make up for your complete lack of style?

You should make sure that the dialogue is realistic and natural, without any sudden changes in tone or format.

"Oh come on, it's only a game."

"Eh, so so..."

"And this one?"

"I don't know if I like it..."

"And this sweater from my aunt?"

"It's hideous, no question about it."

"Well, maybe we can try it on and see how it looks."

"Yeah sure..."

"You know what, why don't you just go shopping with me? You always complain that I never want to spend time with you, so let's do something fun together instead of watching a game we both know will end badly for our team."

"I mean, it's not like you care about what I think or feel..."

"You know what, just give me this one gift and shut up! Okay?"

"Fine...but don't come crying to me if your precious football loses again."
