Miao Ping : Well then. Let me tell you some more, The interest is settled on the 20th of the last month in each quarter , It's paid quarterly. Of course it also needs to be settled if you cancel the account .

Qing Qing : Miao Ping , in your opinion, should we go for the Type A or Type B Account?

Miao Ping: Well, the Type B Account is very restricted. If your aim is to use the account the same way as you use your Settlement Account, I would recommend the Type A Account for you.

Qing Qing : Thanks for your time. I'll go and discuss everything with my partner and Iâ€™ll be back later .
