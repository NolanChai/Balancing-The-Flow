"well , yes but they understand it. We had so many expenses after the wedding and my husband didn't want to burden me with them as well . He even insisted on paying for all of it . 
It was really sweet of him . "

"my wedding ceremony was simple, just the two witnesses and a registrar. But afterward, my husband and I had three parties - one in each of our home countries as well as here in New Zealand where we now live."

"That's a lot to organise! Was it expensive?"

"Not really, because both sets of parents were unable to attend the wedding, so we decided to celebrate with two parties in each country. It wasn't too difficult or costly."

"Were your family disappointed not to be able to attend?"

"I would have liked them there, but they couldn't afford it and neither could we. They understood the circumstances."

"Did you get a chance to meet your husband's family at any of these parties?"

### Explanation:
1. In this response, the speaker begins by describing the wedding ceremony itself as "simple," with two witnesses and a registrar present. However, following the wedding, they held three parties to celebrate in each of their home countries (New Zealand) as well as in the country where they now live (New Zealand).

2. When asked if it was expensive to hold these parties, the speaker explains that while they would have liked for both sets of parents to attend, they could not afford to travel and neither could their husband's family. Therefore, they opted for three separate parties instead.

3. Next, when asked about the response from her own family members who could not attend, she says that they understood the circumstances and were not disappointed since it was impossible for them to travel.

4. Finally, when questioned about whether or not she had an opportunity to meet her husband's family at any of these parties, she says "not really," as both families were unable to attend.

" actually , the only person who didn't know about our wedding was my husband ! He thought we were just going out for dinner with friends when we went to a small hotel room in London and I told him we had already got married . It was such a lovely surprise , and it made his face light up ! "

" that sounds like an amazing moment , Abigail . I'm sure your husband will never forget it . Did he enjoy the honeymoon ? "

" my husband loved our honeymoon , although we did have to keep a few secrets from his parents for a while before they found out we were married ! But after that , they were completely supportive of us . "

"We had the most wonderful, intimate ceremony that I would not trade for anything in the world. We went to a local chapel and had our best friends as witnesses. Afterwards we drove out into the desert with my husband's brother and spent some time together as just the two of us before heading home."

"Yes, it was incredibly special. We decided to have one party in each city I grew up in: New York City for me and Los Angeles for him. It wasn't that expensive actually—we did most of the work ourselves! We got married in a beautiful little chapel filled with our closest friends and family members, followed by an elegant reception at his parents’ house where everyone else could come together to celebrate."

"Of course they were disappointed, but also excited for us. My mother wasn't able to come because she had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer so I think that really helped them understand why we couldn't have a big traditional ceremony like others do."

"Absolutely! His family met mine right after he proposed atop Mt. Fuji in Japan—they were all so excited and supportive of our union."

"No, we decided against it since we wanted to save up for our first home together instead."

"We're not traditional people at heart anyway! But yes, we did eventually get away somewhere tropical afterwards for a week or two—it was amazing!"
