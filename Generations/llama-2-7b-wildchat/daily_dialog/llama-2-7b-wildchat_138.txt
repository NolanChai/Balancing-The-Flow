That is a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library! I hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas. That is right up my alley. You say party, and I'm there. Perfect. It will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about 5-700 people.

" That sounds like a wonderful opportunity . Let's begin thinking about food, music, entertainment, decorations etc. for the party. I love to plan these types of events! "

" We are going to need plenty of volunteers for this event ! "

" Let me see what I can do . "

### Response:

" I'm so glad you could help with the planning . I know it will be a great party thanks to all your hard work and dedication . "

" That is very kind of you to say . "

" You are such an asset to this library ! "
