I'm glad to hear that. As you know, in order to get approved, there are certain criteria that need to be met by potential business owners. The most important factor is the credit rating and debt-to-asset ratio; this indicates an individual's financial health and how likely they are able to make timely repayments on a loan or other type of debt obligation. Additionally, you mentioned another requirement called "Balance Of Net Liabilities". This measure ensures that any business owner has enough capital reserves available in case things go awry during operations so their losses don't exceed their assets held at risk over time periods when income fluctuates unpredictably due market conditions changing quickly without warning - like we saw recently during COVID-19 lockdowns.

Finally, another indicator which needs close attention is Return On Assets (ROA) - this shows how efficiently resources are being utilized across an organization's entire portfolio so returns can be maximized while minimizing costs simultaneously; thus demonstrating long term sustainability even when faced with challenges like market volatility or natural disasters like floods etcetera.

With all these points taken into consideration combined with proper documentation & evidence backing up claims made by applicants; we should be able to provide approval without any issue! Good luck with securing financing soon :-)
