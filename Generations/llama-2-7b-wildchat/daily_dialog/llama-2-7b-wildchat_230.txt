" That ’ s true ! I ’ ve been singing for years now ... but unfortunately , I can ’ t play any instrument . "

" Why don ’ t you give it a try? I know there ’ s a piano in the house ... and some of those songs are easy to learn. You ’ ll be our singer , if you like ! 

"Well, that sounds great ! But I ’ m afraid we won ’ t find anyone else . "

I 'm forming a music band. Do you already know how to play an instrument? Uh...Yeah! I've told you a thousand times that I'm learning to play the drums now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band. Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band? We have a guy who plays guitar and another who plays bass although we still haven't found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent right? Yes, I'm a singer. Perfect! So you can audition this weekend here at my house.
