The teacher, Miss. Wong, walks into the classroom and calls for her students to return to their seats. The students eagerly get up from their breaks and walk back inside the room with renewed energy. As they make their way back to their desks, they begin discussing how quickly time flies during a break.

“Does the class start again, mam?” one of the students asks.

“Yes,” Miss. Wong replies, “but let’s not waste any more time. It’s time for our next lesson.”

The class settles into their seats and begins preparing themselves for the upcoming lecture. The atmosphere is lively as everyone gets ready to learn something new.

Miss. Wong continues, “Now that you’re back in your seat, let's get started. Today we will be discussing the concept of 'fairness'.”

One student pipes up, “Oh, breaktime flies! It went by so fast!”

“I know,” Miss Wong chuckles, “break time always seems to go by in a blink of an eye. But let’s focus on our lesson for now.”

The students nod and return their attention to the teacher. As Miss.Wong begins her lecture, they eagerly take notes, hoping to absorb as much knowledge as possible.
