"Do you like to play football? What do you think of the World Cup? "

"Yes I do.I was a school football player in my childhood time . I have been watching the World cup every four years since 1986. It is always so exciting and inspiring. This year England has made great progress because they beat Argentina, Mexico and Sweden in the first round of the group stage. They will meet Japan next which I think it's going to be very interesting."

"People everywhere in China usually do Taijiquan early in the morning. It can help people keep fit. It has a history of over three hundred years",

"Is it easy to learn?"

"Yes, it is. I can teach you if you like."

"Thank you. I can teach you how to bowl.",
