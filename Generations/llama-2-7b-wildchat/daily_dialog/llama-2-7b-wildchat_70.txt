Well, it's late and we have to get home. You don't need to be so polite! I can stay for dinner with us tonight.

"I'm afraid I can't. I already have dinner plans."

"What? It's a dinner party?"

"It's just some friends over at seven."

"Oh, well then, that's fine! Can you come to England with me the day after tomorrow too?"

"Sorry, but I can't. I have plans."

"Well, it was nice meeting you!"
