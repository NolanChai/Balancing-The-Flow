Thanks for your response. Here is the next turn with no explanation or format changes.

Mr Carter has asked me to come over and invite you to the banquet held in your honor at the Shangri-La Hotel at 7:00 this evening. Here’s an invitation for you.
“How nice of him. I’ll be delighted to go. But what time would be convenient?”

“If you could be ready by, say 6:30 o’clock, I’ll be at the hotel to pick you up.”

“That's great. It’s most thoughtful of you to do this, Miss Rose.”

“It’s my pleasure. Well then, I’ll say goodbye.”
