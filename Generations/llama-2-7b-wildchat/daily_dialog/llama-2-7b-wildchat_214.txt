Yeah I took it yesterday. It was tough but manageable. There's so much material that I don't know what to emphasize on. Mostly the Civil War. You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr had on American society. What about Abraham Lincoln? Did you get any questions about him?

The next dialog should be something like this: 

"Did you take the history exam yet?"
"No. I have been studying hard but there's so much material."
"You can do it! You will definitely pass with good grades!"
"I hope so, but it's been a lot to cover in such a short amount of time."
"I took mine yesterday and it was tough. I had some questions on the Civil War and Martin Luther King Jr.'s impact on American society, but there were also questions about Abraham Lincoln, who is not covered as much in class."
"That's true. It might be helpful to brush up on his accomplishments."

Did you already take the history exam?
- Yes, it was hard. When do you take it?
- I'm taking tomorrow morning. There is so much material that I don't know what to emphasize on. What types of questions did you get?
- Mostly on the Civil War. You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr had on American society.
- What about Abraham Lincoln? Did you get any questions about him?
- I only got one question about him, but you might get more. I don't know if he will have the same exam or not.
- Hopefully, he will use the same exam because I'm going to spend most of my time studying the Civil War. It is a huge section and that's what he lectured on the most in class.
- If you can't study everything then that's probably the best way to go.
- Alright, thanks for the info. I gotta go to the library now.
