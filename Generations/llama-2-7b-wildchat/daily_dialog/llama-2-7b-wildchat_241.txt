"Excuse me sir, may I come in? 

Mike, you're late again. 

I'm sorry, but my sister was ill so I... 

Do you think I believe the story like that? 

But it's true!

Sure, come in.

Don’t you think you are late every day? You have been late for two days and said your sister was sick last time. The same excuse is used twice within one week! I don't believe that this story any more!

" I think you need to accept my apology before that . "

" But if you can not , then we 'll have another talk about this . "

" But we already had a talk about it. You didn't change anything 。 "

" You should know better by now . "
