"Well, John, I was looking through some magazines for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year. I've already told my buddy Mark that I am going hunting with him in Alaska. You can't be serious! Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. I am sorry that bothers you."

"I understand your frustration but I feel like we should spend time together as a couple this year and do something different than what we have been doing in the past. We can go to a place where there is no hunting allowed, relax by the beach or explore new cities together. My parents went on cruises for their honeymoon and it was an amazing experience; I think they had so much fun."

"Hunting might not be your cup of tea but maybe we can compromise with a trip where we can both have our own adventures? Maybe spend some time outdoors exploring nature while also having downtime together at night. We could even take turns cooking dinner for each other! I promise it'll be an unforgettable experience."

"I know how much this means to you, John but please understand my desire to do something different with our vacation time. Let me explain why this is important: we've been together over a year now and I think it's safe to assume that we'd spend our vacations together in the future as well. But for once let's explore new things, create memories together outside of hunting trips, and experience something completely different."

" I've already told my buddy, Mark, that I am going hunting with him in Alaska. Sorry that bothers you."
"You can't be serious!!"
"Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. I'm sorry that bothers you."
"After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume we would automatically spend our vacation together."
"Says who? I don't think that is necessarily the case."
"You know now that I think about it, I really don't have much more to say to you at all!"
