David nodded. It was always safer to be careful when driving in Shanghai, one of the most populous cities in China. The roads could get crowded, especially around rush hour or during special occasions like New Year's Eve. He remembered his international driver's license and vowed that he would follow all traffic rules carefully while renting a car in this busy metropolis.

"What about you , Mr Zhang? Are you going to drive us downtown? Or should we just take the subway?" asked David, turning to look at the bus driver.

Mr Zhang shook his head. "No, I can't take you there. But it's no problem. There are plenty of taxi drivers around who will gladly take you downtown for a reasonable price." He pointed toward a busy street corner across from the airport where several taxis were already waiting for customers.
"Just find one that looks safe, and they'll drop you off wherever you need to go in Shanghai."

David thanked Mr Zhang for his assistance and turned back towards his friend. "So, who wants to go first?" he asked with a smile.
