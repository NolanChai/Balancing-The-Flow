Tim walks away with Karren. He looks at his watch and says, “Oh! It’s getting late; I must leave now.” She gives a warm smile and says, “Yes, Tim, nice meeting you as well.” 
He replies, “I guess we’ll see just around here,” indicating they’re likely to meet again. Karren nods in agreement and continues on her way. The two part ways with a hopeful sense of possibility for the future.
