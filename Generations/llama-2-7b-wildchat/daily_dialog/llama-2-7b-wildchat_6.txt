"That's all right. Let's play."

Let’s play chess.
I haven’t played chess in a long time.
That’s all right. I’m a beginner and I’ve just learnt how to play. Look! There’s a chessboard. Those two men have already finished playing. You’re a very good player. Not really, but once I won a prize. So did I. I won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners.
