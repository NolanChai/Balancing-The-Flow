The life pods were designed not to be able to steer, yes. However, they are equipped with a small thruster that is capable of generating about 10 N of force for short periods of time in order to steer away from an incoming piece of debris or some other hazard. This will only give the pod a few seconds before the thrusters run out of fuel and must be recharged by solar power, which can take up to three hours depending on conditions outside. The thruster itself cannot generate enough force to turn around quickly once it has been activated.
