I woke up after being knocked out for several hours, everything around me had been changed. I'd never seen a sky so bright or felt the warmth of a sunrise before. I found myself on an island covered in trees with a beautiful lake surrounding it. It was like nothing I had ever imagined could exist! The next thing that happened blew my mind even more; there were creatures walking around me - some resembled humans, others had feathers and fur all over their bodies... but the most fascinating part was that they spoke to each other! I couldn't believe it - these amazing beings talking with one another right in front of my eyes.
I sat down on a rock near the shore as more creatures approached me curiously; some were timid while others had big smiles on their faces eager for conversation or simply just wanting to meet someone new like myself who had come into this strange yet beautiful world
