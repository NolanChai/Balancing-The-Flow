A sound woke me up in the dead of night. It sounded like a knock on my front door. It was three o’clock in the morning; I was sound asleep in bed. The house was dark, and the lights were off. 

I was alone, and I was scared. My heart pounded in my chest as I sat up in bed. I could hear footsteps outside, and I knew someone was at the door. 

My breathing quickened as I grabbed my phone and turned on the lights. As soon as I did that, a shadowy figure appeared in the doorway. 

I gasped, my heart racing even faster. It was a woman – tall, thin, with long dark hair. She smiled at me, her face lit up by the glow of the phone light. 

“Hello? Can I help you?” I asked, my voice trembling. 

The woman stepped into the room and shut the door behind her. Her gaze swept over me as she walked toward my bed. She stopped at my feet and smiled again. 

“I’m sorry to wake you, but I need your help,” she said in a soft voice. “Do you have a light?” 

My heart sank. I didn’t know what was going on, but I knew that this wasn't right. The woman reached out her hand for the phone and switched off the lights. 

The room was plunged into darkness. My breath caught in my throat as the figure stepped closer to me. “Please, I need you,” she said again, a desperate plea in her voice. 

My mind raced with questions – why would someone break into my house? Why was this woman here? Was she going to hurt me? My pulse quickened as I backed away from her. 

“I don’t know what you want,” I said, my voice shaking. “But I can’t help you.” With that, I turned and ran toward the door. 

I was halfway down the hall when she grabbed me by the arm, spinning me around. Her hands were cold and clammy as they gripped me tightly. “You have to help me,” she said urgently. 

My heart was beating so loudly that I thought it would burst out of my chest. I tried to shake off her grasp, but it was no use – she was too strong. 

With a sudden burst of energy, the woman threw me against the wall with such force that my head cracked against the hard surface. Stars danced in front of my eyes as I stumbled backward. 

The figure loomed over me menacingly, her face inches from mine. “I don’t have a choice,” she said. Her voice was cold and harsh, like steel on glass. “You have to help me.” 

I couldn't move – I could barely breathe. Tears filled my eyes as I stared into the woman's dark gaze. “Please don’t hurt me,” I pleaded, but it was too late. 

The figure leaned in closer, her face now right in front of mine. She smiled again and whispered in my ear: “Don’t make this harder than it has to be.” 

Then, before I could even process what happened, she reached out her hand and grabbed me by the throat. Her fingers were cold as they tightened around my neck, slowly squeezing tighter with each passing second. 

My vision started to blur as I tried desperately to breathe in air, but it was no use – she had complete control over my life now. 

Suddenly, a loud noise filled the room and the woman let go of me. It was like an explosion inside my head – all I could hear was ringing and screeching sounds that made every inch of my body hurt. 

As I struggled to catch my breath, I realized what had just happened. The woman had strangled me until the point where I thought she would kill me. 

But then something else occurred – a sharp pain at the base of my neck. It felt like an electric shock, but it was different this time – more intense and unbearable than anything else I’ve ever experienced before. 

My vision blurred again as the room started to spin around me. My head felt like it would explode any second now and I knew that if this kept up, death would be inevitable. 

I heard footsteps running down the hallway towards me – someone else was coming for me! Just before they reached my bedroom door, a voice shouted out: “Police! Hands up!” 

The figure turned and ran out of the room as fast as she could without losing her balance. The next thing I knew, there were police officers in front of me, guns pointed at her. She had escaped – but not before taking something from me that can never be replaced: my life. 

### Outro:

That was when I woke up. My heart pounding, sweat dripping down my forehead. It was a dream, but it felt so real. The nightmare was still fresh in my mind as I sat up in bed and turned on the lights. 

I was trembling, trying to regain control of myself after such an intense experience. But then suddenly, my phone buzzed with an incoming text message: "Are you okay? We heard a loud bang from your room." 

It was my best friend, checking up on me like always. I couldn’t help but smile – even though it had only been a dream, I felt relieved knowing that someone cared enough about me to come looking for me if something happened in my sleep. 

I typed back quickly: “Yeah, I'm fine now. Thanks for checking up on me.” And as soon as I pressed send, another text appeared: "Good! We thought you might be having nightmares again after what happened last week." 

My smile faded slightly at the mention of last week’s incident; it still haunted my dreams every night. But I forced myself to look on the bright side: at least this time I was safe, even in my sleep. 

I glanced around my room and noticed something – a small object sitting on my bedside table. It looked like an old necklace with some broken pieces attached to it. 

A sudden memory came rushing back into my mind: The woman who tried to strangle me last night, she had worn that exact same necklace around her neck before grabbing hold of me tightly. 

My heart skipped a beat as I reached for the pendant and held it in my hands carefully; there was something about this broken piece that felt so familiar yet alien at the same time. 

I knew then that whatever happened last night, it wasn't just a dream – it was real, and it would stay with me forevermore.
