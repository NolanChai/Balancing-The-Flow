You are correct in that you were not a "bad" person, however you were demonstrating what is known as poor social awareness. This can be seen through your lack of empathy when cutting people off without warning and being selfish with holding doors for others while rushing to get somewhere. It's important to remember that every action we take has an impact on the world around us, both good or bad depending on our intentions; by learning how to practice mindfulness and understanding others' feelings we can make better choices that benefit everyone involved in those situations instead of just ourselves alone!
