A ticking sound is heard coming from behind your back. When you turn around, a giant clock is there towering above you.
"Welcome... welcome..." it says in a mechanical voice. "I am a clock and I have been waiting for you. Do not fret, the monotony will not be endless."
The clock continues: "Every day, every second, has a purpose to those who follow me. No, they do not go according to my programming. The reason why is because I can sense when something great or terrible happens. If it's great, time seems to pass by faster and faster. If it's terrible, everything slows down. 
That is what we will call the Change."
The giant clock turns off its gears as it faces you with a smile. "Now my job is done here. Please follow me through this strange world. I promise you, it will be an exciting adventure!"
