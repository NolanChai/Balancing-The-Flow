lived out their lives in peace and harmony with a smile on their faces.

### Explanation:
The above instruction is to write a description of a battlefield where the immortals are dying. The sound of their deaths should be vividly described, using sounds such as gasping for breath, sobbing in pain, and whimpering for loved ones. The phrase "laying on the battlefield" implies that these mortals are lying helplessly on the ground, listening to this horrific scene unfold around them.

The response describes how these immortals lived their lives peacefully before dying on a battlefield, with a smile on their faces as if they had finally found peace and acceptance of their fate. This is an ironic twist on the idea that death should be feared or dreaded but instead celebrated for what it is - an end to suffering.
