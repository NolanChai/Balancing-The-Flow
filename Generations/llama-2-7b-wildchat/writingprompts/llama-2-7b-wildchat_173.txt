Sorry for the late response! You are more than welcome to change/rephrase this at any point if it feels too awkward for you or anything. :)
I understand your pain. I always wanted a normal life, but when I was little, my parents decided to do everything in their power to make me feel better. They used hypnosis on me and gave me super powers so that they could keep me hidden from society because I am a mutant. It felt like there were no other options at the time. 
But now? Now...I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to be normal and live as any human would, but it doesn't help that I have super powers!
You see, I was born with a mutant ability where I can generate fire from my hands. I mean, it's not the most powerful of all abilities, but still...I feel like I should be doing something great with it! But being normal is more important to me than anything else in this world.
Sorry if that was too much for you to read through or hear. I just needed someone who could understand what I am going through right now because no one else really does. 
Anyways, please let me know whenever you want to talk about it and we'll figure things out together!
