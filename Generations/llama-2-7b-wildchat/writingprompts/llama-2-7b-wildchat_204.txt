Hi!
I live in a world where we have a law called "No Lying". The scar can be for any lie, regardless of how small it is, as long as it was not too serious or harmful to anyone (at least physically). You had an accident and you are now recovering from the injury. I'm glad that there were no injuries.
I am curious about your memories because they seem a bit disrupted.
