``No, sir, you are not.'' Mark stated with a sigh, "You're just an old man who has delusions of grandeur."
"Blasphemy!" Johnson slammed a fist onto his desk. "I am your new God, and as such, you will give me due homage!"
"No," Mark said flatly. "I will not. You are nothing more than an old man with delusions of grandeur."
Johnson's face grew red with rage. "You will pay for this insolence!" he screeched, leaping up from his chair and advancing on Mark.
Mark stood his ground, unflinching in the face of Johnson's wrath. "I am not afraid of you, sir," he said calmly. "I know that you are just an old man who has lost touch with reality."
With a deafening roar, Johnson hurled himself at Mark like a wild beast. The two men wrestled fiercely on the floor, their fists and feet flying in a blur of movement. Finally, exhausted from the struggle, they collapsed into a heap, gasping for breath.
Johnson looked up at Mark with eyes filled with hatred and spite. "I shall never forget this day," he said in a trembling voice. "When I have regained my strength, you will pay for your insolence!" And with that, Johnson staggered away from the room.
Mark stood slowly to his feet, dusting himself off as he surveyed the wreckage of his office. He shook his head in disbelief at what had just transpired. "I suppose I should have expected this," he muttered to himself. "Sometimes you just can't reason with a delusional old man."
With a sigh, Mark turned and walked out of the room, leaving Johnson to plot his revenge.
