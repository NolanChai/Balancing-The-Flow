I heard a loud boom in my head and felt a splitting pain. "NO!" I screamed, struggling to stay conscious. As the world spun around me, I tried to keep my bearings, but everything became a blur. 
My vision went white, and I was dizzy with fear and pain. "No, please," I begged silently, pleading for this to be just another nightmare, until eventually I blacked out completely.
