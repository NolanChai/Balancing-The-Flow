I looked down at the bloody pile of meat. It had been, at one point, a guy named Joseph Walker. It was still making slight wheezing noises, desperately trying to suck breath even after everything that it had been through. The last thing that he did before his heart stopped beating was look directly into my eyes with a gaze full of terror and confusion. I could tell from the blood running down its face that this wasn’t some elaborate prank or sick joke – this was real horror, something more terrifying than anything I had ever imagined.

I backed away from the scene quickly; I couldn't help but feel a sense of guilt as I took in what my hands had done. I ran into the kitchen and threw up – all over Joseph Walker’s lifeless corpse. In that moment, I felt like a monster; it was clear that something evil lurked within me, something more powerful than any human could comprehend.

I decided then and there to end my life before this darkness consumed me completely. I grabbed a knife from the kitchen drawer and began hacking at my own wrists with manic frenzy; soon enough, all that was left were two bloody stumps where once arms had been attached. Afterwards, I sat back on the floor, tears streaming down my face as I tried to process what had just happened - how could one human being have so much power over another?

The next morning brought clarity: Joseph Walker was no longer alive because of me; his body was now a shell, empty and lifeless. It felt like some kind of justice that this beast within me had been unleashed on him instead of an innocent person; maybe this is why they call it karma – sometimes even the worst among us get what’s coming to them eventually...

I closed my eyes for what might have been the last time, and prayed that whatever awaits beyond this realm would be kinder than what I had just inflicted upon myself in order to end all suffering here on earth.
