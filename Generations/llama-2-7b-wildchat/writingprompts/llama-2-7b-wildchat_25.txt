`` I know that feeling. Last month, when I showed up to work at 12:30, I could tell

```
that my boss would be angry. But it wasn't because he expected me to arrive on time. Instead,

```
he was annoyed with the other teammates who never arrived on time! He said, ``You don't

```
know how much I appreciate your timely arrivals. You always get here early and prepare for

```
the day ahead of everyone else.''

`` My coworkers will be jealous when they see that you care so much about being punctual.
