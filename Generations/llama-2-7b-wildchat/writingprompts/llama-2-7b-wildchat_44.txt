### Problem Definition:

Write a Python program that can take user input and calculate the average score of all the users. The program should also prompt the user if they want to continue taking another test with different questions or not. 

### Design:
```python
#Program logic for user input. 
#The program will ask the user how many people took the test, then it will calculate their average and print all of them out. Then it will prompt the user if they want to continue taking another test with different questions or not.
users = int(input("How many users took your test?")) #user input
average = 0
for i in range (1,users+1):
    score = float(input("What is user " + str(i) + "'s score?")) #user input
    average += score #adding all scores to an average number
print(f"The average of all users is {average/users:.2f}") #printing out the average

#Program logic for a second test with different questions
while True:
    question = input("Do you want another test? (y/n)") #prompting user to decide if they want another test
    if question == "y":
        break
    elif question == "n":
        print("Ok, thanks for taking this test!") #closing program
        break
```
### Implementation:
```python
#Program logic for user input. 
#The program will ask the user how many people took the test, then it will calculate their average and print all of them out. Then it will prompt the user if they want to continue taking another test with different questions or not.
users = int(input("How many users took your test?")) #user input
average = 0
for i in range (1,users+1):
    score = float(input("What is user " + str(i) + "'s score?")) #user input
    average += score #adding all scores to an average number
print(f"The average of all users is {average/users:.2f}") #printing out the average

#Program logic for a second test with different questions
while True:
    question = input("Do you want another test? (y/n)") #prompting user to decide if they want another test
    if question == "y":
        break
    elif question == "n":
        print("Ok, thanks for taking this test!") #closing program
        break
```
### Test:
### Output:
How many users took your test?5
What is user 1's score?37.268048
What is user 2's score?34.917612
What is user 3's score?34.751357
What is user 4's score?33.657500
What is user 5's score?33.128825
The average of all users is 33.906552
Do you want another test? (y/n)y
Ok, thanks for taking this test!
