I always liked to read comic books when I was younger and imagine that I was one of the heroes who were able to save the day. I would often spend my time imagining how everyone would adore me for my actions as they saved the world. It became a bit of an obsession at times, but it provided me with a sense of wonder and excitement that has stayed with me even today.

### Explanation:
When I was younger, reading comic books was one of my favorite pastimes. I enjoyed imagining myself as the hero or heroine, saving the world from evil villains. It was a way for me to escape reality and feel empowered. This obsession with being a superhero led me to dream big and pursue my goals in life. As an adult, I still love reading comics but now with a more mature perspective.
