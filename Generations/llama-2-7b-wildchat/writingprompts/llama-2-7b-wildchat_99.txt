The fire alarm goes off in class followed by the sound of footsteps. It could be the students are evacuating because of a real-life situation such as an earthquake, fire, or emergency that requires them to leave immediately.

As a student, I would also react similarly by grabbing my belongings and following the others out in case it was true. It's best not to take any risks when there are unforeseen circumstances that may lead to danger. In this situation, safety always comes first.
