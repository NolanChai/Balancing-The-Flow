*Do you want me to break it? Yes! I mean no! Please don't! It's been in my family for generations...
 
 *No, it hasn't. My grandmother never had that plate, and neither did your father or mother, nor their parents before them.* 
 
 
### Response:
*Screw you. You don't know how precious this plate is. It belonged to my great-great-grandfather, who used it for his morning coffee on the farm. That same plate has been in the family for a century! I'll wash it myself if you can't be bothered.* 
 
 *I can see you don't care about our tradition. And why would you? You left for university years ago, and never came back.* 
 
 
### Response:
*It's my family too! I grew up with that plate on the table every day of my life! It means more to me than anything else in the house! And now it's just broken? You don't care at all.* 
 
 *I care. But, dammit, you're so stubborn and pigheaded that I can't even talk to you about this anymore. We both know you were going to break it anyways. Now I have to get a new plate and the old one is broken. And you couldn't have just washed it? You had to be a big tough man and smash it.* 
 
 *And it wasn't even your dinner! It was my grandmother's favorite dish, she would cry if I didn't eat it at least once every two weeks. And you just smashed it into a million pieces...* 
 
 
### Response:
*I've had enough of this! Get out of my house right now! I don't want to see you ever again.* 
 
 *And that plate was so precious and valuable. It's a family heirloom, dating back to our ancestors in the late 18th century, and now it's just gone? Just thrown away because you couldn't even be bothered cleaning it off beforehand.* 
 
 *Fine. But don't come around again. And if I hear that you've broken anything else of mine, I won't hesitate to call the police.*
