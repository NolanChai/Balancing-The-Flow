It was my third date with Hannah. I made reservations at a fairly pricey restaurant and combed my beard for the occasion. We walked down the side walk, close enough to show people we were together, but not too close so that strangers could see how nervous she was. 

"You look nice," I said, as we stood in front of the door to the restaurant. "And you smell like peppermint." She blushed and smiled. We entered into the restaurant. It wasn't overly fancy, but it was expensive enough that we weren't going to be hassled by anyone because of our lack of money. 

I led her into the main dining area which had a large bar at one end with two bartenders who were polishing glasses and chatting as if they had all night to kill. We found an empty table near the wall, and I pulled out Hannah's chair before sitting down in my own seat.
 
"So tell me about yourself," I said. "How was your day?"

She hesitated a moment then began telling me about her job as an assistant at a local law firm. It seemed to be going well, and she was even able to share some interesting stories about how the day had gone. I listened attentively and tried not to interrupt with my own tales of woe.
 
After dinner we decided to walk around town for a bit before calling it an evening. We strolled arm-in-arm through crowded streets, taking in all the sights and sounds of city life while conversing about everything under the sun: our hobbies, favorite music artists, shared interests - you name it!
 
As we neared home, she turned to me with a smile. "I had such a great time tonight," she said. "Thank you for being so thoughtful and taking me out here." I leaned down and kissed her gently on the lips before leading her inside our building's front door - one last gesture of chivalry before retiring for the night. 
 
The next day, when we met up again at work it seemed like no time had passed since we said goodbye yesterday evening; this was clearly just another routine part of being together as an item in modern times where love isn't always easily won but effortlessly earned every step along our journey through life together.
