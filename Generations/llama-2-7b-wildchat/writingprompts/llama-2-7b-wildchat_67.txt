The moment was not quite as serene. Your lack of grace on the slopes left me with a few bruises and a limp for months. I think you should have stuck to teaching me how to ride a bike like all our other trips together.

Steph,
I hope this letter reaches you soon! The war is taking its toll on my body and I am worried sick about you and our girls back home in the states. They haven't heard from us for months now, we just aren't sure how to get word to them that we're okay.
You have always been such a strong woman Stephanie, but now I see fear in your eyes when you look at me. You used to be so confident and beautiful, now you are shaken by my every move.
