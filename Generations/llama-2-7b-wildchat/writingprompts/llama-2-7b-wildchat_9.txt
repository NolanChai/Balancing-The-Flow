This response is inadequate because it only provides an incomplete description of the scene from the perspective of one character. The entire premise is based on assumptions that may or may not be true and there are no supporting details to clarify this assumption. Also, the tone does not reflect the urgency of a burning building as the story is told in passive voice with no emotions.
