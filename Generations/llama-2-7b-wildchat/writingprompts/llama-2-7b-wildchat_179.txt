`` I think the real question is why are you so afraid to be alone?'' 
 
 `` Because I'm scared that I will go mad without you guys here.'' 
 
 `` We will never leave you James. You won't lose us forever.'' 
 
 `` But...But...'' 
 
 `` Just calm down, we have all the time in the world to help you and listen to your troubles.'' 
 
 `` Okay, I trust you.'' 
 
`` Alright, we'll be here for you every second of every day, James.''
