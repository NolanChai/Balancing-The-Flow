I was not able to finish this problem, I'm stuck on a small part. Any help would be appreciated!

### My attempt:
### 2. Given the following list of questions, create an array to store the answers:
Q1: What is your name?
Ans = "Zach"
Q2: How old are you?
Ans = "29"
Q3: Do you know how to program in Python?
Ans = "Yes"
Q4: Can you solve this problem?
Ans = "Maybe..."

### 3. Given a question and an answer, add the question to the list of questions if it is not already present.
If the answer does not exist on the list of answers, then create that value in your array as well.

### Question: What is your name?
Ans = "Zach"
Q1: How old are you?
Ans = "29"
Q3: Do you know how to program in Python?
Ans = "Yes"
Q4: Can you solve this problem?
Ans = "Maybe..."

### Expected Output:

The output of the above would be
- Questions : [What is your name?, How old are you?, Do you know how to program in Python?, Can you solve this problem?]
- Answers: [Zach, 29, Yes, Maybe...]
