The first time I'd heard of *Arabian Amulets* was the morning of my church's youth summer camp.
I'm not much of a facebooker; that was a bit too `` old people'' for me, but I wanted to let my family know I'd made it safe to camp with no major problems so far. My phone had been getting really hot and I didn't want to have the battery drain before lunch, so I switched it off and stowed it in my luggage.

I was just settling down on my bunk when I heard some commotion outside and a girl ran in shouting her name and that she'd lost something very important. Some of the counselors took her out to find whatever had gone missing, leaving me alone in our cabin for a few minutes with a bunch of teenage girls who weren't much interested in small talk.

I started rummaging through my luggage and found the phone sitting on top, not as hot as I expected, but it did still have a lot of battery left. After a bit more searching, I realized what had happened: Arabian Amulets.

We'd been taught all about them in school; they were believed to provide protection from evil and bring luck to those who owned or wore one. Apparently, some people thought the phone case was an amulet because of its shape - a blue square with little gold lines drawn on it that resembled the sun.

It didn't take long for word to spread around camp about this new ``amulet'' that had been found; everyone wanted one! Before I knew it, I was surrounded by girls asking if they could touch my phone or taking pictures with it just because someone told them it might bring good luck.

Needless to say, that's when the rumor mill started churning: Who else had their own *Arabian Amulet*? How do you get one too? What powers did they hold? All of a sudden everyone at camp was obsessed with these mythical objects - even adults were taking selfies with them!

Sadly for me though, that wasn't really my scene; I never thought much about luck or fate or whatever else might be out there beyond our understanding. So while everyone else was rushing around trying to get an amulet of their own, I just quietly put the phone away again - no point in keeping something so superstitious on display for others who didn't understand what it really meant anyway!
