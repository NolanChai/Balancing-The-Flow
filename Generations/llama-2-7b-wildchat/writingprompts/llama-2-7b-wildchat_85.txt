```Pontius Pilate, Roman governor, stands on an elevated platform with his army surrounding him. The crowd has been clamoring for hours, hoping that he will give them what they want - a free Jesus! But Pontius knows better than to listen to their demands; after all, he is the one in charge here and he makes the decisions.

The sun beats down harshly on his face as he waits impatiently for everything to die down before making any sort of announcement - or perhaps not at all if it means getting what they want without giving up any power himself. He shakes off his thoughts as they start to form into something more than just annoying fleeting ideas - this was never about being a good governor or following orders from Rome; rather, it's always been about maintaining control over this land and its people no matter what might happen next!
