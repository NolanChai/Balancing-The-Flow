I agree with you on this statement, because many people also feel the same way as you. There are always some things that we should have done earlier, but didnâ€™t do it due to procrastination. I used to do such thing too when I was still a university student. Since then, I tried to organize my time better and follow a more effective schedule. I would wake up early in the morning to catch up on some of the things that needed to be done. In addition, I also started to set aside specific times for studying and working on projects so that these tasks are not left until the last minute.
