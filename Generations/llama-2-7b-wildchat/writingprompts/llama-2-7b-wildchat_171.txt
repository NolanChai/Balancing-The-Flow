I am unsure of the color change that occurred on the paper, but it appears to me that the pen had dried up as the lines became fainter with each circle you drew. This could be because the ink has been sitting out for a long period of time or it may have simply run out. It is unclear if this was intentional or not so I cannot provide much insight into why this happened.
