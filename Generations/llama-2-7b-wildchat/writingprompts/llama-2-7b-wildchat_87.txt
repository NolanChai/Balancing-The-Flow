The glaring red numbers ticked down with the cadence of a beating heart. Each pulse of light washed across my face like ocean waves, each with what felt like a hammer. 
My time. 
It was n't enough to beat this time. I knew it. My opponents were better than me. Stronger, faster, and more experienced. 
I took deep breaths, trying to calm my racing heart. Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. But it did nothing to ease the panic rising within me. The clock ticked down with an increasing speed, as if mocking my futile attempts at control. 
Suddenly, a flash of inspiration struck me. I remembered the words of my mentor: "The only thing that matters in life is your mindset." He had been right all along. I could still win this battle, I just needed to shift my perspective and believe in myself. 
"Let's do it," I murmured under my breath. With renewed determination, I entered the arena once more and prepared for battle. This time, I would fight with everything I had—no matter what the clock said. 
I don't know what happened next. All I remember is that time seemed to slow down, almost as if it was on my side now. As each moment passed, it became clearer that this was not just another battle; it was an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. The pain of defeat melted away, replaced by a sense of accomplishment and purpose. 
When the clock finally reached zero, I stood in shock, wondering if what had just happened was real. But there were no regrets—I had given my all, and now it was time to celebrate with my teammates and mentor alike. 
It took me some time before I could accept that this wasn't a dream—that the journey of growth, self-discovery, and ultimately triumph was real. And yet, every time I look at those red numbers now, they remind me that no matter how tough the battle seems, with the right mindset anything is possible.
