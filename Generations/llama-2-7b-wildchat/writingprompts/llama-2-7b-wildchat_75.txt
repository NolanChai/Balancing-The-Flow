>The forces of Ol and of the Scorched King were a series of escalating atrocities. Each battle an attempt to cause the worst tragedy possible, for each side was convinced that their enemy's cruelty far surpassed their own. This war was one in which neither side could claim victory because it became an endless cycle of conflict with no clear victor. The two sides fought tirelessly, never realizing that they were both suffering the same painful fate - a battle without resolution, leaving both armies exhausted and hopeless.
