*The name...is Ella Fitzgerald! You've been playing that goddamn jazz song on repeat all day long, and I can't take it anymore.* I took a deep breath as I stepped outside into the crisp evening air, trying to calm my nerves. "Fitzgerald" was right there on my lips, but I couldn't bring myself to say it out loud. It felt like I had failed somehow - not remembering such an iconic name was unacceptable.
