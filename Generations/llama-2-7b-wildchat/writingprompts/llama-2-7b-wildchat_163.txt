The Test? I was not too excited at first, but I got curious when Mrs. Petrie said "it's gonna be difficult", so I thought it could only mean that this lesson will teach me all the things that I need to know for The Test. When she told us that The Test is going to be difficult and long, I had no doubts left in my mind. I was already anxious about what kind of test it is, but I tried not to think about it so much and listen to Mrs. Petrie's instructions.
