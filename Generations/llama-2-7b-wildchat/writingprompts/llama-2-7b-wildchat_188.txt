My initial reaction was one of confusion when I saw that you were here to visit me and my mother. My mom and I were hoping that we could get together someday but never expected it would be this soon, and especially not in such an unconventional way!
 
 
I've always loved your music since I was young. Your songs have inspired me to do better with life even when things seem bleakest for us all around us nowadays because people are just too afraid or scared away from anything new without knowing what kind of effect it might have on them later down the line due solely upon how different things were back then versus today; however, if only those kids could come see me againâ€¦I would love nothing more than another chance at making everything right between us one last time before my mom finally passes away from cancer.
 
 
Now that I've gotten over the initial shock of seeing you here in front of me after so many years apart, itâ€™s time for action! It sounds like you have something important to tell us about how everything has changed since then tooâ€”I can't wait until we sit down together again and talk things out because maybe then there will be hope left at all instead of despair like nowâ€¦
 
 
But firstly before anything else, let's go get some food or something else nice while waiting for our chat session next month (which won't take too long since itâ€™ll just be between us two). I hope this makes sense enough? It should! ðŸ˜‰ See ya soon xxx
