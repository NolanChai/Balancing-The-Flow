I was very interested in this because my friends and family say that they do exactly what you have mentioned above to get the attention of their girlfriend or wife. 

When they are not getting enough attention from their significant other, they may believe it is due to how they look or what they eat. However, when these things don't work, they eventually realize that this is not true. 

While I do agree with the sentiment of eating healthier and dressing more nicely as a way to attract the attention of others, it may just be that your significant other does not like you or does not feel the same way about you. 

Therefore, it could be that there is nothing wrong with what you look like or how you are presenting yourself; maybe it's simply because they don't care for you in that manner.

### My thoughts:

I agree with your statement as sometimes I convince myself if I dress right she'll feel the same about me too. When that does not work, I will lose a little sleep at night but decide to eat healthier.
For a while, I will but then I will find other ways and means of attracting her attention. But it doesnâ€™t always happen that way. Sometimes the more I try, the less she feels. 

### My feedback:

I would like to give some positive reinforcement here. You are right about not dressing right or eating healthier won't work on every person, but it may help you attract a different type of partner than before.

It is okay if there is nothing wrong with what you look like or how you present yourself; maybe they don't care for you in that manner at all. There are many people out there who appreciate these qualities and would love to date someone like them! Keep searching until you find your perfect match :)
