> This shop is mine. It was my father's, his father's, and a two-tongued witch's beforehand but I do not want to remember the story I was told. I sell what I can and buy what I need.

### Explanation:
"Two tongued" is an old English idiom meaning "two mouths", so the sentence translates into, "I don't want to remember the tale I was told." It may also refer to a witch who could speak two languages and this was a common belief about witches.
