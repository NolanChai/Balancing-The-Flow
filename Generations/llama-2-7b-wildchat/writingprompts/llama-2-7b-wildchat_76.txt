### Instructions:
It was a terrible day, God had finally had enough. Humanity had strayed too far, and like a parent to a child, God had devised a punishment. All of Humanities fears had finally come true, just about every living human being was in a horrible, hopeless situation. The ground shook violently as the sky turned black, rain began to fall hard and fast.

Everyone knew what happened when there’s heavy rain like this, but they weren’t prepared for what would happen next. Huge bolts of lightning struck down from the heavens and caused a terrible storm. The thunder was so loud that it drowned out every other sound around them.
The world had gone crazy, people were screaming in fear as they tried to escape this unstoppable force of nature. They couldn’t run away or find shelter because everything around them was being destroyed by the storm and its wrath!
Finally, after what seemed like an eternity (but was actually just minutes), the rain started slowing down a bit as it poured harder than before but not nearly as hard as before. People could see that daylight had returned again at last – they were safe from this terrible storm…or so they thought!
