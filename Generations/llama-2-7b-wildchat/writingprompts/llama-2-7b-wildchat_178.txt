You may be having a flashback to your past experiences, or it could be just a normal occurrence of déjà vu phenomenon. Deja Vu is the experience of feeling that you have witnessed or experienced an event before, when you are experiencing it for the first time. It's usually a fleeting experience that lasts for few seconds and then disappears.
However, if this sensation is persistent and lingers longer than usual, then it could be indicative of other underlying conditions such as Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or memory loss.
It's important to note that Deja Vu is a normal occurrence in humans, but if you have any concerns about your mental health, I recommend seeking professional help from a therapist who can assess and guide you better.
