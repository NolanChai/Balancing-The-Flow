We are not called a murder, we are referred to as a "murder" due to our similarities to crows. This is an ironic allusion to how we are often viewed negatively by others because of this similarity in appearance and behavior. The use of the word "ironic" implies that this association between us and crows was unintentional or unexpected, which highlights how people have made assumptions about us without knowing any facts.
