As he ran down the alleyway, a man was being followed by an assailant. He had his back to them and they were closing in on him, he couldn't be sure of how close they were as the lighting wasn't ideal for this late at night. As he ran he looked back over his shoulder and saw someone there following him closely behind him but when he turned his head round again he could n't see them anymore so he quickened his pace once more, knowing that they had to have been close behind him to be able to get in such a tight position on the other side of him.
