The two men were talking about their experiences during the World War II on an elevator. One man was from Warsaw while another one is American. The Warsaw man shared that he escaped to America after the war and lived there for years before returning to his home in Warsaw. Meanwhile, the American man has been living in Warsaw ever since the war ended without realizing how long he had spent there. They decided to share their experiences during the war because they both experienced it differently despite being neighbors on an elevator.
