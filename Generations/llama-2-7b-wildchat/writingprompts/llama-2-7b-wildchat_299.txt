I took a sip of wine as I stared at the box. It had been years since I had held these in my hand. They meant so much more to me than just another set of baoding balls.

These weren’t your ordinary baoding balls though; they were tungsten, each one weighting almost a pound and a half. They were heavy, and beautifully crafted. When I touched them, it felt like my hand was encased in something solid yet delicate. These were special.

I didn’t know why I still had them, but there they were, on my desk, collecting dust. In the last few years, life had dealt us some harsh blows that we could not recover from. And somehow these baoding balls were one of those things that survived our struggles.

I picked up each ball and squeezed it in my fist, feeling its weight and contemplating the memories they brought back to me. The way I had once held them so tightly, as if they could protect us from everything that was coming our way. We were so naive then, full of hope for a future we couldn’t possibly predict.

It felt like such a long time ago now, but these baoding balls reminded me that no matter what life brings, there is always something to hold on to – even if it’s just a simple set of tungsten baoding balls. I put them back in their box and left them on my desk for a moment of reflection before I moved on with the day ahead.
