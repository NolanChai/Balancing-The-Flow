1. You should not feel ashamed at all. There is a reason for your single status and it isn't that you aren't dateable, nor is there anything wrong with you. It doesn't matter what other people think of you or what they say to you behind your back about you. That is their issue, and it has nothing to do with you.
2. It might be time to look at why you are single in the first place and how much that is a personal choice for you. You need to stop looking around and start working on yourself because it sounds like you are more invested in your fears than actually finding someone who could help you become a better version of yourself, someone who can see past those flaws we all have.
3. Being single isn't a bad thing. It means that you don't feel like settling down just yet and this is what matters most. You should always take the time to focus on yourself first before making any decision about dating again - because once your life gets better, then maybe it will be easier for someone else!
