 It started off normal, for every 10 births there was 10 deaths, it was life. It was normal. 
 
 However, a fifteen year old girl fell pregnant in the town, and no one knew what to do with her. She'd always been different from everyone else, her family said she had problems. They kept it quiet. The child grew within her, and before anyone realised, he was born. He was different, dark hair, dark eyes, not as tall as the other boys his age, but he was still a child. He loved the water, enjoyed being with people, and the women in town felt safe around him. However, their husbands were suspicious of this boy, they said he was evil and would take them to hell, so they turned on him one day when no one else was around and tried to burn his house down. The townsfolk laughed and made it out like an accidental fire, but the girl who gave birth didn't want that happening again, so she had her husband kill everyone in town. Everyone except herself, her child, and a few other children she and her husband could trust. 
 
 They set up home elsewhere, the boy grew up to be a young man, and no one knew of what happened before. He still loved people, still liked being around them, but he also had a dark side, an uncontrollable blood lust. After years of hiding from him, his mother realised she needed to kill him. She gave birth to another child that was very similar in looks to her first son, and the boy grew up believing he was the only person left alive after that fateful night so long ago. 
 
 It was a normal town again for years before that one day when he was hunting with his father. A young woman came into their hunting ground, not realising they were there. They hid in the bushes and watched as she started to pee, just before her husband arrived. He saw her doing it, but the boy couldn't resist, he had never seen a woman naked before, so he attacked her. They killed them both that day. 
 
 It was then they realised what their son was, and his mother knew she needed to kill him, so she did. It has been like this ever since...
