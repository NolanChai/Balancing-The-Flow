My name is Sammy, and it sure has been a while since I last heard from my old friend Troy. It’s great to hear how much you have grown – you were just starting to learn how to crawl when I left for college! Your mom tells me that your father and I are no longer together. That breaks my heart, but at least she is there with you to take care of you. She loves you very much, and so do I.

I’ll be back in the spring after graduating from college with a degree in business administration. By then I will have an amazing job waiting for me that will allow me to support us financially. Your mom said that you are also working hard at school and doing well despite everything going on at home. You seem like such an intelligent young man, and I can’t wait until we are reunited so we can spend more time together as a family!
