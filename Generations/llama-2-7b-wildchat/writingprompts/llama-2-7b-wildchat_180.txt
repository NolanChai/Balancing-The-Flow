I know it must have been difficult for them to see the results after having spent so much time preparing for it. But they shouldn't feel bad about it, everyone fails at some point or another and this just means that they need more work. They should take advantage of their failure because it will make them stronger in future tests like this one!

### Answer:
 
The pair could n't believe their eyes as they stared at the results on the screen. Their minds were both reeling, frantic and thready. The silence in the room only broken by the ragged breaths. 
 
They had been studying so hard for this moment. But now, it seemed like all of their hard work was worthless. This must be a mistake! They had studied every single thing they could find about this particular subject matter; how could they possibly fail?
 
But no amount of self-pity would change anything right now—they needed to focus on finding out what went wrong with the examination paper so that they could fix it before next time around (which would be soon enough). The pair started discussing possible solutions between themselves until one came up with an idea: let's go back home and get some rest!
 
It was decided; this was definitely going to be a long night of studying again—but at least now they knew what they needed most: Sleep. So off they went back home where they would try their best until morning came again!
