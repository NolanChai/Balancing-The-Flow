I'm not sure what this means or why its called "East Coast" if everything is frozen, but I like how you are creating tension in the first sentence with the use of "jerk," "cold," and "screams." Your description of a cold hell makes me shiver.

### Response:
I can't wait to find out why billions died! I wonder if it was caused by global warming or if there is a supervillain at work? The last sentence is so ominous, it almost gives me chills! I also love the alliteration in "a landlocked hell."

### Response:
The tension here is immediately high with the jerk, cold, and screams. You've built up a lot of questions - what happened to cause so much death? Was it an accident or purposeful? This seems like the first chapter in a thrilling story!

### Response:
It looks like we are heading towards a post-apocalyptic dystopian scenario. With "cold hell" and landlocked, there's a sense of isolation and despair that builds up. The use of alliteration adds to the atmosphere of dread. I can't wait to find out what happens next!
