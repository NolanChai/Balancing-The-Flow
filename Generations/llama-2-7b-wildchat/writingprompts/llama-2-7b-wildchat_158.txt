Mike looked at the room around him with disbelief. He'd been looking at everything around him with disbelief for the past 4 hours, ever since the car had reached that city. That modern, wealthy, nonexploitative city. Mike knew his father could only be in this place because he was rich. So when they got to this hotel and Mike saw the huge swimming pool filled with expensive looking people, he looked at his father with disbelief. He had never seen a car like that before either, and it seemed so out of place on these streets. This whole city looked very strange compared to the other cities where he lived most of his life as an exploited slave laborer for rich landlords in another country far away from here - where there were no pools filled with fancy looking people like this one right now either!
