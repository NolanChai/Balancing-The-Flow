It wasn't until around the fifth floor that I began to notice something odd about the elevator I was in. The little man in the corner seemed to be hunched over in a fetal position, and it occurred to me that I had somehow failed to initially notice him. As the elevator continued upward, my curiosity grew, leading me down an unknown path of discovery and adventure.
