It is true, it seems like more prisoners have escaped then I first thought. The safety has been switched to "on" mode which means that the prison guards can only fire when absolutely necessary and not be fired at themselves in response. This also allows for a small amount of negligence or hesitance to shoot if they were to fire upon any prisoner as they run down the corridor.
