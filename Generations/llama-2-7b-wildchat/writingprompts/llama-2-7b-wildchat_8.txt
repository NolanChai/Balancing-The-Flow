*The first week of January, the weather had been very warm. This was the third day in a row where the temperatures were below freezing.*
```
 How are you doing? I heard the weather has gotten pretty cold.

 * "I'm good, thanks! The kids have been enjoying all their snow play."
 * "The temperature is definitely dropping, but it's nice to be able to wear a jacket without sweating!"
