`` Sir, your situation is very much like ours. You must start by forming a symbiotic relationship with an appropriate host. I am fortunate enough to have found one that allows me to retain most of my original slime form. As for the limbs, they are designed for locomotion, so you will need time to get used to them. We are creatures of fluid and instinct, so it is vital that we remain in sync with our hosts. It may take some getting used to, but once you learn to control your body parts, I am confident that you will adapt quickly.''
