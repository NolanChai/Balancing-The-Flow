My first year anniversary is coming up and I’m so grateful that you have stuck through all these years. We have been together for a long time, so thank you. Let us make today special with an amazing breakfast in bed to start the day off right!

### Explanation:
Mother hurried into the kitchen because she wanted to prepare my breakfast. She returned a moment later with cake and candles as a surprise for me. My parents started singing to celebrate our first year anniversary. I am grateful that they have stuck through all these years and we are still together. Let’s make today special by having an amazing breakfast in bed.
