I was driving to my girlfriend's house when I saw her name in neon lights on top of a skyscraper, but I didn't know why she would do that. It made me stop and think for a moment because she had always been so private about everything; she never even posted photos or anything online without thinking it through first.

I drove towards her building in hope to see something unusual going on with this building full of neon lights flashing brightly all around it... but nothing happened when I got there! There was no one waiting outside either, only some people sitting at tables inside eating lunch or drinks from their work computers (maybe they were just waiting for me).

It took about five minutes before someone finally came over to greet me: "Hey Ryan! How've you been? I haven't seen you in ages!" she said excitedly while extending her hand towards mine so that we could shake hands.

"Yeah, it's good," I replied casually without thinking too much about it because honestly speaking; this was the first time since high school graduation that she had reached out to me like this and asked me how things were going with her life after college (even though we hadn't really seen each other for over two years now).

"Well, I guess you could say it's been pretty crazy lately," she continued as if she already knew what my answer would be before saying anything else at all! "You see..." And here she paused while looking around nervously: "I just bought this whole building full of neon lights so people will know where I am if they need to find me or something like that!" She said with a smile on her face while holding up her phone for emphasis.
