They were here!

I rushed to our landing pad in a frantic sprint. My heart pounded furiously with each step I took; the sounds of my rapid breaths filled the air as I tried not to trip over anything. The ship was just a few feet away and I could feel the anticipation building within me as the seconds ticked by.

Suddenly, the ground shook underneath me once again – this time with more force than before. It sent a chill down my spine despite the hot weather outside. The ship emerged from behind one of those red-and-black clouds like a massive fireball that blotted out the sun above us. My breath caught in my throat as I gazed upon its imposing presence – it was truly something else!

I stood there motionless for several moments until finally finding my voice once again: “It’s here.”
