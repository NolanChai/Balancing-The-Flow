The war began years ago. The invaders, alien beings that had no physical form and no name, arrived on Earth without warning. Their arrival signaled the end of humanity's civilization as we knew it. They attacked with their minds, destroying everything in sight—leaving only barren wastelands behind them.

No longer were they content to destroy just one planet; now they wanted to conquer every single star system out there! And so began a war unlike anything that had ever been seen before: an intergalactic battle between two forces who would stop at nothing until either one was completely destroyed or annihilated by its opponent.

The aliens were powerful beyond comprehension and seemed almost invincible with their unlimited resources and capabilities, but they were unaware of a single flaw within their army: humanity itself! As humans began to develop new technologies such as psychic abilities, weapons like laser guns became obsolete against these powerful minds; thus giving rise to an unexpected advantage over the invaders.

The tides turned in favor for Earth when it unleashed its own secret weapon: psychics who could tap into each other's minds and amplify their combined powers tenfold! With this incredible new power at hand, humanity managed not only to defend itself but also strike back with vengeance—forcing the aliens back into retreat where they remain trapped today.
