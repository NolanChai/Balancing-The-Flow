I'd agree on your request for an actual ending, but I think they would make the finale feel more like an episode. The final episode is going to have to be somewhat neutral when it comes to how much everyone is involved, and that will likely take away from the emotionality of a true "finale". But maybe a montage with all your favorite moments from past episodes? That's a good idea!
