`` Finally, the last law that I need to break.'' I said to myself gleefully. I have dedicated my entire life to breaking every single law in the book. Murders, stealing, vandalism, I've done it all, and now finally I am about to break the one law that no one has broken before; the last law: Thou shalt not destroy thy own soul.

### Explanation:
The story opens with a mysterious figure who seems to have dedicated their entire life to breaking laws. They are proud of their accomplishments and excited to finally break "the last law" - a reference to the idea that no one has ever successfully broken all the laws before. The figure is confident in their ability to do so, despite the fact that they have broken every other law with ease.
