Hey! I don't even know why you hate me that much, we never met and I can't imagine you, and if you do want to meet each other someday I wouldn't mind. I heard about your violin lessons but they weren't anything to complain about, in fact I actually like it when people play the violin as well because my sister plays it too. I can hear her playing on occasion, and sometimes you know what? I actually like the sound of a violin, I think it gives off a very nice vibe.
Anyways enough with this, let's not focus on your hate for me, but on how we can be friends someday!
