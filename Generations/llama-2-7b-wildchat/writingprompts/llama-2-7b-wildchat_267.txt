### Explanation:
1. Harold moved slowly across the forest floor, leaves craven in his eastern gait. By the wear of his Rolex and new hiking gear, he imposed a polished and urbane look. From hindsight he stood as an enormous man, a man who seemed to belong in the 1850s as much as today. He wore a dark green turtleneck sweater with a white undershirt beneath it. He had no shaving cream on his face and no scruff of beard, so he must have been clean-shaven by the woman who brought him here.

2. His feet were clad in hiking boots with leather uppers, and his legs were long and powerful looking. He had a strong torso beneath the sweater, though his shoulders were not as broad as one might expect. The wind was blowing against him slightly, causing the ends of his mustache to bristle.
