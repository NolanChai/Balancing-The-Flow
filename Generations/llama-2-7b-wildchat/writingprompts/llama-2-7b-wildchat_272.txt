I am not sure why you are wearing glasses, but it is very clear that they do help you see clearly in this situation. I believe this means that your glasses were important to you, and you did not realize how much until now. This could also mean that wearing them was a way of protecting yourself from the world around you, or maybe they just helped you function better. Either way, it is clear that having these items with us throughout our journey will be crucial for success!
