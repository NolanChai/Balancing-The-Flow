When everyone is dead, there are no wars; yet when there is peace everywhere, wars break out. It's an interesting juxtaposition. Like, when people find peace in their own lives, they have to go around looking for something to fight over.
Peace and war seem to be directly connected. The more that you want it, the more it becomes elusive. Maybe it's like a drug: the higher you get, the harder it is to come back down. Or maybe there needs to be balance between the two in order for peace to exist at all.
When everyone dies, their bodies become fertile again and give birth to new life. What does this mean for humanity? Will we always have a need to fight or will our urge for peace finally win out over warfare once and for all? Only time will tell...
### Discussion:
How do you think the earth would be different if there was no death at all? How about if everyone lived forever? What are some pros/cons of having eternal life on our planet?
What role does peace play in war? Do you think it's possible for two countries or groups of people to wage war without hating each other first? Does "enemy" have an inherent need to be understood before conflict can break out?
### Thoughts: 
I find this concept fascinating because it presents a world where both death and peace are not only possible, but they exist in harmony with one another. It seems that the death of everyone brings forth new life while also providing an opportunity for war to continue on without fear of losing anything or anyone. The idea of balance between these two concepts is intriguing; perhaps this could be achieved if both sides were able to understand and respect each other's perspectives before conflict arises.
It would surely create a drastically different environment than what we currently know, but one that may ultimately lead to greater understanding amongst us all - even our enemies!
### Question: 
What do you think about this idea of "everyone being dead" and how it affects the earth? Does it sound like a utopia or dystopia to you, why? What other implications could come from such an event taking place on our planet?
