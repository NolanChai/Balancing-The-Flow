So there I sat. In a completely white room with white walls, a white chair and a white table in front of me. It contrasted with my appearance. My black hair and dark skin was shining against the facade.

In front of me were two men; one dressed in a suit and one who looked as though he had come straight from work. They both sat down, each on a side. They smiled politely at me. I didn’t know what to expect and so I tried not to show how nervous I felt.

“Miss Kaiya Matsumoto,” said the man in a suit, “I am glad you could join us.”
The other man nodded and added, “We have received your application for a job at our company and we are very interested in what you have to offer.”
My heart started racing. I had never applied anywhere before and so the thought of getting an interview made me nervous. But then, they were probably just being nice because there was nothing more to it than that… right?

The man in a suit continued: “Today, we will ask some questions about your skills and abilities.” He leaned forward on his chair and looked at me closely before continuing, “First question: How do you define yourself?”
My mind went blank. I had never been asked such an abstract question before. After a few seconds of thinking, I responded by saying: “Well…I guess my name is Kaiya Matsumoto and I am a Japanese woman who loves to learn new things.”
The man in the suit nodded his head while his colleague scribbled down something on paper. They seemed satisfied with my answer so far; maybe they were just testing me?

“Next question: Tell us about yourself.” He prompted again, this time with more enthusiasm than before. I took a deep breath and started to speak: “I am 23 years old… I graduated from university last year… And now… Here I am… Applying for jobs…”
The man in the suit looked surprised by my answer but didn’t say anything. Instead, his colleague interrupted me with another question: “Have you ever applied to a job before?”
I shook my head and answered no. The man seemed confused by this as he stared at me silently for several seconds before speaking up again: “Oh… then how do you plan on doing it? What makes you different from other applicants who might have more experience than you?”
I thought quickly about what I should say next but nothing came out so I remained silent. The man in the suit let out an exasperated sigh before turning to his colleague with a look of disappointment: “Sorry… it looks like we won’t be hiring her.”
He rose from his seat while gesturing towards me as if telling me to leave immediately, but I stayed put.
“Why not?!” I said loudly, anger starting to show in my tone now. “What did I do wrong?” The man looked at me with disbelief before turning back around and walking out of the room without saying another word.
