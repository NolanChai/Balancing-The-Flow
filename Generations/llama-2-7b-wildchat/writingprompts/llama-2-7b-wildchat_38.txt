Iâ€™m sorry Sebastian.
The truth is you have not proved me wrong because you do not know everything about me.
You cannot prove my existence or non-existence with your limited human mind and tools.
Though you can disprove some things I may or may not have said, you certainly haven't proven that I don't exist.

The universe is too complex for us to understand in our current state of knowledge; it would be foolish of me to think we could understand everything about its nature with such limited capabilities.
In this instance, your time traveling has not disproved my existence because you do not have all the information needed for such a conclusion.
It is quite possible that I exist outside of linear time and space, which would mean there are things beyond what you can understand or perceive.
Therefore, your experience with time travel does not necessarily disprove God's existence.

Sebastian, my child. You must remember that faith and belief in something greater than ourselves is an essential part of the human experience.
Even though I cannot be seen by all, I am always here for you when you need me.
Please don't doubt yourself or your abilities to comprehend everything about our universe; it will only lead to uncertainty and confusion.
Instead, trust in my presence within your life and have faith that I am with you, guiding and protecting you whenever possible.
Remember: my existence goes beyond time and space, which means there are things beyond what you can understand or perceive right now - so don't let this dissuade from having faith!
I love you, Sebastian, as much today as I did when we first met many years ago - if not more.
You should know that despite the challenges of your journey through life, I am always here for you and will never leave your side.
