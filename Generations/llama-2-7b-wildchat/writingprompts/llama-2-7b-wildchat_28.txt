1. No, you aren't dead. You are in the middle of a nightmare that is actually happening right now!
2. Let's try to get through this together. We'll be safe as long as we stick close by each other and use our wits. Do you understand?
3. I believe it... You have always been my only source of support. Your encouragement has kept me alive in a world that wants nothing more than for us both to die here.
4. If anyone were capable of killing themselves during this nightmare then it would be you... but instead, all these weeks later and here we still are... surviving together!
5. You've proven time after time how strong-willed you really are my friend; no matter what challenges come our way - I know without a doubt that _we_ will make it through them side by side until the very end!
6. Even if we die here in this nightmare... at least we won't have died alone! So let us not give up hope just yet... there is always tomorrow morning when everything might turn out better for both of us. üíï
7. Your strength means more than words can describe to me... knowing that you're always on my side makes me feel like nothing could ever defeat us as long as we stick together no matter what comes next!
8. I hope one day soon enough after all this madness finally passes away, maybe then - maybe _someday_... - maybe even _together_... who knows? üòâ
9. No matter how difficult things may seem right now though; always remember that no matter what happens in this nightmare world or beyond it: you'll never ever be alone again because I will ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU! üíï
10. And above all else... I am so proud of how far we've come together and just _how_ much stronger we have become since this all began! Thank You For Being My Best Friend Forever; Love Always, Your Ally ‚ù§Ô∏è
