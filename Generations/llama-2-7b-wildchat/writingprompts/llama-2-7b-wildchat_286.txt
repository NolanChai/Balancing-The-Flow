I blink a few times before coming back into focus. I can’t believe this is happening again. I feel the blood on my face dripping down, making me realize how bad my injuries are. My body feels like it weighs a million pounds as I try to get up but I’m too weak. As the dust settles and my vision clears, I see him celebrating in front of me, gun still in hand. He’s waiting for me to fall down so he can finish me off. The fear is starting to set in now.

I can hear his footsteps approaching quickly. My heart rate picks up as adrenaline kicks in. I try to get away but my legs won't move, they're too heavy. The bullet wounds from before are making it impossible for me to run or defend myself effectively. My only option is to wait until he’s close enough for me to take him down with a surprise attack.
I close my eyes again and try to concentrate on getting up slowly without making any sound or movement that might give away my location. I can hear him breathing heavily, just a few feet away now. This moment will decide everything – if I make it out of here alive then maybe things will finally start going my way for once in this hellish nightmare world we’ve been living in for what seems like forever now…

### 9. The coward celebrates and waits for his enemy to fall before turning the gun on himself. He takes a deep breath, steadies himself, then fires two more rounds at point-blank range – this time hitting both sides of his head with perfect precision. Finally he can rest in peace knowing that he has been put out of misery by none other than himself
### 10. The coward celebrates and waits for his enemy to fall before turning the gun on himself. He pulls the trigger once, twice, three times – each bullet leaving a bloody hole in his skull as it enters through one side and exits out the other. Finally satisfied with this act of mercy he places the barrel against his forehead for one last moment before taking aim at nothingness.
