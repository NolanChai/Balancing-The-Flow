Cassidy rubbed his head. Looking at his daughter, he was not quite sure what to say, “We’re so… proud of you. I guess. Right dear?”
Jackie clicked her tongue, “I so called it.”
Francis laughed, “You did indeed call it. And I’m just so glad that we came here together as a family. I knew you would be perfect for this.”
Cassidy smiled, grateful for their support and love. He ruffled Jackie’s hair playfully before turning to her. “Well done, sweetheart. You did amazing today, and you should feel really proud of yourself.”
Jackie giggled at his affectionate gesture and gave him a high five. “Thanks Dad! I had so much fun!”
“And we’re going to get some ice cream after this. How does that sound?” Cassidy asked with a wink.
Jackie’s face lit up with excitement, knowing how much she enjoyed their family outings together. They were truly blessed to have each other in this beautiful moment.
Francis smiled at them both, feeling the love and warmth radiating from his daughter and wife. “Now let’s go enjoy our ice cream as a family.”
As they walked away hand-in-hand, Cassidy couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by the pride he felt for his little girl who was so full of life and energy, just like her mother.
Francis smiled at their reunion, realizing once again why he loved being part of this incredible family with all its ups and downs yet still coming out stronger than ever before every time.
