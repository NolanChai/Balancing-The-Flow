Caillou: As you know, this is not the first time we have experienced this problem and I would like to take a moment to discuss the steps we can take in order to prevent further delays.

Ruler of Hell (ROH): Thank you for your concern Caillou, but unfortunately these shipments are beyond our control. We do not manufacture or produce the items ourselves so any issues that arise with suppliers or logistics companies fall outside our realm of responsibility.

Caillou: I understand ROH, however, there may be other solutions we can explore together in order to streamline this process and reduce delays such as exploring alternative shipping routes or considering working with a different supplier who has a better track record when it comes to timely deliveries.

ROH: While these are valid points Caillou, unfortunately our hands are tied in some cases due to contractual obligations we have made with various suppliers and logistics companies over the years which do not allow us much flexibility when things go wrong. However, I will take note of your suggestions for future reference should other similar issues arise again down the road.

Caillou: Thank you ROH; let's move on to our next agenda item - "Laundry services in Hell".
