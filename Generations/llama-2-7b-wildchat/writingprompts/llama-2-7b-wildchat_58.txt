The man finally woke up with an annoyed expression, he found himself lying on the ground with no trace of fire or blood. He looked around and saw that they had been brought out into a beautiful garden filled with colorful blooming flowers. The man felt confused as he didn't remember falling asleep in such a place before.

He slowly stood up feeling stiff from his long nap, but upon further inspection of the area, he realized there was no trace of fire or blood anywhere. He began to question what happened and whether he had dreamt it all. However, he could still smell burning flesh in his nostrils which made him feel uneasy.

The man decided to explore this new environment further while trying not to overthink the strange events that occurred before falling asleep. As he walked around admiring these beautiful flowers, he began wondering if perhaps this was all part of a dream or some otherworldly experience.
