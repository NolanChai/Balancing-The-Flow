As usual, I answered the door to a stranger looking for a job interview. I was more than willing and excited to help him out as always. It seemed like this time it would be a different man then ever before. His face showed he had a dark tan from being in the sun too often. He looked clean cut, well dressed with his slicked hair back, wearing a business suit. But his eyes gave away that there was something else lurking behind them.

As usual I was happy to take him on as my newest worker and started asking questions about himself. We talked about his experience and how long he had been in the business of this kind. His answers seemed promising, he had worked at a few different companies and had great recommendations from his past employers.

After discussing all the details I decided to give him an interview that day itself as it was already late evening and if we did not start then there might be no other time left. I brought out my laptop and prepared myself for the interview while he sat on a couch in front of me waiting patiently.

At last, after about an hour long discussion with him on various topics like work ethics, commitment towards his job, etc., I finally concluded that this was going to be the best fit for my company so far. Hence I immediately offered him the position right then and there without hesitation. He gladly accepted it and we shook hands happily marking the end of another successful interview session with an exciting new employee!
