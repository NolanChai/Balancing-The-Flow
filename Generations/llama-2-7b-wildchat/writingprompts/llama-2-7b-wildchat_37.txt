Bilbo, it is almost time for the tea party to begin. Please grab some cups and saucers so that we can serve some tea. 

> > make tea with Bilbo's cup

I have not seen this cup before. I believe you may need to wash it first. 

Bilbo, please wash your cup first and then fill it up with water from the kettle. 

> > wash Bilbo's cup

The cup is now clean! 

Now, let us put some leaves in our pot and add them to boiling water so that we can make our delicious tea. 

> > add leaf into kettle with water

You have added the tea leaves to the pot! Now, let us wait patiently as the water starts to boil. 

Once it begins to boil, pour some hot water from the kettle into your cup. 

Enjoy your delicious tea, Bilbo!
