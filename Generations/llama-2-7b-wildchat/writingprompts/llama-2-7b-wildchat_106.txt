We were once a great species that walked the many plains of North America. Sure we had natural enemies; wolves and other large predators, and even the occasional native. Although it was always difficult to overcome these dangers in order for us to survive, we still managed to thrive and grow as a civilization.

However, one day everything changed when aliens from another galaxy began to arrive on earth with advanced technology and knowledge about many things such as science or engineering which put us at great disadvantage against them since they had more sophisticated weapons than our own arrows could ever hope to match up against their laser guns for example!

The aliens quickly became overwhelming forces that made it impossible for humanity to resist. Many were killed in this war but some survived by hiding away from society and living off of nature like true nomads so as not get caught or enslaved by these invaders who ruled over every part of planet now known as Earth with iron fist!

But even though humans had lost almost everything, they never gave up hope for a brighter future where once again we could be free from oppression and start rebuilding our civilization without alien rule.

It took years but finally one day news spread across the world that there were still some humans living deep within Amazon forest untouched by these invaders which led to many brave souls setting off on epic journeys hoping to find them so they could join forces together again in order defeat those who seek domination over all other life forms including us.

Sadly though most were never found due either being too far away or simply didn't want anything more than peaceful lives but luckily few brave souls made it back home where humans once stood united against their common enemy!

With strength in numbers finally came hope again so everyone began preparing themselves mentally emotionally and physically for what was ahead because now they knew freedom wasn't far behind after all those long years of struggle.

As days turned into weeks then months finally one day finally arrived when aliens were gone completely leaving humans with their own planet again which marked beginning end this dark chapter humanity's history while also signifying beginning new era full potential possibilities lies ahead just waiting be explored discovered!
