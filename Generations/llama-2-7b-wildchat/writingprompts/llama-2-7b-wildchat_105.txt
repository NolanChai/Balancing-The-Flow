Hild is a Scandinavian female given name from Old Norse "hildr" which means "battle". The name may have originated in the pagan Germanic religion as a reference to war goddess Hilde. The name was popular among the Vikings. Hild may also be the Old Norse word for a "fight", although there is some question about its relationship to Hilda/Hildr.

Hilda, an Anglo-Saxon name, comes from Old English "hild" meaning battle or combat. The name was brought to England by Germanic tribes during the Migration Period. In England it became very common in the Middle Ages and remained popular until the Reformation when its usage declined. It is sometimes thought to be a feminine form of Hildebrand, however there are no historical records showing this connection.

The name Hilda may also derive from Old Norse "hild" meaning "battle", but there is no evidence of its use in Scandinavia before the 15th century. The spelling "Hilda" was first found in English in the early 13th century, while "Hilde" appeared around 1200 AD.

The name Hild was popularized by William Shakespeare's play "Richard II" where he used it as a nickname for Princess Isabella of Valois (a character based on Joan of Navarre). From then onwards Hilda became a common female given name in England, especially among Puritans and Quakers. It experienced another surge of popularity during the Victorian era when its usage peaked around 1890-1910 AD before gradually declining again from mid 20th century until nowadays where it has become a rare name due to widespread use of other feminine names such as Emily or Victoria.

### Revised:

Hild, also known by the name Hilda, was an ancient goddess worshiped in Scandinavia and Germany before Christianization. Her name may be derived from Old Norse "hildr" which means "battle", but there is no historical record showing a connection with Hildebrand or any other Germanic deity. In England she was popularized by William Shakespeare's play "Richard II" where he used it as a nickname for Princess Isabella of Valois (a character based on Joan of Navarre).

During the Victorian era, Hild became a common female given name in England especially among Puritans and Quakers due to widespread use of other feminine names such as Emily or Victoria. However, with increasing secularization and rising popularity of new names, its usage has gradually declined since mid 20th century until nowadays when it has become a rare name due to wide use of other female given names like Amelia or Mia.
