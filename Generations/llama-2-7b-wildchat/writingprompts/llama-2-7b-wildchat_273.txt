This story shows me how much a person can change after they learn to love themselves, and also how important it is for them to let go of things in order to move on. The narratorâ€™s journey from being someone who was too busy caring about everyone else, even if it meant harming themselves, to somebody who valued her own life as well led her down an interesting path where she got so much out of helping others that she wouldn't have had any other way.
