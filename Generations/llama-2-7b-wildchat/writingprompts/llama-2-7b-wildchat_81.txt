I love animals. Especially dogs, but all kinds of animals are fun. When my mother was pregnant with me she had a dream that I had a donkey. She thought it was weird because we had never owned or even seen one, let alone had a dream about one. A few weeks later my parents told me they were going to name the baby donkey after the animal in my mother's dream. My brother was named Colt, so I was Donk. When I was 5 years old my family and I were visiting some cousins who had a farm. They owned many animals including horses, sheep, goats and donkeys. I loved being around all the animals but for some reason my heart belonged to the donkey that lived on their farm. It wasn't as big and beautiful as the horses or as shiny as the pony my cousin rode when we visited, but it had a kindness in its eyes that made me want to give it a hug. So I did. And then another. And another until the donkey was tired of all the attention. My parents were horrified and took me away from the farm immediately.
