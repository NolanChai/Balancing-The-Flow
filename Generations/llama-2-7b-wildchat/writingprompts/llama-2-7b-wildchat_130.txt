There are times when I feel a deep sense of emptiness like the one you're describing, but I also believe that those feelings can be temporary or fleeting. It could be that you were experiencing something similar and it has dissipated over time. However, it's important to recognize that our feelings may not always be entirely accurate or reflective of what we are actually feeling in the moment. Sometimes, our thoughts and emotions can create a narrative or story around our experiences that may not accurately represent what we're truly experiencing.

In my experience, when I feel like I'm "feeling nothing," it is usually because my mind is over-thinking things or creating an unnecessary sense of anxiety. During those moments, it can be helpful to bring attention to your breath and focus on the present moment without judgment or expectation. You could also try engaging in a calming activity such as journaling, meditation, or listening to soothing music.

Another possibility is that you may have experienced something that caused a temporary state of numbness. It's possible that your body and mind were trying to protect themselves from the emotional intensity of the situation by shutting down temporarily. However, it's important not to get stuck in this pattern as it can lead to prolonged feelings of detachment or disconnection from life experiences.

Ultimately, it's natural for us to experience different levels of emotions throughout our lives - even if we don't always feel them right away or immediately recognize their source. If you continue feeling a sense of emptiness or numbness in your everyday life, I recommend seeking professional support from someone who can help you understand and process these feelings in more depth.
