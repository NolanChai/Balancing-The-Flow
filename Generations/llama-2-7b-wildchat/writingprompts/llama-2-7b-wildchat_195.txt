“ Hey, we have to hurry up and get out of here! We don’t have much time before Dark Flag realizes that something is wrong. ” 
 
 I could hear the panic in Violet ’ s voice as she scurried about, flipping switches and checking gauges. My eyes flickered to the computer screen on the far side of the cockpit—it displayed a map of the planet’s surface, with our current location highlighted in red. The dots that represented White Falcon and I were shrinking, getting closer together every second. 
 
 “ What ’ s your status? ” I asked as calmly as possible. 
 
 *You should know my name by now. And the answer is: I am fine.* 
 
 Violet stopped what she was doing and stepped away from the console, her face contorting into a grimace of disgust. 
 
 “ You are not fine. Your skin is all puffy, and you ’ re pale as a ghost.” 
 
 *You have no idea how hard it is to make someone with a body as beautiful as yours look ugly.* 
 
 Violet bit her bottom lip. 
 
 “ I don’t mean to be insensitive—” she started, but I cut her off with a sharp glare. 
 
 “ Just get us out of here,” I said firmly, turning back to the controls. My fingers hovered over the switches, my mind racing to find a solution before it was too late. The clock was ticking, and we were running out of time. 
 
 Violet took one last glance at me before returning to her duties—her eyes filled with pity and concern for what I had gone through. I could feel myself starting to tremble as memories flooded my mind: the pain, the loss, the betrayal…the darkness that consumed everything in its wake. It was overwhelming, suffocating, almost too much to bear. 
 
 But then Violet ’ s voice pierced through the haze like a ray of light in an otherwise pitch-black room: 
 
 *We’re going to make it out of here together.* 
 
 I looked at her with renewed hope, my body instantly reenergized by her words. Violet had given me something—something that I desperately needed: the courage and strength to continue fighting against the darkness. She was more than just a companion; she was a friend, a confidante, a source of light in this dark and treacherous world. 
 
 Together, we pressed on through the pain and uncertainty, knowing that there was still hope for us yet. We would face whatever obstacles came our way—no matter how great or insurmountable they may seem—because as long as we had each other’s backs, nothing could stop us from reaching our ultimate goal: to restore peace, order, and justice in this world…and beyond.
