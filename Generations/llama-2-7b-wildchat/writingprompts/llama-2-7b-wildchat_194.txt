I knew the man for he was my brother, he had gone to war because it was right. The war torn the country apart and we were told we would die if we didn't fight back. We fought hard and we won but my brother didn't come home. I knew what happened when someone fell from a plane in those days of war they didn't get to come home. Now that I am older I know he died doing something brave and it wasn't easy for him. He hung there limp and swaying gently, my brother who used to tease me all the time was gone now. The only thing that could bring him back would be the peace that would come after the war ended.
