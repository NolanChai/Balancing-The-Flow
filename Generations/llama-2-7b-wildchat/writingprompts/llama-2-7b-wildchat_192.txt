I wanted to eat them too. They were so small and tasty. I had always been a good boy, but once you get used to something....... I was only a teenager when they first started eating each other. I remember sitting in my room with the door closed, reading. My mother stood outside, looking at me. "Go out and play", she said. She wanted me to be like everyone else. But how could I? I had been raised on this. It wasn't fair. They told us that they were here to help, but all they did was make things worse for me. And now, as adults, they continue their hypocrisy by eating each other without shame. Why is it ok when they do it, but not me? I know this is wrong, but sometimes you can 't help what you are.
