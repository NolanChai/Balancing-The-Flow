*'' Hold on sir! This is the murder scene for the last time! '' *

 Henry quickly turns off the Ipod and hands it back. He takes a deep breath, and walks to the room with his head down. 
 
 Henry sits down in front of the 3rd body.
 
*'' This one seems more familiar...'' *  

 Henry looks closely at the third victim. He has his eyes closed while holding the Ipod tightly, as if he was listening to a song when he fell asleep. The room is still spinning in front of him, he struggles to keep himself together and tries not to fall back on his chair. 
 
*'' This is...'' *
Henry stands up and walks out of the room with tears rolling down from his face. He quickly closes the door behind him.
