`` Here you go!'' I handed Delia the stapler.
Delia is our department’s new designated “Stapler”.
“Stapler” is what her name tag says, so she must have an important job, as most new employees here are given names that relate to their duties. She certainly seems responsible, which makes sense since this is the first time we’ve used her in our office. I’m sure she’ll prove herself worthy of our trust soon enough!
