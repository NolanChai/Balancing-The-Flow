Greg had never owned a business in his life. He had spent the majority of his 52 years as a software developer, and he thought that he would be happy to just work from home for the rest of his life. However, one day his wife, Sandy, came into the office with a bright idea about opening a small shop.
`Sandy: Honey, i had the most amazing dream last night! I was in a shop full of wondrous books and things. It was like a library meets an antique store.`
Greg: What did you call it?
`Sandy: Carrelhold. A cozy shop for readers to find their next great read, and collectors to find the perfect bookish keepsake. I'm sure you could turn that dream into reality!`
`Greg: ...I guess i could.`
`Sandy (smiling): Of course, dear. Let me help you start your new business!`
So, Greg found an empty shop in a quiet neighborhood and spent the next few weeks remodeling it. He painted the walls white, added shelves lined with books, and even bought some cozy armchairs for his customers to enjoy while browsing.
Fast forward 10 years later, and Carrelhold is still thriving! Greg has found a niche in providing readers and collectors alike with unique bookish items that cannot be found anywhere else. Sandy still helps him out with the business, and they have never been happier.
So why did Greg do it? Well, he thought opening Carrelhold would be a challenge to keep his mind sharp and engage with the community. He never imagined it would become such an integral part of their lives. But that's just what makes him love this shop so much: the sense of family and belonging it provides for all those who step into its doors.
