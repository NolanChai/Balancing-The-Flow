`` What is it?'' replied Dr. Edmunds as he grabbed for a pen and notepad.

`` I found a correlation between the size of an individual's cortex and their propensity to lie,'' Johannes stated excitedly. 

 `` Fascinating! Can you send me the data?'' asked Dr. Edmunds eagerly.

 `` Sure thing, here you go. The bigger the brain, the bigger the lies,'' Johannes said as he sent over a file containing the data. 

 ```
  Name       |    Age |   Cortex Size (mm) | Lie Ratio
   ----------|--------|---------------------|-------
  Alice      |    50   |   124               |   0.73
  Bob        |    60   |   129               |   0.78
  Charlie    |    80   |   134               |   0.89
  Dan        |    90   |   135               |   0.85
  Eliza      |   100   |   136               |   1.23
 ```

Dr. Edmunds was elated as he scanned the data, nodding in agreement with Johannes' findings. 

 `` This supports our previous hypothesis that larger brains are more prone to lying due to their increased cognitive abilities. It also implies that people over 100 years of age may be less inclined to tell the truth as they have already accumulated a significant amount of experience,'' Dr. Edmunds stated with enthusiasm.

 `` I knew you'd find something interesting in there! Now, let's figure out how we can use this data to our advantage,'' Johannes replied eagerly. 

 `` We could design experiments to test the effects of different stimuli on people's tendency to lie, or even try to train them to tell the truth more effectively,'' Dr. Edmunds suggested. 

 Together, they began planning a new research project, using this fascinating data as their foundation for further exploration into the intricacies of human behavior and cognition.
