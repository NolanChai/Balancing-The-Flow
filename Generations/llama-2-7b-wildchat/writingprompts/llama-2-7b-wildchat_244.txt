This was a very entertaining story about rabbits hiding under tables, and it reminded me of a time when my younger sibling would try to sneakily bring their pet hamster into the house during our parents' sleep. Although I have no direct experience with hidden rabbit games, this story made me smile.

### Thoughts:
I enjoyed your playful tone and creative details about how Maestro kept you under the table to play with a magically appearing rabbit. It was interesting to imagine a scene where there would be a magical disappearing and reappearing rabbit. This reminded me of one time when I played hide-and-seek as a child, hiding behind a large potted plant in our backyard. It was fun and exciting!
