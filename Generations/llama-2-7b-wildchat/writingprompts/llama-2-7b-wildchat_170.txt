A: There was no time to lose. It was now or never. Jim knew exactly what had to be done.

When he got this job, little did he know that it would fulfill his lifelong fantasies. He didn't even know the real name of the company until today. 

But as they say: "The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry". And so it proved to be for Jim, who found himself in a situation beyond his control. 

Now all he could do was wait for fate's hand to play its part. He had no idea what tomorrow would bring or how this adventure would end. All that mattered now was taking action - even if it meant going against every moral fiber within him.
