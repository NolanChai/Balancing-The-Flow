Santa peered down at the crate's contents again as he continued speaking to the representative. "So you're saying, legally, they're still mine, even though I do n't want them?"

"Yessir," the
rep said, sounding a little weary. "You signed for them, sir." 

### Explanation:
The instruction is in the form of dialogue between Santa and the representative. In this case, Santa is asking whether or not he still has legal ownership over the crate's contents even though he does n't want them anymore. The response from the representative is a confirmation that he signed for the items and therefore legally owns them.
