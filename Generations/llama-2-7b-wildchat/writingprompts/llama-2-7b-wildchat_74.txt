In a corner of the room stood a thin young woman with shoulder length blonde hair and blue eyes that pierced through me like a knife. She was wearing tight leather pants and a matching top. I did not recognize her but knew she was one of my regulars from before I had joined up with the company, "So what is it today?"
 
 *I'll go over to your room after our business is finished, but for now, we have work to do.* She replied, holding out a device. A handheld gaming console.
