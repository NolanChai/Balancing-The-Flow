It was a cold Sunday morning when we buried my grandfather, James Sr. I still can't believe he's gone.

As I stood there in front of the grave, with tears streaming down my face, I thought about all the memories I had shared with him throughout my life. 

From taking trips to the lake together when I was little, to sitting by his side while he watched football games on Sundays; they were moments that will never be forgotten. And now these moments will forever remain only in my mind's eye.

But even though he is gone physically from this world, his spirit remains alive within me and continues to guide me through life's challenges ahead. 

So although today marks an end for one chapter of our lives together, it also signifies the beginning of another - one filled with hope and love as we remember what truly matters most: time spent with those who matter most in this world.

It was a bitter sweet moment to say goodbye, but I know that even though he is gone now my grandfather will always be right here by my side every step of the way.
