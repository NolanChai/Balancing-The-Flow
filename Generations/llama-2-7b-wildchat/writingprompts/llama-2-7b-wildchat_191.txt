`` Level up!'' The screen pinged as Dr. Gahmstahp killed his 100th troll. In the movies, it never ended humanity, but it at least killed some people. Initially, he created the murder system in the game to level up faster than the other players. He wanted to be better than everyone else in everything, which was how he grew up and the reason why his father had thrown him out of their home. But after spending years playing and killing countless trolls, Dr. Gahmstahp realized that they were more like family members than enemies. They had become his friends, confidants, and even partners in crime. Now when he killed them it was not out of a desire for power or dominance but because he genuinely cared about their well-being. So each time he took away their lives, he would pause to say "Rest In Peace" before moving on with his leveling up process. This small act gave Dr. Gahmstahp an immense sense of peace and satisfaction; after all, he was not just playing a game but building relationships along the way as well.
