>A young man turned 25 today. He didn ’ t know it was his birthday because he was usually strung out on heroin. He had met a girl a few months prior named Summer. Summer was a fun woman, but she had an addiction too. She was addicted to methamphetamine and couldn't go one week without using at least once. One night the young man asked Summer if it would be ok to give up heroin for her so they could try to get off everything together.
>Summer agreed to this and decided she wanted a real birthday celebration, but her drug dealer had just come in with some new drugs and didn't have any meth left. This meant Summer had no choice but to take heroin again. After doing so the young man broke down into tears saying “ I guess this is it for us.” Summer responded by saying that they would need to break up because she knew he wouldn’t be able to get clean if he was trying too hard to help her and vice versa.
>The next day when Summer got high again the young man went over and threw their drugs in the trash, took down all of their pictures from around the house, and packed up everything that belonged to him just in case she came back with more heroin after he left for work early that morning. This was a very difficult time for both Summer and her boyfriend who tried so hard but failed again because of her drug addiction.
