I was never one for small talk but this guy stood out. His clothes were strange; he had on a hat with a feather, his hair was long and messy, his face was caked in dirt from the fields, yet it sparkled, almost like diamonds, but not quite, and his smile seemed to be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, a thousand times more beautiful than any painting. It looked so fake, yet real, it was mesmerizing. He stood with me in line, we talked for hours.

 
 
 He spoke of things that I had never heard before, he taught me about the world and I became intrigued by him; his stories were unlike anything I've ever heard. There were moments when he would get so engrossed in his tales, I worried that he was forgetting where he was.
