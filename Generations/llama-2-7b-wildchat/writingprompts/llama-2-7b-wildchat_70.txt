The idea of causing horror through mind is very interesting. It makes me think of horror movies and how scary some scenes are without a single drop of blood being drawn. Itâ€™s also similar to what we do as developers in games. We can make people feel like the game characters, give them the same feelings and experiences that the character has and let them see the world through their eyes. The more they identify themselves with the character, the deeper will be the emotional connection between the player and the game.
