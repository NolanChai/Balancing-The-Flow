When I was in college I always looked forward to going home for the weekend because my family had a pet Unleashed named Brutus. He'd been with us ever since we could remember - I don't know how our parents got him but it seemed like he came into our lives when we were still babies, maybe even before that! Brutus was an amazing dog; gentle and caring while still having a fierce spirit. He was always protective of us kids (and sometimes a little overprotective) but would never harm anyone unless they gave him reason to do so.
