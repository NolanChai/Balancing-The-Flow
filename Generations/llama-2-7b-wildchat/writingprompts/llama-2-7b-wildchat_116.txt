It's a lot of fun for me as well! It's such an interesting instrument because its sound can be so many different things depending on the setting. The pipe organ is also very versatile-- you could play a simple hymn or an elaborate piece by Bach or Wagner. It's just such a beautiful and majestic instrument.
