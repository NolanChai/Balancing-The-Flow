The assignment is not very clear to me. The instruction asks you to make a right turn after getting into his office and then left turn when walking out of the door. How does this relate to "Go home, go to sleep"? I think there should be an extra line in the paragraph between 'Turn on computer' and 'Open your inbox'.

### Reason:
The story is written without using any punctuation like commas, question marks or exclamation marks. The absence of these punctuations makes it difficult for me to understand what is going on in this piece of writing.

### Instructions:
You walked into his office, you sat at your desk every day, the same routine open your inbox, check for assignments and go home. But tonight, make a left turn down the alleyway after getting off the elevator then walk up to the building’s exterior staircase going up to the 9th floor. Walk into his office and sit at your desk.

### Response:
The story is much clearer with punctuation.

### Reason:
I think it makes a lot of sense now that I read the instructions. The assignment is about walking in someone's office, sitting at their desk every day but tonight make a left turn and walk up to the 9th floor where there will be staircase leading inside building then go into his/her office before returning home again after completing assignments for work.

### Instructions:
You walked into his office, you sat at your desk every day, same routine. Open computer check inbox go to sleep. Except tonight, make a left turn down the alleyway and walk up to building’s exterior staircase going up 9th floor then walk into his office sit at your desk open computer check inbox check for assignments return home after completing them all!

### Response:
The story is still unclear. I think it should have a line between 'Turn on computer' and 'Open your inbox'. The instructions are not clear about the assignment either, which seems to be "Walk into his office, sit at your desk every day". But the next sentence talks about making left turn and walking up stairs so I don't understand what the point of this story is supposed to be.

### Reason:
I think the reason for my confusion lies in the fact that there are no commas or question marks used anywhere within the paragraph which makes it difficult for me to comprehend exactly how these events take place over time as well as where we actually go from one point (sitting at desk) onto another (walking up stairs).

### Instructions:
You walked into his office, you sat at your desk every day. Same routine. Open computer check inbox check for assignments Go home go to sleep except tonight make a left turn down the alleyway after getting off elevator walk up to building’s exterior staircase going 9th floor walk into his office sit at your desk open computer check inbox check assignments return home!

### Response:
I think it's better now that we have punctuations like commas, question marks and exclamation marks which makes the instructions clearer. However, I still don't know what the point of this story is supposed to be about because there aren't any details on how these events take place over time or where they lead us afterwards as well as how long each action takes place before moving onto another one.

### Reason:
I think it makes a lot more sense now that I have read the instructions carefully. There is punctuation which helps me understand what is happening in this story. Also, we can see where these events take place over time and how long each action takes before moving onto another one. This gives us an idea of what type of assignment you need to complete while also showing that it's not just about sitting at your desk all day!

### Response:
