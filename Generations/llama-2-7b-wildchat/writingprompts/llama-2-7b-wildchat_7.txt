Christopher looked down at his bag and couldn't believe how much it weighed. He just hoped that Katelyn would enjoy her meal. He had left a note in the bag saying "Hope you like it!" to make sure she knew someone was thinking about her while he was gone. With one hand holding the bag, he squeezed his phone with the other and sent her an excited text: "I'm on my way! Can't wait for you to see your dinner :)" Christopher couldn't believe how excited he felt; this was going to be the best meal ever.
