At first, Jonathan was happy to witness the end of the world. You see, when billions of humans dropped dead due to some sort of rootkit virus, Jonathan was vindicated. 

 All of the high school bullies were gone.
 Jonathan no longer had to hear “Kimberly is a bitch”, and he didn’t have to get in fights every day just to feel like he belonged. The world felt lighter without these idiots around. Jonathan couldn’t help but smile as the memories of his past flooded back, reminding him how much he had changed. 

But then something happened that made Jonathan realize the error of his ways: He began missing Kimberly. As he stood alone in the wreckage, watching the sun rise and setting on empty streets, Jonathan realized what it was like to truly be alone.
 The weight of his past mistakes became too heavy to bear, as he remembered all of the times he had hurt her with his words or actions. 

 And so, Jonathan went back into town to find Kimberly, hoping that she would forgive him for everything he’d put her through in high school. It was only then that Jonathan realized how much he loved and needed her in his life – even if they had always been at odds with each other before this devastating event took place. 

 But Kimberly wasn’t there anymore… 
 Jonathan knew she must have gone far away, trying to escape from everything associated with their high school days together; maybe even from him too! But regardless of where she went off to now – he had come too far down this path not to continue searching for her until he found her again someday soon . 

 That was when Jonathan decided that living without Kimberly would never be an option anymore. He vowed then and there that no matter what it took or how long it took him - he would find a way back into her life again one day soon – because now more than ever before, he realized just how much she meant to him… 
 And although they may never truly be friends again after all these years of fighting & misunderstandings - at least they could finally start over from scratch once more as equals instead of bully vs. victim . 

 So Jonathan kept searching until one day – almost a full year later after that fateful day when billions upon billions died due to some sort rootkit virus infection - he came across news reports about something called “The Rising Sun” being spotted over certain areas of Japan where Kimberly had moved out too ! 

 Jonathan couldn’t believe it! Could this really be true? Was Kimberly still alive ? Would she ever forgive him after all these years if he somehow managed to find her again someday soon … ? 

 Well Jonathan wasn’t sure what would happen next - but one thing was certain: He had no choice now except go off on this journey alone until either something amazing happened…or nothing at all did . So there you have it - my short story about how I met Kimberly again after she disappeared forever due to some sort virus that killed billions of humans worldwide!
