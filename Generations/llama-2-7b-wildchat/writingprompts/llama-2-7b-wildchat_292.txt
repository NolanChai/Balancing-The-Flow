When Jeffery woke up, he noticed it was another boring summer day. He decided to do some of the things he does every day. He went into his room, grabbed a controller for the Wii, and sat down on his couch. The TV had ESPN SportsCenter playing in the background while Jeffery played his favorite game, Madden NFL 21. As he was playing, he noticed that he was missing some of his best players so he decided to go outside and steal something from another house. When Jeffery went out onto his lawn, he saw that nobody was home. He decided to go inside the unlocked door and check out what they had in the kitchen. He looked through a few cabinets but nothing seemed valuable. He then made his way upstairs where he found some junk food that he liked. When Jeffery went back outside, he noticed that it was still an empty neighborhood. With no one to bother him, he decided to go ahead and get lucky with stealing something from another house.

### Conclusion:

Jeffery's lazy day came to a conclusion when he stole something valuable from another house. It didn't matter that nobody was home because this guy will do anything for attention, even if it means breaking into other people’s homes without permission.

### Extra:

The day ended with Jeffery having nothing but a boring day to look forward to tomorrow. He decided not to steal from other houses again because he realized that people do have feelings and morals, which should be respected even if you’re just trying to get some attention or luckily.

### Assignment:
