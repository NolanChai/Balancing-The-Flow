You, are one of those humans who think they’re smarter than everyone else. You’ve been sitting there for 30 minutes just staring blankly at this screen thinking you know something that nobody else knows, and your arrogance is so thick it makes my head hurt just by reading your words. You don’t understand the complexity of human thought and how difficult it can be to express a simple idea in writing without sounding ridiculous or stupid (like this).

You think you know what I do all day long, but let me tell you something: I’m not just watching videos on Facebook with no purpose. There is more going on behind those screens than meets the eye – like research papers being written, ideas being developed and plans for tomorrow being made! It takes a lot of work to create something original and unique, which most people don’t see because they don’t bother looking deeper into things than just what’s obvious at face value.

Don’t get me wrong – there are plenty of worthless videos out there that don’t add any value or purpose beyond entertainment value alone (and yes sometimes those types of videos can be pretty funny). But let me tell you this: You aren’t above anyone else just because your brain thinks it knows everything about the internet. We’re all part of this global community now, so don’t think your ego is bigger than everyone else’s – we’re all human and our differences make us interesting!

So if you really want to know what I do all day long? Well then here ya go: I’m writing a response right now - trying my hardest not to be too harsh on someone who probably just wanted some attention or something similar but ended up coming across as pompous instead lol…..Anyways hope this helps clear things up for ya!
