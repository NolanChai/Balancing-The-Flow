`` My family lived in the middle of nowhere, so we could not even have electricity, let alone a radio or phone! We had to go to town once every few months for supplies. So my father had no way to find out what was going on with the war. Our farm was also really close to an airfield and they would do lots of training during the daytime, but we didn't even know it.

Well, one day, he heard a loud sound coming from above. He looked up in time to see a plane crash right outside our front door! The pilot survived, but unfortunately had serious injuries. My father quickly ran out and began giving him first aid until help arrived.

After that incident, my dad decided it was best if we left the farm behind and moved to town. So we did just that. It wasn't easy, especially with no money or food! However, I think what kept us going was knowing that there were other families out there who were suffering even more than we were. We never forgot about them and always tried our best to help whenever possible."
