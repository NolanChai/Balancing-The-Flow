The bunker is empty.

Jen steps out of the bunker. It was a long, exhausting walk through the blizzard back to her car, but she finally made it! She opens the door and gets into her truck.

She turns on the radio, hoping for some news about what happened outside or if there are any warnings for the next storm. But nothing comes in except static.

As she drives away, Jen thinks about what could have caused this strange power outage. Did they have a solar flare? A nuclear explosion? Or was it something more sinister?
