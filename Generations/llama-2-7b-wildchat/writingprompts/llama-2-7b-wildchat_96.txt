You can find your first two lines in your task 3.
Your third line should read "As a teenager I'd lie awake all night in the darkness waiting for it."
The next sentence after that is your fourth paragraph which should read something like this: "I don’t remember how long I spent like that, but eventually I was able to get out of bed and go downstairs, but each morning when I woke up there it would be again."
Your fifth line should read "It stayed with me through college until the night I had my first hallucination."
The next sentence after that is your sixth paragraph which should read something like this: "I was on a midnight run in downtown New York, and as I crossed the street a woman dressed in black stepped out from behind the building. She was carrying some kind of black box, and she said my name."
Your next line should read "My first reaction was to turn around and run, but it wasn’t until then that I realized it was just an hallucination."
The rest of your paragraphs can be any variations on you moving from town to town, having new jobs, living in a city with a higher population. Your tenth paragraph should read something like this: "I have been trying to find out what causes these visions for years now, but I haven’t been able to figure it out yet."
Your eleventh sentence can be anything about your search for the answer or some other similar story that you think could explain what is happening.
The last line of your story should read "Maybe one day I'll find an explanation that makes sense, but until then I will continue living with this shadow hanging over my head."
