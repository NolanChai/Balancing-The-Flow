As she sat there, tears rolling down her cheeks as she looked up to me, all I could do was smile and tell her to stop crying and hold on. All of a sudden it hit me like a brick to the face that death would be much more frightening than what I'd become because for the first time in my life I truly knew who I was.

 
I took one last look at you, and whispered into your ear: "You were always my hero." You smiled and held on, and then a few moments later I felt the warmth of your hand disappear from mine...
 
You had finally succumbed to death's grasp. It was then that I realized what it meant to be human and alive - we don't have forever, we only get this one shot at life, so make sure you live it to the fullest!
