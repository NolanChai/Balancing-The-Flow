Well, if this isn't the most useless assignment I've ever done. I mean seriously, writing a 10k word essay on a subject that can barely be classed as a real subject?! And for what reason?! Just to get our grades up. It's ridiculous and it's stupid and no one should have to put themselves through this nonsense. I mean, honestly, we should all just revolt against this system, but we're too busy with schoolwork to actually do anything about it.
