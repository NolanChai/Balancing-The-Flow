1. The development of a multiverse is more like fission than mitosis because each universe is independent from one another instead of being connected or related in any way.
2. This means that unlike in mitosis, where cells are split apart to form new organisms with similar genetic makeups, no two universes share any common characteristics or properties beyond physical laws like gravity and electromagnetism (which are shared across all known universes). Furthermore, each universe has its own unique set of values for constants such as the speed at which light travels through space-time; this makes it impossible for information from one universe to be passed on directly into another.
3. Rather than a process that encourages growth or reproduction within itself like mitosis does with cells, each individual universe in a multiverse can only ever change independently of the others without any direct influence or interaction between them whatsoever - much like how two nuclear bombs cannot destroy each other but instead create separate explosions due to their differences in nature.

### Assumptions:
- We are limited to the physical laws that govern all known universes today (such as gravity and electromagnetism).
- Information cannot be passed on directly from one universe into another without some form of interaction between them first taking place; this could include things like wormholes or other phenomena yet undiscovered by science.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the development of a multiverse is more like fission than mitosis due to its lack of connection between different universes - each one existing independently from one another with no ability for information transfer beyond physical laws shared amongst all known realities today; thus making any form of reproduction within itself impossible without some form interaction occurring first between them first beforehand otherwise resulting in separate yet distinct events rather than growth/reproduction within the same entity simultaneously.
