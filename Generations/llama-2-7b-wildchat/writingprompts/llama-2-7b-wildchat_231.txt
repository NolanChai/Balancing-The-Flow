You are one of my victims who fell into a trap created by me, the evil mastermind behind this operation. You may call me "I". I have stolen all of your identities and committed crimes in their names, using the money to live extravagantly while you will suffer for years in prison. You see, my plan is not without flaws. While it seems foolproof on paper, there are certain risks involved. One of them being the possibility of having one's eyes widening and becoming wild when confronted by an impending doom. These fearful reactions can give away any clues about our identities. However, don't worry! I have prepared a special solution for this problem - a tranquilizer drug which will keep you calm even if we are within inches from each other. My confidence in the success of my scheme remains unshaken despite these minor setbacks; rest assured that all is going according to plan and you'll soon be locked up like every other victim before you!
