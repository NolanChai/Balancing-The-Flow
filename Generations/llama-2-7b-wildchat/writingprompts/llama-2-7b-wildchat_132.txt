They could n't really ban religion. We all knew that. They could ban what they *thought* was religion, but that was n't belief. Belief comes from within; I had found this out when I was younger, my parents had wanted to raise me as a Catholic because it was the norm of their time.

As I grew older I came to realize that people do not follow what is taught by religions blindly, they see reason and logic in everything, including religion, so they form a belief on their own. These people can still be considered religious, even though no one has ever heard about them or knows anything about them; they are the ones who hold the true religion.
