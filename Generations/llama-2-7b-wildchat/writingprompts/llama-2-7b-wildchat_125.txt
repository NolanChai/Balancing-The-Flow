In 2150 humans made their first successful journey out of our solar system. They discovered an asteroid known as Eros in the Astraea Asteroid Belt and landed on it, building a mining colony. Soon after they developed warp technology that allowed them to travel to nearby star systems and trade with other civilizations. They were then able to advance into space with greater speed than ever before.

In 2203, humans built their first interstellar ship, the Starship Enterprise NX-01. This paved way for a new era of exploration as humans began expanding throughout other parts of space. They also established diplomatic relations with nearby civilizations and soon became one of the most powerful races in known space.

During this time period, humans faced many challenges both internally and externally while trying to establish themselves as a major force among other interstellar nations. However with courageous leadership from great leaders like Jean-Luc Picard (Captain) or William Shatner's James Tiberius Kirk, humanity managed to overcome these obstacles in order to achieve its full potential within the known universe.
