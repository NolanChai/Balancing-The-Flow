Desire is indeed a very important thing to humans. It is one that drives us forward and helps push through many difficult things in life. However, sometimes people's desires can be a little too greedy or selfish for the better good of others around them which I feel would lead down a path where no good will come from it.

I think desire is very important to humanity. It keeps us going and striving for more things in life. However, it can also be a bad thing if we let our desires consume us and take over our lives.
