```Hello! Welcome to our server! Here is your welcome message and instructions on how to begin your journey through this new world.
To start playing, simply type "/start" in the chat window. This will bring you into the game lobby where other players are waiting for you. Once everyone has joined, we'll begin by introducing ourselves and choosing our characters.
You can choose between three different classes: Warrior, Mage, or Rogue. Each class has its own unique abilities that make them suited to different playstyles.
Once we have chosen our character type, we'll move onto creating our player avatar! This will involve selecting from a variety of customization options like hair styles, skin tones, and clothing choices.
With your avatar ready to go it's time for us to explore this exciting new world together! We can choose between several different maps filled with quests and enemies waiting to be defeated or allies willing to help along the way. So let's dive in and embark on an unforgettable adventure full of danger and discovery!"
