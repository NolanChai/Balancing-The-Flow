He had been involved in an accident on his motorcycle and was in critical condition, needing some help. He asked me to meet up with him at the nearest hospital as soon as possible since he is unable to drive himself due to the seriousness of his injury. I got into my car quickly and drove off towards the destination as fast as I could so I can reach the accident spot and be by Lloyd's side in no time, hoping that he pull through.
