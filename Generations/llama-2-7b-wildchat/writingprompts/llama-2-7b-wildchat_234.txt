I think that this is a sad thing to hear and I agree with what you are saying, but the world still has plenty of great writers who have yet to die. We have all had to face this question in our lives: "What will be my legacy?", whether or not we want to admit it. And some people think that they may leave an impact on the world through their work, just like many authors do. However, some may disagree with this concept and argue that everyone is special and should strive to make a difference in life regardless of how big or small it may be.
