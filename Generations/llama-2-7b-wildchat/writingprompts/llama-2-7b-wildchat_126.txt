Mrs. Dunbar shuffled her feet into position, patted down her skirt and looked up across the room towards her opponent. There had been weeks of preparation leading up to the final presidential debate between herself (Mrs. Dunbar) and candidate Donald J. Trump (DJT). The eyes of a nation were upon them, and Mrs. Dunbar felt her heart begin racing at the very thought. She took several deep breaths in an effort to calm herself but was met with only minor success.

As she waited for the debate moderator to introduce them, Mrs. Dunbar's mind raced back and forth between her carefully crafted campaign message and DJT's unpredictability. She knew that any misstep could be costly in this high-stakes event but remained focused on staying composed while preparing herself for an aggressive counter from DJT at any moment. Her determination was undeterred by his brash behavior during previous debates and she felt confident that she had what it takes to come out on top tonight if only given a chance to explain her vision for America's future.

As the moderator began introducing them both, Mrs. Dunbar took one final deep breath and stepped forward into the spotlight. She looked directly at DJT across from her and confidently stated "Mr. Trump has already proven himself unfit for office by dividing our nation through his divisive rhetoric and lack of experience." With this strong opening statement Mrs. Dunbar set the tone for what would be a hard-hitting debate where facts were king over fiction as she laid out her vision for America's future without hesitation or interruption from DJT throughout their hour long discussion on key issues facing both candidates during their campaign run up until now including healthcare reform, immigration reform, tax cuts and economic growth just to name a few topics discussed along the way while keeping focus back on herself rather than getting deflected away by any attempt at attacking comments made towards him from Donald Trump himself .

In short, Mrs. Dunbar's opening statement at their final presidential debate was a masterful display of political skill which allowed her to effectively frame herself as an experienced leader capable not just talking about change but actually making it happen if given enough time and resources by the American people themselves who were now listening closely every step she made along this campaign trail journey until Election Day arrived where they would have one last chance make their choice between two very different candidates running for President Of The United States come November 2016!
