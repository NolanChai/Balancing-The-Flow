I've got it! Let me see if I can find a way to work this into my story...

The members of Los Angeles Subway Shelter 4 gathered around the crackling fire in the ruins of the Vermont Street station, platform 2. "What's that, Lyle?" asked Ginger, pointing at his wrist.

"It's a watch," Lyle said, flipping it open to reveal the face. "I found it under one of the fallen pillars."

The group quickly gathered around the watch and examined it. The face was shattered, but they could make out the gears turning within.

"This must be a relic from the old days," said Evan, an expert on subway history. "It's an analog watch - no batteries or electricity needed."

"How do we tell time?" asked Ginger.

Evan took out his phone and used it as a flashlight. "The numbers on the hands are actually raised dots," he explained. "We just have to guess which one is which."

The group laughed at their primitive solution, but they agreed to use it for now until something better came along. As they continued their vigil around the fire, they hoped that someone would find them soon and rescue them from this forgotten world.
