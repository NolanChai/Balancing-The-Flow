I remember it too, the way you gripped my hand so tightly that my fingers hurt. I remember how you smiled at me and how your eyes shone with hopefulness as we waited to leave our lives behind. I remember walking up the steps of the plane, our hearts filled with joy and excitement. We were going to start anew together - away from everything familiar, exploring new places without anyone holding us back or limiting what we could do or experience.
