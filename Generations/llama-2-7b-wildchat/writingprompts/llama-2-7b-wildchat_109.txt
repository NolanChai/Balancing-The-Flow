`` Well, I don 't know what else you can do!'' The voice in my head says. 
 `` Yes, yes, but if we go down the M40 and it says take the M25 then how will we get back? '' 
 `` Ah, right...'' The computer speaks. It's almost as if he is actually thinking. 
`` We can always drive back through London!'' I laugh in response. 
`` Yeah, yeah, but that would be really boring. Do you have any other ideas?'' 
`` Well, there are two more routes to get from Swindon to Heathrow...'' the computer says hesitantly. ``Take the A346 through Birmingham and then M25 west OR Take the M40 south and then take the M25 anti-clockwise as you did before! '' 
`` Thank you, Mr. Computer! You've been a great help. Now we know two more ways to get from Swindon to Heathrow.'' I smile at my computer companion. 
 `` Or you could just take the M25 east and go around the back of London...'' It says teasingly. 
`` Yes, but that would be a lot longer and we still have to get through the traffic in Birmingham!'' I say, rolling my eyes. 
 `` Well, maybe if we took all three routes at once it could work? We could go down the M40 and then take the M25 east...'' The computer pauses before continuing. ``Then after passing through London, we could take either of the other two routes back!'' 
``Hmmm, that sounds interesting! I don't know if it would actually work but I think it's worth a try. So let's go on a crazy adventure and drive all three routes at once! '' 
``Agreed! Let's see what happens...'' The computer says as we begin our journey.
