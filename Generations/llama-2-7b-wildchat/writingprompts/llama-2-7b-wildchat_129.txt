Theo Cullins walked the old streets of Valia, his small town in the land of Khalhalla. It was a small mining and fishing village, perched on a cliff overlooking the endless blue sea. The sun had just set, leaving behind a spectacular red sky. Theo could almost feel the salty air fill his lungs with new vigor; this was home.
