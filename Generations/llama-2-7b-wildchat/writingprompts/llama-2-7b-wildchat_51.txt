The log truck rumbled to a stop. Its diesel engine had been running hot the last hour, and it clicked and clanked now in the cool winter air. Dexter Morgan pulled a toque over his head and climbed down from the cab. He stretched his back and cracked his neck, feeling the familiar ache of a long day on the road.

Dexter glanced at the pile of logs behind him, stacked high in the bed of his truck. It was an impressive sight – the perfect Christmas tree for anyone looking to decorate their home with natural beauty this holiday season. He had been making these deliveries for years now, and he loved nothing more than bringing joy to people's homes through his work.

But today was different; today brought something unexpected along with it. As Dexter reached into the back of his truck to retrieve a pair of gloves, something caught his eye among all those logs: A man lying on the ground, unmoving and covered in blood. His face was twisted in pain, and there were bullet holes scattered across his chest – someone had tried to shoot him dead just minutes before!

Dexter's instinct took over immediately; he pulled out his phone and dialled 911 before running towards the victim. He knelt down beside him as sirens blared in the distance – this was not going to be an easy rescue mission by any means. But it didn't matter; Dexter was determined to do everything within his power to save this man from certain death at least one more time.

As he waited for help to arrive, Dexter looked into those eyes once more – knowing full well that this might very well be their last conversation together on earth. He didn't know much about him yet; but he did know enough: This man had been through so much pain in his life already...and yet here he was still fighting for every second of it despite everything!

And now, finally – with those bullets still lodged deep into his body – this was what he chose to do: He chose hope; he chose faith; and he chose love above all else. In that moment alone, Dexter knew without a doubt that no matter how hard things got or how many struggles were ahead of them - together they could overcome anything because ultimately life always finds a way to remind us just why we keep fighting so hard despite everything!
