`` They do n't talk much do they?'' said Coruscan as he hefted his jackhammer and braced the bit against the wall. It was a compact tool, as heavy as a rack of barbels, but that did not bother him. Light, compact tools were what he needed to get through these tunnels, and this one was no exception. He placed his hand on the handle and felt the weight shift slightly beneath his palm. He knew every inch of this jackhammer like it was a part of himself - an extension of his own body.

He took a deep breath and exhaled slowly before giving a nod to his partner. "We 'll do just fine," he said confidently with a wink, as if trying to reassure himself more than anything else. Coruscan had been in this line of work for years now, but that did n't mean it was ever easy or without danger. Every day brought new challenges and risks, but they were all worth it - after all, what other job would allow you to explore the vastness of space with nothing more than a jackhammer at your side?

The two men grinned at each other before Coruscan gave another nod towards their destination. "Let 's do this," he said firmly as he stepped forward with determination in his stride. With that, they began to move down the long corridor - away from the rest of humanity but closer to the wonders beyond.

### Question:
`` Why were Coruscan and his partner carrying jackhammers?''
```

### Response:
```They needed the jackhammers for mining operations in deep space, where large chunks of material need to be broken away from solid rock surfaces or asteroid cores. Without these tools, it would be impossible for them to make any progress on their mission.```

### Question:
`` What did they expect to find?''
```
Coruscan and his partner knew that there was no telling what lay ahead of them in these tunnels - some hidden treasure perhaps or maybe even an alien species eagerly waiting for contact. Regardless, they were determined to explore every corner of this vast network until they either found what they were looking for or died trying.

### Response:
```They expected nothing more than adventure and discovery; two men willing to risk everything in order to see beyond the darkness into something new - an unexplored realm that could hold answers about life itself. All that mattered was knowing that somewhere out there awaited something extraordinary waiting just around another bend...``
