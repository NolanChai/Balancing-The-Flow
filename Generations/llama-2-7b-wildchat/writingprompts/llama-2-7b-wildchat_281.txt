Ariel is very reluctant to talk about her experience because she blames herself for what happened. She thinks she could've done more for Mike when he needed help.

**Mike**

I don't know why we didn't get divorced at that time, Ariel. We were living in the same house, and there was a lot of tension between us. I just couldn't let go of her.

Mike is reflecting on their marriage. He regrets not getting divorced sooner because it would've saved them both from so much pain.

**Ariel, again**  
But anyway, I wasn't going to take him with me if he didn't want to be there. So we left together and moved into an apartment that was only a few blocks away from his school.
