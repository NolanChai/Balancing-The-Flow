#### ## 1. Whenever I hear the word “competitive” my mind immediately goes back to my high school days when it was all about competing against everyone else. There were so many different types of competitions for students, and I remember always trying to get involved in as much as possible just to show my talent, not necessarily for winning but more so to be recognized. One type of competition that I competed in was track & field, specifically hurdles and javelin. I’m sure you can imagine the mental struggles that came with these events since there were so many other people trying their best against me, however, the adrenaline rush that came with being able to compete against others definitely outweighed it all!

After high school ended, I went on my own path where college was my main focus but as time passed by, I realized how much more enjoyable it would be if there were other people competing against me instead of just trying to get good grades for the sake of it - so here we are now at this place called UC Berkeley with endless opportunities for us students!

As a current student here at UC Berkeley, I’ve been exposed to even more ways where people compete against each other than in high school alone – there’s everything from academic competitions like debate tournaments or spelling bees; athletic events such as track meets and basketball games; even social challenges such as who can make the best cupcake recipe! No matter what form of competition we choose, we always come together with one common goal: being better than others by showing off our talents – whether it’s winning an award or simply gaining recognition for doing something extraordinary.
