A: Don woke up in a large, disheveled bed with no idea how long he'd been there. He hadn't seen any clocks or calendars, and his memory of the night before was hazy at best. All he knew was that there had been drinking, dancing, and sex—a lot of it.

It seemed like Don had gone on a wild bender. His clothes were rumpled from sleep, and his head was pounding from alcohol and exhaustion. He looked around the room, trying to figure out where he was, but nothing felt familiar. The place was messy and dilapidated, with old furniture and worn carpeting. It didn't look like a hotel—more like an abandoned house or apartment.

Don tried to piece together what had happened the night before. He remembered meeting some friends at a bar, then going out dancing until early in the morning. The drinks flowed freely, and soon Don was feeling euphoric and invincible. He lost track of time, and next thing he knew, it was dawn.

As Don got up to go home, he passed out on someone's couch or bed—he couldn't be sure which one. The last thing he remembered before collapsing into a deep sleep was the feeling of satisfaction that came with waking up in a stranger's arms. It had been fun, but it also left him feeling empty and ashamed.

Now here he was, alone and disoriented in an unfamiliar room. The night before had been a blur of pleasure and regret, leaving Don to wonder what else he might have missed out on while getting lost in the haze.
