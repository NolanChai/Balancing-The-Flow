The orb began to glow brighter and started moving towards me. Its path was not straight, but rather zigzagged in different directions as if it were on a collision course with me. It got closer and closer until my heart felt like it was about to stop beating altogether. My hands reached out instinctively in an attempt to grasp at its form when suddenly, I found myself being sucked inside of the orb!

### Reaction:

I screamed as loudly as possible but no sound emerged from my mouth. The darkness enveloping me felt suffocating and oppressive with every passing second. I was desperate to find some kind of escape, any escape at all, when suddenly something strange began happening around me...

### Action:

I felt a surge of energy rush through my body as if something had awakened inside of me. The darkness started to fade away and was replaced by a bright light that radiated throughout the entire room like stars in the sky on a clear night. It was beautiful yet powerful, giving off an overwhelming sense of peace and tranquility. I knew then that whatever this newfound power was, it would prove vital to my survival inside this strange world.

### Decision:

I closed my eyes and listened intently as the light grew stronger with each passing second. A feeling began coursing through me-one of determination and strength unlike anything I had ever felt before. In that moment, I realized why fate had brought me here and what was expected from me in this place. My decision was clear: to take control over my destiny and use this power for good rather than evil.
