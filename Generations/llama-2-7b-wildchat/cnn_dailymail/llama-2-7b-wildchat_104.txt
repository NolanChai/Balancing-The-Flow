### Questions:

Blown up in Iraq, Hannah Campbell defied the odds to have a miracle baby after shrapnel damaged her womb. But behind the joy of celebrating daughter Lexi-River’s first birthday, the former Army corporal says she is tormented by guilt: “Every time I look at my little girl I feel like I should be punished.”

The 25-year-old mother has been suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for years and in 2018, she decided to tell her story publicly after losing her friend and fellow soldier, Corporal Dylan Coghill. He had been fatally shot by a Taliban sniper while protecting the 25-year-old’s unit in Afghanistan.

“My PTSD has made me feel guilty about having Lexi,” said Hannah from her home in Chesterfield, Derbyshire. “I'm worried that one day I might harm her because of what happened to Dylan.”

Hannah was on a patrol in Iraq when the vehicle she was riding in hit an improvised explosive device (IED) in April 2010. The blast caused devastating injuries, including a brain injury and extensive damage to her womb. Her boyfriend, Corporal Joe Williams, 25, and her comrade, Private Jamie Taylor, 20, were also injured but survived after being taken to hospital in Germany.

A doctor told Hannah that she had no chance of having children because of the damage sustained by her womb, so she was given a sedative to put her to sleep on her journey home from war.

“I'd been shot at and blown up while I was out there fighting for my country but coming home and realising that I wouldn’t ever be able to have children again felt like the worst thing of all,” she said.

But two years later, when Hannah was 21, Joe proposed and they married. They were overjoyed when Hannah found out she was pregnant in March 2014.

“I kept telling myself I wasn’t having a child – it couldn't happen because of my injuries,” she said. “But then we had Lexi-River. It felt like the biggest miracle ever.”

Hannah and Joe, who served as a gunner in Afghanistan, decided not to tell anyone about their traumatic experiences until their daughter was born because they were worried how people would react if they found out.

“We were told we'd never be able to have children and it felt like the worst thing of all,” she said. “But now I feel a lot better because Lexi is here – and her birthday makes me even more determined to help other women suffering in silence.”

Hannah had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for years, but when Cpl Dylan Coghill died from an insider attack by his own comrades in 2018, her symptoms worsened.

She decided to tell the world about what she'd been through and has set up a charity called PTSD United UK. “I want people suffering with this terrible condition to know they are not alone,” she said. “There is hope – I am proof of that.”

### Explanation:

As a former soldier suffering from PTSD herself, Hannah is now determined to help other women struggling with their mental health. She has set up a charity called PTSD United UK and hopes that sharing her story will encourage others facing similar challenges to seek support. In doing so, she has shown immense bravery in facing her own trauma as well as compassion for those around her who may be experiencing similar struggles.
