I do not like the story of Mr Prasanna. The death of this person is very tragic and should be stopped by law enforcement agencies. This story is an example of how dangerous it can be for ordinary people when they try to help. However, in general, we need more stories of heroism such as the shopkeeper who sacrificed his life to protect others from thieves . In this case, the shopkeeper's death was pointless because he could not stop the thieves from stealing things. But if more people were like him , then there would be fewer crimes committed by robbers or other criminals .

It is a tragedy that Nick fell to his death, but I am glad that he died fighting for what was right and just instead of hiding behind others' backs. It seems that this story has been written with sensitivity towards Nickâ€™s family as well as other families who have lost loved ones due to their bravery in protecting people from harm.
