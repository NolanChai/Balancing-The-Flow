The waitress disappeared, which was really bad luck for her because she had to make her way home on foot in a cold, damp winter night.

The police suspect the multi-millionaire property developer's son of murdering the waitress and therefore they are questioning him about her disappearance.

The young man was in a celebrity club popular with Premiership footballers and soap stars when she went missing, which is unfortunate for him because he may have been caught up with some unsavoury people there.
