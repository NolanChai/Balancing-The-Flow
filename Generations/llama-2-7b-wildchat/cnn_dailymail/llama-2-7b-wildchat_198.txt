In light of this incident, we are very concerned about our national security, because Andreas Lubitz may be a threat to UK national security. In order to maintain high level of national security, the government has issued an alert for all rogue workers in nuclear and transport industries, as well as public services such as the health system, police service etc., reminding them that they should never do any thing wrong or illegal, even if they are under a lot of pressure.

### Discussion:

It’s not surprising to see UK government issue an alert because we have also witnessed similar incidents in other countries such as 9/11 attack and the Japanese nuclear disaster. Therefore, it’s very important to make sure that all rogue workers are aware of the risk of their actions. They should never put their job or family’s safety at stake because their own lives also matters a lot.

### Question:

What do you think about this? Do you have any suggestions for UK government and rogue workers in nuclear, transport and public services?
