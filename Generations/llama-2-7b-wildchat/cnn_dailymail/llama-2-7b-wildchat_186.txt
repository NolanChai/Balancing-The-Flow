Shopping, like, literally is such a big part of Made in Chelsea’s culture and, as you said, it’s not uncommon to see the cast visiting shops in every episode.

While some people might criticize them for having too much money to spend, let’s give them credit - they always find ways to look chic and stylish, no matter where they shop from. Whether it’s designer labels or high street brands, the cast knows how to put together outfits that are both fashionable and effortless.

Plus, who doesn’t enjoy seeing their favorite reality stars indulge in some retail therapy? It’s a great way to escape our own lives for a while and live vicariously through someone else.

So, let’s give the cast of Made in Chelsea credit – they may have lots of cash to splurge but they certainly know how to make shopping look like fun!
