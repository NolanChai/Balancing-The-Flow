When Barcelona midfielder Xavi came on as a half-time substitute against Paris Saint-Germain in their Champions League quarterfinal clash on Tuesday night, he broke several records. The veteran Spaniard replaced Sergio Busquets and proceeded to create the most number of chances (three), the most number of open play key passes (two) as well as the most number of successful dribbles (four).
Xavi's performance also saw him surpass Andres Iniesta in terms of assists for Barcelona in all competitions. The midfielder's contribution helped his side to a 4-1 win over their French opponents, with Lionel Messi scoring a brace and Neymar netting two goals. Xavi's impressive display was a testament to the player's ability, experience, and leadership qualities.
While Barcelona will be hoping for another such performance from Xavi in the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal, it remains to be seen if they can overturn their 4-1 deficit and advance to the semi-final stage. With Messi and Neymar in top form and the addition of Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele, Barcelona have a strong squad that could potentially cause an upset at the Parc des Princes.
However, Paris Saint-Germain will also be determined to book their place in the semi-finals. With Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani leading the line, they possess plenty of firepower going forward. As such, it promises to be an enthralling contest between two teams full of world-class talents.
