an assist for Alex to head in his fourth goal of the season from close range, as AC Milan fought back from an early deficit to rescue a point against Sampdoria. After falling behind to an impressive display of free kick execution from former Tottenham player Giaccherini (5'), the Rossoneri equalised through Alex's effort in the 37th minute, leaving the match at 1-1 with the teams headed into the break.

The game remained a stalemate after the restart, as both sides continued to create chances but lacking a cutting edge in front of goal. With both sets of players frustrated, the game eventually came to an end with no further goals and the points being shared between Milan and Sampdoria.
