(CNN)It took BP five months to stop the gusher of 200 million gallons (750 million liters) of crude oil from spewing into the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in April, 2010. But that was not enough for a group of environmental organizations.

They took their case to the courts and got a settlement from BP which, in addition to paying more than $6 billion in fines, agreed to a long-term restoration plan covering natural resources impacted by the oil spill. That includes marine and wetlands habitat, oysters, shrimp and fish populations, birds and wildlife, as well as public beaches.

The settlement, which was finalized last week after more than 400 days in court, also provides for long-term monitoring to make sure the restoration projects are successful.

(CNN)The largest marine oil spill in U.S. history happened five years ago this month when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and spewed millions of gallons (literally hundreds of millions) of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico for 87 days. The environmental and economic costs are still being assessed, but early estimates predict at least $2 billion in cleanup efforts alone.

(CNN)Five years after a deadly explosion on an offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico sent millions of gallons of crude oil gushing into America's waters, there is no clear consensus among scientists about whether it will ever be safe to swim in some areas affected by the massive spill.
