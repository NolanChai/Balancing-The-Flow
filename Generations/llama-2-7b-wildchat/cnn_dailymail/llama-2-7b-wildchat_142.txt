Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing in response to your advertisement regarding fake tan. As a self-confessed fan of all things beauty, I have been eagerly awaiting this opportunity for some time now. My name is Ms. Smith and my reason for responding to this ad is that I want to make it clear that I am interested in pursuing further details about the availability of fake tan at your location.

I have always loved having a bronzed glow, especially during summer months when outdoor activities become more commonplace. However, with busy lifestyles and hectic schedules making it difficult to spend as much time outdoors as we would like, many people struggle to achieve that sought-after tan. That’s why fake tan has become such an invaluable tool for many women who want to look their best without having to spend hours basking under the sun.

Therefore, I am extremely excited at the prospect of being able to purchase quality fake tan products from a reliable source such as yourself. Additionally, given my passion for all things beauty-related, it would be fantastic if you could provide me with information about upcoming events or promotions that may offer special deals on these types of tanning solutions.

I hope this letter serves as proof of my enthusiasm and interest in fake tan from your store! I look forward to hearing back from you soon regarding its availability here in town, so please do not hesitate to get in touch with me if more details are needed about the product line-up or anything else related.
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule – it means a lot that someone like myself would take an interest in something like this!

Kind regards,
Ms. Smith
