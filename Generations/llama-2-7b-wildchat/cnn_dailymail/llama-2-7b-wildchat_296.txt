1. A meat grinder is an electric device used for cutting or grinding meat into small pieces. It consists of two rotating blades that chop and shred the meat, and a housing that collects the ground meat. In this scenario, it's being used to explain that the suspect had some sort of involvement in the disappearance of his female lodger, as well as others, which is suspicious behavior.
2. Adriana could be the name of either the man arrested or the missing female lodger, depending on who is making the statement. It's not clear from the context who is speaking, so it can't be determined exactly which person Adriana refers to.
