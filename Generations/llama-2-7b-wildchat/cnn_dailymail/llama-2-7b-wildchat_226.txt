mind, but now she is making it public. She has also voted against the DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act) law. Her stance on these issues has become very strong and clear. However, there have been some controversies concerning this matter.

Ginsburg is a liberal justice, who has often expressed her opinions about social and political matters. She has argued that legalizing same-sex marriage would benefit the whole country, including families. In one of her interviews with NPR (National Public Radio), she stated that “there is no doubt in my mind that there will be more families headed by gay persons” if they are allowed to marry and have children.

Ginsburg believes that allowing gays to marry would help create more stable families, which can be beneficial for both society and economy. Moreover, she emphasizes on the fact that same-sex couples deserve equal rights and should not be denied basic human needs such as legal protections or benefits provided by marriage laws.

However, her opinion has caused some disagreements among Supreme Court justices since Justice Anthony Kennedy joined Ginsburg’s side during last year’s hearing about California Proposition 8 case (which banned same-sex marriages in that state). This decision resulted in dissenting opinions from other four conservative-leaning judges – Samuel Alito Jr., Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia and Chief Justice John Roberts. They argued that this was not an issue of civil rights but rather a question about traditional definition of marriage between one man and one woman only.

### Conclusion:

Ruth Bader Ginsburg has made it clear where she stands when it comes to legalizing same-sex marriages; however, some disagreements remain among Supreme Court justices regarding this matter. Nevertheless, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s stance remains strong and she will continue fighting until equal rights are guaranteed for all Americans regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
