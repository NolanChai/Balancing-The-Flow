had ever seen, were discovered on the outskirts of Kettleburgh near Bury St Edmunds last weekend.

Police said they believed the waste was left during a series of fly-tipping incidents at 19 locations across Suffolk in recent weeks.

One officer described the rubbish as ‘the worst he had ever seen’ while another tweeted: ‘Unbelievably bad fly tipping along the A14.’

The huge mounds of waste were found at a spot on the roadside about five miles from Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk.

It was discovered during a police patrol last weekend when officers made their way through Kettleburgh, which is popular with dog walkers and families.

Inspector Sarah Norris said: ‘The fly-tipped waste has been removed but we are still keen to speak with anyone who may have seen suspicious activity in the area over the last month.’

A Suffolk police spokesman said they believed the waste was left during a series of incidents.

Fly-tipping is an offence which can lead to a fine of up to £50,000 or two years imprisonment.
