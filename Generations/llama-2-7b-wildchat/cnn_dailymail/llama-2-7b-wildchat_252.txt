The article is interesting because it talks about a change in teaching styles. As an education system, we should try to use as many different approaches to teaching as possible. This will help children develop their learning skills and understand how to study more effectively. However, this can cause some confusion for teachers who might not be used to using so many different techniques. The article also talks about how teachers need to learn new methods of instruction in order to adapt better with the changing times.

### Question:
How should we respond? Should we stick with one teaching style or try out a few different approaches?
