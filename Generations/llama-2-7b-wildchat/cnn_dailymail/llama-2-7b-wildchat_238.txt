A daredevil climber known as the 'French Spiderman' has scaled the world's tallest twisted skyscraper – without a safety harness. French climber Alain Robert climbed Dubai's 1,007ft Cayan Tower with no equipment to mark his 20th attempt at scaling one of the city's famous landmarks. The climb took the 54-year-old four hours and he scaled it using only his hands and feet.
The tower has an exterior wall made from a unique curved design, which has made it a popular target for thrill-seeking climbers. He previously succeeded in scaling the world's tallest building – the 160-storey Burj Khalifa – on New Year's Eve in 2014 without ropes or safety equipment.
