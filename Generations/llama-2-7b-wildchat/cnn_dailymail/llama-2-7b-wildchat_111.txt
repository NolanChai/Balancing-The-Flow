A: In response to the announcement of the Queen's staff taking industrial action for the first time in history over their 'ridiculously low' wages, Wardens at Windsor Castle say that they are expected to carry out extra duties, including guarding the Royal Mint and serving as pallbearers.

The union representing the Queen's workers has issued a statement saying that the staff should receive a pay increase similar to other frontline workers in the public sector who have received a 3% uplift. The Wardens claim they are underpaid compared to their colleagues at Buckingham Palace, which is why they want a salary closer to Â£25,000 per year.

The Royal Mint and pallbearer duties are among the many responsibilities of the Warden's role that require extra time commitment outside regular hours. The Wardens say their pay does not reflect this dedication, prompting them to take industrial action as a last resort after unsuccessful attempts at negotiations with Her Majesty's officials and the Royal Household department.

It remains unclear how long the strike will last or what other measures will be put into place until an agreement is reached between both parties involved in this dispute over pay inequality within The Queen's staff. In response, Buckingham Palace has said that they will "consider any proposals for change with open minds" while ensuring all services provided remain uninterrupted during the industrial action period.
