Time Warner Cable is a major cable company headquartered in New York City. Comcast Corporation is the nation's largest provider of cable, broadband Internet and voice services. These two companies are planning to merge their respective businesses for $45 billion in order to create one of America's premier media and communications companies. However, concerns have been raised by US Department of Justice officials over potential antitrust issues that could arise from such a merger between these two major players within this industry. The meeting between representatives from Comcast and Time Warner Cable will focus on addressing these concerns in an effort to allay any fears around possible monopolies or price hikes for customers if they become too powerful as one entity together after their planned merger occurs later this year.

### Solution:
The solution to this problem is that the US Department of Justice should allow Comcast and Time Warner Cable to complete their merger. This would be in line with antitrust law, which allows for two companies to merge if they don't control more than 20% of a particular market segment or have an unfair competitive advantage due to other factors such as geographic reach or size differentials between them and rivals that are also seeking the same acquisitions. If both parties can demonstrate that their combined assets will not create undue harm for consumers, then regulatory approval could be granted without any restrictions placed upon either company's operations afterward - thus ensuring a smooth transition into one single entity under new management while preserving competition among other providers within its respective industry sector(s).

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, it is clear that there are valid concerns about potential antitrust issues arising from this planned merger between two major players in America's cable industry. However, if both companies can demonstrate how their combined assets will not create undue harm for consumers then regulatory approval should be granted without any restrictions placed upon either party's operations afterwards - thus ensuring a smooth transition into one single entity under new management while preserving competition among other providers within its respective industry sector(s).
