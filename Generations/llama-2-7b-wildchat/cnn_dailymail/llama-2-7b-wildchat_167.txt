In a letter to Fairfax Media today, Ms Bartholomew denied reports she threw her shopping in the air and yelled at Mr Voukelatos after he refused to sell her the chicken. She said that on May 19 she went into his store in Woolwich to buy two chickens for the dinner party but was unable to get one of them as the stock ran out before she could complete her purchase.
Ms Bartholomew wrote: “I’m not going to sit back and listen to a man accuse me of something I didn’t do,” she said in a letter to Fairfax Media today.
“He had already denied my request for two chickens and he knew why I was there – as the date on my receipt will show.”
Ms Bartholomew also denied claims Mr Voukelatos had attempted to calm her down, saying: “I’m not an idiot. He tried to calm me down? Not a chance. In fact he was trying his best to get me out of the store because I wasn’t budging.”
The young woman said she went back in to check if there were any more chickens and was told no, but asked Mr Voukelatos to sell her one of the ones that had been returned as they weren't fully cooked. She alleges he became agitated.
“I couldn’t believe what I just heard. How dare a man treat me in such a manner,” she wrote.
She said she then asked for her money back and went home, “whereupon I started throwing things around” after being disturbed by the incident. She also denied yelling at Mr Voukelatos when he confronted her outside.
“He was quite aggressive towards me,” she wrote in the letter. “I wanted him to leave me alone but instead he kept on talking, trying to provoke a response from me.” Ms Bartholomew said she had taken legal advice about filing a defamation case against Mr Voukelatos and was waiting for the outcome of her complaint to the NSW Fair Trading Department.
In a second letter in today’s paper, Mr Voukelatos insisted that Ms Bartholomew was “in no way, shape or form” attacked by him but instead had “behaved extremely aggressively towards me”. The butcher denied ever throwing shopping at her and said she had thrown the items herself. He claimed he had been trying to calm her down when she “repeatedly hurled expletives” at him outside his store, as well as at other members of staff.
“I had asked [Ms Bartholomew] to leave my premises and requested that she desist in the use of foul language,” he wrote. “In this process I never raised my voice and I did not threaten her with violence.” Mr Voukelatos said his actions were in accordance with Fair Trading regulations, which state staff members can remove a customer who refuses to leave. He added that Ms Bartholomew had become upset when he told her she was being recorded on CCTV.
“As [Ms Bartholomew] is clearly well aware of the rules and regulations regarding recording, she became visibly angry and verbally abusive towards myself,” Mr Voukelatos wrote. “Her behaviour was aggressive, threatening and deliberately provocative.” The butcher said he had been left with a black eye after the incident, which occurred about 12.45pm on May 19 at his Woolwich store.
He also claimed Ms Bartholomew had tried to smash her car into him outside the shop and was taken by police to Sydney's Kings Cross for questioning. “[Ms Bartholomew] was arrested under Section 4 of the Summary Offences Act (2017),” he wrote in his letter.
“I wish to make it clear that my only intention on the day in question was to protect myself and my staff from being attacked by Ms Bartholomew. “If she wishes to pursue her frivolous claims of assault, I will seek justice through a court.”
