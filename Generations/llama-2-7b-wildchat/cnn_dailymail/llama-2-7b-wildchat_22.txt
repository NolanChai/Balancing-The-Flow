A train was stopped at the Fulton Street station, and evacuations began in cars around 9:30 a.m., Metropolitan Transportation Authority spokesman Adam Lisberg said in an email to NPR. The fire started about 10 minutes earlier on one of four tracks between Brooklyn and Manhattan, he added.

Firefighters were called and evacuated passengers from three cars, according to the FDNY. About 125 people were affected by the incident, a spokesman for the MTA said.

### Solution:
The fire began on one of four tracks between Brooklyn and Manhattan. The MTA closed two of those tracks while they evacuated passengers from three cars. The FDNY was called and evacuated 125 people in total, according to the MTA spokesman.

### What did you learn from this?
I learned that incidents like these can occur on public transportation systems even during regular hours of operation which causes major disruptions for commuters trying to get where they need to go efficiently without any interruption or delay whatsoever so always try your best not only when there's an actual emergency but also in times where things may seem calm at first glance because something might happen later down the line even if no one expected it beforehand!

### Do you have a better solution? If yes, please explain.
Yes I do! My better solution would be having extra evacuation points around every underground station especially during peak hours when traffic congestion could lead to delayed arrivals at destination platforms which might cause some passengers waiting inside trains or buses outside them might panic if an incident occurs resulting in chaos everywhere thus leading us back where we started from before resolving any situation at hand effectively without causing further harm than needed especially considering how densely populated most cities are these days so every precaution taken against such problems must be given utmost importance since lives could potentially depend upon them!
