Forest Reserve in Sri Lanka, the now elderly female was reunited with her mother for the first time in 10 years. According to The Dodo, the pair had been separated when Kumbukani's owner, an elephant handler who worked at a nearby temple, decided to give the young girl a new home after she turned too large to care for. The 5-year-old had lived with her mother and other animals during these years. When the owner passed away, Kumbukani was allowed to return to her birthplace.

Despite living apart from each other, the two female elephants seemed delighted to see one another again. After a short but emotional reunion, they embraced and shared an affectionate moment together. Kumbukani's owner even reported that she was thrilled to see her mother once more after such a long separation.

Although some may believe that elephants never forget their family members, this touching video shows that they can develop close bonds with those who take care of them and remain connected for many years. The reunion between Kumbukani and her mother demonstrates the remarkable strength of these animals' maternal love.
