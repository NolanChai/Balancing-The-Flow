The veteran had applied for a personalized plate with "1967 PURPLE HART" on it. The Utah Department of Motor Vehicles had refused the request, saying that the phrase "Purple Hart" is trademarked and they can't grant licenses with such phrases.

### Analysis:

The veteran has since taken his case to a state legislature, who said he will be given a new choice of plates in the meantime. This story shows how important it is for those who have served our country and sacrificed so much to remember their service with personalized license plates. The Utah Department of Motor Vehicles should not deny such requests due to trademark issues as they are honoring an individual's courageous act during wartime.
