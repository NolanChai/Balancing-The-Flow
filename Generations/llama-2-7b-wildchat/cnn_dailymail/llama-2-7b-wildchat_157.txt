The Scottish National Party is an anti-monarchist and separatist political party in Scotland. The SNP advocates Scottish independence, the establishment of a federal United Kingdom with England, Wales and Northern Ireland, or at least full devolved powers for Scotland within the UK. The Scottish National Party was formed from the Scottish Party by Winnie Ewing in 1968. In May 1974 it won its first seat in Westminster (the Dundee constituency) with the election of Tam Dalyell, although its first member to be elected at Holyrood had been John MacCormick MP who won a by-election on 25 February 1968. In April 2016 it became the first major party in the UK since before World War I to win an absolute majority of seats in a UK-wide parliamentary election: winning all but one of the Scottish seats at the 2015 general election. The SNP has also led the Scottish Parliament since its establishment in 1999, and won the subsequent elections in 2003, 2007 and 2011 with an overwhelming majority. In September 2014 it won all but one of the Scottish seats at the United Kingdom general election.

The Prime Minister has been quoted as saying that the Scottish National Party do not want to see a united Britain. This statement is incorrect and unfair, as the SNP actually advocates a federal system for the whole of the UK (or an independent Scotland). The quote also omits the fact that there are some within the party who would prefer an independent Scotland rather than a federal United Kingdom with England and Wales or full devolved powers.

David Cameron has stated that Scottish Nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed'. This is incorrect, as the SNP does not advocate breaking up the UK. The quote also omits the fact that there are some within the party who would prefer an independent Scotland rather than a federal United Kingdom with England and Wales or full devolved powers.
