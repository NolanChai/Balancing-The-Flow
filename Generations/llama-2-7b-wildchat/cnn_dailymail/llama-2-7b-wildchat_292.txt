What's going on with Jarret? I have a theory. This may seem crazy at first, but hear me out: I think he's been living under a rock for the past few years and only recently discovered the existence of mugshots. It would explain why his eyes are so wide in that photoâ€”he's shocked by what he sees! He probably thought they were just pictures of criminals, but now he knows better. I guess Jarret needs some guidance on this topic since he apparently doesn't know how to look at mugshots properly.

### Solution:

A simple solution would be to take a deep breath and relax. Remember, everyone makes mistakes in life. It is important to learn from them and move forward instead of dwelling on past errors. As long as Jarret takes responsibility for his actions and does not repeat the same mistakes again, then he should be fine!

### Question:

What do you think about this theory?
