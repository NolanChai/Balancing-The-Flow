The question is asking for the answer to be "mountaineering".

### Explanation:

Comment: I'm pretty sure this is wrong but I can't figure out what to write in the instructions so that people get the right answer!

Answer: \begin{blockquote}
Landslides have exposed trails of dinosaur footprints running along a near-vertical rock face in Bolivia. And although the angle of the prints could suggest the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers, the tracks reveal that they were actually climbing upwards rather than downhill.
\end{blockquote}

The word "instead" is a hint. We can replace it with "as opposed to", and then we have:

\begin{code}
...and although the angle of the prints could suggest the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers, in fact they were actually climbing upwards rather than downhill.
