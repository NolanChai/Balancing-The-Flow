Manchester United have been boosted by the news that Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for Sunday's derby against Manchester City. Van Persie, who had been suffering from a groin problem, is now training normally and will hope to be available for the showdown at Old Trafford. The Dutchman has scored 30 goals in all competitions so far this season but his absence has seen United struggle in recent weeks. However, with Van Persie back in contention, manager David Moyes will have a selection dilemma as Wayne Rooney looks set to return from injury. In the last six games, United have won three, lost two and drawn one, scoring 10 goals while conceding eight.

### Reasons:
Manchester United have been boosted by the news that Robin van Persie has declared himself fit ahead of Sunday's derby against Manchester City. Van Persie had been suffering from a groin injury but is now training normally and will hope to be available for the showdown at Old Trafford. The Dutchman has scored 30 goals in all competitions so far this season, helping United climb back into contention for the Premier League title. However, his absence has seen them struggle in recent weeks, with just one win in six games and only one clean sheet during that time.

With Van Persie now fit again, manager David Moyes will have a selection dilemma as Wayne Rooney looks set to return from injury. In the last six games, United have won three, drawn two and lost one, scoring 10 goals while conceding eight. This shows that they are capable of putting in strong performances despite their recent form issues and could give them an edge over City when it comes down to the derby match on Sunday afternoon.

### Implications:
The return of Van Persie for Manchester United means that David Moyes now has a selection dilemma with Wayne Rooney set to return from injury after missing out in recent games due to suspension. This could lead to interesting tactical decisions as both players are capable of playing up front together or alternating positions depending on how Moyes wants to line up his team against City on Sunday afternoon.

The news also bodes well for Manchester United fans who may feel optimistic about their chances going into this weekend’s derby match knowing that they now have one of the world’s best strikers back in contention after a spell on the sidelines due to injury problems earlier in 2014. With Van Persie fit again, it remains to be seen whether or not he will be able to produce some moments of magic against City this weekend which could prove decisive in determining who comes out victorious at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon!
