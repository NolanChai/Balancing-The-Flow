The Chelsea U19 side stormed into the UEFA Youth League final following a 4-0 mauling of Roma in the semis. After a tense and goalless first half, midfielder Charlie Colkett's deflected shot broke the deadlock before a second from Billy Gilmour. Chelsea captain Fikayo Tomori put them further ahead shortly after and substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi sealed the win with a fourth goal late on. With both sides looking to secure their first UEFA Youth League title, it promises to be an exciting finale in Stockholm.
