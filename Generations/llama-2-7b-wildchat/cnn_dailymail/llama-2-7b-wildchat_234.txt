There may have been a few disgruntled lap swimmers at Bondi on Thursday. 
The daily visitors to the iconic Icebergs Club were forced to take their exercise back to the beach as their beloved pool was drained for maintenance.

"I just found out it's closed, I've been coming here every day since the beginning of Covid and they gave us no notice," said 21-year old Aaron Yuen. "They could have put a sign up or something."

But despite the inconvenience for regular swimmers, there were plenty who turned out to see what the fuss was all about.

"It's a pretty unique opportunity, I love seeing stuff like this," said 25-year old Matt Banks. "I can't even remember if they ever close it, so when I heard about it, I just thought I have to get down here."

And for one local swimmer, it was the perfect chance to complete a little race she had planned. 
"It's my birthday today and I said to myself I gotta go for a swim," 60-year old Linda Dodd explained. "So I came down here with my friend and I thought we might as well do a lap."

With the pool drained, there was no stopping anyone from taking a dip - even if it was in the frigid waters of the summer season.
"It's freezing," said 24-year old Emma Bragg after her quick dip. "I don't know how these guys do it."

But for many, this unconventional swim wasn't about braving the cold or achieving a personal best. It was simply an opportunity to be part of something special - and appreciate one of Australia's most iconic landmarks from a different perspective.
"I think you just gotta embrace it," said Matt, who took the opportunity for a quick snorkel. "It doesn't happen often, so you might as well get in."
As the sun set over Bondi, there was no doubt that this was an experience that will be remembered by all those who braved the cold - and reminded them just how lucky we are to have such a beautiful part of our city on our doorstep.
