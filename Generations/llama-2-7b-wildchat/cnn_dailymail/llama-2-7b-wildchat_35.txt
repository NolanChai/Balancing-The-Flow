Manchester United will be forced to wear Nike kit during their summer tour of America this year after confirming that they would not have any official teamwear sponsorship on their jerseys.

The club confirmed the news in a statement, which said that adidas had “withdrawn” from its role as the Manchester United's "official kit manufacturer”, but that Nike will be stepping up to fulfil its duties while the deal is being finalised for next season.

It was also confirmed by the club that this would extend beyond the current 2014/15 season, with adidas still having a two-year sponsorship left on their deal to manufacture and supply the official kit of Manchester United from July 1st 2014 until June 30th 2016.

Nike are the current sponsors of Real Madrid and Chelsea, as well as other big clubs in Europe such as Bayern Munich and Juventus. It is not clear whether any deal will be announced before Manchester United's pre-season tour to America but it is believed that Nike would want to promote themselves at this time after being snubbed by the Red Devils.

What does Nike do?
