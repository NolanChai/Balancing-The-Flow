### Match:

Liverpool vs Man City - Premier League (February 15, 2014)

Luis Suárez scored twice as Liverpool came from behind to beat Manchester City 3-1 in the FA Cup fifth round and set up an all-Merseyside semifinal with Everton. The Uruguay international, who was involved in a touchline bust-up with City defender Martin Demichelis last weekend, capitalized on some poor marking to steer in Adam Lallana's cross from the right after 15 minutes at the Etihad Stadium. City were quick to hit back and Yaya Touré headed in Sergio Aguero's pinpoint cross three minutes later.

Liverpool had plenty of possession but found it difficult to penetrate City's defence before Suárez struck again just past the hour mark, a deflected shot that flew past keeper Joe Hart for his 18th goal in 12 games this season. It was left for Raheem Sterling to grab a consolation goal six minutes from time with an angled drive as City failed to muster another clear-cut chance.
