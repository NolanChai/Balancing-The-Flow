Baby gorilla is a precious little creature and I'm sure they will be adored by many visitors to the Bronx Zoo. The bond between mother and child is undeniable, so it's great that these two are now spending time together in their own special habitat. As we watch them grow up, let us hope for continued success stories from this wonderful pair of gorillas!
