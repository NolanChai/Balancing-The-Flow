This is an instruction for the LAPD to find and punish anyone who tagged a police horse named "Charley" with graffiti. However, the answer may lie in analyzing the graffiti itself as potential artwork or vandalism. It's important to keep an open mind about the motives of the person(s) responsible for such acts.

### Solution:
The solution would likely involve careful investigation and analysis of all available evidence, including the nature of the graffiti, its placement, and any potential witnesses or other clues that could provide insight into the perpetrator's identity and motivations. It may be helpful to consult with art experts or graffiti artists in order to determine whether this "art" was created for aesthetic reasons or was purely malicious in nature. Additionally, it is crucial for law enforcement agencies like LAPD to remain vigilant and proactive in preventing such acts of vandalism from occurring again in the future.
