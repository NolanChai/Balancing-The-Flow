"Hi," said the officer, "I'm sorry for the inconvenience."

Hollinshead told him that he was trying to help an elderly lady who needed medical attention. He said she wasn't a relative and that she had gotten out of her car after it broke down on the highway. The woman asked if Hollinshead could take her home, so they stopped at a gas station to get her medicine.

The officer told Hollinshead he couldn't just give him money for the parking ticket since it was against department policy. But the officer said he would be able to park anywhere in town as long as there wasn't an emergency on duty. He wished him luck and told him to take care of himself and his passengers before they left together.
