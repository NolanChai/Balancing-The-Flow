>This decision by Morrisons supermarkets is a step forward for inclusivity and diversity in Britain, where there are many different cultural traditions and beliefs among its citizens. By offering a halal-only pick and mix counter, Muslim customers will be able to enjoy the same experience as everyone else without having to worry about whether or not their chosen sweet contains alcohol or other non-halal ingredients. This move shows that Morrisons understands the needs of its customer base and values inclusion above all else. It also demonstrates how important it is for businesses today to cater to a wider range of preferences and religions, creating more accessible spaces where everyone feels welcome.
