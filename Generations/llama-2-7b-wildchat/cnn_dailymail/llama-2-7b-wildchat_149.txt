This is a great idea! I think it would be awesome if you could share some thoughts on how your experience with reading through the Bible impacted you spiritually. What stood out to you? Did anything surprise or challenge you? How has your understanding of God and His Word changed since then? And of course, we'd love to hear about any interesting moments from along the way! ðŸ™‚
