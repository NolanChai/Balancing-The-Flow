CNN's article talks about a refugee from Eritrea named Daniel whose journey took him through Africa, Libya and onward towards Europe. He spent days and nights in the Sahara desert with little food or water but he was willing to risk everything because he believed his life would be better once he arrived in Europe. After making it through Libya, where many people had died due to harsh conditions like drowning at sea during attempted boat journeys, Daniel finally reached Italy by foot along the dangerous route known as the "road of death." The article concludes that while Daniel's journey was not easy or pleasant at times, he feels like his life is better now because of it.
