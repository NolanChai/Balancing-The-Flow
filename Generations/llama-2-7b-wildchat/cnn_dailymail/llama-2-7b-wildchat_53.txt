Lee was born on May 15th of 2001. He had been in school for only five months when he was killed in June of 2011 by his classmate Matthew Raymond. The two boys were six years old at the time of the murder. They lived next door to each other and played together often.
On the day Lee died, he had gone out to play with some friends around 1:45pm while their mother was cleaning up lunch dishes in her kitchen. Matthew waited until everyone else went inside before walking over to where Lee stood near a tree behind one of his friend's houses. Then without warning or explanation, Matthew hit him once across the head with an unknown object.
