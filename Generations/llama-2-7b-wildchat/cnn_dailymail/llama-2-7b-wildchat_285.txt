A report on BBC news says that the 2018 Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) commission has urged governments to start encouraging consumers to eat more insects. This is because they are an environmentally-friendly alternative protein source, which also provide health benefits. In fact, eating insects would be a good alternative for the world to meet the increasing demands of meat in the future. The FAO has estimated that if everyone on Earth were to eat 30 grams of insects per week (roughly two standard-size cookies) it could cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 1.5 billion tonnes a year, which is equivalent to taking about half the world's vehicles off the road. It would also reduce food waste because farmers will not need to grow as much crops for livestock feed or meat production. This means that they could use their land to produce more food instead, helping to address global food security issues.
However, there are some concerns about how people may react when it comes to eating insects. A lot of them might find the thought of consuming crickets, mealworms or cockroaches repulsive because they're used to associating these creatures with filth and contamination. In addition, there is also an issue over whether people would actually be willing to eat insects at all since they might view them as something less desirable than other meat alternatives like fish or chicken which are seen as more "prestigious" food items on our plates.
It remains unclear what kind of impact introducing insect-based diets into mainstream culture will have on people's appetites for conventional meats like beef and pork over time though one thing seems clear: if we want to solve some key environmental issues around global warming then perhaps changing how we view certain food items could help us find solutions down the line.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, eating insects might not seem appealing to most people at first but they can provide a valuable solution for meeting our growing demand of meat in the future while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global food security issues. However, it will take time before people get used to consuming these creatures as part of their diet so we need to continue educating ourselves about these potential benefits in order to make informed decisions on how best to meet our nutritional needs going forward.
