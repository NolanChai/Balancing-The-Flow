[This is a great opportunity to have students think about what it means for evidence to be "new" (i.e., new to the court) or "old."
The following instructional questions are adapted from the Criminal Investigation Instructional Framework (CIIF, available at https://cjpc.berkeley.edu/resources/frameworks). The framework is a tool for teachers to use in planning and teaching investigative scenarios:
1) Describe the evidence used by the prosecution that was new information in the grandmother's case. (Students should list the type of evidence, e.g., DNA, blood stain analysis.) 2) Explain how this new evidence supports the prosecution's claim about the grandmother's guilt or innocence in her husband’s death.
3) Describe the evidence used by the defense that was old information in the grandmother's case, e.g., testimony from the first trial (where she was acquitted of murder). 4) Explain how this old information supports the grandmother's claim about her innocence in her husband’s death.
5) In your opinion, is it reasonable for a judge to overturn an old conviction based on new evidence? Why or why not?]
