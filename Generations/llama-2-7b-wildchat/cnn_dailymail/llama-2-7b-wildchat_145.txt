A driver who ran off after being stopped by police was eventually caught by officers after they chased him around a roundabout at high speeds. Yassir Ali, 29, was pulled over on the A468 in Cardiff on October 17 last year as he drove an old red Ford Focus.

The car's windscreen wipers were not switched on and its lights were not working properly as officers tried to stop Ali for a routine traffic check. He was seen "driving erratically" during the chase, according to South Wales Police. The chase continued down Cardiff Road before heading towards Roath Park Lake where Ali drove around the lake at high speeds while officers followed behind in their police cars.

As Ali made his way up a slip road and onto the A4054 Western Avenue, he drove off from the traffic police, but was eventually caught after being pursued for four minutes. He had driven a total of 2.8 miles during the chase as he failed to stop for officers on three occasions, according to South Wales Police.
Ali pleaded guilty at Cardiff Magistrates' Court last month and received two points on his driving licence, fined £70, ordered to pay £65 costs, plus a £34 victim surcharge. He was also disqualified from driving for 12 months, with the ban reduced by three quarters if Ali completes a course approved by the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) before March next year.
