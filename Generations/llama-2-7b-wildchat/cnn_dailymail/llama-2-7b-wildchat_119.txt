[I]t’s not unusual to find bodies that have been submerged for over a decade, particularly along the Gulf Coast where salt water tends to preserve them.

In this case, the body was found in 80 feet of water and it had decomposed considerably. But even at that depth, it’s unlikely that the body was submerged all these years. It would have floated to the surface for a time before being re-submerged again.

So the question becomes when did Kitty drown? There are several possibilities:

1) The family may have been visiting Texas during Hurricane Carla in 1961, which caused extensive damage along the Gulf Coast and submerged large portions of land under water. It’s possible that Kitty was caught up in one of those floods and drowned, or her body got carried away by currents.

2) Kitty may have fallen into the marina and been swept away by a strong current, leading to her death from drowning. This could be due to carelessness on behalf of her parents, who were busy working at their jobs while she played nearby without supervision.

3) Kitty may have had an accidental fall into deep water and been unable to swim back to shore because it was too far away or because she couldn’t catch her breath underwater long enough to make it there safely before succumbing to drowning.

4) Lastly, Kitty could have been kidnapped by someone who wanted to silence her and later discarded her body in deep water as part of their plan—this would explain why no one knows what happened after she disappeared nearly 60 years ago!
