### Explanation:

The answer is (A).

The passage describes a young man who had been shot twice at point-blank range and was impressively polite and bright in the eyes of his boyhood teachers, an encourager of his college friends. He was a docile captured killer in the care of paramedics tending to his gunshot wounds as they wheeled him away to the hospital, where he would be kept overnight for observation.

To rewrite the underlined part, we first identify the key noun and verb phrase of the sentence: "docile captured killer" modifies "him", which is a singular pronoun referring to this young man in the passage. Therefore, the correct answer should start with the singular form of the verb: "He".

Next, we need to provide a subject complement that agrees in number and gender with the verb "was": "he" (singular masculine). To ensure consistency with the rest of the sentence, it's important to use the same tense ("were kept overnight") as the verb "were."

Finally, we need to add the necessary information in this particular sentence. We want to express that he was impressively polite and bright in the eyes of his boyhood teachers, an encourager of his college friends. This is why the correct answer includes two clauses: "in the care of paramedics tending to his gunshot wounds" and "as they wheeled him away".

To summarize, the correct response is (A): "He was impressively polite and bright in the eyes of his boyhood teachers, an encourager of his college friends. He was a docile captured killer in the care of paramedics tending to his gunshot wounds as they wheeled him away to the hospital, where he would be kept overnight for observation."
