7. A woman who suffered seven miscarriages has spoken of her distress after a family friend stole the money set aside for her babies' grave stone. The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jersey show to share the sad story with viewers. Dawn had saved up £500 for a headstone to mark the burial spot of the children she lost at various stages in her pregnancy. But when she returned home from work one day, she discovered that her 24-year-old daughter, Emily, had taken the money without telling her. 'When I came through the door Emily was sitting there smiling and saying how much fun it was to have £500 in the bank,' Dawn said. 'I told her I'd saved up that cash for a headstone for my babies.' But the following day when Emily withdrew the money from their joint account, Dawn found out she had been lied to. The 39-year-old was devastated and told viewers how upsetting it had been to find the money missing. 'I went into a very dark place for days,' she said. 'Emily kept saying that I needed to let go of the past, but all I wanted was my babies' gravestones. It felt like they were forgotten. Dawn explained how Emily was not aware of her plans to save up for the headstone and had been left feeling distraught about what she did. 'I don't know if it would help now, but I would really like to make a fresh start,' she added.
