I'd love to see Messi and Cristiano play together for a while. I think it would be fascinating as I don't know if either of them have ever had a true rival on the pitch who pushes them to be better. They are both great players but not even one player has pushed them to be their best on the pitch. That is what a good rival does, and Ronaldo was an excellent rival for Messi, in that he constantly tried to get under his skin. But Cristiano is never going to play with Messi, as they don't share the same agent.
