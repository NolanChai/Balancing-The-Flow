team had gone 80 minutes and 62 phases without giving away a penalty before the referee decided to award one for a late tackle on Juan de Jongh after he had scored his side's second try of the game. It was a mistake, but it cost Wasps the match as they were forced into playing with only 14 men when the score would have been locked at 23-all. Instead, the game finished 26-23 in favour of Toulon.
