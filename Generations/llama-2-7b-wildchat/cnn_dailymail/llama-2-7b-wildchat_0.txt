(G) If you're talking about the recent "Revolution" that started with Occupy Wall Street and has now spread like a wildfire throughout America, I believe it was quite revolutionary in the sense of an entire generation coming together and saying enough is enough.
However, I do not believe there will be any overthrow of government or major changes to the American political system as a whole. Most people simply aren't interested in revolution, they're interested in reform.
The "revolution" that took place was more like a protest movement and an awakening. It was a reminder that this country isn't perfect; it never has been and probably never will be. But we are still the greatest nation on earth and we can work to make it better through peaceful means such as voting, getting involved in politics or simply raising our voices.
I think what makes me optimistic is the realization that Americans do care about things like fairness and equality. We aren't going away anytime soon; instead, I believe these revolutionary ideas will continue to grow stronger until they become a force too great to ignore. So no, not quite yet, but someday perhaps there may be another "American Revolution".
