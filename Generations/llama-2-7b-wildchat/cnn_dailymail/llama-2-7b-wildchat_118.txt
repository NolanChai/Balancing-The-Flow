1. Lewis Hamilton (Mercedes) 68 . 2. Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) 55 . 3. Nico Rosberg (Mercedes) 51 . Nico Rosberg was brooding, his face stony, his eyes fixed on the middle distance and his fingers interlaced across his chest. A week ago he would have been celebrating with a champagne shower and a round of back-slapping in Maranello but now he was here, alone in an empty Mercedes garage as the team worked furiously to repair his car after its latest dramatic retirement. He had every reason to be frustrated, even bitter. After all, it was Valtteri Bottas who had won this race for him by virtue of a late-race collision between Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen - a collision that had not only cost Vettel the win but also his place in the title fight. It seemed incongruous that Rosberg should be here, sulking alone while Bottas partied with teammates, friends and family back at the hotel. But he was here, and it was time to talk about what had happened.
