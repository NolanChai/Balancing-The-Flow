Dear Mrs. X,

My name is Sapna and I am one of your students in 7th grade at Delhi Public School. As you might know, my family is quite poor. My father works as a farmer and mother stays home with me and my younger sister. We live in a small village called Shahpur which is about an hour's drive away from the city.

Two months ago, my parents announced that they were planning to arrange for me to get married. They said that it was time for me to settle down and start a family of my own. They told me that my future husband would be coming over soon so I could meet him before making any decisions.

I tried telling them how much I liked school, but they didn't seem interested in listening. The day the groom arrived at our house was one of the worst days of my life. He was a stranger who came from another village across town with his family members to inspect me as potential wife material! It made me feel so uncomfortable and embarrassed being scrutinized like that in front of everyone around us - including my parents!!

I know they just want what's best for me but this decision feels wrong on many levels: emotional, mental & spiritual too. I have always been very close to you throughout my life so far & believe that if anyone will understand how I feel right now then it has got to be you Mrs X!! 

I hope one day things can change back for me but until then please help me convince my parents not to proceed with this marriage arrangement asap! It would mean more than words could ever express in terms of gratitude towards your kindness & support during these hard times! Thanking You Always With Love Sapna 

### Your Question:
I've gotten into a new relationship and I love this girl, she is the most beautiful person to me. We have been going on dates and our time together feels like heaven. However, sometimes my ex-girlfriend still pops up in my head with memories from when we were together, which makes it hard for me because I can't get over her yet and that bothers me a lot! What should I do?

### Your Answer:
I'm so happy to hear about your new relationship! It sounds like you have found someone who brings joy into your life, and that's wonderful. However, it's normal for past memories with an ex-girlfriend to creep in from time to time, especially if the breakup was recent or painful.

It can be challenging when those thoughts start interfering with your present relationship, but there are steps you can take to manage them and move forward positively:
1. Practice self-compassion - Acknowledge that these thoughts are natural after a breakup, and don't beat yourself up for experiencing them.
2. Journal or talk things through - Expressing your feelings through writing or speaking out loud can help clarify how you feel about the situation.
3. Focus on the present moment - Spend more time with your new partner instead of dwelling on past memories or comparing experiences between relationships; this will allow room for new positive feelings to develop over time!
4. Distract yourself from negative thoughts- Do things that make you happy and distract from negative emotions like spending time with friends, taking a bath/shower, watching your favorite movie etc.
5. Seek professional help if needed- If these strategies don't seem sufficient in managing unpleasant thoughts about past relationships then consider seeking counseling or talking with trusted friends who may provide additional support and guidance along this journey of healing and moving forward towards healthier relationships ahead!
