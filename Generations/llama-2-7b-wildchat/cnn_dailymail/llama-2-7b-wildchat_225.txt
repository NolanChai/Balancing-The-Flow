The article "Cancer treatment breakthrough" published by the BBC, tells us about how researchers have discovered a way to use viruses to treat cancer. This article is informative and interesting for many reasons. It explains in detail what this virus does, as well as how it can help improve cancer rates among those suffering from them. The study was conducted on mice, but the researchers are confident that humans will benefit from these results too. They believe their new technique has potential to be used by medical practitioners all over the world so we do not have to lose anyone else due to this deadly disease anymore!

### Evaluation:
The article is well-written and easy to understand. It does not use any jargon or technical terms, making it accessible for people with no previous knowledge about cancer treatment breakthroughs like myself. This article gives me hope because I know there are things being done in order to fight against this disease which affects many lives every year so hopefully one day soon we will be able to cure all types of cancers completely!

### Reflection:
The researchersâ€™ findings are exciting as they provide an alternative treatment option for cancer patients. The virus does not attack healthy cells, only those affected by tumors and this means that the immune system won't be compromised during therapy which could lead to side effects or complications after surgery when fighting against these diseases too often has left people feeling sick with severe fatigue afterwards because their bodies were so weak from chemotherapy sessions alone.
