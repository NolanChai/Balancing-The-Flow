The Arizona man who suffers from an extreme case of the tumor disorder in which his body is covered with non-cancerous lumps said that she finally got a sense of belonging to the group. Bob Heslip 50 years old suffers from Neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1, a genetic condition in which benign tumors grow along the nerves anywhere throughout the body.

The man also has another skin condition called cutaneous neurofibroma. This skin tumor is mostly found on his face. He said he started to grow these lumps when he was 8 years old. They grew so large that they have covered about 90 percent of his body. The lumps can cause him a lot of pain and they also make it difficult for him to move freely.

Heslip's NF1 has left him disabled. He said it took away everything from him except for his family and friends who support him through the good days and bad. His wife, Angie Heslip, has been by her husbandâ€™s side since she first met Bob when he was a teenager with the disease.
