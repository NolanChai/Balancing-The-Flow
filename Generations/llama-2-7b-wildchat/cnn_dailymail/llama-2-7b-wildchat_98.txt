The reigning Barclay's premier league champion Manchester City is preparing to make a massive bid for England's Liverpool striker, Raheem Sterling on the day when the transfer window reopens.

The city plans to launch an aggressive offer that will try to force Sterling into signing a new contract at Anfield. The 20-year-old forward has been linked with a move away from Merseyside in recent months, and his current deal expires next summer.

If Liverpool do not accept the mega bid from City, then they risk losing their star player for free in just over six months time. So far this season Sterling has scored eight goals in 28 appearances for Jurgen Klopp's side and he is expected to be a key part of England's World Cup squad next year.

The reigning Barclays premier league champions Manchester City are planning to table an offer on the day the transfer window reopens for Raheem Sterling, as they look to keep hold of one of their star players. The 20-year-old has been in fine form this season, scoring eight goals in all competitions and providing six assists. He is also a regular starter for England at international level.
City's interest in retaining Sterling's services comes after Liverpool were linked with a move for him during the summer transfer window. The Reds were reportedly prepared to offer up to £30million for his signature, but it now appears as though Pep Guardiola's side are ready to go all out to keep their prize asset at the Etihad Stadium.
Sterling's future has been in doubt ever since he turned down an extension on his contract with Liverpool last year. The former Queens Park Rangers player is said to be keen on playing Champions League football, and that ambition could yet take him away from Manchester City before next season begins. However, for now at least it looks as though the reigning Barclays premier league champions are going to try everything they can to keep hold of their prized asset.
The reigning Barclay's Premier League Champion Manchester City is planning to table a mega-bid for Raheem Sterling on the day that the transfer window reopens. This comes as a surprise move from Pep Guardiola's side, who have been linked with several other strikers over the past few months.
Sterling has been in fine form this season and has already scored eight goals in all competitions for City. The 20-year-old is also set to represent England at next summer's World Cup finals in Russia, which could prove tempting to Liverpool fans who have seen their side falter since Jurgen Klopp took over from Brendan Rodgers in October 2015.
If City do manage to secure Sterling's signature before the deadline then it will be an impressive feat by Guardiola - who has already strengthened his squad considerably this summer with the signings of Alexis Sanchez, Bernardo Silva and Riyad Mahrez among others. It remains to be seen how much Liverpool are prepared to let their star player leave for but they may now have no choice if City persist in their pursuit.
