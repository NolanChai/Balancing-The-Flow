I think this is a very difficult question to answer because we don't know what Gael Monfils could have become if he had focused on tennis rather than other things. There are too many variables at play here for us to say definitively whether or not he would have been one of the greatest players ever, but it seems like his potential was high enough that anything is possible.

### Clarification:
Gael Monfils' career has had a lot of ups and downs, but there's no doubt that he's one of the most talented players on tour right now. He has all the tools necessary to become great—a big serve, powerful groundstrokes, and fantastic movement around the court—but it's up to him whether or not he wants to dedicate himself fully to tennis. If he does, then anything is possible!

### Explanation:
Gael Monfils has the potential to be one of the best players ever if he decides to focus on tennis full time and works hard at improving his game. His talent level is already high enough that it's conceivable for him to achieve great things in this sport, but only time will tell whether or not he makes it happen.
