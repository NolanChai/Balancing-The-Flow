bit different, but that doesn’t mean he still isn’t recognisable in his neighbourhood.

It has been 18 months since his last game for Hibs - at Celtic Park when he was sent off after kicking out at Scott Brown - and the striker has been on a journey to rebuild his career ever since, including a spell training under the watchful eye of Arsene Wenger.

He is still based in Edinburgh’s Leith, where he lived with his grandmother during his time as Hibs player-coach before moving into his own flat, and when he can he enjoys taking his son to the park or just going for a walk to get away from his phone.

There was one instance in which Griffiths thought someone had spotted him but it turned out that person had just seen an old photo. He said: ‘I’m still recognisable, there are certain places around Leith where I go and you don’t hear people shouting my name or anything like that but I definitely get a few nods and smiles from people when they see me.
‘Sometimes it can be quite surreal going into the local shop or cafe because obviously it was one of those things for a long time where you just didn’t want to go out too much, especially at night-time.
'When I first moved back home I definitely wasn’t going anywhere, but after that I got a few looks and I realised people still knew who I was.
‘I was in the local cafe the other day and they were playing football on TV and I saw one of my old Hibs team-mates – Anthony Stokes – come on for his club side Shakhter Karagandy, so I got a few smiles from people as they knew who he was.
‘You still get that feeling where you are maybe wearing an old Hibs top and someone says “I remember when you played at Easter Road”. I just hope people don’t mistake me for anyone else because I know one person did once and it was really embarrassing!
'He said: “Hey Griffiths” and I asked what he wanted. He said he had seen an old photo of me, so I said the same thing could have happened to him if he didn’t recognise who he was speaking to.’

Griffiths has been known for his occasional outbursts on social media - most notably when he shared a video of himself wearing a Celtic top and drinking in a pub.

The forward said: ‘I do still go into the local shops, cafes and bars but I have to admit I’ve become quite an introverted person since all this has happened, so you definitely won’t see me at any football matches around Edinburgh or Leith.
‘I know it sounds a bit strange, but being away from the game has made me realise just how much I missed being involved in football and there have been times when I miss going into the pubs for a few drinks with mates after training on a Friday night.’

Griffiths is due to take part in a charity match for Hibs fans at Easter Road next month. The game, which will see former players play against current Hibs stars, has been organised by supporters who want him to return to the club where he scored 80 goals in 153 games.
He added: ‘I’m looking forward to it and I definitely plan on being there on the day. It was a great experience playing against former players from other clubs last year, so if I can get some game time under my belt then that would be a perfect way to prepare for pre-season.'
