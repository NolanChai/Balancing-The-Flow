The Tesla Model S P85D's 'insane mode' may be fast, but a new electric car by Drive eO is set to be even faster. The Latvian firm is currently developing a one megawatt electric race car to compete in Formula E, an all-electric racing series which will launch next year.
The Latvian company has not officially announced its vehicle yet but the car's specifications have been confirmed by several sources, including its own website. The Drive eO prototype is estimated to have a range of around 200 miles (321 km) per charge and is expected to produce over one megawatt in power output.

The car will use a high-powered electric motor that has been designed specifically for the vehicle, which should make it more efficient than the standard Model S P85D. Drive eO's prototype will also feature an aerodynamic bodywork and lightweight chassis design, both of which are designed to help maximise performance on the track.

The company behind the project is hoping that its new electric car will prove popular with racing fans who want a fast and reliable vehicle without having to make compromises when it comes to power or efficiency. If all goes well, Drive eO's prototype could soon be competing against some of the most advanced race cars in the world at Formula E events next year.
