Myuran was sentenced to death, however due to his mental health issues and pleas from the international community he was eventually granted clemency by Indonesian president Joko Widodo and transferred to Kerobokan Prison in Bali where he began rehabilitation with other prisoners. After a 12 month sentence, Chan and Sukumaran were transferred back to jail in Kerobakan to await their executions.
