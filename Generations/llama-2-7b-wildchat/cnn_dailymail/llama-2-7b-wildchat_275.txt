- The IRS is facing a budget crisis that has forced it to cut back on customer service and technology modernization efforts. As a result, its phone lines are overloaded, leaving many taxpayers frustrated.

### Solution:
- The IRS needs to find ways to improve its phone system and increase funding for customer services. This could include investing in automated systems or hiring more staff to handle calls. Additionally, the agency should provide additional online resources and tools to help taxpayers file their returns without having to call.
