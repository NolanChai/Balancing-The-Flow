This is a good example of a press release that could have been better written. The information is too long and takes more than 10 seconds to read, the quotes don't really make much sense at all, and it seems as though the writer didn't spend much time formatting this correctly. The main issues are:
-Too many paragraphs. This is a press release, not an article or a story, so it should be one paragraph. You can also break down smaller paragraphs into shorter sentences for more readability.
-Way too long! This press release takes more than 10 seconds to read and the journalist won't even give it that much time before moving on to another pitch. The best ones are around a paragraph or two max, so this one is way too long.
-Too many quotes. This isn't really necessary for a press release unless they have something important to say which could add value to the story. In this case, there doesn't seem to be any good quotes in here that would make people want to cover this event. 

### Rewrite:

Rory McIlroy put his golf clubs away as he battled with Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan to promote new football concept Circular Soccer. The Northern Irishman and the actor, who both hail from Belfast, were filmed playing against each other in a unique match that saw them use no goalposts or nets and instead kicking the ball around a circular field of 20 by 60 metres with no corners or traditional football rules.

McIlroy, who recently announced he would be taking an extended break from golf to focus on his family life after a tough year in which he split from girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki and lost out on winning major tournaments at The Masters Tournament and US Open Championship, was clearly enjoying himself during the event.

"It's great fun," said McIlroy. "I love football so this is right up my street." He added: "We don't have to worry about goals or corners, it just makes for a more exciting game of footie."

Dornan also seemed pleased with the new sport and said he would definitely consider taking part again. "This is amazing," he said. "I can see why Rory likes it so much - I've never played football like this before!"

Circular Soccer was created by entrepreneur Ryan Dunn who wanted to bring something different to the world of sports and give people a new way to play football. He plans on bringing Circular Soccer events all over Northern Ireland in coming months, hoping that it will catch on among local residents as well as visiting fans from across Europe who are looking for something unique during their trip here.
