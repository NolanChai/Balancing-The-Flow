A merry widow from Edinburgh who loves to party the night away dancing on tables admits her lifestyle is a far cry from her own grandparents.  
Pat Ingles, 69, remembers her grandmother sitting by the fireside in their home in Glasgow while Pat's mother was out working in a factory. 
The great-grandmother of six now says she has a much happier life than most of her family - because she can afford to live it up after retiring.  
She said: "I never went dancing with my grandparents but I've always loved socialising, going out and having a good time. 
"My mum was working in the factory while we were kids but now when she comes home from her job at a care home, she has nothing to do."  
Pat met her husband John Ingles when they both worked for British Rail before moving to Edinburgh. They had four children together and enjoyed family holidays abroad. But when he died in 2017 aged 86 Pat was left with no pension after only working part-time as a dinner lady.  
The grandmother of eight now enjoys socialising at pubs, clubs and restaurants around the city - often dancing on tables to keep herself fit. She said: "I don't have my husband anymore and he used to pay for everything. 
"But I try not to think about it because I can afford to live like this and there are worse situations."  
Pat says she has no regrets in life - but wishes she had a bigger pension pot so she could enjoy her old age even more than she does now. "My grandparents were working all day, every day. 
"I was working in the factory too but I didn't have to put my kids through school like they did."  
The retired dinner lady has spent years supporting charities and volunteering at her local hospital. She says she loves meeting new people and is now planning a trip to Thailand with her daughter next year. 
"I just want to keep living the life I'm living," Pat added. "It might not be traditional but it's my choice."
