He said it was only meant to be a "joke" - and that it was meant to be satirical, not serious. But the Tories have claimed it proves he was too 'incompetent' to be Chancellor. The 2003 note - dubbed the 'red top' by critics because of its colourful language - was leaked in August last year and is a scathing assessment of Labour's economic performance under Gordon Brown, including:
- We have borrowed more than every government since the Second World War put together.
- In 15 years we will still be borrowing money to pay for the pensions of people who have never worked for us and are not entitled to it.
- By 2013/14, Britain's budget deficit will exceed 7% of national income - which is more than twice as big as Greece's.
- Public spending is rising faster than tax revenues at a time when the economy is growing slowly. The result is that public debt is forecast to increase from £421bn in 2002/03, to £571bn by 2006/07 - which means more interest repayments and increased pressure on our finances.
- By 2007/08 debt will reach over 40% of national income compared with 39% in 1997 when Labour came to power - putting us higher than many countries with low incomes such as Turkey (40%).
- By the end of this Parliament, we will have spent £500bn more on welfare payments and public services than we planned.
- The Government's own forecasts show that our borrowing will still be rising in 2013/14 - by which time we will have borrowed almost as much money to meet the demands of interest repayments, social security and health care alone. This is equivalent to around £85bn for every year from now until then, or 6% of national income.
- In 20 years, Labour has doubled the amount we spend on education (to almost £50 billion a year) - but not doubled our pupils' results in exams and tests, so we have failed to give today's children the education they deserve.
Mr Balls said: 'It was meant as a joke.' But he insisted that Mr Brown had been right to be fiscally cautious in 2003 because the economy was not doing well and there were fears of recession. In response, Conservative shadow chancellor George Osborne said: 'This admission by Ed Balls proves he's too incompetent for No11.'

### My answer:
Ed Balls has been accused of treating the public with 'contempt' after dismissing as a 'joke' the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances. The shadow chancellor said t

The 2003 note was not a joke, it was a serious document which contained information and analysis of the country’s financial situation at the time. Mr Balls’ dismissal of the document as a “joke” shows a lack of understanding and respect for the issues at hand. This is concerning, especially in light of his potential to become Chancellor if Labour returns to power.

While it may be true that the economy was not doing well when the note was written, that does not excuse the fact that the Labour government failed to manage public finances effectively. It also shows a lack of foresight and planning on behalf of the government at the time. A competent Chancellor would have recognised the warning signs and taken steps to avoid the situation we are in today.

It is important that politicians take responsibility for their actions, even if they do not agree with what was written in a particular document. Mr Balls’ dismissal of the note as a “joke” shows a lack of accountability and a willingness to sweep problems under the rug rather than address them head-on. This is a concerning attitude that should be taken into consideration when evaluating his suitability for leadership positions in government.

In conclusion, while it may have been meant as a “joke”, the Labour note admitting their failures in managing public finances was not only serious but also contains valuable information and analysis of the country’s financial situation at the time. Mr Balls' dismissal of this document as a "joke" shows a lack of understanding, respect and accountability for these issues and raises questions about his ability to lead in government.
