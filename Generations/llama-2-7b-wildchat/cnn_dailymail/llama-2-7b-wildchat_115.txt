Liverpool will continue to pursue their interests with BVB striker Ciro Immobile as they search for a potential target in this transfer window. Liverpool are showing interest in Immobile, who has struggled at times since joining Borussia Dortmund from Torino last summer. However, the 25-year-old is still a highly rated player and could be an excellent addition to Jurgen Klopp's squad.
Immobile has scored just six goals in all competitions this season for Dortmund, which is far below his best form. He will likely need a change of scenery if he hopes to recapture his previous form in Italy with Torino and Lazio before moving to Germany last summer. Liverpool have struggled up front at times this season, so adding another quality striker could help them close the gap on Manchester City at the top of the Premier League table.
