Ciro Immobile is a good player. But I am afraid that there might be other clubs looking to sign him too. So if we do manage to get him it would be difficult for us to keep him long-term unless we can improve on the pitch. We already have lots of players at Liverpool so maybe it's not worth wasting time on someone who isn't even playing regularly right now?
