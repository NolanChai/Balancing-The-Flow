These people are known as "cloggers" (the plural of "clogger"), and there's a group dedicated to them on Facebook, called "Holy Mother Of Cloggers".
It was started in 2011 by a woman who simply wanted to vent her frustration at seeing the same friends and their babies on her news feed day after day. The page now has over 4,500 members, each one sharing their own "clogger horror stories".
The group is tongue-in-cheek, but it also serves a valuable purpose: It's a safe space for people to express their annoyance with the overwhelming amount of baby updates on Facebook. In a world where we are constantly connected and bombarded by information, it can be refreshing to vent our frustrations in a place where others understand exactly what you mean.
So if you're sick of seeing your friend's babies clogging up your news feed, don't worry - there's a whole group out there who feels the same way. Join "Holy Mother Of Cloggers" and share your own stories of baby overload!
