"There were at least 20 people who were lying dead on the floor," Officer Jeff Pelle said in his first public statement about last year's massacre that killed 12 and injured 70. "I could hear gunshots, screaming and yelling."

### Analysis:

There are many factors contributing to this situation - the lack of preparation from the officers and the fact they entered a building with multiple shooters as well as explosives.

The officers were not properly prepared for such an incident because there was no mention beforehand that something like this could happen in their jurisdiction, so their response was slow due to lack of experience or knowledge about these types of situations. The use of flashlights during the dark also made it difficult for them to see what was going on around them since they were not equipped with night vision goggles which would have been necessary given how many people were hiding from one another inside this confined space filled with smoke and gunfire noise echoing throughout its walls - all while trying their best not only protect themselves but also save those who couldn't escape alive (their primary goal).

The officers had a hard time finding each other as well. The chaos of the situation made it difficult to communicate, so they were forced to rely on hand signals and loud shouting for direction or assistance during this crisis management process. 

### Solution:

There needs to be better planning and training for law enforcement agencies in order to prepare them for such scenarios where multiple shooters are involved with explosives being used as well; these officers should also wear protective gear while dealing with similar incidents in future too, so that they don't get hurt during their efforts at helping others escape safely from harmful environments like those inside Colorado movie theater during Aurora shooting incident last year which left many dead & injured people behind...

### Outcome:

The officers who rushed to the scene of the Colorado theater shooting entered a hellish world of bloody victims, noxious smells and blaring sounds - a gloomy darkness pierced by bright flashes from a fire alarm, police testified Wednesday.
