I think the manager is more focused about winning the games rather than about lineups because he knows that a lot of factors are involved in choosing lineup (players fitness level and injuries), so itâ€™s not something he can do from day to another, but every week he has a specific plan. It depends on the coach how much time he spends thinking over his choice for lineup.
