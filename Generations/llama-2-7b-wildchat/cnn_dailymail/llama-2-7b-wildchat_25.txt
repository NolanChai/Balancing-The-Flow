I am saddened to hear that a Briton jailed in Burma for using an image of the Buddha to promote his bar has been 'abandoned' by the Foreign Office, according to human rights campaigners. Phil Blackwood was sentenced to two-and-a-half years imprisonment last year for displaying a picture of a naked woman with her back turned on a bar wall. The human rights lawyer Phil Shiner described his case as an "absolute disgrace" and said he had been left without support from the Foreign Office. Blackwood was released in January after serving six months, but is now appealing against the sentence. His supporters have accused the British Embassy of ignoring him for over a year since being arrested by Burmese authorities on 25 April 2017.
