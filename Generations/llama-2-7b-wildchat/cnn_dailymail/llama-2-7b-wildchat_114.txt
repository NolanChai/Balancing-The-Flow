Nearly 200 protesters gathered at Union Square Park and started the march. They then walked through Lower Manhattan, past One Police Plaza – where the NYPD's headquarters are located - before reaching Foley Square in front of City Hall. During the march, protestors carried signs with messages such as "Hands Up Don’t Shoot" and shouted chants like: “Black lives matter”.

The NYPD reported that at least 34 people were arrested during the demonstration for various offenses including unlawful assembly, disorderly conduct and obstruction of government administration. A spokesperson said that several arrests had been made on charges related to vandalism or assaulting officers.

The NYPD's Chief of Patrol Terence Monahan stated that he was proud of the way his officers handled the protest, which he described as “peaceful”. He went on to add that while there were no major incidents during the march, some participants did engage in "destructive behavior".

The NYPD's response to Tuesday night’s demonstration was praised by Mayor Bill de Blasio who tweeted his support saying: “Thank you to our protestors for exercising your First Amendment rights peacefully & for raising critical issues around racial injustice”.
