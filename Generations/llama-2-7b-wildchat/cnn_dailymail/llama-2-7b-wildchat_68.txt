1. This season was very tense especially for teams like Bournemouth, Burnley and Hull City. The race of relegation was extremely close until the last day. In fact, if you take away Swansea’s victory against West Ham United in their last match then this would have been a disastrous weekend for all the 3 teams that were involved in the relegation battle and Swansea would have dropped to the bottom of the table. It was an important game for them because they had to win it, so as not to end up relying on others, which is never easy. However, the team did it and in fact they managed to get a great victory which put their fate back into their own hands. So after this game all three teams were only separated by 2 points with Burnley being closest to safety as they had 40 points whereas Bournemouth had 36 points followed by Hull City who had only 34 points, so it was an extremely tense moment for those two last teams. In conclusion, although it looks like Sunderland are safe because they have already secured their place in next season’s Premier League but still there is always a small chance that things may go wrong due to bad results from other teams involved in relegation battle so they should be careful and try not to underestimate anyone.

2. As for Sunderland, they were not only safe but had also secured their place in next season’s Premier League and this was mainly thanks to a great run of form that began around November time when they managed to win 10 out of the next 16 games which allowed them to build up an enormous amount of points (48). The most impressive part about it was that during these 25 matches there were only three losses so basically they didn’t lose many games overall which meant they remained competitive throughout this period even though some teams around them started losing form which led to their eventual downfall.

### Relevance:
This season will always be remembered as one with many twists and turns due to its unpredictability especially when it comes to relegation battle where everything could have gone wrong at any moment even though most people expected teams like Bournemouth, Burnley or Hull City would stay up but surprisingly they all stayed safe despite being involved in this battle for almost 90% of the campaign. Therefore this season proved that anything can happen in football which makes it even more interesting and exciting to watch as we never know what will happen next!
