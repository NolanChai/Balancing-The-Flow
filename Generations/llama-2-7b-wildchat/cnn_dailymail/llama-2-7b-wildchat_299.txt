The first two sentences of this question are almost exactly the same. The original version of this question had been answered correctly by one student, and also has a correct answer that is consistent with both sentences. The student who had answered it incorrectly in this question simply added more information into the question - "after falling from the upper floor" should not have appeared anywhere in the question after the sentence "The popular  graduate fell to his death".
