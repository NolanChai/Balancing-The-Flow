The study found that eating a handful (40g) of peanuts a day was linked to a significant reduction in food poisoning by E. coli, the most common bacteria responsible for foodborne illnesses. Researchers found that this amount of peanuts provided antibiotic effects against the bacterium.

Eating peanuts can help improve gut health and increase our bodyâ€™s ability to ward off bugs like E.coli, according to a new study. The study suggests that eating 40 grams of peanuts daily may significantly reduce the risk of food poisoning caused by E. coli bacteria in adults and children over six years old.

Peanuts are an excellent source of healthy fats, protein, antioxidants, fiber, and other vitamins and minerals such as folate and potassium. They also contain resveratrol which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties that may help reduce inflammation in the gut lining which could lead to better digestion overall. In addition, peanut consumption has been linked with lower cholesterol levels due to its high unsaturated fat content compared with saturated fats found in other sources like red meat or butter.

### Conclusion:
Therefore, including a handful (40g) of peanuts into your daily diet may help improve gut health while providing protection against food poisoning from E.coli bacteria by improving digestion and reducing inflammation within the body's internal lining system. It is recommended that adults consume 1oz or two tablespoons of dry roasted peanuts per day for maximum benefit without exceeding their caloric intake limits for healthy weight maintenance goals over time; this amount would equate to approximately 40g or one handful based on typical nut measurements across brands sold in grocery stores worldwide today.
