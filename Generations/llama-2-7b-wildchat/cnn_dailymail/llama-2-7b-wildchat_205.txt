Write a program that determines whether Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison for accepting gifts from a wealthy donor while he was a U.S. Senator. 
Your program will take in two parameters, the first will be the amount of money (in thousands) received by Senator Robert Menendez from a wealthy donor ($860 thousand), and the second parameter will be the number of years that the senator should face in prison if he is found guilty (15).
Your program should determine whether or not Senator Robert Menendez should receive 15 years in prison for accepting gifts from a wealthy donor while he was a U.S. Senator. If your program returns a true value, then it indicates that the senator should face 15 years in prison for his actions; otherwise, if your program returns a false value, it will indicate that he should not receive jail time.

### Notes:
- This problem is inspired by the real case of Senator Robert Menendez and his involvement with a wealthy donor (Dr. Melgen) in Florida, which resulted in charges for bribery and other corruption allegations. 
- You can use any programming language you prefer to solve this problem; however, your program should be written in English and include clear descriptions of your code's functionality. 
- Your program should only consist of one function that takes two parameters (in thousands) as inputs and returns a boolean value indicating if the senator should face up to 15 years in prison for accepting gifts from a wealthy donor while he was a U.S. Senator.
- Your output should be clear, concise, and easily understandable by anyone reading your code. 
- Remember that your program must follow proper programming practices such as proper indentation, formatting, and correct variable naming conventions.

### Examples:
Example of a successful solution with the correct return value:
```
function shouldPrison(amountReceived: number, years: number) {
  if (amountReceived >= 1000 && amountReceived <= 99999) {
    if (years === 15) {
      console.log("Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison!");
      return true;
    } else {
      console.log("Senator Robert Menendez does not need to face any jail time!");
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```
Example of a failed solution with an incorrect return value:
```
function shouldPrison(amountReceived: number, years: number) {
  if (years === 15 && amountReceived >= 1000 && amountReceived <= 99999) {
    console.log("Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison!");
    return true;
  } else {
    console.log("Senator Robert Menendez does not need to face any jail time!");
    return false;
  }
}
```

### Test cases:
Test case 1:
amountReceived = 860,000, years = 15
Returns true because Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison for accepting gifts from a wealthy donor while he was a U.S. Senator.
```
function shouldPrison(amountReceived: number, years: number) {
  if (amountReceived >= 1000 && amountReceived <= 99999) {
    if (years === 15) {
      console.log("Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison!");
      return true;
    } else {
      console.log("Senator Robert Menendez does not need to face any jail time!");
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```
Test case 2:
amountReceived = 1, years = 15
Returns true because Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison for accepting gifts from a wealthy donor while he was a U.S. Senator.
```
function shouldPrison(amountReceived: number, years: number) {
  if (years === 15 && amountReceived >= 1000 && amountReceived <= 99999) {
    console.log("Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison!");
    return true;
  } else {
    console.log("Senator Robert Menendez does not need to face any jail time!");
    return false;
  }
}
```
Test case 3:
amountReceived = 200, years = 15
Returns true because Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison for accepting gifts from a wealthy donor while he was a U.S. Senator.
```
function shouldPrison(amountReceived: number, years: number) {
  if (years === 15 && amountReceived >= 1000 && amountReceived <= 99999) {
    console.log("Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison!");
    return true;
  } else {
    console.log("Senator Robert Menendez does not need to face any jail time!");
    return false;
  }
}
```
Test case 4:
amountReceived = 860, years = 15
Returns true because Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison for accepting gifts from a wealthy donor while he was a U.S. Senator.
```
function shouldPrison(amountReceived: number, years: number) {
  if (years === 15 && amountReceived >= 1000 && amountReceived <= 99999) {
    console.log("Senator Robert Menendez should face up to 15 years in prison!");
    return true;
  } else {
    console.log("Senator Robert Menendez does not need to face any jail time!");
    return false;
  }
}
