These are really great photos! I love all the close-ups of California's beauty. The photos are well edited for this project; there is no color tint or other enhancements. You have clearly used Adobe Lightroom to edit your photo collection, and you also chose some well composed shots.

I noticed a few minor things that could use improvement:
1) When composing these images, consider cropping them to exclude distracting elements in the frame. These photos tend to include distractions like power poles or telephone lines near the edge of the frame. You can crop out those parts and have more interesting photos!
2) Sometimes, you use a zoom lens for some shots but keep a wide angle on other shots. This creates an uneven look when compared to your other images that are all shot with similar focal lengths (like 18mm, 24-70mm). I would recommend keeping the same focal length or at least sticking to one of those two lenses.
3) Another thing you might consider is adding a photo filter in post processing. For example, you could use the presets that come with Adobe Lightroom. You can find some examples below:

I hope this helps! Keep up the great work! :)
