A: I understand that you have been contacted by Air Canada regarding the incident involving your grandmother's flight from Germany to Toronto last night. Unfortunately, we were forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland due to an 87-year-old passenger causing a disturbance on board. We would like to assure you that she was safely removed and placed under arrest for causing a public nuisance.

We are committed to ensuring the safety and wellbeing of all our passengers, which is why we had to make this unfortunate decision. Despite this unforeseen circumstance, we appreciate your patience during this incident, and we apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused you.

In the meantime, if there are any updates regarding her situation or flight arrangements, please contact Air Canada directly at [phone number] or visit their website [airline's website].
