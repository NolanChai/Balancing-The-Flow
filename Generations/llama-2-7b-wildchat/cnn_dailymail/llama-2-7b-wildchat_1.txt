The baby-faced boy is really a teenager who lives in Memphis, TN. He has 8364 followers on Twitter and his pictorial updates of "gang life" include guns, drugs, money bags, and even dead bodies. While some may find these images disturbing or glorifying violence, others admire the teen's entrepreneurial spirit as he sells merchandise inspired by his lifestyle on Instagram under the handle @YOUNG_BALLS. Despite being just 16 years old, "Young Balls" is already living out a dream that many young people aspire to: becoming successful through hard work and dedication. He hopes one day he will be rich enough to buy his mom a house.
