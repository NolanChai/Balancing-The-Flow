### Explanation:
A: The given sentence indicates that Esperanza Base on the northern tip of Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature o in Argentina, which was its highest temperature ever observed on record. This information supports the notion that Antarctica has experienced its highest temperatures ever seen. The response should explicitly mention how this information is related to the given sentence.
B: The given sentence provides evidence of Antarctica experiencing its highest temperatures on record. The response should explain in more detail what temperature was recorded at Esperanza Base and why it is significant.
C: The given sentence only states that meteorologists believe Antarctica has experienced its highest temperature ever seen, which does not directly indicate whether or not the base had experienced a change in temperature itself. The response should provide additional context about this statement by connecting it with other evidence from the passage or question stem.
D: The given sentence mentions only one aspect of weather conditions in Antarctica - record-high temperatures - without providing any other details such as changes in precipitation levels or wind speed etc., which are necessary for making an accurate prediction about future weather patterns there. As such, this response option does not accurately address the question asked in part (b).
