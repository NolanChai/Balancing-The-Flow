More than 25 women have been airlifted from Royal Navy ships because of pregnancy. One ship - HMS Ocean – even had five pregnant sailors removed in emergency "medevacs" during the last nine years, according to figures released by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The disclosures will pile pressure on ministers ahead of a Commons debate on women serving at sea.

The Royal Navy says there is nothing unusual about its approach but Labour MP Sarah Champion has raised the issue with Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and called for action. "If you have to medevac people, it suggests that either conditions on board are not ideal or you should not be sending them out at all," she said. The figures show 26 women were flown home from HMS Ocean in Portsmouth during the last nine years because of pregnancy-related illnesses.

It means they had to be taken off the ship, which is used for amphibious warfare and training. A further nine women from two other ships - HMS Illustrious and HMS Dauntless – were also medevaced during the same period because of pregnancy-related illnesses. In all cases, the Royal Navy says, the women returned to their duties after giving birth.

One woman was taken off HMS Ocean when she went into labour early. A further three women were transferred from Illustrious and Dauntless as part of "routine" medical evacuations in 2012 and 2013, according to the MoD. It said 1,859 women served on Royal Navy ships during that time – an average of around two per ship at any one time. The Ministry of Defence said HMS Ocean, which carries a crew of 679, was designed "with special consideration for female sailors".

It said it would not comment on individual cases but added: "All women who join the Royal Navy are medically and physiologically screened before entry to ensure they are fit enough to undertake their role." But Labour MPs said the figures showed that having pregnant women serving at sea was unsafe.
