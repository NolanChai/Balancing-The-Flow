to admit that his diet is making him put on weight and he's trying to slim down before the Rio Olympics in 2016. 

"I am getting bigger, I don't want to get bigger," Bolt told reporters after winning a third world title in Beijing last month. "When you eat that type of food [like] KFC and McDonalds and all that stuff, it's not good for the body. But at the same time, I love food." 

Bolt's weight gain is due to his eating habits, which are more of a problem than the food itself. A report from USA Today in February found he has gained as much as six pounds since the London Games two years ago and now weighs just shy of 190 pounds â€” not far off his peak weight during 2008 when he ran his then world-record time for the 100m.
