The Metropolitan Police have faced heavy criticism after failing to respond to an alarm during the Hatton Garden heist, which netted robbers up to £14million of jewellery from 73 safety deposit boxes in April last year. 

Three men were arrested on Monday but police said they had no evidence that would link them with the heist. 

The Metropolitan Police has come under fire after it failed to respond to an alarm during the £200million Hatton Garden jewellery robbery, in which up to 14 people could have been involved.  

The dramatic footage shows how the gang returned twice in three days to continue their audacious heist after being forced out by police cordons on April 6 last year 

Dramatic footage has emerged of the Hatton Garden jewellery robbery, revealing how police had been called twice during the daring £200million heist before finally responding.  

In the first clip, a man wearing a balaclava can be seen running from the building shortly after 2am on April 6 

Police have now admitted they received an alarm call just hours earlier at 11pm on April 5 but failed to attend and the alarm was never investigated.  

In another clip, which appears to show police being forced out of the building by a man in balaclava who had returned later that morning, officers are seen talking

Two men, aged 59 and 75, were arrested at a flat on Friday after detectives raided the address in east London with 20 other properties across Britain as part of Operation Magpie. 

They have been questioned about their links to another robbery committed during the same weekend last year - an assault which left a man with a broken jaw in Southall, west London.      

The Met Police has now faced calls from campaigners for victims of crime and even ex-officers to be forced to pay out compensation totalling millions due to their failure to respond to the alarm. 

Detectives have said they believe between ten and 14 people were involved in the Hatton Garden raid, which is thought to be one of the largest jewellery heists ever.

An investigation into whether the crime was covered up by the police and could have involved a senior officer has been launched 

However, police are refusing to answer questions about how many of those arrested last year in connection with the raid are still under investigation.      

On Thursday it emerged that police could be forced to pay out compensation due to their failure to respond to the alarm during the heist, which netted robbers up to £14million of jewellery from 73 safety deposit boxes. 

An investigation into whether the crime was covered up by the police and could have involved a senior officer has been launched by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC).  

It has also emerged that one of the men arrested last year on suspicion of being involved in the Hatton Garden heist is from London, although police would not confirm his whereabouts.  

Two other suspects have been identified as 75-year-old William Lincoln and 59-year-old John Collins - both from Essex - who were arrested on Friday at a flat in Stratford, east London.     

On Monday, another man aged 64 was questioned after he returned home to his north London house where he lives with his wife. 

He was detained over suspicions that he may have been involved in the break-in at a commercial security firm based in Hertfordshire, which is thought to be linked to Hatton Garden.

The Metropolitan Police said they had no evidence that would link the three men arrested on Monday with the Hatton Garden robbery 

All three have been released without charge.  

On Wednesday, the IPCC said it was investigating whether the Metropolitan Police had failed to properly investigate and respond to a burglary alarm at Hatton Garden jewellery store the previous weekend in April last year. 

It also launched an investigation into how a senior officer could have been involved in a possible cover-up of the heist, which has been described as one of the largest ever carried out on British soil.   

The alarm at Hatton Garden was raised on April 5 but no officers attended and police were forced to respond to the same premises just two hours before the robbery took place at around 3am on Saturday morning.     

They said: 'We are investigating whether any crime prevention and investigation opportunities have been missed by the Met Police Service during the burglary alarm incident in Hatton Garden, London.'   

The Metropolitan Police has faced criticism for failing to respond properly to an alarm raised at 11pm on April 5 last year.    

It is understood that a senior officer may have been involved in a possible cover-up of the heist after evidence was given to Scotland Yard by a security guard who had attended the site shortly before the raid took place. 

He told detectives there was nothing suspicious at Hatton Garden jewellers and police are now investigating whether this may have been part of an attempt to cover up the crime.    

His evidence emerged after the Met launched an investigation into the alarm call following a complaint by a witness, who claimed she had spoken to police officers at the scene on April 5 last year.

In April last year police were forced to raid dozens of properties linked to the £200million Hatton Garden robbery after being tipped off by an informant.  

Three men, aged 75, 56 and 49, were arrested on Friday at a flat in east London as part of Operation Magpie, which saw officers raid addresses across the country.   

All three have been released without charge after police said they had no evidence that would link them with the heist.     

Detectives searched a total of 20 addresses across England and Wales last week as part of their ongoing investigation into Hatton Garden.

Police have said that none of those arrested are being held under terror laws, but they would not confirm their ages or nationalities.  

They also refused to disclose if any of those arrested were still being questioned over their links to Hatton Garden.     

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'The Met is working with partners including the CPS and other forces across England and Wales on Operation Magpie, which has been launched in response to information received from an informant about possible people connected to the Hatton Garden burglary.

'The operation continues.'   

On Monday night a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We have no evidence that links these men with any crime.'     

He added: 'We continue to work closely with our partner organisations in Operation Magpie which is ongoing.'  

Three of the four men arrested at Hatton Garden jewellery store were released without charge on Thursday. 

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'None of these men are being held under terror laws and their ages and nationalities have not been confirmed due to police policy in line with Section 29 (1) (a) of the Terrorism Act 2000.'   

It has now emerged that one of those arrested is from Essex and the other two are aged between 56 and 75.
