"Hi, this is an emergency," the anonymous caller begins. "I think I am calling about a child neglect situation. There's a little girl walking around alone on the streets of Silver Spring. I have no idea where her mom or dad are. And she has no shoes and it's cold."
### Question:
How long does the caller stay on the phone with dispatch?
