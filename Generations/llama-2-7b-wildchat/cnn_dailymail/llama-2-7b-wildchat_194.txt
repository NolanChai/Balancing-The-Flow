The new terminal will be named Daxing International Airport which is scheduled to open in 2019. The airport has been designed by Chinese architect Zaha Hadid, and is predicted to be able to handle 72 million passengers each year once it's fully operational. The airport will not only service domestic flights but international ones too.
The new terminal will feature a 'Sky City', an urban complex comprising hotels, retail shops, restaurants and office space with connections to the airport via a high-speed train. This means passengers won't have to go through the hassle of transfers between cities or airports.
The airport is being built in Beijing’s suburb of Daxing which will take around 90 minutes to drive from downtown. The site has been chosen due to its central location and proximity to highways, as well as nearby transport links. It also offers plenty of space for expansion.
Beijing International Airport currently handles more than 86 million passengers per year (2015 figure) making it China's second busiest airport after Shanghai Pudong. The new terminal will be able to accommodate an additional 30 million passengers per year, bringing total annual capacity up from 40% currently at 90%.
### Explanation:
The world’s biggest and most luxurious Chinese tourism project is set to open its doors in the capital of China. Beijing Daxing International Airport will be completed by 2019, making it one of the largest airports globally with a capacity to handle up to 75 million passengers each year.
The terminal building itself has been designed by renowned architect Zaha Hadid and is estimated at over $8 billion investment; an increase from its original $3.6 billion budget due to inflationary cost increases since construction began back in 2014. The new terminal will feature modern facilities like automated check-in kiosks, self-service baggage drop counters and high-speed elevators.
