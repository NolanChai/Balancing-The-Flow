The contestant, named Avi Gupta, was asked by Alex Trebek to provide an appropriate response to the following clue: "This is the only time of life when you don't feel like yourself." To which he responded with a very disturbing answer, suggesting that it should be related to puberty.

### Contextual Analysis:
While Avi Gupta did provide an answer for the question, his response was inappropriate and left viewers shocked by its implication. Puberty is an important stage of life where teens experience physical changes that can often be confusing and difficult to understand. It's crucial that this sensitive topic is handled with care and respect, especially on a national TV show like Jeopardy!

### Critical Analysis:
Avi Gupta should have recognized the potential harm in his answer and should not have been so cavalier about such an important developmental stage. It's not funny to suggest that puberty is associated with feeling "not like yourself" or having a "bad time." This type of comment can lead to stigmatization and misinformation, potentially causing more harm than good for young viewers who are already going through this stage in their lives.

### Recommendation:
As someone involved in public life and entertainment, Avi Gupta has a responsibility to ensure that his words do not cause additional harm or distress. It's important that we take seriously the impact of our actions on others and work towards creating an inclusive culture where everyone can feel safe and respected.

### Conclusion:
Avi Gupta should have chosen his words more carefully when responding to a question about puberty on Jeopardy! His answer was not only inappropriate but could also cause harm, leaving viewers shocked by its implication. It's crucial that we prioritize the sensitivity and well-being of our youth as they navigate this important stage in their lives.
