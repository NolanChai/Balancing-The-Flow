<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Ed Miliband today rushed to Scotland to try to shore up his hope of becoming Prime Minister as a damning poll showed almost half of Scots are ready to back the SNP. The Labour leader used a speech in <span class="Apple-converted-space">Dumfries</span> yesterday to claim he could be part of an 'incredible team' that would lead Scotland, as he insisted his party is on course for victory in next year's election. He said: 'I am 100 per cent behind Scottish Labour winning the next general election and forming a Labour government.'</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">But his speech was overshadowed by an exclusive poll for The Mail on Sunday which found that almost half of Scots (49 per cent) would rather back the SNP than Labour. Only 37 per cent said they would support Miliband and his party if he became Prime Minister.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">The survey comes after a series of setbacks for Mr Miliband in the run-up to next year's general election. It also adds to concerns among Labour MPs that their leader is failing to connect with voters.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">A YouGov poll for The Sunday Times found that only 27 per cent of those questioned said they believed Mr Miliband was up to the job of being Prime Minister. Only one-in-five respondents thought he would be a good leader.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">In the Scottish poll by Survation, 49 per cent said they would rather have an SNP government led by Nicola Sturgeon than one made up of Labour, Liberal Democrats and Green Party MPs. Just 37 per cent opted for Mr Miliband's party.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">The survey also found that 49 per cent of respondents in Scotland believe the SNP is best-placed to handle the Scottish economy. Only 35 per cent thought Labour had the best plans.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">The poll also found that Mr Miliband's personal ratings in Scotland are low compared with his main political rival Nicola Sturgeon. Forty-seven per cent of Scots said they had a positive view of Ms Sturgeon while only 14 per cent gave him the thumbs up.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Mr Miliband's speech yesterday focused on his party's plan to introduce a Â£7billion 'rainy day fund' of unspent cash. It would be used in the event of an emergency such as a recession or a banking crisis.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">He also claimed Labour would make Scotland 'more attractive' for businesses by cutting corporation tax and promising to reduce the burden of red tape on firms. But in a sign of his party's problems, he was forced to cut short his speech after being pelted with eggs.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Asked about the poll's findings on Sunday, Mr Miliband said it was not 'the be all and end all'. He added: 'We will fight for every single vote in Scotland. We are not going to take anything for granted.'</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">But the findings came as Labour MPs grew increasingly concerned about Mr Miliband's leadership after he suffered a string of electoral setbacks and failed to connect with voters.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Former Home Secretary Alan Johnson said the party would 'fail miserably' in next year's general election unless Mr Miliband improved his leadership credentials. The veteran MP told Sky News: 'The problem we have got is that the Tories and Lib Dems are out there fighting it out, while Labour is not.'</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Mr Johnson added: 'There is a leadership vacuum at present. I don't think Ed Miliband has yet got his own narrative of what he is about. He has had some good wins, but there are other things that have gone badly wrong. And on those occasions he has been outflanked by David Cameron.'</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">The Mail on Sunday poll found that the SNP was now viewed as the most trustworthy party in Scotland and the best-equipped to manage the economy. Just one-in-five Scots said Labour had the best policies for managing the nation's finances.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Labour is trailing behind the SNP and Lib Dems in opinion polls ahead of next May's general election. But the Scottish results suggest that Labour's fortunes would be even worse if it were not for the presence of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">The findings follow a disastrous few weeks for Mr Miliband, who has suffered from a series of poor performances during TV debates and a lacklustre response to the Scottish independence referendum.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Last weekend's poll found that almost half of Scots (49 per cent) thought Mr Miliband was out of touch and that his party was 'not fit to govern'.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">The survey also showed that while two-thirds of people believed Scotland is better off in the United Kingdom, a majority thought that its economy would be stronger outside. Only one-in-five Scots said they would vote to stay part of the UK.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">The findings came despite an overwhelming victory for David Cameron as he won the referendum campaign by pledging that the future of Scotland within the United Kingdom would be decided democratically.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Mr Miliband's speech in Dumfries was interrupted several times as a small number of protestors threw eggs at him. Some in the crowd also booed his attempts to praise Scottish voters for rejecting independence.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">Mr Miliband insisted that 'the people of Scotland are not out of step with the rest of Britain' and said he wanted to be Prime Minister so 'we can build a country fit for the future'.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">But his speech was drowned out as supporters booed and shouted at him when he insisted that Scotland's economy would be better under Labour.</p>
<p style="color: rgb(165, 85, 0);">He also faced a series of jeers when he said people in the UK were 'all united in saying no to independence'.</p>
