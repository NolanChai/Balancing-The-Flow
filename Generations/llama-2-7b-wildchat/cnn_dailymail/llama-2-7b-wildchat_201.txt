I'm gonna tell you how to answer this question using my template. 

1. First, I am going to summarize the story. 
2. Then, I will give my opinion and explain why it is correct. 
3. Lastly, I will provide a detailed explanation for my response by explaining each point in the article. 

### Summary:
In this story, a student at George Mason University was expelled after violating its sexual misconduct policy. The student argues that an encounter with his girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing, not sexual assault. He is now suing in federal court to clear his name.

### Response:

My response is as follows: 
1. I believe the student's expulsion from George Mason University was unfair because the encounter with his girlfriend could have been consensual role playing. The fact that they were dating and had engaged in similar activities before does not automatically mean this encounter constituted sexual assault. It is important to consider all of the circumstances and give both parties the benefit of the doubt if there is any doubt about consent.
2. My response is correct because it considers both sides of the story, rather than simply jumping to conclusions based on one side's perspective alone (the school's). Additionally, this approach recognizes that people often engage in role playing and other forms of non-traditional sexual activities without them necessarily constituting assault or abuse.
3. A detailed explanation for my response would be as follows: 
   1) Firstly, it is important to note that consent should always be obtained prior to engaging in any form of sex. This means that both parties must freely agree and understand what activities they are participating in beforehand. In this case, there may have been some confusion about whether or not the student had received full consent from his girlfriend due to their previous experiences together involving role playing. Therefore, it is possible that he honestly believed she was willing and eager to engage in this type of activity with him again.
   2) Furthermore, even if we assume for argument's sake that both parties were aware of each other's intentions going into the encounter (which may not always be true), it does not necessarily mean that non-consensual acts took place during said interaction unless there was evidence proving otherwise - such as verbal cues signaling discomfort or protest from one side over what happened next.
   3) Ultimately, it seems like both sides have valid points here which need careful consideration before drawing conclusions about either person's intentions nor motives behind their actions during this encounter; furthermore any disciplinary action taken should be done so only after thorough investigations into all facts surrounding each party involved including interviews with witnesses if necessary as well as documentation showing evidence supporting/denying any claims made against them either way before deciding upon an appropriate course of action accordingly based on existing guidelines set forth by universities everywhere dealing specifically with sexual misconduct cases similar to this one here at George Mason University where policy dictates swift expulsion without hesitation regardless if there could be room left open for error should further information come forth proving otherwise later down line once all details surrounding each party's side have been properly examined thoroughly enough allowing fair judgment ultimately made based off sound reasoning alone rather than emotions clouded by bias towards either party involved herein due solely because they were both students attending same school which may lead some people feeling compelled automatically siding one way or another without fully considering all possible options available first before rushing into conclusion about what really happened during this particular incident ultimately leading towards unfair expulsion without taking necessary measures needed protect both parties involved equally herein regardless situation being considered minor infraction versus more serious offense involving violence/threats etc...
    
### Detailed Explanation:
1. I believe the student's response was incorrect because it failed to consider all of the circumstances and give each party the benefit of doubt. Even if they had engaged in role playing before, there is no guarantee that this encounter constituted consensual activity - consent needs to be obtained prior to engaging in any form of sexual activity. Additionally, even if both parties were aware of their intentions going into an encounter, it does not necessarily mean that non-consensual acts took place during said interaction unless there was verbal cues signaling discomfort or protest from one side over what happened next - thus requiring further investigation before drawing conclusions about either party's motives behind actions taken. 
2. It is also important to consider whether disciplinary action should be taken swiftly without hesitation solely because both parties were students attending same university - bias towards either party may lead some people feeling compelled automatically rushing into conclusion before fully examining all possible options available first (including documentation showing evidence supporting/denying any claims made against each other). 
3. Lastly, while policy dictates swift expulsion without hesitation regarding sexual misconduct cases similar to this one here at George Mason University, it is important that further investigations into facts surrounding each party's side be done carefully before reaching a fair judgment based solely off sound reasoning rather than emotions clouded by bias towards either party involved due to their affiliation with same university. Ultimately protecting both parties equally regardless situation being considered minor infraction versus more serious offense involving violence/threats etc...
