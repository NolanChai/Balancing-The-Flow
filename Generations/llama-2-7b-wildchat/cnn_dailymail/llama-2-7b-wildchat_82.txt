“Mike will be out for another couple of weeks,” revealed O’Shea, who has been working with Brown since 2015 and believes he is a “phenomenal athlete” capable of playing in any position on the pitch. “The worrying thing about Mike, like all players who get concussed or have head injuries, it is just that you don’t know where they are with their rehabilitation. It is all about getting them back to a place mentally and physically that they feel comfortable being put into the game.”

### Response:

O'Shea has revealed his concern at the increasing force of rugby's collisions after Harlequins and England full back Mike Brown was consigned to even more time on the sidelines to recover from the latest high-profile head injury. The 33-year old was injured during Quins' defeat against Saracens in December, which led him to withdraw from England's squad for the Six Nations due to begin next month.
