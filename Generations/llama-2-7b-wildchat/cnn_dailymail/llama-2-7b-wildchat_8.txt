The idea of "Britishness" dates from the early Middle Ages, when Britain was still divided into a number of distinct kingdoms such as Wales and Scotland. The term "English" is older than that, having been used by the Anglo-Saxons before they were invaded by the Normans in 1066. But it wasn't until after the Norman Conquest that these words came to mean more than just a nationality or an ethnic group.

### Explanation:
As far as English is concerned, there has been a long-standing debate about whether the word refers specifically to someone who speaks one of two specific languages (English and Welsh), or if it can be applied broadly to anyone whose primary language is English regardless of where they live. There are different arguments for both sides of this argument; some believe that because most people in England speak only one language, then it would make sense for English itself to become the official nationality instead of being considered a dialect or accent within Wales or Scotland alone (although not all Welsh citizens agree with this view). Others argue against this notion by pointing out how many times over time various parts have been invaded by other nations - so much so that they could technically call themselves something different if they wanted too.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, the debate about whether being English means speaking English or not has been going on for centuries. It is difficult to find a consensus because of how many languages are spoken in England and the fact that people often identify with their regional dialect instead of the national language. However, there have been some attempts at creating an official definition for what it means to be English which will hopefully lead to more clarity over this topic.
