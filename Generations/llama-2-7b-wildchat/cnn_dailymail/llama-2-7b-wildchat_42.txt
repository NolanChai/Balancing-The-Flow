Thierry Henry has criticised Arsenal’s recent dealings in the transfer window, and has urged his former side to spend big and buy four players in the summer. According to Henry, Arsenal needs a top-quality goalkeeper, two world-class midfielders, and a centre forward to challenge for trophies. The Frenchman believes that these signings will transform the team into a title contender, but it remains to be seen if the club will heed his advice.<br/><br/>
<br/>
The Gunners have been underwhelming in their transfer business so far this year. After losing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette for free, Arsenal decided to spend £12 million on Gabriel Jesus from Manchester City. While the Brazilian will be a good addition to the team, Henry feels that the Gunners need more than just one player in the summer transfer window.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Henry has urged Arsenal’s hierarchy to sign a goalkeeper of world-class stature. According to him, Bernd Leno is not good enough for such an ambitious club and needs to be replaced with someone like Edouard Mendy from Chelsea or Rui Patricio from Wolves.<br/><br/>
In terms of midfielders, Henry believes that Arsenal should sign two top-class players. He feels that Granit Xhaka is a liability in the team and that Matteo Guendouzi has not proven himself yet at Emirates Stadium. The Gunners could look into the likes of Youri Tielemans from Leicester City or Renato Sanches from Lille, who are both available for around £40 million.<br/><br/>
In terms of attacking options, Henry believes that Arsenal need to bring in a top centre forward to challenge Aubameyang and Lacazette for the starting spot. The Frenchman has suggested that the club should sign Napoli’s Victor Osimhen or Real Madrid’s Luka Jovic as potential replacements.<br/><br/>
While Henry’s advice may not be heeded by Arsenal management, it is clear that they need to strengthen their squad considerably in order to compete for trophies next season. With the summer transfer window approaching, it remains to be seen if the Gunners will invest wisely and bring in the players they need.<br/><br/>

Thierry Henry has been a legendary figure at Arsenal and has won numerous trophies with the club. However, even Henry's opinion is not enough to convince Arsenal management on how they should spend their money in the transfer market.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Henry believes that Arsenal need to sign a world-class goalkeeper, two midfielders and a center forward. However, Arsenal have already invested heavily in the midfield department by signing Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid and Albert Sambi Lokonga from Anderlecht. Moreover, Arsenal are reportedly interested in signing Youri Tielemans from Leicester City as well.<br/><br/>
<br/>
In terms of goalkeepers, Edouard Mendy is an excellent choice but he might not be available for a reasonable price considering his recent performances with Chelsea. Moreover, Arsenal have already signed Leno and Ramsdale from Roma and Sheffield United respectively in the last two years. Hence, signing another goalkeeper doesn't seem to be a priority right now.<br/><br/>
<br/>
In terms of center forwards, Arsenal already have Lacazette, Aubameyang and Pepe who can play as strikers. Moreover, Nketiah is also an excellent talent that the club should promote rather than signing another player in that position.<br/><br/>
<br/>
In terms of midfielders, Arsenal might need to bring in another option considering the departure of Ceballos and Ozil. However, it's hard to imagine them splashing out on Tielemans who has only 18 months left on his contract at Leicester City. Moreover, reports suggest that the Gunners are also interested in bringing back Denis Suarez on loan from Barcelona as a backup option.<br/><br/>
<br/>
Henry might be correct about Arsenal's need to sign top-class players but it remains to be seen if they will heed his advice or go for different options in the transfer market. The Gunners have already strengthened their squad considerably with new additions and only time will tell if they need more reinforcements.<br/><br/>
