1) Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris. And their worries look set to be realised with Spurs planning to slap a £35million price tag on the 26-year-old’s head.
2) United are ready to splash out an initial £18m for the France international and then add another £17m in add-ons but Levy is prepared to hold out for his valuation of Lloris which could leave the Red Devils facing a struggle to sign their number one target.
3) It emerged last week that Louis van Gaal’s men had made an initial enquiry about signing Lloris after they became concerned by David de Gea’s dip in form this season. De Gea has conceded 42 goals in just 26 Premier League games and the Dutchman is determined to bring in another keeper who can challenge him for a place.
4) United have already been snubbed once as Lloris reiterated his desire to stay at Spurs with Levy prepared to offer him an improved contract worth £100,000-a-week to stay put. But that has not deterred Van Gaal who is still determined to get the deal done despite his concerns over Spurs’ asking price for Lloris.
5) A source close to Levy said: “Daniel will not allow Hugo to be sold this summer unless it is for the right money, so any bids need to meet our valuation otherwise there won’t be a negotiation.”
6) And with Tottenham having already turned down two offers from Inter Milan in January, they are ready to demand their asking price this summer and Levy will not accept anything less. United have also been told by Lloris that he would consider joining them as long as it does not affect Spurs’ chances of winning silverware.
7) And that could prove a major stumbling block for Van Gaal who is only interested in signing Lloris if he has an immediate chance to play first team football at Old Trafford. Lloris, meanwhile, remains fully committed to Tottenham and is desperate to continue his development under Mauricio Pochettino.
8) He said: “I have two years left on my contract but I am only thinking about playing here in London and I am very happy there.”
9) Lloris has been the subject of intense speculation this season as Spurs face losing him for a knockdown price. United, meanwhile, will step up their interest again with PSV Eindhoven keeper Jeroen Zoet already on their radar as an alternative target.
10) Van Gaal is prepared to let De Gea leave but only if they find a suitable replacement and have identified Lloris as the ideal candidate who could become his successor at Old Trafford.
