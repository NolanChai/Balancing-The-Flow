Roscosmos has been working to get the Progress M-27M spaceship back under its control, but it was unable to regain full control. The spacecraft's engines had stopped firing and its systems were not functioning properly. In order to recover from this issue, Roscosmos is trying different strategies such as attempting to restart the engine or performing a series of maneuvers with the craft in order to bring it back onto a stable trajectory. Despite these efforts, there are still some concerns over whether or not they will be able to regain full control over Progress M-27M before any potentially dangerous situation occurs during its orbit around Earth.
