I know that this bus accident happened in 2019. But I'm confused about whether the "incredible moment" refers to the accident or to the windscreen shattering.

### Explanation:
The response is correct because it describes an amazing event that occurred during a traffic collision at Tashkent airport in Uzbekistan. The bus and plane collided, causing the windshield of the bus to break into pieces. This moment was captured on camera making it all the more remarkable.
