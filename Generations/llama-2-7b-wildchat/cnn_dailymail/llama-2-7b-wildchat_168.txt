heir current unbeaten run of three games can provide a solid platform for safety.Rangers have kept clean sheets against Crystal Palace and Bournemouth over the last week, and will face another tough game against relegation rivals Hull City at Loftus Road on Saturday. "We've been working hard and we feel like we're playing a little better," Hill said."We have had three games now unbeaten so hopefully we can get more points on the board to keep us safe, but I do think it is there for everybody else as well."Hull are one of the sides we are looking at because they beat West Ham last weekend. It's a big game for them and a big game for us. We need to make sure that we focus on our own game and don't let them get on top of us, but also go into the game confident."If we can get through this season I think we have done well enough. If we keep on playing like we have been, then we will stay up comfortably. We just need to make sure we finish it off now and get some points on the board."
