This was the first time that such video had been shot during a spacewalk, and it took some trial-and-error to capture the action. The astronauts used an HD camera on the end of a boom arm, which was attached by hand via a tether to their suits. They also relied heavily on the ground crew's guidance for direction and angles - they couldn't see much through their visors!

### Analysis:

The footage provides an unparalleled view of Earth from space, allowing us to gain insight into what it would be like to explore outer space. It also highlights how fragile our planet looks when viewed from this perspective - just how tiny we are in comparison with everything else out there!
