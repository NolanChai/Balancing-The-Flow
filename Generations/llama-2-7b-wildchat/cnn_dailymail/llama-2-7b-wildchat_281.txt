- England captain, Alastair Cook has scored 143 runs at a healthy strike rate of 78.29 as he is well set to post his ninth century in the Caribbean.  The left handed opener has already amassed 500 run
s at an average of 83, in the two matches that he played against West Indies A.
- Cook was on course for a double hundred but was caught behind off Ronsford Beaton to end his knock which lasted 241 minutes and comprised of 23 fours and one six. England have batted well at the
Coolidge Cricket Ground, scoring over 600 runs in their first innings of both matches.  They will be keen to bat deep into this match too, as they are now playing with a new opening pair in Keaton Jennin
g and Joe Denly.
- The pitch at Coolidge has been conducive for batting, but it could also be a spinner's paradise if the wicket starts turning, especially on the last two days of the match when England will be fielding
.  So far, both sides have done well with their seamers and neither have given much away to the opposition batsmen.
- It was an outstanding spell from spinner Akila Dananjaya who finished with figures of 3/46 in his 20 overs. His wily off break has been a constant menace for the English batsmen and he also scalped t
he valuable wickets of Ben Foakes, Keaton Jennings and Joe Denly.
- It was a long drawn out spell but one that yielded rewards as Dananjaya kept bowling in different areas to the right handers and his leg spin proved effective on these pitches. The English batsmen
 were not able to deal with him and he bowled brilliantly.  His accuracy, variations in pace, and a hint of reverse swing has made it tough for England's batsmen to get used to the conditions.
- Meanwhile, Shannon Gabriel continued his impressive run by picking up two more wickets on this surface as he picked up the crucial scalp of Alastair Cook. His short and rising deliveries have been a
 constant nuisance for the English batsmen who haven't got to grips with them yet.  Gabriel has now taken 10 wickets at an average of less than ten in two matches which he played against England A.
- The West Indies bowling lineup is looking strong and it will be a challenge for the English batsmen as they are going to face some stern tests over the next three Tests starting with this one in Barbados.
