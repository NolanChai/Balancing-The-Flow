50.0 - 61.2

### Explanation:

Jonathan Trott's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful, as he was caught at first slip just three balls in. Trott last played a Test four years ago when he scored 285 against Australia at Lordâ€™s in what proved to be England's only success during their home summer.
