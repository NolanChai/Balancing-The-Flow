The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, which launched with Prince Charles as its first patron, has lost a legal battle with a Hollywood fashion company over plans to launch its own branded polo-style shirts and hats. The club had asked the High Court in London for an order that would prevent Los Angeles-based OGX from selling goods under their "Official Polo Club" name, arguing that it was unfair competition. However, Mr Justice Christopher Floyd ruled in favour of the fashion brand, saying that it did not cause confusion among consumers and its use of the term "polo club" was descriptive rather than misleading.
