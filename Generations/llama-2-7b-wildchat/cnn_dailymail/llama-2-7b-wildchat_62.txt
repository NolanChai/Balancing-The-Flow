In the passage, there is no instruction for me to find something on "planet w/o sun" so I can't start the task.

### Expected Answer:
I agree that the warmth of a sun has long been thought to be a key ingredient to life. But astronomers say 'rogue', sun-less planets that wander the stars could still harbour extra-terrestrials. While it sounds like an appealing theory, there are several factors to consider before we start getting our hopes up about alien life on these planets.

Firstly, these 'rogue' planets may not have any kind of star or sun to provide them with light and heat, making it difficult for any potential organisms living on the surface to survive long-term without another source of energy such as a nearby star. Secondly, even if these rogue planets do possess some kind of internal source of warmth from geothermal activity or radioactive materials within their cores; this may not be sufficient enough for any complex organisms living on its surface to thrive.

Furthermore, because we don't know much about what conditions are required for life (beyond Earth) it is hard to say whether these 'rogue' planets would actually be suitable environments for alien lifeforms if they existed at all. Although they could potentially provide shelter from harmful radiation or other environmental hazards present around nearby stars; ultimately there is no way of knowing until we explore further into space and find out more about our Universe!

In conclusion while it's fun speculating about alien lifeforms living on rogue planets without suns; at this stage there isnâ€™t enough evidence available yet for us confidently make such claims without further investigation first hand observations from space exploration missions further into deepest regions of our galaxy!
