Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao are two of the best fighters in the world. They have both achieved greatness, but behind them stand their wives - Melissa Brim (Mayweather) and Jinkee Pacquiao. While they may not always be in the spotlight, their roles as supportive partners help keep their husbands focused on what matters most - winning. 

Melissa has been by Floyd's side since he was just a teenager. She knows how to motivate him and keep him grounded when things get tough. She understands that her husband's success is also hers, so she supports his journey wholeheartedly. Melissa is a true rock for Floyd Mayweather, always cheering him on from behind the scenes. 

Jinkee has been by Manny Pacquiao's side since he was first discovered in the Philippines as a young boxer. She understands the sacrifices that come with being an elite athlete and gives her husband the confidence needed to perform at his best each time they step into the ring. Jinkee is more than just a wife; she's also Manny's biggest fan, traveling with him to every fight around the world to show her unwavering support for him. 

Both Melissa and Jinkee are strong women who play an essential role in their husbands' successes inside and outside of boxing. They motivate them to be better versions of themselves while helping them stay humble despite their immense fame and fortune. These two ladies are true pillars for these legendary fighters, providing support during good times as well as bad - because behind every great man stands an even greater woman!
