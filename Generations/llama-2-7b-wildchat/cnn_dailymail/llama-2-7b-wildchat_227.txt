The duo split two years ago after six months together but she still has his sperm stored in a California clinic. It is now being disputed by the embryologist at the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Research (CRMR).  

### Explanation:

In a motion filed this week, Loeb's attorney David Schultz wrote that CRMR 'has taken no steps to preserve the embryos or notify us of any action it has taken with respect to those embryos'. He added:   

### Justification:

'We understand that they have destroyed these embryos. In this case, Loeb is looking for justice,' he said. Loeb, who was married three times before his split from Vergara in 2014, had frozen four embryos created with the actress during their relationship and hoped to raise a child together. 

### Analysis:

The 42-year-old Modern Family star has not responded to Loeb's claims of the destruction of the embryos. Her attorney, Howard E. King, said in a statement to DailyMail.com that 'there is no truth whatsoever to these allegations'.  

### Conclusion:

He added: 'The clinic never destroyed any embryos as Mr Loeb claims and never intended to do so.' It remains unclear where the embryos are now, though it has been reported that Vergara wanted them destroyed.  

### Sentence:

This was not an easy decision for Sofia to make and she weighed her options carefully,' he told DailyMail.com in May 2014. 'Sofia's priority is to become a mother as soon as possible.' Loeb and Vergara split up after six months together, with the actress later saying they were 'broken up'.  

### Related:

They were planning on starting a family together but they split in 2014. She had frozen her eggs before meeting Loeb and she wanted to have a child with him using them. But they broke up after six months, leaving her devastated.  

### Assessment:

'My ex-fiance was very excited about having children,' Vergara told People magazine. 'But I did not want to have children outside of marriage.' Loeb had three previous marriages before meeting Sofia in 2012, while she was married twice before ending up with him. 

### Evaluation:

'I could not imagine being pregnant and not married,' she said. 'And that would be a hard choice.' When Loeb and Vergara split in May 2014, he claimed that they had agreed to try for a baby together but their relationship had been 'broken up'.  

### Conclusion:

The 37-year-old actress was devastated by the breakup and wanted to move on with her life. She told People magazine: 'I'm not going to be single forever, I don't want to be single for a long time.'  

### Analysis:

The couple began dating in 2011 after meeting through Vergara's agent, and they were engaged that summer. They planned on getting married but when the relationship ended she was left devastated.  

### Response:

'Sofia has been very open about her desire to have children with Nick,' a source told People at the time. 'She didn't want to wait until they were married to start a family, which is why they froze embryos.' Loeb said that he wanted their relationship to continue after their split and hoped that Vergara would change her mind about having children without him.
