Agger will now be absent from his side’s upcoming Europa League clashes with Krasnodar and Gent. He received a yellow card at the time of the incident, which took place in the 78th minute of Brondby's 2-1 loss to Copenhagen on Saturday.

### Reaction:
Agger’s ban has been met with widespread criticism from football fans and pundits alike, who believe that the punishment is too light for such a serious offence. Many have called for harsher sanctions to be implemented in order to deter violent behaviour on the pitch.

### Analysis:
The incident highlights the ongoing issue of player safety in football and raises questions about whether adequate measures are being taken to protect players from potential harm. Agger’s ban serves as a reminder that serious consequences must follow any act of violence on the pitch, regardless of how minor it may seem at the time.

### Conclusion:
In light of the growing concerns over player safety in football, it is imperative that FIFA and other governing bodies take urgent action to address this issue head-on. Stricter sanctions must be implemented for violent conduct on the pitch, especially when it leads to injury or potentially serious consequences. The Agger case serves as a stark reminder of why these measures are so vital for player safety in our beautiful game.
