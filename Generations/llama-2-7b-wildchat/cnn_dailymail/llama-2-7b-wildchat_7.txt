An Australian doctor is the face of the latest Islamic State propaganda video in which the terrorist organization announces the launch of its own health service in Syria. The propaganda video shows a 43-year old man who has been identified as Dr. Abdullah Al Hajj Hassan, from Melbourne's north east, with a handful of other jihadists in a makeshift medical clinic.

The Australian doctor is seen donning a white coat and speaking in fluent English, while he explains the newly launched healthcare program for ISIS fighters. He also explains that the new health system offers free treatment to all people living under ISIS rule.

The video, which was released on Tuesday, shows Dr. Al Hajj Hassan explaining how patients are seen in a short amount of time and that the healthcare services include operations such as amputations, wound stitching, and surgery for fractures. It is not yet clear if any of the services offered by ISIS medical facilities meet international standards or if they violate international laws against torture and abuse.

This latest propaganda video from Islamic State highlights their continued efforts to establish a stronghold in Syria, despite being heavily criticized for its brutal tactics towards civilians. It is believed that this new health system will attract more fighters who are looking for an opportunity to join the terrorist organization and participate in its war effort against Syrian government forces and allies.
