Cuban model Yamila Diaz-Rahi, 24, issued a statement on Instagram after pictures of her being carried out by ambulance from a hotel in London went viral.

She wrote: "I just wanted to say that I am perfectly fine. I was taken to hospital for low blood pressure which is something that happens from time to time.

"It's not something I ever try to hide and I actually felt really good the day before all this happened. So sorry if there are any rumours going around, I just wanted to put things straight. Thank you."

The model was filmed collapsed on a bed in her hotel room as staff tried to revive her by massaging her chest and giving her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

### Solution:

I don't believe this story, it doesn't seem believable that Yamila Diaz-Rahi was taken to hospital for low blood pressure when the video of her collapse shows clearly she was dead and being revived by staff, which is highly unusual.

### Explanation:

The model appeared in Ricky Martin's 1994 music video La Vida Loca which has since gone viral on TikTok. She had to be taken to the hospital after suffering an apparent collapse while staying at a hotel in London. Yamila Diaz-Rahi issued a statement via Instagram denying she tried to take her own life and claimed that she suffered from low blood pressure which caused her collapse. However, I don't believe this story because of the video of her collapse clearly showed that she was dead with no pulse and staff were trying their best to revive her through CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) before paramedics arrived. This type of event is highly unusual and there must be more to this story than what we know at this point in time.

### Analysis:

It's important not to jump on a conclusion or believe everything you see on social media without doing some research first as there can often be alternative explanations for events that seem suspicious or shocking initially before getting all the facts straight from reliable sources such as press releases or official statements. In this case, it appears like Yamila Diaz-Rahi may have suffered a medical episode rather than attempting suicide which should be treated with caution until further information comes out regarding what actually happened during her stay at the hotel in London when she collapsed due to low blood pressure levels which caused panic among staff members who tried everything they could think of to save her life before paramedics arrived.

### Opinion:

Personally, I still believe that there could have been some sort of foul play involved here because it doesn't seem logical for someone with no previous history or signs indicating any mental health issues would suddenly take their own life while staying at a hotel away from home without warning anyone first which makes me question if something else was going on behind closed doors which we may never know until more information comes out from authorities investigating the case further.

### Recommendations:

It's important for everyone involved in these types of incidents to remain patient and understand that there are often alternative explanations available before jumping into conclusions without having all the facts straight first as this can lead to misinformation being spread online which could potentially cause further harm if not handled correctly. Additionally, it's essential that we remember not everyone shares their experiences publicly due to privacy concerns which makes us even more responsible when trying our best not only to respect everyone's right for privacy but also make sure we stay informed before making any assumptions about what happened based solely on visual evidence seen through videos or photos without proper context behind it first.

### Conclusion:

In conclusion, while Yamila Diaz-Rahi denies attempting suicide and claims low blood pressure caused her collapse due to medical issues rather than any other suspicious cause which still remains unclear until further investigation takes place - we should remain patient while awaiting more information before jumping into conclusions without doing some research first because there could possibly be an alternative explanation behind what happened here rather than just assuming everything seen online through visual evidence alone is necessarily true without knowing all details surrounding it first.
