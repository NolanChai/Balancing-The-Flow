: Asif and Sara Malik were stopped on a plane at Istanbul airport last week as they tried to leave Turkey for Gaziantep, a city in southern Turkey that is close to the border with Syria. Asif's sister Fatima, 38, said her brother had "a beard" when she spoke to him before his arrest and believed he was now staying at an airport hotel. She also said Asif was still in touch with her on social media despite his disappearance.
