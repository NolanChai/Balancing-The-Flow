In some instances it may be used to prevent others from hearing important information that is meant only for specific members of the group. However, in other cases, it can indicate a lack of trust or respect within a group and could also be interpreted as a threat.

### Explanation:
Whispering among animals has been observed in a range of species, including apes, dolphins, birds, monkeys and even elephants. These forms of communication are generally used for more sensitive or intimate information that is not meant to be broadcast to others outside the group. This could involve warnings about danger or sharing important information related to survival in their environment.

Whispering among gibbons may also be used as a way to convey feelings of affection, such as when one individual is comforting another after an injury or death in the group. It can also demonstrate dominance over other members of the troop, especially if it's accompanied by loud calls or threatening gestures.

While it's unclear why gibbons tend to use whispers more often than other species when communicating within their groups, research has shown that this behavior may have evolutionary benefits for both individual animals and entire populations alike. Whispering helps protect individuals from predators while also allowing them to stay connected with others despite any potential threats or challenges facing them in their environment.

In conclusion, although it might seem odd at first sight that gibbons use whispers when communicating amongst themselves instead of loud calls like other apes do; understanding these subtle signals can provide valuable insight into how primates interact within complex social structures both now and over time throughout evolutionary history.
