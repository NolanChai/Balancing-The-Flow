I think Jen was probably right on this one, and there are two reasons for that. Firstly, the offer to become Obama’s communications director would be highly competitive since it requires strong communication skills, political acumen, and strategic thinking abilities. These qualities can easily attract many applicants who might feel confident enough about their own potential or have connections inside the White House itself that could secure an interview or job offer from President Obama himself.

However, if we look at Jen’s expectations more closely – she thought this opportunity wouldn’t last long because Denis McDonough had never heard of her pregnancy yet! This suggests that perhaps there was some sort of miscommunication between these two people where one party (Jen) did not disclose certain information to the other party (Denis). If such an incident occurs then it would make sense why Jen felt confident enough about herself or had connections inside the White House as she might have assumed that Denis knew everything related to her personal life before making any decision regarding potential candidates for this position.

It’s important here not just focus on what happened after but also pay attention towards what was happening leading up until then so we can get a clearer understanding about how this situation developed into such an awkward one which ultimately resulted in Jen Psaki ending up accepting another offer instead of taking Denis McDonough's original job offer.
