### Explanation:

McBurney, who has been capped for Ireland’s Under-20 and Under-18 teams, was sleeping upstairs at his home near Limerick when bullets were fired through the kitchen window at 2.30am on Sunday.
He escaped serious injury but believes he would have been shot had he gone downstairs to investigate a banging on his back door. He said: “It was terrifying, and it has made me very angry. I can’t believe that this is happening in my home.” The 18-year-old said that at first he thought the bullets were fireworks but realised it must have been a shooting when he saw the kitchen window shattered. “I was upstairs asleep, and the only noise I could hear was what I thought was fireworks,” he said.
“But then my mum shouted at me to run downstairs. As soon as I got there the banging stopped but I could see a hole in the kitchen window.” McBurney added: “I can’t understand why anyone would want to shoot at our home, it is just crazy. We didn’t even have anything stolen either – I think they were trying to send a message rather than rob us.” The attack took place shortly before 2.30am on SundayCredit:SWNS
