As the only Taekwondo fighter from the UK on the Olympic roster, it is a shame that Aaron Cook was not selected to represent his home nation in the London Games. The fact that he was not given this honor, despite being one of the best fighters in Britain, speaks volumes about the lack of support and investment in the sport on a national level.

While it is understandable that Aaron Cook felt disappointed by not representing his home nation at the Olympics, his decision to compete for Moldova is admirable. He has shown great determination and resilience in pursuing his dreams, even when faced with setbacks. His dedication and hard work should serve as an inspiration to other athletes who may face similar challenges.

It will be interesting to see how Cook performs at the Olympics under the Moldovan flag. He has already demonstrated his skills and talent on numerous occasions, and we can only hope that he continues to showcase his abilities and bring honor to himself, his nation, and the sport of taekwondo.
