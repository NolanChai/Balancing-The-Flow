I am not going to get into a long explanation because it is about Brazil, but what I will say is that I have been watching them for years now. And one of my favorite players is Zico – he played for Flamengo and was also captain at Vasco da Gama. He is like a little genius on the pitch; when you watch him you can’t help but admire his style of play.

The best way to describe it would be “a magician with ball at feet” because that is what he does – magic! There was no one better than Zico in Brazil during that time period and I don't think anyone will ever come close to replacing him again; especially now when soccer has become so commercialized.
