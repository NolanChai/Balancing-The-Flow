This is one of the most beautiful pictures ever taken in astronomy. It shows a region called NGC 3198 in our galaxy, the Milky Way. This picture was taken using Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveying (ACS). ACS can take pictures with much wider fields than any other camera on Hubble, making it possible to capture such large and detailed images like this one!
