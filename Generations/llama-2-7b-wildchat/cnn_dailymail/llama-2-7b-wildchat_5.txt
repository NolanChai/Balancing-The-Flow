I have always had an interest in boxing, and it was even more so when my dad started boxing because he would talk to me about his techniques and what he would do differently if he were fighting that night. I never knew how much knowledge my dad had until I started training with him for this upcoming fight against Manny Pacquiao - it's a completely different perspective!
The one thing I will say is the training is hard, but it's worth it because you get to be in the ring with your dad and learn from his experience. He always says "I'm not training you; I'm just making sure you are prepared." This means that he wants me to know everything so when we go into battle together on May 2nd, there will never be any surprises!

### Question:
What advice do you have for boxers and aspiring fighters out there?

### Answer:
My best advice would be to always listen and learn. My father taught me that the sport of boxing is not about how much experience you have, but rather it's all about knowing your opponent's style better than they know themselves. That way when they try to outsmart or surprise us in a fight, we will already know what they are trying to do before they even think of it!
