The ritual is a common tradition in Hinduism, which has been practiced for centuries. It is known as 'Tila Tarpan' and is believed to be a way of purifying oneself by burning away impurities and negative energies. This ceremony involves roasting yourself above an open flame for a short period of time in order to achieve this purpose. The fire should never reach too high or be uncontrollable, as this could result in serious injury. It is said that the smoke from the burning coal is purifying and has healing qualities, which will bring good luck and prosperity into one's life.
