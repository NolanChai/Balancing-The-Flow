The 37-year-old’s Instagram video, titled "A Message To Body Shamers", sees Cassey reclaiming the hate and provoking a reaction against the negativity she has experienced over her life online.
“I started to ask myself ‘Why am I letting these people get me down? Why am I even allowing them in my mind at all?”, says Ho, who launched her popular POP Pilates fitness programme 15 years ago. "Instead of focusing on how you want to feel and the joy that comes from living a healthy life, you’re looking at others and measuring yourself against their successes," she adds.
The video, which has now been viewed more than 9 million times, ends with Cassey addressing those who have commented negatively on her Instagram photos: “To everyone who is still leaving comments about my body shape, your size, your weight, I invite you to read this until the end. And then I invite you to get in touch with me because I’d love to meet you for a cup of coffee. Let’s have a chat and talk about how we can make change together.”

### Conclusion:
In her video, Cassey Ho has highlighted the cruel comments left by viewers of her fitness-focused clips who accuse the trim and toned online icon of being everything from ‘too fat’ to ‘ugly’ to ‘pudgy’. By reclaiming these negatives as positives, she is challenging body shaming in a powerful way. Her invitation to those who have left negative comments shows her commitment to spreading awareness about this issue while also offering support and encouragement for those struggling with it themselves. Through her video message on Instagram, Cassey Ho has demonstrated how important it is for everyone involved in online spaces to take action against body shaming by providing a safe space where all people are accepted regardless of their shape or size.

### What the author thinks:
It is great to see that Cassey Ho is speaking out on such an important issue. Body shaming can be incredibly harmful for many individuals, especially young girls and women who already feel pressure to conform to a certain beauty standard in today’s society. By addressing these issues head-on, we hope that others will follow suit so we can create a culture where everyone feels safe and accepted regardless of their shape or size.
