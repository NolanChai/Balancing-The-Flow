"The article claims that "Eaze" is the world's first Uber for weed - it will enable people to order marijuana in seconds from their phones. The delivery service also claims to use its own data to find new consumers who might not have been able to access cannabis before."

It is a great idea that they are trying to help out those who need it but the app sounds like it may be abused by people who just want drugs. It also sounds like there will be some issues with delivery drivers and customers getting caught up in illegal situations.
