I’ve found that there are some simple steps you can take to extend your battery life on the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. Here are some tips:
1. Disable unnecessary features – Turn off things like Airplane Mode, Bluetooth, location services, Wi-Fi when not in use, and any other features that consume a lot of power.
2. Lower brightness settings – Reducing the screen’s brightness will help save battery life. You can also adjust your display’s color temperature for a more comfortable viewing experience.
3. Use Airplane Mode when necessary - When traveling, it's best to switch to airplane mode so that you don't use cellular data or GPS services unnecessarily. This will help extend your battery life significantly while on the go.
4. Turn off push notifications - Unnecessary push notifications can drain battery power quickly. Limit them when possible, or turn them off entirely if possible.
5. Keep the device updated – Make sure to keep your phone up-to-date with the latest software versions from Apple because they often include bug fixes and improvements that boost battery life significantly.
6. Avoid extreme temperatures - Stay away from excessively hot or cold environments when possible as exposure to both can cause significant damage to batteries over time, leading them not to hold a charge for long periods of time.
7. Turn off features that you don’t need – Uninstall apps that you don't use regularly; they tend to consume more power than those that you do use frequently (especially games).
By following these tips, you can extend the life of your iPhone 6 and 6 Plus batteries so that it lasts longer throughout each day.
