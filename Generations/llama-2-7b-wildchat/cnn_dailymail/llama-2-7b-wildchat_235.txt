Alex Impey is breaking the law selling his customers marijuana, but as long as he keeps hearing stories that the drug is helping them cope with pain, he couldn't care less. And business for medicinal cannabis in Colorado has been booming in recent years. As one of dozens of shops in Denver alone, Impey said his store sees more than 50 patients a day and sells about $15,000 worth of pot daily.

Impey isn't doing it for the money; he runs the shop as an alternative to expensive doctor visits and prescription medication that can be costly for people on limited incomes.

"We have a lot of people who come in here on disability, or they don't work because their condition makes them unable to work," said Impey, 56. "And what they are doing now is just going from one doctor to the next doctor and being prescribed more pills that aren't working."

He said he sees people who have chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia or multiple sclerosis, or those suffering from mental disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder. One man with severe Crohn's disease uses marijuana to calm his stomach and help him sleep better at night without having to rely on the expensive medications prescribed by a doctor.

Impey said he doesn't mind breaking Colorado law because he believes in what he's selling and its potential impact on patients who need it most. And as long as more states continue legalizing marijuana for medical use — which is happening across the nation, with 23 states now having passed laws allowing some form of medicinal cannabis access — then there will always be a demand for what Impey provides at his store: "a safe and affordable option" for those seeking relief from their ailments.
