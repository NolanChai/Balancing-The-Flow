"This is not my place to call on anyone to resign, but I think it is very important that this incident does not happen again in a final match," Geronimi said. "It seems strange to me that the president of Ligue de Football Professional (LFP) did not come onto the pitch for the trophy ceremony and shake our players' hands."

"I had the impression, especially when it was time for them [the LFP] to present the trophies, that they wanted to avoid us. So it is better that he leaves, because I am really afraid of what could happen next year in the Coupe de France final," Geronimi added. "It's important that we have someone who cares about these things."
