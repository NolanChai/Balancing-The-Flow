Wow! This is a very heartwarming story of a bond between generations. It's important for young people to learn about history, especially military history, so they can understand the sacrifices and hardships that have been made in order to preserve their freedom and way of life. Robert Harding's willingness to share his experiences with these twin brothers is an inspiring example of selflessness and dedication. It's truly touching that he took the time to connect with them, and it shows how important it is for veterans to be recognized and appreciated for their service. These two boys have been lucky enough to gain a new friend in Robert, but more than anything else they will surely grow up to appreciate history as much as Robert does now. This story emphasizes the importance of respecting those who came before us; it's important that we take advantage of learning from them while they're still with us.

### Feedback:

Awesome! I'm so glad that Robert Harding took the time to share his experiences with these young boys. It's incredibly important for children (and adults) to learn about history, especially military history. It teaches them about bravery and sacrifice and helps them appreciate what has been given to us as a nation. I wish more veterans would be willing to share their stories like Robert did; it is such an honorable way of passing on knowledge!
