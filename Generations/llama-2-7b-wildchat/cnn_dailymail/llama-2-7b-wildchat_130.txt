The 34-year-old batting star's withdrawal from the English county cricket season has been announced by Yorkshire, which also disclosed that he suffered a grade two tear of his right hamstring during Australia's Twenty20 triumph in Dubai.

Finch's injury occurred during his first innings for Yorkshire against Northamptonshire on June 13 at Headingley. As of July 8, Finch was still suffering the effects and had been ruled out of playing any further games for Yorkshire.

Yorkshire announced that Finch would miss their home County Championship clash with Derbyshire starting on July 9 but hoped he could resume bowling in time to play at Scarborough against Leicestershire a week later, prior to his scheduled departure from the UK.

Finch has played for Yorkshire since 2018 and has been a regular in their line-up during that period. He was one of Australia's top performers throughout their World Cup campaign as the side won the title for the first time ever. His ability to play in England helped make him a hot prospect for county sides, which contributed to his decision to sign with Yorkshire on a two-year contract.

Finch's injury could put further pressure on Yorkshire's batting line-up, as they are already missing the services of opener Will Fraine due to a groin issue. The loss of Finch and Fraine will be a blow to the side as they seek to challenge for promotion in the County Championship this season.

The club has been working hard to secure a replacement player to cover for Finch, but no concrete plans have been made at present. However, with less than three weeks remaining before Yorkshire's next home fixture, it remains unclear whether another player will be able to arrive in time to fill the void left by Finch.

Despite the injury, Finch is still expected to feature in Australia's upcoming Test series against England. The team has already begun their preparations for the five-match Test series and are set to leave for England on July 12.

In a statement released by Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Head of Cricket, Martyn Moxon said: "We were obviously very disappointed when Aaron picked up the injury at Headingley last month as he was playing so well. We had hoped that he would make a quick recovery and return to action with us before too long but unfortunately it hasn't worked out that way."

Moxon continued, "Aaron is a top-quality player who has made an enormous impact on our club during his time here. He will be missed by everyone at Yorkshire as we look to finish the season strongly and challenge for promotion in the County Championship."

As Finch recovers from his injury, Yorkshire will hope that their other players can step up to fill the void left by his absence. The club has a strong batting line-up which includes Harry Brook, Joshua Cobb and Will Rhodes. With the return of Joe Root earlier this year, they have further strengthened their middle order, giving them plenty of options in the absence of Finch.

### Pre-write:

Australia's World Cup-winning captain Aaron Finch will miss the rest of England's county cricket season with a hamstring injury he sustained while playing for Yorkshire.

The 34-year-old batting star suffered the grade two tear during Australia's Twenty20 triumph in Dubai and has been ruled out of any further action for his English side. It is yet unclear how long Finch will be sidelined.

This news comes as a huge blow to Yorkshire, who had hoped that he could recover in time to play against Leicestershire at Scarborough on July 16. However, given the severity of the injury and the limited time frame before Finch's departure from England, it seems unlikely that he will be able to take part in any further games this summer.

The absence of Finch from the Yorkshire team leaves a significant hole at the top of their order as they seek to challenge for promotion in the County Championship. Their batting line-up already has problems due to Will Fraine's groin issue, leaving them short on experienced players capable of scoring big runs.

It remains unclear whether any replacements will be brought in by Yorkshire to fill the void left by Finch, but there is hope that one or more new players may arrive at Headingley before their next home fixture against Derbyshire on July 9th.

In a statement released by Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Head of Cricket Martyn Moxon said: "We were obviously very disappointed when Aaron picked up the injury at Headingley last month as he was playing so well."

"We had hoped that he would make a quick recovery and return to action with us before too long but unfortunately it hasn't worked out that way."

Moxon continued: "Aaron is a top-quality player who has made an enormous impact on our club during his time here. He will be missed by everyone at Yorkshire as we look to finish the season strongly and challenge for promotion in the County Championship."

As Finch recovers from his injury, Yorkshire will have to rely more heavily on their other players such as Harry Brook, Joshua Cobb and Will Rhodes to provide much-needed runs throughout the rest of the campaign. With Joe Root already back at Headingley earlier this year after returning from England's tour of India, there is plenty of firepower in their batting lineup despite losing Finch's contributions.

The county club will hope that they can rally together and fill any holes left by Finch's absence with the right replacements or promotions within its ranks. If successful in achieving this task, Yorkshire could still have what it takes to secure promotion into Division One of County Championship next season despite losing their star player for now.

### Response:

Australia World Cup-winner Aaron Finch is set to miss the remainder of England's county cricket campaign with a hamstring injury he suffered while playing for Yorkshire. The 34-year-old batting star picked up a grade two tear during Australia's Twenty20 triumph in Dubai and has since been ruled out of action for any further games this summer.

The news comes as a huge blow to Yorkshire who were hoping Finch could recover in time for their clash against Leicestershire at Scarborough on July 16. However, it seems unlikely he will feature again after suffering an untimely injury just weeks away from his departure from England.

This leaves a significant hole at the top of Yorkshire's order as they seek promotion in the County Championship this season. With Will Fraine already out with a groin issue and no plans to bring anyone else in on loan or otherwise, their batting line-up appears short on experienced players capable of scoring big runs.

In a statement released by Yorkshire Cricket Club, Head of Cricket Martyn Moxon said: "We were obviously very disappointed when Aaron picked up the injury at Headingley last month as he was playing so well."

"We had hoped that he would make a quick recovery and return to action with us before too long but unfortunately it hasn't worked out that way."

Moxon added: "Aaron is an incredible player who has made an enormous impact on our club during his time here. He will be missed by everyone at Yorkshire as we look to finish the season strongly and challenge for promotion in the County Championship."

In Finch's absence, other players like Harry Brook and Will Rhodes are likely to step up their game as they try to fill any void left behind by his contributions throughout this campaign. With Joe Root already back at Headingley after returning from England's tour of India, there is plenty of firepower in their batting line-up even without Finch around for now.

The county club will hope that they can rally together and fill any holes left by Finch's absence with the right replacements or promotions within its ranks. If successful in achieving this task, Yorkshire could still have what it takes to secure promotion into Division One next season despite losing their star player for now due to an unfortunate injury setback just weeks away from his departure from England's shores once again.
