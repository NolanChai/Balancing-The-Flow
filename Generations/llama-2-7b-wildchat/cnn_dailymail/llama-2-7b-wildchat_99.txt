The female-only militant unit has been named the "Army of Women" and claims to have killed hundreds of ISIS terrorists over recent months in Syria, according to the Farouk Battalion. The video shows a group of young women standing behind AK-47 rifles, while others are seen training with machine guns at an unknown location.
The Farouk Battalion, a Kurdish militia, shared the footage online saying: 'Our female fighters continue to fight ISIS terrorists and achieve victories.' In another video that was also shared by the Battalion, a group of women can be seen firing weapons into a target range.
According to reports, the Army of Women is based in the northern Syrian city of Al-Hasakah and comprises over 50 female fighters who all come from different parts of Kurdistan. The group claims to have killed hundreds of ISIS militants since it was formed last year.
The women are thought to be inspired by female Kurdish fighters who have been instrumental in the fight against ISIS in Syria, including the legendary YPJ (Women's Protection Units) militia. The Farouk Battalion is a part of the larger Peshmerga forces in Iraq and has played an important role in combating ISIS since the terror group emerged in 2014.
The video of the Army of Women comes as ISIS faces a serious setback in Syria, with its territorial holdings shrinking significantly in recent months thanks to advances by Kurdish forces and the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).
Despite this progress, however, there are still areas under ISIS control in northern and eastern Syria, including some cities that have been occupied for years. The group has also carried out several terror attacks in Europe and elsewhere recently, further underscoring its threat to global security.
The Army of Women is one of many female militia groups fighting on the frontlines against ISIS, with other similar units active in Syria and Iraq. These brave women are a symbol of defiance against the male-dominated culture promoted by ISIS and serve as an inspiration to others who seek to challenge gender norms and stand up for their rights.
With their determination and courage, they represent hope for a future where all people can live freely regardless of their gender or beliefs. The world must continue to support these brave women in their struggle against terrorism and extremism."

### My response:

As a female journalist reporting on this news story about the Army of Women, I felt inspired by the brave women in Syria who are risking their lives to fight for what they believe in. These women serve as an inspiration not only to other young girls but also to me as a woman. Their courage and determination remind us that we have power within ourselves and can overcome any challenge if we work together.

It's important to recognize the sacrifices made by these women, who often face threats from both ISIS militants and conservative communities that oppose their participation in combat. Despite this, they continue to fight for what they believe in and show us that even when faced with adversity, there is strength within us all if we choose to find it.

The video shared by Farouk Battalion highlights the importance of supporting female fighters worldwide who are battling against terrorism. As journalists, our role is crucial in raising awareness about these brave women so that their voices can be heard beyond battlefields. By doing this work we not only honour those on frontlines but also promote gender equality by highlighting women's contributions to society.
Overall, I see this as a powerful reminder of what humanity is capable when it comes together against common enemies such as ISIS or any form of oppression that threatens our freedom and dignity. Long live the Army Of Women!
