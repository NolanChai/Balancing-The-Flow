Their kids were playing in the neighborhood and no crime was committed!

### My Response:
I think it's ridiculous that we have police picking up children who are playing outside in the neighborhood. It's a sign of the times where you cannot leave your child alone, even if you trust them to play safely in the neighborhood, and parents feel like they need to be right behind their kids for fear of some absurd reason that the police could be called.
