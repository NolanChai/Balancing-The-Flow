Everything they say about the Maldives is true. The sea is breathtakingly cerulean blue, the sand as soft as flour. The air is so clear it feels like there might be a fourth dimension. The view from the hotel room's terrace is serene and tranquil. We can see all the way to Sri Lanka on one side and India on the other.

As we swim in the warm waters, I think back to what I have read about this place: how it was created by an ancient volcanic eruption that formed a ring of small islands around a lagoon. The Maldives is like paradise for divers, with its rich marine life and vibrant coral reefs.

But now I realize that there's so much more to explore beyond the surface level. We take a boat ride to one of the local inhabited islands and witness daily life on land - women cooking food over open fires, children playing in the streets, and men tending to their boats or working at small shops selling fish products.

The Maldives may be known for its luxurious resorts catering exclusively towards tourists but this visit has made me appreciate all that this nation has to offer beyond just a beautiful backdrop for Instagram photos - an abundance of culture and history hidden beneath the surface waiting to be uncovered.
