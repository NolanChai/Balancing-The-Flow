Brazil legend Roberto Carlos is targeting a career in management having been impressed with the way his former club, Real Madrid, have handled Zinedine Zidane’s recent departure.

The 42-year-old left-back retired from football two years ago but has found coaching "very easy" and claims he would love to one day manage Brazil.
"I don't know if it will be in my career, but I do dream of coaching a big team like Brazil," Carlos said on the Gol Cares podcast.
"Football is what I love most, it is not just about winning titles."
Zidane's departure was made easier by the club’s decision to give him time away from the game for his mental well-being after he won a third Champions League title in two years as head coach last season.
Carlos is now hoping Real Madrid follow that lead and allow him to pursue his dream of managing Brazil one day, although he doesn't want to rush into it just yet.
"I think it would be very easy for me," Carlos said when asked about coaching. "I know how demanding a footballer is. I already had my moment on the field and now I am more aware of what it takes to train, to speak with players, to be in their company."
Carlos added: "It's not easy to leave something you love so much behind. But the best thing that happened to me was being able to return to football. Now I have another dream and this is coaching."
