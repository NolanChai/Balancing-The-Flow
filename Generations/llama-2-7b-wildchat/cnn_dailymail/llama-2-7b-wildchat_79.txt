Lionel Messi should play in the Barcelona vs Celta game. He is ready after the two weeks of absence from the national team, but the match will be played on Sunday night, so he doesn't have enough time for a full recovery. If there was no such an important match for La Liga at stake and if it wasn't against Celta Vigo then maybe we would see Messi playing in El Salvador's friendly game instead of watching him on TV at home or elsewhere while supporting his teammates who will be trying their best to win.
