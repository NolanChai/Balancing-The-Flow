The BBC has been criticised for making light of an allegation of assault against one of its own presenters Jeremy Clarkson in a comedy sketch on W1A. The satirical show's creator John Morton and comedian Hugh Bonneville were both reportedly "horrified" by the episode, which was not cleared with anyone at the corporation before it went to air.
