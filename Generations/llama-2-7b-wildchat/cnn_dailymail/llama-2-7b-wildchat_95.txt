Dear Sir/Madam,

Thank you for your email. The Coastguard does not comment on our operations and therefore I am unable to confirm or deny any incidents involving the Coastguard. Please note that Auckland Coastguard is a charity that relies on donations from individuals and businesses. If you are happy to support us please click below for more information on how you can help us keep New Zealanders safe at sea.

Kind regards,
