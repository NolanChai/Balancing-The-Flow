The goal was to test if short videos (of around 20 seconds each) could be used as an alternative tool for patients and their families who want to keep up with their loved ones' lives, rather than rely on in-person visits.

### Reason:
Video recordings are often seen as a way to remotely interact with those affected by dementia. This method has been found to be more successful than simply relying on regular phone calls.

### Result:
The initial results of the experiment were promising, and it showed that video recordings helped patients stay connected and engaged with their loved ones. It also enabled families to keep up with important details in their loved one's day-to-day activities without having to physically visit them regularly.

### Conclusion:
This type of intervention can be a great asset for those affected by dementia, as it enables family members and caregivers to stay connected while providing an alternative way of interacting with their loved ones from afar.
