In terms of calorie content, the difference is small - usually one or two per cent. But that's not all. A burger contains on average 15g of saturated fat (63%) while a sandwich with lettuce has just 2g (4%). There are no figures for pasta salads but it is unlikely they will contain as much fat and sugar as burgers or sandwiches.
