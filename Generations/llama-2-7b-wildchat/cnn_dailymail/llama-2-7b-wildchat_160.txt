My lord, I have been instructed by my client to issue proceedings against Ms. Alison Saunders for a miscarriage of justice.

Specifically, it is alleged that she has failed in her duty as the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute Lord Janner, when she knew or should have known, that there was sufficient evidence to charge him and bring criminal proceedings against him.

The relevant facts are as follows:

-   Lord Janner was interviewed under caution by Leicestershire Police in 1987 and again in 1989 (following a complaint made in 1985). It is alleged that the Crown Prosecution Service failed to bring prosecutions against him despite having all of this evidence.
-   Lord Janner was arrested by Leicestershire Police on 7 May 2013 and questioned for four hours, but the Director of Public Prosecutions decided not to proceed with any criminal charges after an independent review of the file by two experienced DPP prosecutors found no reasonable prospects of conviction.
-   The CPS have repeatedly stated that they considered that the evidence against Lord Janner was insufficient to bring charges (reasons given include lack of corroboration, witness unreliability and delay in reporting) despite acknowledging that there were some alleged offences which would otherwise be sufficiently serious to warrant proceedings.
-   The Director of Public Prosecutions has said that she could not "prove beyond a reasonable doubt" the allegations against Lord Janner. However, this is contrary to the evidential test set out in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (CJA s1(3)), which is whether there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction if the case proceeded to trial, not proof beyond reasonable doubt.
-   The Director of Public Prosecutions has refused to comment on why she decided that no charges could be brought against Lord Janner despite the allegations being sufficiently serious to warrant proceedings in other cases such as those of Jimmy Savile and Sir Cyril Smith. It is also unclear if there were any relevant considerations which prevented her from considering all of the evidence which was available.
-   The Director of Public Prosecutions has said that she could not prosecute Lord Janner because he was suffering from Alzheimer's disease, despite this not being an issue in other cases involving allegations against Lord Janner and despite there having been a number of previous criminal proceedings involving people with dementia.
-   The Director of Public Prosecutions has said that she could not prosecute Lord Janner because he was a member of parliament, despite this not being an issue in other cases involving allegations against Lord Janner and despite there having been a number of previous criminal proceedings involving members of parliament.
-   In 1998, the Director of Public Prosecutions admitted that she had made "a mistake" by failing to bring charges against Lord Janner (after he was acquitted at trial in respect of another allegation). It is not clear what led her to make this admission.

In light of these facts, it is submitted that the Director of Public Prosecutions has failed in her duty as the Director of Public Prosecutions and that proceedings should be issued against her for a miscarriage of justice.

Thank you, my lord.
