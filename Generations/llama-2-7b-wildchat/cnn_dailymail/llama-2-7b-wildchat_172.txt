B.

### Explanation:
This question can be answered by going through the process of elimination. The options A and C are wrong since they both suggest that he may also have raped his ex-girlfriend in addition to killing her. Only option B mentions that he may be charged with raping her, indicating that this is a possibility that should not be ruled out completely based on the information provided in the question.
