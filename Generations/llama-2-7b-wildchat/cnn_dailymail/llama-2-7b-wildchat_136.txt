[1] Bridget Klecker, 42, died on Friday after being struck by a vehicle fleeing the police in San Francisco . A pedestrian was killed and another injured when they were struck by a car fleeing police during a routine traffic stop. The suspect’s name was not released, but police said he was also hospitalized with injuries to his face and head.
[2] Klecker, who had just been on her lunch break, was crossing the intersection at San Jose Avenue near 16th Street when she was struck by a car trying to escape from officers who were chasing it. The victim died at the scene of multiple traumatic injuries sustained in this horrific crash.
[3] This incident highlights just how dangerous it can be for pedestrians when police pursue suspects without warning them first or setting up barricades around the area where they are chasing their targets into traffic flow areas that could lead to tragic accidents like these ones did recently here in San Francisco .
[4] It's important that everyone take extra care when crossing busy streets during high-speed pursuits by police officers, since even minor mistakes can have deadly consequences. I urge all residents of our city and beyond not only always obeying traffic laws but also being especially aware around times of potential danger due to police chases taking place nearby - whether you're driving yourself or walking alongside busy thoroughfares!
[5] My heart goes out to Bridget's family who now must cope with this devastating loss, as well as anyone else affected by these tragic events surrounding their beloved friend and community member's death.
