This year saw a rash of massive dust storms around the world that caused travel chaos and blocked out sunlight, however, experts could not pinpoint the reason for this spate. This week, incredibly intense sandstorms hit cities including Tehran, Mumbai, New Delhi and Beijing, as well as other countries in Africa and the Middle East.

The cause of these storms remains a mystery, but experts believe that climate change, drought and human activity may be contributing factors. In addition, dust particles from desert regions can travel hundreds or even thousands of miles before they reach populated areas. This phenomenon is known as "dust loading" and it has been observed to increase in recent years due to increasing emissions from industrial activities such as mining and agriculture.

The impacts of these dust storms are far-reaching, not just visually but also on human health and infrastructure. Inhalation of high levels of dust particles can cause respiratory problems like coughing or wheezing; visibility may be reduced significantly at airports leading to flight delays; construction work may also be affected due to poor working conditions caused by fine particulate matter in the atmosphere.

Overall, while experts cannot pinpoint one single reason behind this spate of intense dust storms around the world this year; they agree that climate change and human activities are likely playing an important role. Understanding why these storms occur could help us better prepare for future events like them so that we can minimize any associated damage caused by such natural phenomena.
