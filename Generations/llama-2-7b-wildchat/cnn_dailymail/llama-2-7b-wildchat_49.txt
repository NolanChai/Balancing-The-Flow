Dear Sir,

Please find my response below.

I am pleased that you have emailed me with your questions and concerns regarding Everton's future plans for Antolin Alcaraz and Sylvain Distin. As a journalist covering the football scene closely, I understand how important it is to provide accurate and reliable information to your readers.

Regarding Roberto Martinez's statement about not ruling out new contracts for these players, I can assure you that there has been no confirmation on this matter yet. While Alcaraz and Distin are undoubtedly important figures in Everton's history, their performances on the pitch will ultimately determine whether or not they receive a new deal from the club.

As we all know, football is a highly competitive industry where players must continually prove themselves in order to remain relevant. The decision whether or not to renew Alcaraz and Distin's contracts will depend greatly on their ability to deliver consistently high-quality performances throughout the upcoming seasons.

If they can do so, then there is always a chance that Everton could offer them new deals and keep them in the squad for another few years. However, if they fail to impress on the pitch or face injuries, it may become difficult for manager Roberto Martinez to justify extending their contracts.

In short, while Alcaraz and Distin remain important members of Everton's team, their fate ultimately lies in their own hands. As long as they continue to give 100% effort on the field, there is always a chance that they will be rewarded with new contracts by the club.

However, if they fail to deliver consistent performances or suffer from injuries that prevent them from playing regularly, then it may become difficult for Martinez to keep them in the squad moving forward.

I hope this provides some clarity on Everton's plans regarding Alcaraz and Distin's future contracts. As a journalist covering the team closely, I will do my best to provide accurate and up-to-date information as it becomes available. Thank you for your interest in football at Goodison Park.

Kind regards,

A Journalist
