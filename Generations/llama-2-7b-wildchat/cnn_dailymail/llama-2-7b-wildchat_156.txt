I think it's a nice idea to combine a helicopter with an airship and also it is great that they managed to get these two types of vehicles work together. This means we can have a more efficient way to travel between land and sea. As far as I know, there are no such aircraft yet on the market, so this will definitely be something new in the aviation world.
