It was always going to be a crazy day for Watford and there was little doubt that when it ended, their supporters would be deliriously happy as they celebrated a promotion back to the Premier League after two seasons in the Championship. And yet the joyous scenes on Saturday were more than justified given all that had happened over 90 minutes at Vicarage Road. Watford's 1-0 win over Birmingham City, which ensured they would go up as Champions irrespective of what happened elsewhere in the division, was a testament to their character and resilience after they had gone down to ten men late on against a team who were fighting for their lives. But it was also a remarkable story considering all that had transpired over 12 months with Watford.

### Reason:

In May last year, Jokanovic led Watford to promotion via the play-offs but his future remained in doubt at Vicarage Road. He had been under pressure for much of the season following a run of poor results and withdrew from his media duties at a crucial point late on in that campaign as he appeared increasingly likely to depart. He was eventually sacked by Watford and replaced by Javi Gracia, who only took over in November but guided Watford to the summit.

### Response:

With Jokanovic still out of work after being released by Fulham earlier this season, he would surely have had a good few questions put his way by interested parties about what went wrong during that difficult period at Vicarage Road. But there was no sign of any bitterness on Saturday when Watford fans sang his name and chanted: 'Jokanovic! Jokanovic!' And the 52-year-old Serbian, who took over from Gracia in the summer after he had joined Villarreal following promotion, was quick to praise those supporters. "The fans are great," said Jokanovic on Sky Sports' coverage of Watford's win. "I want to thank them for their support. We played a good game and we deserved the win.
