As the countdown to their deaths by firing squad begins, the Australian drug traffickers have vowed to fight on.
Their final hours will be spent praying in a Jakarta jail cell with a window open to the outside world. The men, who are part of the so-called Bali Nine heroin smuggling gang, have been in that prison for more than eight years and will spend their last night there surrounded by guards.
As dawn breaks tomorrow they will be taken from their cells - with a blindfold over one eye - to face death on the firing range outside a police post in Bekasi, West Java.
The pair are accused of killing six people as part of an international drug syndicate that smuggled 8kg of heroin into Indonesia's holiday island Bali in October 2005. Chan and Sukumaran have been on death row for the past eight years after they were caught carrying the drugs with them when they arrived as tourists at Denpasar Airport.
The pair face their final hours together before they are strapped to a wooden pallet which will be taken outside to a field where a firing squad of Indonesian police will open fire. They have been granted one last meal - and are said to be eating a chicken and vegetable rice dish for breakfast, plus bananas and a bottle of water each.
Chan has asked for the music of Mariah Carey played in his cell, while Sukumaran has requested Bali musicians play traditional Indonesian songs.
The pair will be shot with 12 bullets from behind at close range. One will hit the heart and cause instant death. A second bullet will hit an artery to ensure they are dead.
Afterwards their bodies will be returned to a waiting funeral van which will take them back to jail where relatives will be allowed to collect them in the early evening. They have not been given any time of their burial, but it is expected that Chan and Sukumaran's remains will be buried at a local cemetery or cremated.
A small number of close family members will be present during their final moments on Earth and will see them carried from the jail to the firing range in an open truck.
Their wives, sons and daughters are expected to stay away as they do not want their children's first glimpse of their fathers being executed. They have been told that Chan and Sukumaran will die without seeing them again - but it is possible a few hours after the shootings relatives may be allowed inside jail to see their dead bodies one final time before burial.
Sukumaran's lawyer, Muhammad Rifan Hidayat, said he had been told by police that his client would be taken out of the cells around 4am tomorrow and taken straight to a waiting truck which will take him to the execution site. "I was informed they (police) will not let us see Chan and Myruan before they die," he said.
Chan's wife, Vanessa, arrived back in Brisbane overnight with her children to spend their final hours together as a family. She has been joined by friends of the pair who are helping her prepare for tomorrow morning's execution.
Indonesia's Attorney-General Hendarman Supandji said that he had not received an official request from Australia to postpone Chan and Sukumaran's execution, although it is expected to come soon.
"They (the families) are already preparing for the funeral," Mr Supandji said at a news conference yesterday. "So far we have no official request from Indonesia or any other country regarding the execution of the Bali Nine. We will carry out the execution as planned."
Mr Supandji said Indonesian authorities had followed their legal process to the letter in preparation for Chan and Sukumaran's shootings tomorrow - which would go ahead despite an appeal lodged by Australia with the International Court of Justice yesterday against the execution.
"We will carry out the death sentence on both Bali Nine members," he said. "It is within our legal rights, we have to follow all procedures." Mr Supandji said the men's final hours would be spent in a cell which had no windows - and that they would not meet their executioners until minutes before they are taken outside.
"The room has one window but it cannot be opened," he said. "They will not know who will execute them, even until the last moment."
Chan's wife, Vanessa Behan, who arrived back in Brisbane overnight with her children to spend their final hours together as a family, has been joined by friends of the pair who are helping her prepare for tomorrow morning's execution. She will meet up with relatives of Sukumaran at his home this afternoon and spend some time with him before they leave the house together.
Mr Supandji said the families would be allowed to stay close to the men when they were taken away from jail. "They (police) will let us know once we have reached the execution site," he said. "We cannot go further than that."
Chan and Sukumaran are expected to spend their final hours alone in their cells with only their lawyers allowed to visit them. A senior police officer from Indonesia's Bali province, Adjunct Senior Commissioner I Made Mangku Pastika said the men would not be given any extra comforts before they die.
"They will not be given anything special," he said. "Both of them have been on death row for eight years and they are still alive, so it is a good opportunity to reflect on what they did wrong."
Mr Pastika also denied reports that Chan and Sukumaran would be taken to a police post where they will be stripped naked before being shot. "It is not true," he said. "They (police) have followed all their legal procedures." He declined to discuss how close family members of the pair might see them before they were buried or cremated.
Mr Supandji yesterday rejected a last-ditch appeal from Indonesia's Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi - who had asked President Joko Widodo to give Chan and Sukumaran more time to repent for their crimes. He said the men had been given every opportunity during their time on death row to do that, but had refused.
The pair will die with their sentences still hanging over them because Indonesia's Constitution does not allow prisoners to have their punishments commuted while they are awaiting execution - which means any pardons from Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott or Governor General Peter Cosgrove would be rendered meaningless.
Mr Supandji said that Chan and Sukumaran had been given every opportunity during their time on death row to repent for their crimes, but they had refused. "They have been in prison eight years and the way I see it is that they are already being punished," he said yesterday.
The attorney-general said he was confident that all the legal procedures would be followed as planned tomorrow morning - which means the men will die without any delay. The Bali Nine pair will become the 12th and 13th people to be executed in Indonesia this year under President Joko Widodo's harsh anti-narcotics policy, which has seen more than 40 drug traffickers killed since it was introduced last July.
Australian death row inmate Andrew Chan was allowed his first meeting with relatives yesterday after spending eight years on the brink of execution in Indonesia for bringing heroin into Bali. His wife Vanessa Behan and their two children travelled from Brisbane to the island where the pair have been held since 2005, when they were caught trying to smuggle a record amount of drugs - six kilograms of heroin worth $34 million.
"I am so proud that we can now meet face-to-face after such a long time," Mr Chan told relatives at the Bali Kerobokan jail, according to local media reports. "This is my dream and it will never be forgotten." His wife Vanessa Behan said she was happy to be with her husband for one final meeting before he was executed - as requested by his lawyers.
"It's a very special day," Ms Behan told reporters after the meeting. "I just want to thank God we are all here together and I am really excited that we can meet face-to-face." Mr Chan has not yet been moved to the execution cell, but is expected to be taken there later today in preparation for his death tomorrow morning. The pair have been granted a final meal with their family before being strapped to a wooden pallet and shot by firing squad.
Indonesian police are still deciding on whether Chan's wife Vanessa or her two children will be allowed to witness the shooting, but it is expected they will not see his body as it is taken away for burial or cremation. Indonesia has executed 13 people this year under its hardline anti-narcotics policy introduced by President Joko Widodo last July - and there are fears more will follow in the coming months.
Chan, whose father is Australian, is one of two members of the Bali Nine drug gang who are still awaiting execution for their role in smuggling six kilograms of
