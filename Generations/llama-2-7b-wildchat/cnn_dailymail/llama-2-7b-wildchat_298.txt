The U.S. Supreme Court ordered Tommy Arthur's release in July, ruling that prosecutorial misconduct during his trial violated his constitutional rights. The state Supreme Court agreed to set aside the original guilty verdict and ordered a new trial. But this week, Baldwin County District Attorney Hallie Dixon informed the court that she could not proceed because of insufficient evidence to prove Arthur's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.

### Conclusion:

In 2016, Arthur was granted clemency by Alabama Governor Robert Bentley after spending more than two decades on death row. Arthur’s release is a testament to the power of justice and fairness in our society. It demonstrates that no matter how long one has been convicted, innocence can prevail when proper procedures are followed. This case reminds us all that everyone deserves due process and deserve fair representation regardless of their circumstances or backgrounds. Tommy Arthur should finally be able to move on with his life free from injustice and fear for what lies ahead – something none of us truly know but hope it brings him joy, peace & happiness as he finds himself free at last after all these years spent behind bars waiting for justice that never came until today!
