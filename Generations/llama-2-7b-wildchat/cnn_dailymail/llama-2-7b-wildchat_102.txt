1) "The markets are volatile at the moment. They're up and down like a yo-yo." Navinder Sarao told the BBC in an interview at his home in west London on Tuesday 7 January, after he had been charged by the US authorities with conspiracy to manipulate prices, wire fraud and spoofing.
2) "I'm really looking forward to this. It will be a chance for me to put my side of the story across," said Mr Sarao who has been charged in relation to the 6 May 2010 flash crash on Wall Street which caused chaos on global markets and resulted in $1 trillion being wiped off stock values.
3) "I'm not a criminal, I don't even smoke or drink. I've got three kids to look after." said Mr Sarao.
4) "I've made over £1 million in the last month alone." The trader who earned around $500,000 (£350,000) a year from day trading told the BBC he was still making profits even though he had been suspended by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange since May 2010 and his broker has stopped trading.
5)"I don't understand why I have been charged with conspiracy to manipulate prices in a market where everybody is trying to do the same thing." said Mr Sarao, who was arrested at Heathrow airport after returning from holiday in India on 6 March and later bailed.
6) "It's all just a big misunderstanding." he added.
