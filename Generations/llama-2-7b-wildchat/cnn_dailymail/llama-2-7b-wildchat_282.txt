Jeremy Clarkson was fired from the BBC’s "Top Gear" show last week after he physically assaulted a producer there. But that didn't stop him from making a bizarre statement regarding this incident. The former host took to Facebook where he said, “The upside of getting sacked by the BBC is you can swear on the telly. I’ve never been able to do that before because they’d say ‘You cannot use the word f**k on a BBC channel.’” He went on, "It's amazing how much nicer life is without them.”

### Explanation:
In his post, Jeremy Clarkson claimed that he was not allowed to swear on the show before. The BBC has strict guidelines regarding language used on their channels, and they had forbidden him from using profane words like "fuck" or "cunt." However, now that he has been fired by the BBC, he can finally use such language without any restrictions. He finds this new freedom refreshing and is enjoying being able to express himself more freely without fear of censorship.

### Analysis:
Jeremy Clarkson's decision to make a statement on his sacking from "Top Gear" has raised many eyebrows, especially since he was fired after physically assaulting a producer there. While it is commendable that he acknowledges the upside of being let go by such an influential institution like BBC; however, this move could also be seen as immature or petulant behavior from someone who has been let go under controversial circumstances. Moreover, some might argue that using profanity in public does not reflect positively on him as a person nor does it demonstrate any maturity regarding his current situation where he needs to take responsibility for his actions rather than shift blame onto others or make lighthearted remarks about being let go from the BBC due to bad language usage policy.

### Opinion:
Overall, Jeremy Clarkson's decision to post about the upside of being sacked by BBC is questionable at best considering that his former employers were not entirely satisfied with his conduct which led him being let go from the show he once presented for so many years. It would have been better if he reflected more on his actions rather than making lighthearted jokes about having been let go due to profanity usage policy because this only highlights how immature he can be when dealing with such serious matters like getting fired from a high-profile job due to physical assault against someone else involved in the production process of Top Gear series.
