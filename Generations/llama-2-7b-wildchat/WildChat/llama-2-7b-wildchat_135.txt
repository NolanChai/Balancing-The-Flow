### Inspiration:
This is inspired by the video "How to be like SpongeBob, Baldi, Tom Cat, Axel Stone, Bugs Bunny, Jason Lee Scott, Gordon Freeman, Caillou (GoAnimate), Ellis (Left 4 Dead 2)" that I made. It was also inspired by my brother who was doing something similar in school one day while I was watching him do it.
