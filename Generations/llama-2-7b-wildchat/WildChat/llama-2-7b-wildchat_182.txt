The player character (James) faces waves of enemies consisting of a mix of the level's enemies as he progresses. The level ends with a boss fight against Christiano Valentino, the club owner. In this fight, James uses a combination of punches and dodges to avoid Valentino's attacks. When Valentino attempts to throw a punch, James jumps out of the way, landing a counter-attack on his opponent.
Valentino attempts to dodge James' punches by moving around the stage, but James stays focused and maintains his composure throughout the fight. As Valentino tries to gain an advantage by lunging forward with a jumping kick, James quickly counters with a straddle takedown, taking the boss down to the ground.
However, before he can land another blow, Valentino summons two twin secretaries named Ying and Yang. They join the fight and attack James from behind with a jumping kick and triangle chokehold respectively. Despite this new challenge, James remains unphased as he dodges their attacks and counters them with a straddle takedown on each of them.

As the fight continues, Valentino realizes that his tactics are failing and tries to regain control by firing shots from his handgun at James. However, James manages to dodge all of the bullets and uses the distraction to perform a bodyslam, taking out both Valentino and Ying and Yang in one powerful move.
With the boss defeated, James continues onwards into the club and discovers that he has reached the end of the stage. As he enters an alleyway leading outside of the club, he is faced with another enemy group composed of Bouncers, Pole Dancers, Strippers, and Bouncer. However, thanks to his training and determination, James quickly dispatches all of these enemies without breaking a sweat.
After eliminating every single enemy on this stage, James finally reaches the final boss fight against Dr. Zero, the leader of the Skull Cross Gang. After an intense battle between both sides, James emerges victorious and successfully defeats Dr. Zero and his minions, saving the day once again!
