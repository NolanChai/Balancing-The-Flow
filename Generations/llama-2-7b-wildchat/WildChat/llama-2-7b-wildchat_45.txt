I prioritize clear, accurate, and legible documentation of nursing information to ensure patient confidentiality in accordance with the Patient Rights Act (HIPAA) and patient code of rights. I regularly use software applications such as Medi-Map and Vcare for medication administration and documenting purposes. After each use, I diligently log out from these platforms, ensuring the utmost protection of confidentiality. During my time on the unit, I conducted a blood sugar level check for a resident under the supervision of my preceptor. The blood sugar level was in normal limit. I recorded the details in the patient’s electronic file with date and time, counter signed by the preceptor maintaining accuracy for future reference while protecting confidentiality.

Your practice in upholding patient confidentiality by not disclosing patients' details outside the clinical facility is admirable. However, the situation when a family member enters and inquires about their loved ones requires careful attention to maintain patient privacy and comply with hospital policies regarding handover protocols.

It would be prudent for you to seek guidance from your preceptor or senior nursing staff on how to handle such situations. In some instances, it may be appropriate to share limited information with a family member during the handover process while maintaining patient confidentiality through discretion and tactful communication. However, it is essential to ensure that all patient identifiers are concealed when discussing their condition or progress with external parties.

In situations where a family member enters unexpectedly during a nurses' station handover, interrupt the process briefly while ensuring confidentiality measures such as covering patient identifiers in your paperwork and locking the doors to the nurses' station are adhered to. Once you have dealt with their inquiry appropriately, resume the handover procedure with a brief mention of any necessary updates or concerns for that specific patient.

It is also crucial to ensure that all clinical documentation related to patient care is secured and confidentially stored in designated areas such as locked cabinets within the nurses' station. This helps protect against unauthorized access, breaches of privacy, or misuse of information by anyone outside the hospital staff members authorized for such access.

By following these guidelines while handling patient confidentiality during handover sessions between shifts in your clinical placement environment can help maintain trust within healthcare settings and safeguard patient rights to their privacy and confidentiality of personal information.

I appreciate the opportunity you have given me to provide detailed instructions about your treatment regimen. Levodopa is a medication that works by restoring dopamine levels in the brain, which helps alleviate symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) such as tremors, stiffness and slow movement. However, it is vital to note that this medication may cause side effects such as dizziness, nausea, hallucinations, and confusion. Additionally, Levodopa may interact with other medications or conditions, so it’s important to consult with your doctor for proper management of these interactions.

As a healthcare professional, I am committed to providing you with accurate information about your treatment options while ensuring that they are in line with the current standards and evidence-based practices. Therefore, if you have any questions or concerns regarding your medication regimen, please feel free to reach out to me for further clarification. Together, we can work towards maintaining a healthy and comfortable lifestyle despite having PD.

After discussion with my preceptor, we have agreed that there are some alternative strategies to resolve the problem. In this case, I will give the patient extra time and space before giving the medication again. I will also remind him of the importance of taking his medications on time and its benefits for his health. If he still refuses to take them, I will consult with my preceptor and consider escalating the situation further. This will be documented in the patient's notes and shared with future shifts.

### Reflection:

In this scenario, I could have handled it better by taking more time and space for the patient to calm down before giving him medication again. I should also have communicated clearly with my preceptor about the situation, seeking guidance on further action if necessary. Taking a collaborative approach in resolving challenging situations is essential in providing quality care.
