> Script 1 (Female) : 
> The camera pans over the street in front of apartment building where our protagonist, Tara is seen walking out of her flat with an air of urgency on her face. She rushes towards the stairwell leading to the entrance of the building and is about to unlock the door when she realizes that her key is missing. Her eyes widen in panic as she frantically looks around for it, but to no avail. She desperately tries to find another way inside while maintaining a sense of urgency on her face. The camera moves towards her and she breaks down into tears with the sound of crying heard from a distance.
> 
> Cut to : Tara's flatmate, Shona sitting in her living room. She is seen wearing casual attire, probably after coming back from work or school. The camera moves towards Shona as she hears a knock on the door and rises up with an excited smile on her face thinking it might be her friend calling over for some fun time.
> 
> Tara (Off-screen voice): Shona! You home?
> 
> As Shona opens the door, she is met by the sight of a frantic and teary-eyed Tara who stands before her with a bowl filled with poop in one hand. Her eyes are red from crying, and she looks exhausted as if she had been running for hours.
> 
> Shona: Tara! What's wrong? Are you alright?
> 
> Cut to : Inside the apartment building where we see Tara trying to unlock her door with a key but failing miserably due to lack of proper lighting and security arrangements. She desperately tries to find another way in through a window or some other means, but fails again as she realizes how hard it is to get inside without a proper key. The camera pans over to Shona who stands on the other side of door waiting for Tara's response.
> 
> Tara (Voice): No! I lost my damn key and now I can't enter. Please help me, I need to move my bowels right now.
> 
> Shona: Calm down, Tara. Why don't you use the public washroom? It's only a few minutes away from here. We can go there together if that makes you feel better.
> 
> Cut to : Outside the apartment building where we see people walking around and enjoying their time in the city with no sign of Tara or Shona. They are both out of sight, as the camera pans over to focus on some passerby who's having a normal conversation without knowing what just happened inside the building.
> 
> Tara (Voice): No! I hate public washrooms and I won't go anywhere near that place. Besides, it will take way too long for me to reach there and back. Please help me or else I will die here.
> 
> Shona: Alright then, let me think of something else... (Shona tries to figure out some alternative ways to help Tara)
> 
> Cut to : Inside the flat where we see both women standing in front of their respective doors with a sense of despair on their face. The camera pans over to focus on Shona who is still thinking about what she can do to help her friend.
> 
> Tara (Voice): I tried calling you but it didn't work either. Please come inside and let me poop in peace, otherwise I will die here.
> 
> Cut to : Outside the apartment building where we see people walking around happily without knowing what just happened inside Tara's flat. They are all unaware of the struggle both women are going through at that moment.
> 
> Shona (Off-screen voice): Alright, I am coming... Just stay calm and don't freak out. I will be there as soon as possible.
> 
> Cut to : Inside Tara's flat where we see both women waiting for each other in front of their respective doors. Shona is seen opening the door while carrying a bag filled with necessary items such as some tissue paper and hand sanitizer which she planned to help her friend through this ordeal.
> 
> Tara (Voice): Thank god you came! Now let me poop first before we go anywhere else okay? I need it so badly right now...
> 
> Shona nods in agreement as she steps inside the apartment with a worried look on her face. The camera pans over to show us both women sitting at their respective doors with some tissue paper handy for cleaning up after Tara finishes pooping.
> 
> Cut to : Outside the apartment building where we see people walking around without any knowledge of what just happened inside Tara's flat. It seems like nothing extraordinary has taken place and everything is going smoothly as usual.
> 
> Shona (Voice): Now that you have pooped, let us go out for some fresh air. We need to get out of this apartment for a while or else the smell will make me sick too!
> 
> Cut to : Inside Tara's flat where we see both women standing up after cleaning themselves up with tissue papers provided by Shona earlier on. The camera pans over as they both leave their respective doors and walk out into the corridor together.
> 
> Shona (Voice): Alright then, let us go somewhere else where we can talk freely about this incident without anyone hearing us or seeing anything weird happening. I don't want any trouble from your neighbors or landlady finding out what happened today...
> 
> Cut to : Outside the apartment building where we see people walking around happily again, without knowing that something strange has just taken place inside Tara's flat. It seems like nothing extraordinary has transpired in this neighborhood as usual.
> 
> Shona (Voice): Alright then, let us go somewhere else where we can talk freely about this incident without anyone hearing us or seeing anything weird happening... (The camera pans over to focus on some passerby who is unaware of what just happened inside Tara's flat).
> 
> Cut to : Inside an abandoned park nearby where both women sit down on a bench and talk about their experience. The camera pans over as Shona asks Tara how she managed to hold her poop for so long before finally letting go in front of her own flatmate.
> 
> Tara (Voice): I tried my best but it was just too hard! There was no way that I could've waited any longer after holding it all this while... Besides, what if someone knocked on the door earlier or called me over the phone? That would have been even worse than what actually happened now!
> 
> Shona (Voice): Alright then, let us not worry about past anymore and focus on present instead. Let's make sure that nothing like this happens again in future... How are you going to handle such situations next time?
> 
> Cut to : Inside Tara's flat where we see her sitting down with a smile on her face as she thinks about what Shona just told her. The camera pans over as she reflects upon how difficult it was for her to let go of poop in front of someone so close and trustworthy like Shona without hesitation or embarrassment.
> 
> Tara (Voice): I guess that's what happens when you have a good friend like her by your side... If anything ever goes wrong, she will always be there for me without judging or criticizing me in any way possible! Thank god for her presence today - otherwise things could've gotten worse than they already did...

> 
> Shona nods in agreement while smiling at Tara's words before both women leave the park together and go their separate ways, leaving us with a sense of relief and contentment that everything turned out just fine in the end despite some initial hiccups along the way.

The friendship between Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor is a testament to the power of female solidarity. Throughout their respective careers, these trailblazing women faced adversities together while also advocating for gender equality alongside each other. In this essay, I will explore how they formed an alliance that strengthened them during tough times and helped them shape American history with their shared values of justice and fairness.

The first instance where Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor demonstrated their friendship was in 1983 when the Supreme Court decided to hire Justice O'Connor as one of two women on the bench. At this time, only men sat on America’s highest court; however, this decision marked a major milestone for gender equity within American law firms and government institutions alike – making Sandra Day O'Connor one of just four female justices ever appointed to serve alongside them at any given time throughout history up until present day (Garcia). Throughout her tenure as Justice on the bench from 1981-2006, she worked closely with Ruth Bader Ginsburg who was also appointed in 1993 by President Clinton to serve as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court until now where she continues serving today (Garcia). Together these two women helped pave the way for future generations seeking justice through legal channels while shaping America's judicial system with their unique perspective on gender equality issues faced throughout American society since then.

A second instance where Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor demonstrated their friendship was when they both advocated against gender discrimination laws at various points in their careers – which ultimately led them to co-authored book "Fighting Words: A Supreme Court Justice on How The Right Went Wrong" back 2016 (O'Connor). Throughout this process they worked hand-in-hand discussing how best tackle issues related to equal pay for women among other topics while continuously educating one another about various legislative policies surrounding gender discrimination matters along the way (CNN). Ultimately these two women used their platform together during 2016 presidential election cycle where they both voiced concerns over Donald Trump's misogynistic remarks against Hillary Clinton -which ultimately led them towards becoming vocal opponents against his campaign during this time period as well (O'Connor).

Lastly another instance where Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor demonstrated their friendship was when they were both asked by President Barack Obama to join him on a trip abroad in 2014 -during which time he publicly thanked them for all their contributions towards shaping America’s judicial system throughout history (Garcia). It was an honorable gesture recognizing these two remarkable women who paved new paths when it comes down gender equality matters within our nation's lawmaking processes since then -something that still stands strong today thanks largely due efforts put forth both Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O'Connor throughout years passed.

Overall, through their friendship over decades these two remarkable women have continued working together towards promoting justice equality across American society while educating one another along way -ultimately making lasting impacts towards shaping future generations seeking justice through legal channels like never before ever since! Their mutual dedication to advancing gender equity issues throughout history is truly an inspiration for us all!
