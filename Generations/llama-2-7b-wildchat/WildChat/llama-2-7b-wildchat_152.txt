Write a new chapter for Charles.

When Charles arrived home after his victory, he found that William and Rose had already left, leaving behind a note on his kitchen counter. The note read: "Congratulations! You are now the champion of G City." It was written in William's handwriting with the little girl's signature at the bottom.

Charles smiled and read it again, reflecting on the day he had won against all odds. He remembered how James had doubted his chances, but he had pushed through despite his anxiety and fatigue.

As he went to open the refrigerator door, he came across an unfamiliar packet of rice noodles labeled "Rose's favorite." It was wrapped in plastic with a sticker from the supermarket that read "80 yuan/kg." He had never seen this particular brand before and wondered if Rose or William had purchased it.

Charles decided to prepare himself a warm meal, feeling grateful for their kindness. He went to the kitchen sink and turned on the tap, ready to wash his hands after chopping the vegetables. Suddenly, he felt someone's eyes behind him, and instinctively looked over his shoulder.

As Charles stared in horror, Rose stood before him, looking at him with tears in her eyes. She held a bouquet of flowers in her hand and stammered out a simple "Thank you." He didn't know what to say or do as he was taken aback by her appearance. 

The two stood there awkwardly for several moments before Rose turned away, unable to meet his gaze. Charles tried to speak, but nothing came out, leaving them both silent in the kitchen.

Finally, Rose broke their silence with a quiet "good night" and left Charles stunned by her unexpected visit. He stood there, watching her disappear into the distance. The tears that had formed in his eyes disappeared just as quickly as she did. 

Charles felt overwhelmed with emotions; grateful for Rose's gesture of kindness but also uncertain about how he should react to it. As he returned to chopping the vegetables, a question arose within him: Why was Rose so afraid of William?
