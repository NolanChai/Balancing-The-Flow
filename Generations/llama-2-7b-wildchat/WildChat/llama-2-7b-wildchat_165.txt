The most challenging aspect of Raft was surviving in the open ocean. To stay alive, I had to build, craft, hunt and scavenge while protecting myself from the elements as well as sharks, other creatures and dangers lurking beneath the waves. It was a constant battle for survival and one step ahead at all times.
