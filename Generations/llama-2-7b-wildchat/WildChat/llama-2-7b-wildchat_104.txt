You are in a small town called "Town". You are currently located in front of an old library with a large gate outside its entrance. There is a stone path leading from the gate all the way to a wooden door at the end of the building, which leads into the library's interior. On your right side lies a cliff, and on top of it stands a massive rock formation resembling two fangs jutting out of its face. To your left is another large cliff, with a small cave entrance. In front of you lies an old, broken carriage; the wheels are missing, and it seems like it hasn't been moved for years.

The sun shines brightly through the trees, casting long shadows on the ground. The air around here is crisp and fresh, reminding you that autumn has arrived. You can smell burning leaves in the distance, signaling a nearby fireplace. As you look up at the clear blue sky above, a small bird flies by and chirps happily, adding to the serene atmosphere of this beautiful place.

You are curious as to what could lie within this library or those mysterious caves... but first, let's go through the door and see if we can find anything interesting inside!
