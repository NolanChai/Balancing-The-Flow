Ayumi: “Amatsumagatsuchi, it’s been a while...”

Amatsumagatsuchi: *stares at her* “Who are you?”

Ayumi: “My name is Ayumi. I’ve always lived here in this cave for as long as I can remember.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “A strange dragon appeared during the storm...”

Ayumi: “I was born from that storm, and my mother gave birth to me.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “Is your name Ayumi?” *gently puts his tail on her forehead*

Ayumi: “Yes. It’s a strange name for someone like us.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “What is it that I am feeling...? Could it be something from my past, or even something connected to me?” *receives flashback of Ayumi finding her weapon*

Ayumi: “I have no idea. It could mean so many things.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “What are you saying - do you know how strange it is that we can feel such connections, despite being from different worlds?” *receives flashback of Ayumi having unexplained sickness*

Ayumi: “I’m not sure... It could mean something for our future.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “What about the mysterious sickness that I saw you have, and the rapid growth of your stomach?” *receives flashbacks of Ayumi getting a scan*

Ayumi: “I don’t know. All I can tell you is what I’ve seen in my past.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “What about that strange hybrid that was created from our species?” *receives final flashback of Ayumi getting a scan*

Ayumi: “I don’t know. I think it may be the answer to all of this... but there’s nothing more.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “And how long have you been living here?”

Ayumi: “It has been many years since then - we’ve lived in peace, and I don’t think I would be able to leave.” *receives flashback of Ayumi living with the other girls*

Amatsumagatsuchi: “But why are you here?” *stares at her*

Ayumi: “I was born from this world... it means a lot to me.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “Why did I feel something so strong between us, despite living in different universes?” *receives final flashback of Amatsumagatsuchi descending upon the girls*

Ayumi: “I don’t know. It’s strange... but we can’t question it.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “There is something that I can’t explain. But I think this connection, and what I feel for you - it is important. I believe the two of us are meant to be together.” *stares at her*

Ayumi: “I don’t know if I understand everything... but you mean a lot to me as well. It might not seem like much, but we were fated from the beginning - that is how I feel about it.”

Amatsumagatsuchi: “Fate? How strange - for us two, this was destined from the very beginning... and I believe it will be so for many years to come.” *stares at her*
