DC's Blue Beetle has a legacy, which is rare in the superhero movie genre.
A lot of comic book movies have come and gone since DC’s original universe began back in 2016 with Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel. These films followed their own storylines with little to no regard for what came before, and even the upcoming DCU has yet to acknowledge these previous stories or characters from the DCEU. However, Blue Beetle is about to change all that, as it will be the first live-action movie to include the concept of passing down a superhero's legacy and mantle to the next generation.

In many ways, Blue Beetle is an old school comic book story that has been told for decades in many different forms. Jaime Reyes’ story began all the way back in 2006 when Keith Giffen and John Rogers teamed up to create a new incarnation of the scarab-wielding hero. The first Blue Beetle was Dan Garrett, an archaeologist who became the original hero after discovering the Scarab artifact which gave him superpowers. Once he passed away, his mantle and powers were then passed on to Ted Kord, a rich businessman who also got the powers of the scarab from another source.
In 2007, the original Blue Beetle title was cancelled as Garrett's grandson, Jamie Reyes, took up the name in the pages of Teen Titans. This version of the character became so popular that he even got his own series titled Blue Beetle in 2011. Jaime’s story has been told for well over a decade now and it was only natural that when DC brought him to live action, they would acknowledge his predecessors and their legacies as the filmmaker does in an interview with Collider.

The legacy of a hero is often left out when adapting comics to live-action, so it is refreshing that the movie will make Jaime Reyes’ predecessors a part of the world around him. Ted Kord may be dead, but he has his own place in history as a member of the Justice League and an ally to Booster Gold. Dan Garrett was one of the first superheroes and had a legacy that continues to influence Jaime’s life and career even after his death.
The fact that Blue Beetle will be passing down this mantle to Jaime makes him special, as he is the third character to don the scarab in the main universe continuity. This type of storytelling has been missing from a lot of movies, with most stories featuring heroes who come out of nowhere and have no past or history before their appearance on screen.
With James Gunn set to produce Blue Beetle and co-wrote the script with Kevin Kiner, it is likely that they will bring this story arc to the big screen in a way that fans can appreciate. As much as DC is trying to move away from the shared universe that Zack Snyder started, they are still going back to their roots of legacy and passing down the torch. Blue Beetle is set to be one of the first movies to embrace this idea, giving it a unique identity among superhero films in a market that has been lacking originality for some time now.
Blue Beetle hits cinemas on August 18th, 2023.
