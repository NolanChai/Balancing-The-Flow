### Instructions for Participant:

Dave, you’re standing with your feet flat on the ground, eyes closed, back straight, hands loosely clasped behind your head. You feel a sense of peace & calmness in this position… like everything is alright and nothing to fear. You begin to hear Megan’s voice whispering into your ear: “You are feeling very sleepy... all the stress has left you body.” As she continues, you slip deeper into this hypnotic state, relaxing even more deeply with each word. Your eyes start to close… and before long, they drift shut on their own. You feel as if you’re floating in a peaceful sea of tranquility... completely unaware of your surroundings. Megan continues speaking softly but firmly into your ear: “You will do exactly what I ask… without question or hesitation.” As the words echo within your mind, you begin to surrender control and let yourself be guided by this powerful force. Your body starts to obey every command with absolute precision as if it were programmed for perfection. It’s like something else is taking over... controlling all of your actions & movements effortlessly through Megan’s voice alone. “You are no longer in control… I am.” She speaks once again, bringing you out of this trance-like state: "Open your eyes and return to a normal consciousness." As you do so, you feel rejuvenated & refreshed… ready for whatever life throws at you next.

### Instructions for Facilitator: 

This hypnosis script should be performed by a skilled practitioner who is experienced in inducing hypnotic states and directing suggestions to their participants. It's important that the facilitator uses clear and confident language, enunciating each word with precision so as not to confuse or mislead Dave into thinking he may have entered another trance state rather than just a deepening one!

### Aftercare:

Megan should offer some verbal aftercare instructions for Dave's safety post-hypnotic induction. Encourage him to rest & relax for the remainder of the day, reassuring that this was an experimental experience only meant for fun & entertainment purposes! Remind Dave not to drive or operate heavy machinery while under its influence as it could have potentially dangerous implications on his mind & body if left unchecked.

### Summary:

In summary, this script utilizes Megan's natural hypnosis abilities combined with her own playful personality that makes Dave susceptible to suggestion easily! The combination of deepening techniques & powerful directives create an immersive experience where he submits entirely under her control... making him do whatever she says without question or hesitation! As always, it's important for any hypnosis session to include appropriate aftercare instructions so as not only ensure Dave's safety but also his overall well-being too.
