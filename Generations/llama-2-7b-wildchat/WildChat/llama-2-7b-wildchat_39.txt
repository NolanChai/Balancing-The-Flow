1. Purchase one 8oz can of Redi-Whip (cream) from the grocery store and place it in your cooler for the day of the event.
2. Add about 6 oz of water, 5 oz of isopropyl alcohol, a handful of sugar, and an equal amount of salt to the canister. Shake vigorously until completely blended. (You may add more/less water or alcohol if it seems too thick).
3. Add 2-3 teaspoons of food dye in small amounts to create your desired color smoke bomb. We recommend red, orange, yellow and green for fireworks, purple, blue and silver for holidays. (Be creative! You can make any color you like!)
4. Shake until blended and then spray it out into the air. 5. The alcohol will evaporate quickly while the cream stays behind as a residue to enhance the effects of the smoke bomb.
6. If you have any remaining product, add water to thin it out for additional use during the day.
