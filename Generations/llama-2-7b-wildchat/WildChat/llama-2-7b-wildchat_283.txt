14. Monitor & Evaluate

1.	To establish a viral loop and gain a steady growth rate for our brand we need to increase the quality of content that we are producing. This will help us build trust with our audience and improve the amount of traffic that is driven organically from social media.

2.	We should create a referral program which includes an incentive for both referring doctors and referred patients. This would help generate more word-of-mouth marketing through doctors. Referring physicians can be incentivized with exclusive coupons/deals to their patients that are being treated by them at no cost, as a way of saying thank you for promoting our brand among their own patient community.

3.	To target physicians specifically we should create an educational content series that is geared towards educating doctors about ADHD and how they can help treat it more effectively through our teletherapy services. We could provide insights on trends related to ADHD treatment, share best practices with other medical professionals in the industry, etc., which would show them the value of working together as a team when treating patients suffering from this mental illness.

### Assignment:
Create an account on LinkedIn and post your strategy on the 3-month sales strategy using virality, referrals and targeting physicians focused on ADHD group in LinkedIn with the description of what you have done and why

### Response:
I would like to create a 3 month sales strategy that uses viral loops, referral programs and targeted advertisements to market our teletherapy platform for treating ADHD.

Firstly, I believe it is important to create high quality content in order to establish a strong presence on social media channels such as Instagram or Facebook. This will help us gain more organic traffic through these networks while also increasing brand awareness among potential customers who may not know about our services yet but are looking for solutions related to ADHD treatment online. Additionally, we can create engaging visuals and infographics which would be shared by doctors or other health professionals in the field who have seen value from working with us before; this type of word-of-mouth marketing is extremely effective when trying promote our business further within this specific niche group community without having to spend heavily on advertisements or other paid media methods at first stage.

Secondly, I will set up a referral program where both physicians referring patients towards us would receive exclusive offers/discounts while also providing them an incentive for spreading the word about our services among their own patient network; this would enable us to tap into even more potential clients who may have been unaware of what we offer until now but are now interested after being referred by someone they trust already.

Finally, I will look at targeted ads where we can focus on reaching out directly towards those physicians who specialize in treating ADHD or other related mental illnesses since they would know more about how our service fits into their practice setup compared to other general ads that don't necessarily cater specifically towards this field; this could further enhance conversions down the line due to greater relevancy between both parties involved here - ourselves being able to better explain why teletherapy has become increasingly popular nowadays while doctors understand why they should recommend us as part of their treatment plans when needed for specific cases involving ADHD patients etc..
