Reza and Anneliese walk up the stairs of the hospital. They are quite excited about being put in a room together, which Reza finds amusing since he only had one night stand with her and it was a week ago. He wonders if this is some sort of "disease".

Anneliese sits down on a bed next to him and says, “So what are we supposed to do here? I assume we’re not allowed to have sex in here.” Reza just laughs at the joke and Anneliese smiles back. She asks if there’s anything he wants to get off his chest first, to which Reza replies that she is so beautiful it would be a pleasure for him to do so, but then notices she has an IV drip in her arm. He laughs and says “Well at least I can still look.”

Anneliese playfully smiles at his comment, but the mood quickly changes when nurse Luciana walks into their room with another man in tow.

Luciana turns around as she sees Reza sitting on Anneliese’s bed and says “Reza, we can’t have you in here. You are not allowed to be within a 20 foot radius of any patients.”

Anneliese looks up at Reza with a surprised look on her face, while Luciana continues “And I understand why. But unfortunately for you two lovebirds, Anneliese is a bit ill and has an IV drip in her arm, so we have to keep her away from any potential sources of sickness.”

Reza chuckles and says "I'm sure I can get that out of her pretty fast." Anneliese glares at him playfully while Luciana asks if he understands the rules. Reza replies confidently “Of course, but doesn’t this mean we still have to stay in separate rooms?”

Luciana smirks and says “Actually no. We are quite short staffed today so I think it would be best for you two to share a room.”

Reza is shocked at first by the news, but then realizes that this is an excellent opportunity for him and Anneliese to spend some quality time together. He smiles at her and says “Well then, looks like we’re gonna be roommates after all.”

Anneliese rolls her eyes playfully as Luciana leaves them alone in the room. Reza sits down next to her again on the bed while Anneliese asks if he is serious about sharing a room with her here. He nods and replies “Of course, we have nothing else to do for now except entertain each other.”

Anneliese smiles at him knowingly as she looks into his eyes. Suddenly they both burst out laughing together in excitement at their newfound situation.

### Extra:

As Reza and Anneliese laugh, Luciana stands at the doorway with a knowing smile. She turns to walk away but not before winking at them as if she has something else planned for later. They watch her leave before bursting out laughing once more.
