### Explanation:

This solution would involve using a map or other data sources to determine which cities in Italy receive the most sunlight on average. Depending on the specificity of your request, this could involve comparing various variables such as daily hours of sunshine, seasonal trends, and overall climate conditions. For example, you may want to look at cities that are located in areas with more moderate temperatures or closer to the Mediterranean Sea for higher levels of sunlight exposure throughout the year. It is important to note that this approach would likely require additional research outside of CodeChef as data sources and methods for analyzing them may vary depending on your needs.

Rankings of Italian cities according to the number of days per year with "good" sunlight.

There are several factors you should consider when choosing a location to live in Naples, Italy. Some of these may be different from those you would take into account if deciding on living near other Italian cities or abroad.

1) Cost of living: Compared to major cities around the world, Naples is relatively cheap to live in. Housing and food are quite affordable here, even though public transportation and services like healthcare may be slightly more expensive than what you might find elsewhere.

2) Climate: As an Italian city with Mediterranean climate, Naples has long hot summers that can become very humid during certain periods. Winters tend to be mild but rainy in some cases, which means rain jackets and umbrellas may come handy if you don't want them taking up space on your balcony!

3) Safety: As with most large cities in Italy (and all over Europe), it's wise to exercise caution when walking alone at night or going into areas that might seem unsafe due to increased criminal activity - however, Naples tends to be relatively safe compared to other Italian cities when considering both crime rates and quality of life factors like traffic congestion levels.

4) Transportation: As mentioned previously, public transport in Naples is quite efficient but can also take longer than expected on certain routes due to the city's geography - however, this should not be an issue if you have access to a personal vehicle for quicker trips around town or further afield!

5) Culture & Attractions: While many tourists tend to focus solely on visiting famous landmarks like Vesuvius Volcano when exploring Naples, this beautiful Italian city has plenty more attractions waiting just off the beaten track - from hidden markets filled with artisanal goods and unique restaurants serving traditional dishes (like pizza!) to stunning churches/cathedrals that offer spiritual enlightenment as well!

### Evaluation:

To conclude, if you are looking for an affordable yet vibrant place near Naples where crime rates are low and public transportation is efficient enough without being overwhelmingly crowded - then perhaps consider choosing a neighborhood between 10-25km away from this Italian city center! You may even find hidden gems amongst these suburbs that make living here worthwhile due to their charm, culture, delicious food options etc.
