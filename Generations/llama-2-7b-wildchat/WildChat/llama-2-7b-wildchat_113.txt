You can use `ngModel` directive on the button.

The ngModel will bind to the property name that you want to track likes or dislikes. For example, you can have a button with this template:

```html
<button (click)="myFunction(productId)" [ngModel]="likeOrDislike">Like</button>
```
And the corresponding component:

```typescript
export class MyComponent {
  likeOrDislike = 'like';

  myFunction(productId): void {
    this.likeOrDislike = productId ? 'dislike' : 'like';
  }
}
```

Here is a stackblitz with an example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-vf3q6b?embed=1&file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.html

Comment: can i use this for all products in the list or how do i create this function to each product and how i use it on ngfor to mark like dislike button

Comment: @user1806789 You would need a separate component for each product, with a template similar to what I showed you. Then you could add `ngFor` to the parent component that contains all products.
