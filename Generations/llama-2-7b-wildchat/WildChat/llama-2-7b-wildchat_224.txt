Write a Day 1 script for the Jungle Myrmex Royal.

(Characters: Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex, [player])

(Scene: Jungle Myrmex Hive - day)

(The wing-like structures on Jade’s back are non-functional)

(Jade would start to construct a small den for the Myrmex slowly developing in her belly when the day begins - and Jade’s belly would be massive)

([player] would fall into the Jungle Myrmex Hive, ultimately landing in the throne room)

(Hours after [player] ends up in the throne room, Jade's water breaks suddenly - and she would bring her larva into the world with [player]'s help)
