As one of the most populous cities in North America, Toronto has witnessed rapid growth over the past two centuries. However, its urban planning has often been a failure, leading to a city that is divided by social and economic disparities, congested roads, and an uncoordinated transit system.

### One of the primary causes of these failures was the lack of a comprehensive long-term plan for the city's development. Instead, planning decisions were often made on a piecemeal basis, resulting in an ad hoc approach that failed to take into account the overall needs and aspirations of the population.

### The result has been a patchwork of neighborhoods with varying degrees of livability and sustainability. Inner city areas such as Downtown Toronto have seen significant investment and development, but at the expense of surrounding communities that are often neglected or ignored.

### A key example is the ongoing debate over the Gardiner Expressway, a major artery through downtown that has been criticized for blocking public access to waterfront areas. Proposals to remove it have faced fierce opposition from those who fear that it will exacerbate traffic congestion and threaten the city's economic vitality.

### Another issue is Toronto's fragmented transit system, which has failed to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population. The subway network was initially built for a city with half the current population, leading to overcrowding and delays during peak hours. The result has been an ongoing debate over the expansion of public transportation infrastructure.

### Social inequality has also played a role in Toronto's urban planning failures. The city's wealthiest neighborhoods have benefited from investment in amenities such as parks and recreational facilities, while less affluent communities struggle with issues like poor housing conditions and high crime rates. These disparities have been exacerbated by policies that favor certain areas over others.

### In response to these challenges, there are calls for a more comprehensive approach to planning that takes into account the needs of all residents, regardless of their economic status or location within the city. This could include measures such as increased investment in public transit, revitalization of neglected neighborhoods, and addressing social issues like poverty and inequality.

### However, there are also concerns about whether Toronto can overcome its history of fragmented planning and achieve a more cohesive and equitable future. The city faces significant challenges, including aging infrastructure, climate change, and competing interests among various stakeholders. But if it can embrace a more integrated approach to development, Toronto has the potential to become one of the most liveable cities in the world.

During the early settlement years (1968-1973), several factions were vying for political power and control over the city's future development. Some of these factions included:

* The Nationalists - They favored preserving traditional Chinese culture, maintaining close ties with China, and promoting stability and order in the city.
* The Capitalists - They believed that Singapore should embrace modernization and globalization, prioritizing economic growth and progress.
* The Laborers - They represented the working class, fighting for better wages and working conditions, as well as affordable housing and social services.
* The Merchants - They were interested in expanding trade relations with other countries, focusing on building a strong international port and developing industry-friendly policies.
* The Government - As the city's governing body, they had to balance various interests and concerns while ensuring stability and progress for Singapore as a whole.
