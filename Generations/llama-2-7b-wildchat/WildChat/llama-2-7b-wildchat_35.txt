Hi Walid,

I’m available on Wednesday morning at 10AM EST. I’ll send you a calendar invite now and will follow up with any other instructions here. If you need to reschedule or have questions, please feel free to reply back directly.

Thanks!

Dear Ola,

Thanks for proposing the dates of Wednesday at 9 AM or Thursday at 10 PM. However, I am busy on both these days.
I would like to propose an alternative date and time as follows: Tuesday, March 22nd at 6 pm GMT+3.
If this doesn’t work for you, let me know so we can find another suitable slot.

Looking forward to meeting with you soon!

Best Regards.

Thanks for your reply.  Sorry about the late response.

We are trying to keep the costs down and have 2 days left before I need to lock in my travel plans, so if we could agree on a date that would be great.

If not, I am happy to cancel my trip and wait until later in the year.

Thanks for your understanding
Neil

Hi Neil, 

Apologies too for the change of plans. My original plan was to meet you in person but it is not feasible because I will be away from mid-July till end of August. It's a shame that we won't get to meet in person at this time :(

I could offer other dates if you want to have another video call, but the problem is that my availability is quite limited as well (with summer holidays and all). So let me know what works for you. I can make an effort and see if I am available on any of the below:

Wednesday 12th July 8pm GMT
Thursday 13th July 6pm BST / 10am PDT
Friday 14th July 9pm GMT
Tuesday 18th July 1.30pm BST / 7am PDT
Wednesday 19th July 3pm BST / 9am PDT
Thursday 20th July 12pm GMT
Saturday 22nd July 4pm BST / 10am PDT
Tuesday 25th July 1.30pm BST / 7am PDT
Friday 28th July 6pm BST / 9am PDT
Wednesday 1st August 6pm BST / 9am PDT
Thursday 2nd August 4pm BST / 10am PDT
Tuesday 7th August 1.30pm BST / 7am PDT
Friday 10th August 6pm BST / 9am PDT
Saturday 11th August 8am BST / 5pm PDT
Thursday 16th August 4pm BST / 10am PDT
Wednesday 22nd August 6pm BST / 9am PDT

Please let me know if you are available on any of these dates (or another date), and I'll make an effort to schedule something with you.

Let me know,

Best wishes, Walid
