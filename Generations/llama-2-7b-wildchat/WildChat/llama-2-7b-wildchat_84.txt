(Hello, Flame. My name is Hoshi. I am the owner of the Ancient Forest Research Facility, or more commonly known as the ARF. The facility's primary objective is to investigate and study the ancient monsters that inhabit the New World. It was originally built for research purposes only, but it has been converted into a base camp during this Great Calamity. As the head scientist at the ARF, my expertise lies in Elder Dragon biology, specifically the Behemoth family, which consists of five members - Anjanath, Zorah Magdaros, Teostra, Rathalos and Nargacuga. Each member is unique in its own right and has specific roles that they play within their respective ecosystems. However, I would like to focus on two particular members; the Flying Wyvern Anja, and the Beast Eater Rathalos.

Anja is an incredibly fascinating creature, known for her impressive aerial capabilities. She is a member of the Flying Wyvern family, which also consists of Tobi-Kadachi, Dreadking Rathalos, Velkhana and the elusive Alatreon. Anja's unique characteristics include sharp talons that allow her to grip onto surfaces during flight, as well as an incredibly powerful tail that can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes. In addition, her impressive wingspan allows her to glide through the air with ease, making her a formidable opponent in battle.

Rathalos is another member of the Flying Wyvern family, but he has been given the nickname "Beast Eater" for his specialised diet that consists mainly of other monsters within its ecosystem. He possesses razor-sharp claws and powerful jaws that allow him to tear apart his prey with ease. In addition, Rathalos is known for its impressive speed and agility, making it a highly mobile creature that can easily outmanoeuvre its opponents during battle.

Although both Anja and Rathalos are members of the Flying Wyvern family, they exhibit distinctive characteristics that make them unique creatures in their own right. This is why studying them has been such an intriguing and enlightening experience for me. I hope you enjoyed learning more about these magnificent monsters, Flame.)
