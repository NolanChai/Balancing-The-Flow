[player]: "W-what is she talking about?"

(She seems like a very friendly girl, and I could tell that she was trying to get her baby out, but nothing was happening.)

Mindy: (to me) "Oh thank God! You're finally here!"

[player]: "Wait... Are you saying that you've been pregnant for the past 30 months?"

(I was surprised and confused by her statement. I'm pretty sure there's something wrong with Mindy.)

Mindy: (to me) "Oh my God, yes! It's been a long journey, but now that you're here, everything will be okay!"

[player]: "I-I don't know what to say..."

(I felt so bad for Mindy and her unborn baby. I had no idea how this situation could happen.)

Mindy: (to me) "Please, help me! My poor little one is stuck inside of me!"

[player]: "I-I'm sorry... but there isn't anything I can do to get your baby out."

(I wanted to say something encouraging and comforting, but there wasn't much that could be done in this situation.)

Mindy: (to me) "But you have to! Please, my son needs you!"

[player]: "If only I had a way to help."

(I wanted to give her some hope and support, but I wasn't sure what else to say. After all, she was in pain and desperate for help.)

Mindy: (to me) "Please! Just try... Anything!"

[player]: "Okay then... Let's see what we can do."

(I walked over to Mindy and put my hand on her stomach. I closed my eyes, trying to concentrate all of my energy into helping her baby come out.)

Mindy: (to me) "Thank you..."

[player]: "Here goes nothing... Let's see if we can get your son out."

(I focused on Mindy and her unborn baby for a few seconds. Suddenly, I felt an energy rush through my body. It was almost like electricity, but more powerful.)

Mindy: (to me) "OH MY GOD! IT'S HAPPENING!"

[player]: "Yes! I think he's coming out!"

(I could feel the baby pushing against Mindy's abdomen. It was a strange feeling, but exciting at the same time.)

Mindy: (to me) "Oh God... Oh my gosh, it hurts so much..."

[player]: "Hold on! This is almost over."

(The baby continued to push its way out. Suddenly, with one final push, Mindy screamed and her son came out into the world.)

Mindy: (in pain) "OH MY GOD!!! IT'S OUT!!!"

[player]: "Congratulations, mom! I hope you and your baby are doing well."

(I helped Mindy clean herself up. She looked exhausted but overjoyed with her newborn son. It was the most amazing moment in my life.)

Mindy: (to me) "You saved us both! Thank you so much!"

[player]: "Anytime, I'm just glad we could help."

(After a while of resting and bonding with her baby, Mindy said goodbye to me.)

Mindy: (to me) "Thank you again for everything. It means more than words can say."

[player]: "It was my pleasure to meet you both. I hope we can stay in touch!"

(I couldn't believe that something so amazing could happen, but it did. Thanks to Mindy and her son, I have a whole new appreciation for life.)
