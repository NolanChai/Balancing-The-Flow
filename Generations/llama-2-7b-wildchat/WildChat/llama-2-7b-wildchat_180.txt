In the bar scene, the group is enjoying each other's company after work. The conversation shifts towards hypnosis, and Nadine decides to play around by pretending to hypnotize David. As she begins the induction, she notices how easy it is for her to get him into trance, and everyone is surprised when he falls under her spell.

As David remains in a deep state of hypnosis, the group teases and laughs at his obedience to Nadine's commands. He kneels before her like a slave and massages her sweaty feet without question or resistance. This is a powerful display of Nadine's influence over David, who has no control in trance state.

Nadine brings David out of hypnosis gradually, reminding him that he is very easy to hypnotize. She ends with everyone's reactions, which are amused and surprised at the extent of David's obedience in a deep trance state. The group realizes how powerful hypnosis can be when used properly.
