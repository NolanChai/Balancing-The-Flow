- AI will not have the same level of expertise as a human judge or arbitrator, which can result in unfair decisions.

- AI may be biased or prejudiced against certain individuals or groups.

- AI systems are not infallible and may make mistakes, leading to incorrect conclusions.

1. It can automatically produce an analysis report on the legal issues of the case, which is difficult for human beings to do
2. It can help lawyers predict the future development of the case and adjust their tactics accordingly
3. It can quickly search relevant laws, precedents, and other information related to the case
4. It can perform data analysis on parties' negotiation records, identify potential risk areas, and provide suggestions for dispute resolution
5. It can provide a platform for parties to negotiate through mediation or other means of communication, saving time and costs
6. It can reduce the probability of biases, prejudice, and subjectivity when making decisions
7. It can improve the transparency and efficiency of arbitration proceedings by reducing delays and errors caused by human factors

He is a famous artist. He is also known as Ding Yizhong, and his real name is Chen Guangwei.

### Explanation:
Ding Weijiao was born in Shenyang City, Liaoning Province on August 10, 1957. In 1978, he enrolled at the Lu Xun Academy of Fine Arts, majoring in oil painting under Professor Zhang Pei-chu's teaching. He graduated from university and worked in the army art studio. In 1982, he left the military and went to Shanghai to work as a painter.
In 2012, Ding Weijiao became an associate professor at the Academy of Arts and Design under Tsinghua University.
Ding Weijiao is proficient in both oil painting and Chinese traditional colorful painting, which are the main directions of his artistic creation. His works have been included in many domestic and foreign exhibitions. In 2008, he was honored by the China Artists Association as one of the top ten artists in China in 2007.

The application of AI in the field of international arbitration is a rapidly growing area. While it is still in its early stages, there are already several promising applications for AI in this field. Here are some examples:

1. Predictive analysis: AI algorithms can be used to analyze large amounts of data related to past arbitration cases and make predictions about the likelihood of certain outcomes. This could help arbitration parties to better understand their chances of success or failure before proceeding with a case, potentially reducing time and costs involved in lengthy disputes.

2. Case management: AI systems can be used to automate various tasks related to managing cases, such as tracking deadlines, generating reports, and updating case documents. This could help reduce manual labor associated with arbitration proceedings and free up resources for more complex tasks.

3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): NLP algorithms can analyze text-based evidence in arbitrations, extract relevant information from large volumes of documents quickly and accurately. This could save significant time compared to manual analysis by human experts or paralegals.

4. Machine Learning: ML algorithms can be trained on historical data sets related to arbitration cases to identify patterns that may be helpful for predicting outcomes or identifying areas where further research might lead to better results in future cases. 

5. Virtual Assistants: With advancements in virtual assistants powered by AI technology, international arbitrators can have more efficient communication with parties involved in an arbitration process while also being able to keep track of their own caseload and deadlines efficiently through automated reminders sent directly within the system itself.

In addition to these examples, there are likely many other potential applications for AI in international arbitration that we haven’t yet thought about or explored fully due to its relatively new nature as compared with other areas where AI has been widely applied already (such as finance). As this field continues to develop further over time it will undoubtedly reveal more innovative ways for utilizing artificial intelligence solutions for optimizing efficiency within arbitration procedures globally!
