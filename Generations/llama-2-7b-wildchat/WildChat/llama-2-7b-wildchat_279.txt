The scene opens on a bright and sunny day in the city of Toronto, Canada. Heather Schmidt (age 49), a confident and assertive woman, enters an upscale medical supply store. She has recently become a single mother after her husband left them for another woman, leaving behind their daughter Susan who was involved in an accident and is recovering from hip surgery with bilateral spica casts.

Heather enters the store looking for special wheelchairs or other equipment to help Susan during her recovery process. She walks through the aisles browsing the different products available, carefully analyzing each one before making her selection. As she passes by various stands displaying items such as hospital beds and reacher grabbers, she suddenly stops in front of an array of colorful adult diapers displayed on shelves.

Heather's eyes widen with surprise as she stares at the packaging labels - some even boasting names like "Amazing Absorbent" or "Dry Like A Diva." She quickly glances around to make sure no one is watching before approaching one of these boxes and reading its description carefully.

Heather's expression changes from disbelief to curiosity as she reads further into the box's details: "Superior moisture-wicking technology keeps skin dry without feeling wet!" Her eyes widen once more, this time filled with intrigue at such an incredible innovation for her daughter's needs.

She continues browsing through other products until finally settling on a particular brand of adult diapers that seem ideal for Susan's condition: they provide maximum absorbency while still being discreet and comfortable enough so she can wear them with confidence throughout the day without feeling self-conscious about her appearance.

After carefully considering all available options, Heather makes her selection at the counter before leaving with several packs under her arm - determined to ensure that Susan's recovery will be as smooth as possible despite any physical limitations caused by the accident she suffered months ago...
