No. The exposure value of your camera has nothing to do with the tone of an image, which is controlled by its colour temperature. In other words, it doesnâ€™t matter what EV you shoot at; as long as your lighting conditions remain constant (i.e., constant illuminant and distance) a grey 18% object will always look like grey 18%.
