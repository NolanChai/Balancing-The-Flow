Thank you for sending me this information on our IC meeting last Friday and some new feedbacks from some of our institutional investor clients. 

We have discussed these issues several times already and I know that the team is actively looking at solutions to ensure that we can still attract more AUMs for the next year. We will continue working closely with you, and keep you informed as soon as any updates are available on the matter.  

We value our relationship and always appreciate your support in making sure that we provide all necessary information to our institutional clients to help them make sound investment decisions. 

Thank you for your time and dedication.


### Response:
Thanks a lot for sending me the summary of this week IC meeting. I am very glad to see how active you are in communicating with some of our clients on the performance of SIS (4%) and CMS (7%), as well as their concerns about deposit rates. It is reassuring that we have an effective channel for two-way communication, allowing us to address these issues quickly and effectively.

We appreciate your efforts in providing valuable insights into our institutional investors' needs and feedbacks. Your work is vital in maintaining a strong relationship with our clients and ensuring their continued trust and support.

Once again, thank you for the summary and I look forward to your further updates on this matter.
