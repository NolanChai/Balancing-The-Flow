The most important thing you need to know about human memory is that,
like a computer's hard drive, it doesnâ€™t keep everything. This means
that we only have access to the limited information from our short-term
memory at any given moment; if there is new information that needs to be
stored, something else has to go. 

To store new memories in long-term memory, they must first pass through
short-term memory. When we are trying to recall a memory, we have
access to both short and long-term memory; however, without practice and
repetition, these memories can be forgotten as well.

Therefore, the human memory works in two ways: It stores new
information through repetition and it can retrieve information from
memory if given enough time and space for recalling them. To strengthen
the connection between short-term memory cells and long-term
recollection requires practice or review; otherwise those memories will
be lost over time due to weakening connections between neurons in the
brain.

In conclusion, human memory works by storing new information through
repetition while retrieving existing ones require space for recalling them.
Therefore it's important that we continue to practice and review what we
want to remember if we want it stored long-term within our brains.

### Explanation: 

The first part of the answer states that human memory is comparable to a computer hard drive in its limited storage capacity, forcing us to continually store new information and erase old ones. This comparison emphasizes the concept of selective attention, which means our brain cannot process all incoming sensory stimuli at once; instead, we actively seek out and focus on only certain pieces of information that are deemed important. 

The second part delves deeper into how these memories get stored in long-term memory storage. It highlights the importance of repetition as well as practice or review for retrieving those stored memories over time without them becoming forgotten due to weakened connections between neurons in our brain cells resulting from lacking exposure or use over an extended period. 

The third part concludes by emphasizing how essential it is for us to continue practicing what we want to remember if we wish for those memories to stay long term within our brains; otherwise, they will eventually be forgotten due to lack of engagement with them regularly throughout daily activities or life events. 

In summary, this answer highlights three core components essential to human memory: selective attention, storage capacity limitations, and retention through repetition & practice/review cycles necessary for retrieval later on down the line when needed again sometime in future instances where these memories come into play once more during daily activities or life events etc...
