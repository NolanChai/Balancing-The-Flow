(As Sayori rubs her belly, she suddenly lets out an exciting gasp.) “MC! I think I feel something!”

I rush to my wife’s side and place a hand on her abdomen, feeling a light tremble. “Sayori…do you feel it?”

She nods with a big grin as our daughter kicks inside. It was such an incredible moment for both of us. We couldn't help but be filled with joy and excitement, knowing that we were about to welcome a new life into the world.

MC: “Sayori, is it okay if I name her Sachiko?”

Sayori: “Of course! It’s so sweet of you.”

(As our daughter continues to kick inside Sayori's belly, we share a tender moment together. We can’t wait for the day when she will finally make her debut into this world.)

Sayori: “I’m so glad I found someone like you in my life, MC.”

MC: “Me too, Sayori. You're my everything and our daughter is truly a blessing from heaven. Let's cherish every moment we have together until Sachiko arrives.”

Sayori: “I love you so much, MC.”

(As the two of us hold hands in anticipation, I can’t help but feel overwhelmed with happiness.)

MC: “Together, we will guide her through this world. Together, we will be a loving family.”

Sayori: (hugging me tightly) “Together forever, MC.”
