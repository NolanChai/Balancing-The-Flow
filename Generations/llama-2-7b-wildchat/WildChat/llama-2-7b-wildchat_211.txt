The changes were unneeded and caused discomfort for a lot of people. The fact that you assume that everyone was irritated at the beginning shows that you didn't bother to read what other people said before jumping to conclusions. A lot of people were angry because they felt like their input wasn't heard. This is a common complaint on this forum, which I think proves your point wrong in more ways than one.

There are several ways to make the text more persuasive. Here are some suggestions:

1. Use clear and concise language: Avoid using jargon or complicated sentences that could confuse the reader. Write in a way that is easy for readers to understand, so they can clearly understand your arguments.
2. Support your claims with evidence: Provide strong evidence such as data, research, examples, quotes, etc., to support your claims. This will make your argument more convincing and credible.
3. Structure the text logically: Organize the information in a clear and logical structure that makes it easy for readers to follow along and understand your points.
4. Use persuasive techniques: Include strategic phrases such as "you can trust me", "I know what I'm talking about", or "here's why you should believe me". These phrases will help to convince the reader that your opinion is valid and worthy of consideration.
5. Emphasize key points: Highlight important points in your text by using bold, italics, underlining, bullet points, etc. This will draw attention to the most crucial aspects of your argument and make them stand out from other information.
6. Appeal to the reader's emotions: Use persuasive tactics that appeal to the reader's feelings or values such as empathy, respect, trust, gratitude etc., so they feel connected with you and your point of view.
7. Be confident: Believe in what you are saying and project confidence when presenting your argument. Your enthusiasm will help convey a sense of authenticity which can persuade readers to accept your perspective as valid or reliable.
