[Natsuki] Oh my! I have never seen anything like this! Is he okay? What happened to his ship, though?
[Sayori] My dear, let me help you carry MC. It's no good for him to be lying in the dirt like that. And if his spaceship has been destroyed, there must be something valuable inside of it. Let's go! I can get you some drinks and snacks before we start looking around.
[Yuri] Hey! Look what I found on the sidewalk! It's a pouch full of gold coins. Do you think they came from MC's spaceship?
[Natsuki] Indeed, Yuri! This must mean that there is something valuable inside his ship. We should find some way to restore it so we can explore the stars again.
[Monika] Wait... before we do anything else, I want to make sure that MC is okay. He looks pretty roughed up. Let's take him back to our clubroom and see if he regains consciousness soon.
[Sayori] Good idea, Monika! I have some first aid supplies in my bag. Maybe we can help him get better faster this way.
### Conversation:
(Once they arrived at the clubroom, Sayori set up a makeshift bed for MC with blankets and pillows before taking out her first aid kit. Monika started to check on his vital signs while Natsuki prepared some food for him.)

[Monika] Hmm... His pulse is weak but steady. I don't think he's in any immediate danger, thankfully.
[Natsuki] Thank you for checking on MC, Monika. Sayori, would you mind setting up some snacks and drinks for him? We don't know how long he will be here or when we can return to our clubroom.
[Sayori] Of course! I'll bring him a nice cup of tea with honey while I prepare some sandwiches and fruits.
[Yuri] Hey, guys... I have another idea! MC could stay in Sayori's room since it's bigger than our clubroom. That way we can all rest easy knowing he won't be wandering around alone here.
