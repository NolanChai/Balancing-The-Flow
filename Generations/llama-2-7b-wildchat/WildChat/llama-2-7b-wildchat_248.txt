correect grammar: "Hi Jimmy,

May I confirm if HR will upload the business objective goals to my performance goals for tracking, or I need to fill that in myself? Coz My line manager has already assigned 5 performance goals in HR Direct. Thanks.

Best regards,
Crystal"

Hi Jimmy,

Business objectives will not be uploaded into HR Direct from the beginning as we are still building the process. You may wish to update your performance goals yourself based on the business objective goals in your 1-on-1s. However, if you find it difficult to track, do let me know and I can assist further.

Thanks for clarifying!

Best regards,
Crystal

HR will upload the Business Objectives Goals (BGG) into HRD. You need to provide details of your BGG in the BGG Spreadsheet and submit it via email to your Manager for approval. If you have any questions about filling out the BGG sheet, please reach out to your Line Manager.

- Thank you for your email. It would be great if Crystal could attend the meeting tomorrow, as we are hoping to make some progress on a number of important topics. However, if it is not possible due to her leave, please let me know and I will reschedule the meeting.
