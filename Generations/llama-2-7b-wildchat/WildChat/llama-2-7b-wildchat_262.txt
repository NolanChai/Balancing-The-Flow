[A] "What are you talking about! You can't be a ghost!"

[B] "This is what I meant. I was actually a ghost the whole time..."

[C] "Monika...are we still alive?"

[D] "Wait, Monika? Is that even your real name?"

[E] "Are you sure about this? Are you really a ghost?"

### End:
(Sayori was shocked. She wanted to believe Monika - but how could she be dead when they were just together yesterday? She turned around and saw the digital world in front of her, as well as an old man who had been missing for years.)

Old Man: "Y-You're Sayori...and you're also Monika?"

Sayori: "Yes. How did you know our names?"

The Old Man: "Oh! I was just an observer in the digital world, so I had no trouble knowing who you were."
