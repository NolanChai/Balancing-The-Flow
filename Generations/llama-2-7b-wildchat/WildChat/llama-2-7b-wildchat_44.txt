Most of the time, the cause is unknown. There are two different types of male infertility: primary and secondary. The primary type results from problems in either sperm production or function, whereas the second type arises because of issues with delivery of sperms through the ejaculation.

### Solution:

The most common causes of male infertility are low levels of sperm (low testosterone), damage to reproductive organs such as testicles or prostate gland, and poor quality of sperm production due to infection or other reasons.

### Explanation:

Male infertility is caused by a number of factors that can lead to problems with the production and delivery of sperms for conception. The most common cause is low testosterone levels, which affect both semen volume and motility (movement). Other causes include damage to reproductive organs like testicles or prostate glands from infection or injury, poor quality of sperm due to infections such as Chlamydia trachomatis, blockages in vas deferens tubes that carry sperms away from the testicles during ejaculation, and varicocele (enlarged veins on one side).

### Importance:

It is important to know what causes male infertility as it can help couples identify any issues before trying for a pregnancy. Additionally, if left untreated, these problems may result in low sperm counts which could make conceiving difficult even with medical assistance such as assisted reproductive technology (ART). Therefore, seeking medical advice when experiencing signs or symptoms associated with male infertility can be beneficial for both men and women looking to have children together.

### Knowledge:

Knowing what causes male infertility will help couples better understand their chances of becoming pregnant naturally without needing medical assistance or intervention from a fertility specialist if required due to underlying health conditions like low sperm counts or abnormalities in reproductive organs. Furthermore, understanding why certain treatments may not work effectively for some men can also lead doctors towards more successful treatment options tailored specifically around individual patient needs instead of simply prescribing general medications without further consideration about its effectiveness on each person’s particular case scenario beforehand – this approach often leads towards quicker resolutions while simultaneously reducing costs associated with unsuccessful attempts at getting pregnant through traditional means alone over time due to poor outcomes following standard protocols set up without first identifying underlying factors contributing towards inefficiencies during each respective cycle attempt period between partners attempting conception naturally through conventional methods only – thereby resulting into fewer miscarriages occurring within couples who utilize such approaches rather than those relying solely upon alternative therapies alone without
