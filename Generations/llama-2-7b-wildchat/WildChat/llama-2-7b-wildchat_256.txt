(Outside, in the clubroom…)

Yuri: “So what were the ideas that everyone came up with?”

Sayori: “Well, Monika suggested having a poetry slam event where we read our favorite poems out loud. And I thought it would be fun to have a book discussion over dinner at some local cafe.”

Monika: “And I thought it’d be cool if we all wrote and illustrated our own short stories together.”

Yuri: “That sounds like it could be really fun! How about you, Sayori? What was your idea?”

Sayori: “I had a couple of ideas, actually. One was to host an art exhibit where we each created pieces inspired by one of our favorite books or authors.”

Monika: “Or what if we combined all the different ideas together? Maybe have a book club discussion over dinner while we’re reading and illustrating stories at the same time?”

Yuri: “That sounds like it could work, too! We can definitely keep brainstorming until we come up with something perfect.”

Sayori: “Agreed! I think this is shaping up to be a really memorable event for us all.”
