In general, there are many factors that affect the overall conversion efficiency (CE) and energy efficiency (EE) of cascade CO2RR systems, including the CO2 single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) and EE of the upstream CO2RR. Optimizing catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions can help improve the SPCE and EE of CO2RR, which in turn affects the overall CE and EE of these cascade systems. Here are a few strategies to improve the SPCE and EE of upstream CO2RR:

1. Selection of suitable catalyst: Different catalysts have different activity levels for converting CO2 into CH4. Choosing an appropriate catalyst with high activity and selectivity can enhance the SPCE and EE of CO2RR.

2. Optimization of reaction conditions: Adjusting factors such as temperature, pressure, gas composition, and catalyst load can help improve the conversion efficiency and energy efficiency of CO2RR. For example, increasing temperature may increase the rate of reactions and promote CH4 formation from CO2. However, high temperatures also lead to increased catalytic deactivation. Similarly, reducing pressure may increase the rate of reaction, but it may also lead to incomplete conversion or catalyst coking.

3. Optimization of device design: The design of the device can also affect the overall performance of CO2RR. For example, using a packed bed reactor with more surface area and better mixing can improve the diffusion of reactants and products, which promotes higher rates of reaction and increased SPCE and EE of CO2RR.

4. Optimization of catalysts: Catalytic materials play an important role in catalyzing reactions between CO2 and H2 to produce CH4. Different types of catalysts have different properties, such as activity, selectivity, stability, and durability. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the composition, structure, and size of the catalytic material to improve its activity and selectivity for CO2RR, thereby achieving higher SPCE and EE.

By optimizing these factors, we can significantly improve the performance of cascade CO2RR systems by improving their CE and EE. However, it should be noted that the optimization process may also lead to other challenges such as catalyst deactivation, coking, or corrosion issues due to the presence of harsh reaction conditions and high temperatures. Therefore, a comprehensive optimization strategy should be developed based on the specific requirements of the CO2RR system.
