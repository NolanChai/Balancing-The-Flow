A Slenderman has been spotted in the Starcraft II Galaxy! Players have reported a dark figure wandering the fields of war, its long limbs reaching out to grab unsuspecting Protoss players as they search for Terran minerals. Some believe it is an AI entity from a past iteration of Starcraft, but others think that it's something more sinister.

If you encounter this Slender Man, don't turn your back on him or he'll capture you in his slender hands! Instead, stay vigilant and keep your eyes peeled for any strange happenings. Remember: you can always call a friend or ally for backup if you start to feel uneasy.

### Scary:
As you move through the Starcraft II galaxy, watch out for this sinister Slender Man! He could be lurking in any corner of the map waiting to pounce on unsuspecting players. Keep your eyes open and stay alert, or else he might steal away one of your units in a flash!

### Difficulty:
easy

### Description:
This is the first chapter in my new series of Starcraft 2 Races meets Siren head. This episode follows the Zerg. 

### Gameplay:
You play as a zerg who wakes up on an unknown planet and sees a huge monster called siren head. You must escape from him by escaping through portals to different planets with other characters.

### Features:
- Starcraft 2 race: Zerg
- Siren head as the main antagonist
- Different planets and environments with unique challenges
- Portals for traveling between locations
- Various character interactions throughout the story

### Notes:
The gameplay will be in top down view. The siren head will chase you through different worlds. There will also be some puzzles to solve, and battles against enemies. The Siren Head can only travel on certain types of ground, so it'll be up to you to find ways around him.

I do not know how to write this. I can not understand the instructions for some reason, but maybe if I keep at it I will come up with something.

### Stargate

I have a vague idea for what it is, and it's sort of like Star Trek meets The Backrooms. There are different races and characters in this universe that come together to explore space and find new planets. But then they stumble upon this mysterious portal called the Stargate, which leads to The Backrooms.

### Races and Characters

Now for the fun part... what races would exist in this universe? How about some popular sci-fi/fantasy ones like elves, dwarfs, orcs, and so on? We could also add in new races like alien species from other galaxies or even human subcultures (like goths or emo). And what kind of personalities would these beings have? Maybe some are more adventurous while others are more cautious; some might be good with technology while others excel at hand-to-hand combat...

### The Backrooms

The Backrooms, for those who don't know about it yet is a horror game where players explore mysterious rooms filled with strange objects and creatures. We can use this concept in our story by having the characters get lost or trapped within these spooky corridors after finding themselves inside The Stargate portal!

### Exploring New Worlds

Now that we've established what kind of races exist along with their personalities - let's explore new planets together. Each planet has its own environment filled with unique flora/fauna which could potentially provide us valuable resources needed for further development back on Earth (or other galaxies). Plus who knows what ancient secrets await us? It could be anything from forgotten civilizations to powerful artifacts...

### Conclusion

So there you have it! My attempt at an idea for a story based off the instructions above. I hope this was helpful in some way :) If anyone has any further feedback or suggestions feel free to reach out via discord (LowKeyStories#2586) . And remember always keep exploring new worlds... even if sometimes they lead us down dark paths filled with horror!
