Regular audits should be conducted by an external third-party organization experienced with penetration testing (PT) methodologies for

There are three main criterias in the development of a system to be considered. These include: (1) Reliability, (2) Usability and (3) Accessibility.

Firstly, reliability is an important criterion in developing a system for the purpose of providing a seamless user experience without any unexpected interruptions or downtime. A reliable system should be capable of processing data correctly and consistently, while ensuring that all data entry points are secured to prevent unauthorized access. Furthermore, it should have backups in place so as to ensure there is no loss of important information due to an unexpected technical issue.

Secondly, usability should be prioritized for this system as it needs to provide users with a convenient platform where they can quickly locate and navigate through different features without any difficulty. A good user experience will increase overall satisfaction among customers, thus leading to improved customer loyalty. This can be achieved by designing an intuitive interface with clear navigation tools such as labels or drop-down menus for easy access of information within the system.

Lastly, accessibility must also be considered when developing this new system since it will enable users from different backgrounds and abilities to utilize its services without any issues. Therefore, features such as text transcripts should be integrated into the design so that those with visual impairments have an equal chance in interacting with the application or website. In addition, adjustable font sizes can help visually-impaired individuals easily read and navigate through pages on their screens without having difficulty viewing small print fonts like others do.

In conclusion, these three criteria â€“ reliability, usability, and accessibility - should be considered when developing any system or application for optimal performance as well as user satisfaction levels. All these aspects need to work together harmoniously so that customers have an excellent overall experience using the service provided by this new system or website.

The project should be implemented in a cloud-based solution such as Amazon AWS or Azure. This will ensure high availability and scalability. Additionally, it allows for cost savings compared to building a dedicated infrastructure from scratch.

The following are the security control measures that should be implemented in an effort to maintain the security of a SOAR system:

- Establish strict policies and procedures for handling sensitive data. This includes defining roles and responsibilities, assigning access permissions based on need-to-know, monitoring access logs, and promptly revoking access when no longer needed.

- Ensure that all devices connected to the SOAR system are properly configured and up-to-date with latest security patches. This should include firewalls, anti-virus software, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and other related software.

- Regularly scan for vulnerabilities in both hardware and software components of the SOAR system using appropriate tools such as Nessus or QualysGuard Vulnerability Management scanner.

- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) protocols where possible, requiring multiple forms of identification from different sources before granting access to sensitive information or resources within the SOAR system.

- Enforce role-based access controls which restrict access only to authorized individuals based on their job function and level of clearance within an organizationâ€™s security framework. This ensures that unauthorized users cannot gain access even if they manage to bypass other layers of protection such as passwords or two-factor authentication (2FA).

- Monitor SOAR system logs for unusual activity which could indicate potential attacks or intrusions into its environment including login attempts with incorrect credentials or suspicious network traffic patterns indicative of malware infections etc.. Any such incidents must be investigated promptly and appropriate action taken against those responsible for them if necessary.

- Regularly test SOAR systemâ€™s resilience against simulated attacks through penetration testing exercises conducted by qualified personnel equipped with specialized knowledge about SOAR technology platforms as well as their associated vulnerabilities etc.. This helps identify any potential flaws which could compromise security if left unchecked thus enabling timely remediation efforts before actual attacks occur in real world situations later on down the line.

- Conduct regular reviews & audits of all implemented controls & processes related to SOAR systems ensuring they remain effective at detecting & responding against malicious activities over time so that necessary adjustments are made where needed accordingly without delay whatsoever.
