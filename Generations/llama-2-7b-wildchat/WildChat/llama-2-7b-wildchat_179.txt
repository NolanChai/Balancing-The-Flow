As the three heroes stood in front of them, they couldn't believe what they were seeing. The two Overwatch agents had become Sombra clones? What was happening here? This was too much for Mei to take. She suddenly felt like she wanted to cry. How could everything be so messy and complicated all at once?
Meanwhile, Tracer looked around in confusion. She didn't understand what was going on either; it seemed like they had been tricked into something. Mercy tried to comfort them both by saying: "Don't worry, we will figure this out." But her words did nothing to ease the tension between Mei and Tracer.
The three clones began to shake violently as they struggled against their bindings, trying desperately to break free. Their faces contorted in agony each time they tried to move an inch; it was clear that something horrible had happened here. It reminded Mei of how she felt when her ice would melt under the heat from her gun's barrel.
Suddenly, a door slammed behind them, revealing another Sombra clone standing there with an evil grin on its face. This new arrival was clearly not one of their friends; Mei could tell just by looking at it that something sinister was going to happen next! 

"What do you want from us?" asked Tracer, trying desperately to sound brave in spite of how afraid she really was. The other Sombra clone remained silent for a moment before replying: "I can't tell you that just yet - but trust me when I say this will all make sense in due time." With those words spoken, he turned around and walked away without another word.
Meanwhile Mercy looked at both Mei and Tracer with concern; clearly something terrible had happened here. She knew they couldn't stay tied up forever like this; she needed to get them out of this mess somehow! 

Suddenly a loud explosion filled the room - followed by intense flames which began spreading quickly throughout their confinement area. Mei screamed in terror as smoke filled her lungs; it was clear they were trapped here until help came - unless Mercy could find a way out somehow...

Mercy began to shout at the top of her lungs: "MEI! TRACER! HANG ON!! We have to get out of this place before those flames reach us!" At that moment both Mei and Tracer responded with strength; their eyes met as they pushed against their bindings until finally breaking free. As soon as their hands were free from restraints, all three Sombra clones began running frantically through the smoke filled corridors searching desperately for an exit - any exit!

Mei was so focused on finding a way out that she didn't realize how close Mercy had been following behind them. It wasn't until Tracer screamed in alarm about flames coming towards them again that Mei finally turned around and saw just how close they were getting to danger...

Suddenly there was another loud explosion - this time much bigger than before. The roof had collapsed onto the hallway, trapping all three Sombra clones inside with no way out! As smoke continued filling their lungs, Mei struggled desperately against her bonds while Mercy tried to comfort both her friends by saying: "Don't worry; we will find a way out of this!" But even she knew that it was becoming increasingly difficult - and time was running out fast!

Just then Tracer let out another scream as the smoke got thicker and thicker - she was having trouble breathing too! Mei tried to yell at her but couldn't make herself heard over the sound of crackling flames burning all around them... 

With nowhere else left for help, they had no choice but to trust each other in this dire situation - but would it be enough? Mercy could feel their panic growing with every passing second; she knew something terrible was about to happen unless someone took action soon! But even as tears rolled down her cheeks from fear and frustration alike, she remained calmly determined not just for herself or Mei & Tracer - but also for all those innocent civilians trapped inside this burning building with them too...

Suddenly an idea hit Mercy like a lightbulb going off: if only they could use their powers to escape! She turned towards Mei & Tracer and shouted out: "I've got it - let's make our way back outside using teleportation!" Without hesitation, both girls nodded in agreement; knowing that this might be their last chance at survival together against all odds!

With each other's trust behind them stronger than ever before, Mei & Tracer closed their eyes tightly while Mercy focused intently on opening a portal near the burning building - hoping desperately that it would work before time ran out for everyone involved...
