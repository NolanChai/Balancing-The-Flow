The easiest way would be to use `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions. They both are really flexible in finding specific text.

\begin{code}
=IFERROR(LEFT(C2, INDEX(A$5:A$9, MATCH(1, FIND(" ", C2 & " ", A$5:A$9), 0))-1),"")
\end{code}

Assuming you have your sentence in column `A`, and the first space of the sentence in the cell `A5` - you can write formula like above.

Comment: Thankyou very much! Is there a way to just put in 2 words?

Comment: If your sentences always have two words, it would be simpler to use a combination of `LEFT`, `FIND` and `INDEX` functions as I did [here](https://webapps.stackexchange.com/a/180476/41000).

You should use the `LEN()` function to calculate the length of your string. If it's less than 6 you can use `.PasteSpecial(xlPasteValues)` to insert your values without wrapping them.

For example, if your data is stored in A1 and you want to make sure it's not more than six words:

```vbscript
If LEN("A1")<6 Then 
    Cells(1,1).PasteSpecial(xlPasteValues)
End If
```

If your data is stored in A2 and you want to make sure it's not more than six words:

```vbscript
If LEN("A2")<6 Then 
    Cells(1,1).PasteSpecial(xlPasteValues)
End If
```

Instead of using a VBA script to verify the validity, you can use the data validation feature to validate the cell value.

The following steps will help you in implementing this task:
\begin{itemize}
\item Open Excel Worksheet (Sheet1) and go to Cell B3, select Data Validation > Data Validation Dialog box.
\item In the Allow drop-down list, set it to "Custom" as shown below:

\item Under Data validation Custom message text box, enter your own customized error message and click Ok button.
\end{itemize}
