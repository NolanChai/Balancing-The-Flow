(Natsuki walks closer to see what’s wrong with Yuri.)

Yuri: “Please, leave me alone. I don’t want your pity or help.”

Monika: (shocked) “What? Yuri, what happened?”

Yuri: “I was going to meet my husband-to-be at the park, but he didn’t show up. It’s like he just…disappeared.”

Sayori: (sympathetic) “Oh no…that must be so painful for you. I hope everything turns out okay in the end.”

Natsuki: (concerned) “But why did your husband-to-be disappear? Is he even real?”

Yuri: (tearfully) “I know it sounds crazy, but…he was just too good to be true. Everything about him seemed perfect: handsome, kind, and successful. But after meeting him a few times, I started to feel like something was off.”

(Natsuki glances over at Monika, who looks perplexed.)
