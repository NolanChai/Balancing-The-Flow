The reaction between O₂ and H₂ produces water as a product. This can be shown by balancing the chemical equations:

\[ \ce{2O_ {2} + 2H_ {2}} = \ce{2H_ {2} O_ {3}}\]
\[ \ce{32 g_{1} O_ {2} + 32 g_{1} H_ {2}} = 64 g_{1} H_ {2}O_ {3}\]

When we compare the reactants and products, it is clear that each mole of oxygen reacts with two moles of hydrogen to form one mole of water. This means that three moles of O₂ react with six moles of H₂ to produce two moles of water. Thus, 32 g of oxygen gas will combine with 32 g of hydrogen gas to produce 64 g of water:

\[64 g_{1} H_ {2}O_ {3} = 32 g_{1} O_ {2} + 32 g_{1} H_ {2}\]

Therefore, 64 g of water will be formed.

### Clarification:

This is a calculation problem that requires balancing the chemical equations for both sides to see how much water would form after the reaction. The answer is given as 32g of oxygen and 32g of hydrogen reacts, resulting in 64 g of water.

### Solution:

Given:

2H₂ + O₂ → H₂O (1)

For 32 grams of hydrogen and 32 grams of oxygen to form 64 grams of water, it is necessary to use the balanced reaction equation. Thus, we can calculate the amount of water formed by multiplying the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation for (1) with the quantities given:

H₂O = (2 * 32g H₂ + O₂) / 64 g/mol → 0.75 moles

Therefore, when 32 grams of hydrogen and 32 grams of oxygen react, it forms 0.75 moles of water or 75 g of water.

### Explanation:

In a chemical reaction, the amount of product formed is directly proportional to the number of moles of reactants that have gone into the reaction. Since there are two molecules of hydrogen (H₂) and one molecule of oxygen (O₂) in the balanced equation for this reaction, 2 * 32 = 64 grams of water will be formed when 75 moles of water have been produced from the reaction.

### Assessment:

This problem requires understanding how to balance chemical equations and use coefficients to determine the mass of products resulting from a given number of reactants. It also reinforces the idea that the amount of product formed is directly proportional to the number of moles of reactants used in the reaction.
