1. Orient is a term that has been used to describe a region in the world or a culture, but its meaning can vary depending on context. In some cases, it may refer to countries in Asia, such as China, India, Japan, and Korea. However, "Orientalism" refers to the ways in which Western cultures have historically portrayed and understood people from other parts of the world, especially those located in Eastern regions like Asia or Africa. Orientalism is a concept developed by Edward Said in his book "Orientalism".
2. The Orientalist discourse contingent upon the West's distinct power dynamic that enables them to create and maintain reductive images of the East, is reminiscent of the Panopticon wherein the Western observer becomes bearer of the gaze and determines what the Eastern identity, norms morals interests are.
3. In Orientalism, Edward Said argues that there are power dynamics at work in the West's portrayal of other cultures in the world, particularly those from the Middle East or Asia. These images often serve to reinforce Western supremacy by presenting non-Western societies as backward or uncivilized compared to Western culture.
4. The Panopticon refers to a type of prison designed by Michel Foucault in which prisoners can be observed constantly without being aware of it due to the circular arrangement of cells around a central tower. In this sense, the West becomes observer and bearer of power-laden gaze determining non Western culture's identity, norms morals and interests. This gaze reifies "a grid of intelligibility that legitimates specific research as objective knowledge"
