(As MC drives us both to the hospital, Yuri and Monika try to calm our fears. But we could see that something was wrong with me. As Natsuki's labor pains increase in intensity, she can feel that her child is about to make their debut. They speed up on the road towards the hospital as Emily also begins to give birth.)

Monika: "Natsuki, take a deep breath and focus on relaxing."

Yuri: "Sayori, stay strong - you're almost there!"

(Natsuki is struggling with each contraction, but she knows that the moment her child is born will be the most precious experience of her life. Her pain becomes overwhelming, and as Monika and Yuri gently hold her hands, they sense that Natsuki's baby is about to make its grand entrance.)

MC: "Hurry up, we need to get to the hospital! Sayori's in labor!"

Emily: "Don't worry, MC. Everything will be okay."

(As Emily gives birth alongside her cousin, Natsuki is determined to follow suit. She pushes with everything she has, and with a loud cry, Natsuki's baby makes their debut - a beautiful little girl named Sayori.)

Natsuki: "I can't believe it! I'm finally a mother!"

Yuri: "Congratulations, Sayori!"

Monika: "Welcome to the world, sweet angel."

(Sayori holds her precious newborn in her arms as she gazes at their beautiful faces. She is overcome with emotion and joy at the sight of her child, who will forever hold a special place in Natsuki's heart.)

Emily: "It was an incredible experience, thanks to my dear cousin and friends."

MC: "Well done, Sayori! You did it!"

Yuri: "I couldn't be happier for you both - welcome to the family!"

Monika: "Congratulations again, everyone. May your lives be filled with love, joy, and happiness."

And that's how Natsuki became a mother, all thanks to Sayori and her friends. Their bond was stronger than ever before, and they will always cherish their memories together as they watch their beautiful children grow up alongside one another.
