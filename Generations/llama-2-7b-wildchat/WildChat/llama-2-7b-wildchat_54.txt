Many students believe that memorizing information and then regurgitating it on a test or assessment will improve their grades. However, research has consistently shown that this approach to learning does not lead to long-term success. Instead, emphasis should be placed on understanding the material and being able to apply it in different situations.

One study found that students who memorized information had difficulty recalling it months later when compared to those who had actively engaged with the material (Kornell & Bjork, 2014). This suggests that merely storing information in memory is not enough; effective learning requires understanding and connecting concepts to real-life applications.

In addition, memorization often leads to forgetting quickly because of the limited amount of time spent reviewing or practicing after initial learning (Dunlosky et al., 2013). Without proper retention strategies such as spacing out practice sessions over time or retrieval practice (reviewing information repeatedly), knowledge can fade rapidly.

It's important for teachers and parents to provide guidance about effective study habits rather than relying solely on memorization as an indicator of success in schoolwork or exams. Students must be encouraged to actively engage with content instead of merely passively absorbing information - this will help them develop critical thinking skills while improving long-term retention rates.

As a teacher, I always thought that memorizing was an effective method in teaching students for learning purposes. However, recently, it has been proven by science that memorization is not as useful to learning as we think. Scientific studies show that “memories are stored in different ways and the brain cannot recall all information stored”(Teaching Learning & Development, 2017). In other words, when a student tries to learn something through memorization alone, they may end up forgetting what they have learned since the information is not actually stored into their long-term memory. In addition, as mentioned by Dr. Sally Goddard Blythe, children’s brains are not fully developed before the age of seven (Goddard Blythe, 2014). This explains why students have difficulties in learning through memorization at such early age. Hence, it can be concluded that memorization is only a temporary method to store information. It may help students improve their short-term memory, but it cannot effectively stimulate their long-term memory which is essential for effective learning.

### Recommendation:
Therefore, as a teacher, I recommend using active methods in teaching students. This means that instead of only relying on memorization to help them learn something, teachers should also provide opportunities for children to engage with the subject matter and apply their knowledge in different ways. For example, when teaching children about maths, we can give them tasks involving real-life scenarios so they can use their maths skills in everyday life (Goddard Blythe, 2014). This will not only help children understand better but also make the learning experience more enjoyable and interesting for them.

In conclusion, memorization is no longer an effective method in teaching students since it does not stimulate their long-term memory and does not provide any meaningful application of knowledge. Instead of relying solely on memorization, teachers should use active methods like providing opportunities for children to engage with the subject matter through various tasks or scenarios so they can retain what they have learned over time.

A student with an accurate and balanced understanding of the subject matter will be able to apply their knowledge in real-world situations. In contrast, a student with an incomplete or imbalanced understanding may struggle with applying their knowledge to solve problems. The inaccurate or imbalanced understanding could result in incorrect problem solving approaches that may not yield the correct solution and waste valuable time and resources.

On the other hand, memorization alone does not guarantee comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Memorizing facts and figures can help students recall information when needed, but it doesn't necessarily foster a deeper understanding of concepts or their applications in different scenarios. Without proper contextualization, memorized information may lack meaningful value beyond examination purposes.

Hence, it is important for us to have/promote an accurate and comprehensive understanding that goes beyond memorization by incorporating critical thinking skills and real-world application of the subject matter. This will enable students not just to pass exams but also make better decisions in their lives.

“Memorisation” has been proposed as a key factor in successful learning for generations, but this idea is not entirely supported by evidence. While memorization can play an important role in certain types of learning such as rote memorization or the acquisition of procedural knowledge, it cannot be relied upon solely for more complex concepts and ideas.

First, memory capacity is limited, making it impractical to rely solely on memorisation when attempting to learn vast amounts of information. For example, trying to memorize all the facts in a history textbook would require a remarkable feat of memory retention that may not even be possible for some individuals. Furthermore, forgetting occurs naturally over time without conscious effort or intent, meaning that any learned material is likely to be forgotten at least partially if not reviewed regularly or re-enforced through other learning methods.

Secondly, memorisation alone does not necessarily lead to deeper understanding or improved retention over longer periods of time compared with strategies such as concept mapping and active engagement in learning activities like problem solving or discussion. In fact studies have shown that learners who rely on rote memorization tend to perform worse on tests later down the line than those who had actively engaged with content through multiple perspectives rather than simply trying to cram it into their memories for an upcoming examination (Liu et al., 2019).

Finally, there are numerous studies demonstrating that teaching strategies such as providing instructional support materials like diagrams or visual aids can significantly improve retention rates compared with purely rote memorization methods alone (e.g., Glasser & Kaminsky , 2005). Additionally , when combined with active engagement in learning activities such as problem solving tasks , group discussions etc., memorisation becomes an important component but not necessarily a primary factor for successful learning .

In conclusion, while memorization plays some role in learning it should never be used alone . Instead , evidence suggests that a combination of instructional support materials , active engagement with content , conceptual understanding building , application & reinforcement through multiple perspectives leads to better retention & performance over time . Therefore it is important for educators not just focus only on memorization but also employ other strategies alongside it which provide greater depth & long term success in learning.
