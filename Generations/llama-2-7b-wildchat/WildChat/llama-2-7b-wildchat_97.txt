Andrea’s mother: Why are you being so stubborn? I understand your frustration, but that doesn’t give you the right to break the law! Please listen to me!
(Entering the room is Jane, looking worried)
Jane: Mom, what happened? Where’s Andrea? What did she do this time? (Mother looks at her in shock)
2.
Andrea’s mother: Oh, honey, I am so sorry to have to tell you this, but your sister was arrested by the police for vandalism and reckless driving. She destroyed public property and endangered the lives of other drivers while running away from them. (Jane sinks into a chair in shock)
3.
Andrea: What? I can’t believe it! How could they arrest me like that? This is so unfair, Mom! There were extenuating circumstances! I was just trying to protect myself and my friends!
4.
Jane: Andrea, please understand that we have to follow the law. The police have done their job, and now it’s up to you to face the consequences of your actions. We’ll do whatever we can to help you through this difficult time, but you need to accept responsibility for your own actions.
5.
Andrea: But I didn’t mean to hurt anyone! I just wanted to protect myself and my friends from a dangerous situation. It was an accident, and the consequences were unfortunate, but they don’t justify this arrest. (She starts crying) 
6.
Jane: I know you’re upset, Andrea, but we have to let the authorities handle it for now. We can’t fight their decisions or try to prove your innocence on our own. You need an experienced criminal defense lawyer who will stand up for your rights and advocate for a fair outcome in court. (Jane gives her a hug)
7.
Andrea: I just don’t understand why everything is always so hard for me! This isn’t the first time I’ve been treated unfairly by the system, and it never seems to get any easier. Sometimes, I feel like nothing will ever go right for me. (She starts crying harder)
8.
Jane: Don’t say that, Andrea. We have to believe in ourselves and trust that things will work out for you, eventually. Just try to stay strong and focused on your future. We love you and we are here for you no matter what happens.
9.
Andrea: Thank you, Jane. You always know just how to make me feel better. (She hugs her) I can’t imagine going through this without you by my side. (They both smile, feeling hopeful for the future) 
10.
Jane: Come on, let’s go talk with Dad about our options moving forward. We will fight for Andrea to get justice and help her rebuild her life. Let’s show them that we can’t be defeated by this, no matter how hard things may seem at times. 
11.
Andrea: I love you both so much. You are my support system through everything good and bad. (She smiles) No matter what happens in the future, I know we will always be there for each other. (Jane wipes away a tear from her eyes)
