I think we'll get 4 out of 5 subject points and that will be perfect in our opinion. The only reason why I say this is because the other subjects are a bit vague, so it's not really possible to determine how many points they should get. I think the best way for us to do this would be by giving each subject point a score out of 5 and then averaging those scores together in order to come up with our final total of 4/5 (which means we got perfect).

I'm sorry to hear that, but you shouldn't feel too bad about it. Mistakes are inevitable and part of the learning process. It's important to try your best and not give up, even when things don't go as planned. Remember that failure is just a step towards success, and every attempt brings you closer to achieving your goals.
Take some time to reflect on what went wrong and analyze why it happened. Perhaps there were certain strategies or approaches you could have taken to prevent the situation from occurring. If there's anything specific you feel you can improve upon, make sure to take action in addressing those areas.
It is also important not to dwell too much on failure and let it hold you back. Instead, focus on learning from your mistakes and use them as an opportunity for growth and development. Keep working hard towards achieving your goals, even if sometimes you have to face obstacles along the way.
Don't forget about self-care either; take time away from studying or assignments when needed so that stress doesn't build up too much pressure onto yourself physically & emotionally . Make sure do activities which bring joy/relaxation into your life like spending quality time with loved ones, engaging in hobbies etc., this will help maintain balance between work life and personal life as well!
Remember that no matter what happens or how much success one achieves; we all experience moments when things don't go according to plan- so donâ€™t let these times define who YOU are. With determination & persistence, I believe everything will eventually fall into place :)

It was a great experience. It really helped me to improve my English language skills, and I learned a lot about how to approach difficult questions effectively. Overall, I feel very proud of myself for achieving such high scores on all four exams!
