i18n object is a global variable and you have to call that global variable which was stored inside 'i18n' key in your app.js file as shown below.

```javascript
  {
        'en-US': {
            header:'Welcome to your App'
        }
    },
```

And the call will look like:

```html
 <h1>{{i18n.header}}</h1>
```
