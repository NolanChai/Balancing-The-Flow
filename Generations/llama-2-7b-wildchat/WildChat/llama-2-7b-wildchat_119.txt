[this dialogue would take place between Collei and Indigo after she asked who he was:]

Collei: I'm sorry. I didn't know this was your mother's stage! Can you tell me what happened? Did something go wrong with the festival preparations?

Indigo (looking at her mother's empty cradle): No... my mother gave birth to me early, and she collapsed on the way back from the hospital. I think they forgot about my mother...

Collei: That's terrible! We need to take you back to your mother as soon as possible. Can you tell us where we can find her?

Indigo (wiping away tears): The doctors said she was too weak to travel, so I stayed here with her until my father came to pick me up. But he never showed up... I think I'm all alone now...

Alhaitham: Don't worry, we won't leave you behind! We will find a way to take care of you and your mother. Let us know if you remember anything else about the day she collapsed.

Tighnari (walking around the stage): I don't think this is the only place where something went wrong. There are a few broken props on the side of the stage, and some missing sets... it looks like there was an accident backstage too.

Kaveh: Let's search through the records and find out what happened to your mother. If anyone remembers her absence, we will get in contact with them as soon as possible.

As they searched for clues, Indigo sat by her mother's cradle, waiting for her father to return. Collei could see how much she loved her mother and wanted nothing more than to be with her again.]
