Thank you for sharing this wonderful update with us! It's inspiring to see how much our children have grown and learned throughout the month of October. Your dedication as teachers is truly commendable, and we couldn't be happier that our little ones are flourishing in your care.

We appreciate the focus on multiculturalism in class; it's essential to give them a diverse learning environment where they can develop their understanding of different cultures and backgrounds. The International Food Week sounds like an exciting and enriching experience for all involved.

It's fantastic that your IEYC unit "This Is Me" has been such a hit with the children, allowing them to explore various aspects of themselves and connect with their classmates. We can't wait to see what creative projects they come up with throughout this process!

We're so glad you've incorporated mathematical concepts in your lessons; counting is an important skill that will benefit our children's future academic endeavors. The fun and interactive approach to learning makes it even more engaging for them.

Learning about the changes of fall season is also a great way for the kids to connect with nature and appreciate its beauty, while also developing their creativity through crafts related to this theme. 

Finally, we're thrilled to have witnessed your children's month-end assembly performance and birthday celebrations! It's heartwarming to see them showcasing what they've learned in class and feeling proud of their achievements. We appreciate the effort you put into creating such memorable experiences for all involved.

Once again, thank you for everything you do for our children. We are grateful for your dedication and commitment, and we look forward to seeing more growth and development in November!

correct this: Hello Panda Parents, this week has been an eventful week. The PN students have continued learning about family members and have started learning about birthdays and how to celebrate them. We have practiced singing the birthday song and made birthday crowns for our Friday dramatic play. The little pandas are very excited about the arrival of fall and all the fun fall activities we plan for them. They also did really well with recognizing number 1 and 2, their gross motor skills continue to improve.
