In marching band, students are taught to march in a synchronized and orderly fashion. This helps create a unified and disciplined image for the group as they perform. As each individual takes their place on the field or stage, they must maintain focus and stay attentive to the movements of the other members around them.

During practice sessions and performances, instructors may use verbal cues such as "left, right" or hand signals to indicate specific formations or directions for each section within the group. Marching kingdoms often have distinct uniform designs that help distinguish between different groups within an ensemble while adding visual interest to their performances.

Marching bands also require physical fitness from each member due to long hours spent practicing and performing outdoors in all types of weather conditions throughout each season's schedule (fall football games; winter holiday concerts). Maintaining proper posture, balance, and coordination become increasingly important as they prepare for high-profile events such as regional competitions or national championship tournaments.

Overall, marching bands require discipline both mentally and physically from each member involved if they wish to excel at this demanding activity involving teamwork alongside individual talent development over time.

There is a song called "Born Sinner" by German rapper Cro. It has a similar sounding title and lyrics.

[Marcher kingdoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcher_kingdoms) were English feudal territories outside the control of the monarch. They existed in England between the Norman conquest of England and the 16th century, when the Wars of the Roses ended with King Henry VII's victory at Bosworth Field.

Marcher kingdom is an English term that originates from the medieval times. It refers to a county or duchy ruled by a feudal overlord who was in control of some territory outside his own, known as the "march". The area within the march had the same laws and privileges as those of the overlord's lands. This allowed for greater autonomy and freedom from centralized control than other fiefdoms under feudalism.

The term March was also used to describe border territories between two countries or kingdoms, which were often contested areas with frequent conflict due to their strategic importance in the region. As a result of these conflicts, many marcher lords became wealthy through raiding and taxation levies on trade routes that passed through their territories.

In medieval times, there were several notable Marches throughout Europe including England’s March County (now Norfolk), Wales’s Marchia Wallica (now Herefordshire) and France's Marche de Bretagne (now Normandy). These areas retained some degree of independence from centralized control until they were absorbed into larger kingdoms or empires during later periods of history.

The concept of Marcher Kingdom is not exclusive to medieval England but rather has been used throughout history across different regions with varying degrees of autonomy granted by feudal overlords or national governments at different points in time depending on political circumstances and power dynamics between neighboring nations/states etc.. It served as an important factor influencing regional politics during these periods due its potential for wealth generation through trade routes crossing into rival territories while providing valuable buffer zones against external aggression from outside forces seeking to gain control over strategic regions within Europe (such as Wales).
