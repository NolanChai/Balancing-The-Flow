"Demon Slayer" was criticized by some for using the Hanafuda earrings in the character design, with the design similar to the rising sun flag. However, "Golden Kamuy" used the Rising Sun flag as a key part of its storyline and characters' backstories without any controversy. This can be attributed to several factors:

1. Differences in cultural context: While both anime/manga series were produced in Japan, they targeted different audiences with distinct cultural backgrounds. "Demon Slayer" was created as a shonen (targeting young boys) manga and aimed at younger audiences. On the other hand, "Golden Kamuy" is an adult seinen (aimed at older men) manga and is more widely read by older generations who are likely to have deeper cultural knowledge regarding Japanese history and imperialism. As such, the controversy surrounding "Demon Slayer" arose from its target audience being unfamiliar with Japan's imperialist past, while "Golden Kamuy" addressed this through its storyline, which involved characters' involvement in World War II and their struggle to come to terms with their wartime experiences.

2. Different approach to controversy: While both series faced criticism for using the Rising Sun flag, there was a stark difference in how they handled the backlash. In the case of "Demon Slayer," the creator made efforts to address the concerns raised by some viewers and acknowledged the negative connotations associated with the Hanafuda earrings' design. Meanwhile, in "Golden Kamuy" the Rising Sun flag was an integral part of its narrative, which allowed the series to explore its significance in a more nuanced way through character development and historical contextualization.

3. Different target audiences: The mature themes and complex plotlines of "Golden Kamuy" likely appeal to viewers with a greater appreciation for Japanese history and culture, making them more receptive towards the usage of the Rising Sun flag in its narrative. On the other hand, the simpler storyline and character design of "Demon Slayer" may not have allowed for such detailed exploration of historical context and cultural significance.

Overall, while both series were criticized for incorporating controversial imagery related to Japan's imperial past, their approach and target audience played an important role in determining how they addressed the concerns raised by viewers regarding the use of the Rising Sun flag.
