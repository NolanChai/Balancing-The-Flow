Paige's character was inspired by the story of actress Chloe Grace Moretz's maternal grandfather who, upon learning that he had a daughter named Jennifer in 2013, immediately sought to contact her after decades without knowing about her existence. This type of family history resonates with me because I grew up being taught the importance of honoring and maintaining relationships with extended families, especially those separated by geography or time.

### Script:

The camera begins on Paige Kwon-Broderick, also known as Kwon Jang-mi in Korean, a Korean-American woman who was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea until she moved to San Francisco with her mother when she was a teenager. She remembers learning about her father Matthew Broderick from her mother Kwon Kyung-sook while growing up. 

Paige's mother revealed that she had an affair with Matthew and got pregnant in New York during the 1990s, but to escape scandals involving him, she left the US and returned to South Korea where Paige grew up. Later, her father found out about his daughter Paige when he was contacted by Kwon Kyung-sook who wanted to meet him in New York. Matthew Broderick met his daughter Paige at his apartment and became emotional because he had no idea he had a daughter and had no relationship with her mother.

Paige's character is played by a Korean American actress, and the story takes place in different locations including San Francisco where Paige grew up, New York where Matthew lives, and Seoul where Paige learns about her mother's past and meets her father for the first time. The script emphasizes the importance of family history and honoring relationships with extended families despite distance or time.
