### Explanation:

This query returns InvoiceItems which are renewing an account at the start of every month.

It finds invoices which have a date (Posted Date) within 1 days of today's date and also includes invoices which were posted one day before today's date.

The query then looks for InvoiceItems which are renewing an account and uses the "AccountingCode" field to find which Deferred Revenue Account Code will be used by Finance (eg: Deferred Revenue Code_1, Deferred Revenue Code_2) and also which Recognized Revenue Accounting Code.

The query looks for InvoiceItems which are renewing accounts which have a Customer Type of "CM Contractor" to include only those invoices where the account is renewing with a contractor as opposed to another type of customer (eg: "Consultant", "Reseller")
