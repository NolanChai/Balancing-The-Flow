1.  Lean manufacturing, also known as just-in-time (JIT), is a methodology used to reduce waste in a company's operations by focusing on eliminating extra steps and reducing inventory levels. It was developed in the 1970s and has become increasingly popular among management circles due to its emphasis on efficiency, quality control, and cost reduction (Roth et al., 2013).

2.  Lean manufacturing can be a more appropriate approach for today's managers as it emphasizes continuous improvement, focuses on eliminating wasteful practices, encourages teamwork among employees, and creates a culture of efficiency throughout an organization (Roth et al., 2013). Moreover, lean manufacturing aligns with modern management theories such as TQM or Total Quality Management which emphasize customer satisfaction through continuous improvement processes. By adopting lean principles such as JIT inventory control systems and process optimization techniques managers can streamline operations leading to higher productivity levels at lower costs while enhancing overall customer satisfaction levels (Roth et al., 2013).

The use of contemporary approaches in nursing is to meet the needs of patients. These approaches also ensure that a patient receives personalized care, which improves quality of life and health outcomes (Sharma et al., 2019). Contemporary approaches allow for a more holistic approach to caring for patients, which encompasses their physical, emotional, and social well-being. The use of technology also provides nurses with real-time data about patient conditions, allowing them to make informed decisions quickly (Sharma et al., 2019). Nurses can leverage contemporary approaches by incorporating evidence-based practices into their care plans and using data analytics tools for better decision making (Rogowski & Zhang, 2018). In addition, they must collaborate effectively with other healthcare professionals to ensure continuity of care and improve patient outcomes. Finally, nurses should be open-minded when it comes to learning new strategies or techniques because the world around us continues changing rapidly every day (Sharma et al., 2019).

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, contemporary approaches are essential for nurses who want to deliver high-quality care that improves patient outcomes. By incorporating evidence-based practices and using data analytics tools, they can provide personalized care tailored specifically towards individual needs while collaborating with other healthcare professionals effectively across disciplines toward continuity of care management efforts aimed at achieving better patient results overall over time (Sharma et al., 2019; Rogowski & Zhang, 2018). With this knowledge in mind along with an openness toward learning new strategies or techniques related to contemporary approaches within nursing practice settings, we can confidently say that these approaches offer endless possibilities when it comes down helping us meet today’s healthcare demands better than ever before!
