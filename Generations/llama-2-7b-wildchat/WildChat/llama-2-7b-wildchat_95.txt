In chronic kidney disease (CKD), hyperglycemia can have a significant impact on the levels of both sodium and potassium. 

- Increased Blood Sugar Levels: High blood sugar levels can lead to increased urine output, which can result in dehydration. Dehydration can cause an increase in sodium retention by the kidneys, leading to increased serum concentrations of both sodium and potassium.
- Decreased Glucose Control: Poor glucose control in CKD patients can lead to glucose accumulation in the urine, which can further increase urinary sodium excretion. This increases the risk of hyperglycemia and worsens chronic kidney disease prognosis.
- Impaired Kidney Function: In advanced stages of CKD, decreased kidney function can impair the ability to maintain normal levels of both sodium and potassium. As a result, patients may experience hyperkalemia (increased potassium level) or hypokalemia (decreased potassium level), which can lead to adverse health effects.
- Medications: Some medications used in the treatment of CKD, such as diuretics and ACE inhibitors, may also have an effect on sodium and potassium levels. Diuretics can increase urinary excretion of both electrolytes, while ACE inhibitors reduce the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and can lead to decreased renal clearance of both sodium and potassium.
- Diet: Patients with CKD may require specific dietary restrictions to maintain adequate levels of electrolytes, as well as appropriate hydration and glucose control.
It is important for healthcare professionals to carefully monitor the levels of these electrolytes in patients with CKD to ensure proper management of their disease progression and improve overall outcomes.

The primary effect of metabolic acidosis on the potassium concentration is a shift from inside of cell (intracellular) to outside of cell (extracellular). As blood pH decreases, the intracellular sodium and extracellular potassium concentration differs. Intracellular sodium concentration remains constant while extracellular potassium increases because of increased Na+/K+ATPase activity. This leads to increased influx of potassium into cells and outflux of sodium. As a result, the intracellular potassium decreases, but extracellular concentration continues to increase, leading to an overall shift from intracellular compartment to extracellular compartment.

Ms. Baga-at has a productive cough with sputum yellowish in color which suggest bronchitis and may have developed acute sinusitis. Her clinical presentation suggest an infectious etiology for her symptoms, thus, she is prescribed with antibiotics like Amoxicillin 500mg Q6H to treat bronchitis and paracetamol to relieve fever.

1. What is your diagnosis and rationale?
Dysthymic Disorder (Persistent Depressive Disorder)

2. What are the clinical manifestations of the disorder that would support this diagnosis?
• The patient has a depressed mood, diminished interest, loss of appetite, decreased energy, poor concentration and sleep disturbance
• The patient has experienced these symptoms for longer than 2 years with no clear cause.
3. What are the possible comorbidities that could affect this diagnosis?
• Anxiety disorder – the patient’s complaints of feeling nervous about their body’s changes can be a sign of anxiety.
• Sleep disturbance – sleep disturbance is one of the symptoms, but it may also be due to another factor such as insomnia or other underlying medical conditions.
4. What are potential contributing factors that could affect this diagnosis?
• Loss of appetite and decreased energy can be a sign of depression, which can lead to further weight loss.
• The patient’s poor concentration and sleep disturbance may be due to other factors such as insomnia or underlying medical conditions.
• Stress from work-related problems could also contribute to the patient’s symptoms of depression and anxiety.
5. What are potential contributing factors that could affect this diagnosis?
• Loss of appetite, decreased energy, poor concentration, sleep disturbance – all signs of depression. The patient may have experienced these symptoms for longer than 2 years with no clear cause; hence, the diagnosis should be Dysthymic Disorder (Persistent Depressive Disorder).
• Anxiety disorder – the patient’s complaints about feeling nervous about their body changes could indicate an underlying anxiety disorder.
6. What are the pertinent data from the case above?
The patient presented with symptoms of depression, including a decreased interest in activities they used to enjoy and weight loss. They reported having experienced these symptoms for longer than 2 years without any clear cause. The clinical manifestations support a diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder (Persistent Depressive Disorder), which requires at least two years of depressed mood or loss of interest with no clear cause. Possible comorbidities that could affect this diagnosis include anxiety disorders, sleep disturbance due to other factors such as insomnia or underlying medical conditions; stress from work-related problems might also contribute to the patient’s symptoms of depression and anxiety. It is important for providers to consider all possible contributing factors when making a diagnosis so as not to miss out on potential treatments that could benefit their patients significantly.
7. What are other related mental health conditions that should be considered when evaluating this patient?
• Anxiety disorder: The patient may have an underlying anxiety disorder due to their complaints about feeling nervous about their body changes. It is important for providers to rule out any comorbidities before making a diagnosis so as not to miss out on potential treatments that could benefit the patient significantly.
• Sleep disturbance: The patient’s decreased energy, poor concentration and sleep disturbance may be due to other factors such as insomnia or underlying medical conditions; providers should consider this when evaluating their patients for mental health issues.
8. What is your plan for treatment?
I will recommend therapy sessions that focus on cognitive behavioural techniques designed specifically for individuals experiencing persistent depressive symptoms like those presented by the patient in this case study, where they can learn strategies for managing negative thoughts and feelings associated with dysthymic disorder (persistent depressive disorder).
In addition, medication such as antidepressants might be necessary for some patients who do not respond well enough through psychotherapy alone. Providers should closely monitor their progress while ensuring patient safety throughout any type of intervention chosen by them.

Identifying and explaining the significance of the physical findings in the case is crucial for establishing a proper diagnosis. The physical findings can provide important clues about the patient's underlying condition, helping to narrow down the possibilities and guiding further investigation. In this particular case, the significant physical findings include:
1) Presence of petechiae (tiny red or purple spots on the skin): Petechiae can be a sign of various conditions such as meningitis, sepsis, or thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). This finding indicates that the patient may have an underlying blood disorder that needs to be investigated further.
2) Tachycardia: A rapid heart rate (>90 BPM) can indicate a condition like anxiety or panic disorder, or it could be a sign of an underlying medical condition such as heart disease or infection. In this case, tachycardia is a significant finding because it suggests that the patient may have a serious medical problem and needs immediate evaluation by a healthcare provider.
3) Abnormal respiratory rate: An abnormally slow (<10 BPM) or fast (>25 BPM) respiratory rate can be a sign of various conditions such as respiratory infection, pneumonia, or heart failure. It is important to assess the underlying cause of any significant changes in breathing patterns and promptly initiate appropriate treatment.
4) Elevated blood pressure: Blood pressure readings higher than 130/80 mmHg can indicate various conditions such as hypertension (high blood pressure), anxiety, or even a heart attack. In this case, elevated blood pressure is an important finding that requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause and appropriate treatment.
5) Abnormal chest sounds: The presence of abnormal chest sounds, such as crackles or wheezes, can indicate various respiratory conditions like pneumonia, asthma, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It is important to assess the underlying cause of any abnormal chest sounds and promptly initiate appropriate treatment.
6) Loss of consciousness: A sudden loss of consciousness can be a sign of various conditions such as seizures, head injuries, or fainting due to low blood pressure. In this case, it is crucial to assess the underlying cause of the patient's loss of consciousness and promptly initiate appropriate treatment.
7) Abnormal eye movements: The presence of abnormal eye movements, such as nystagmus or jerky eye movements, can indicate various neurological conditions like stroke, brain injury, or Parkinson's disease. It is important to assess the underlying cause of any significant changes in eye movement and promptly initiate appropriate treatment.
8) Abnormal pupil size: The size of a person's pupils can vary depending on lighting and other factors. However, abnormal pupil sizes like pinpoint pupils (smaller than normal), unequal pupils (one larger than the other), or dilated pupils (larger than normal) can indicate various neurological conditions such as stroke, brain injury, or substance intoxication. It is important to assess the underlying cause of any significant changes in pupil size and promptly initiate appropriate treatment.
9) Altered mental status: A change in a person's level of alertness, cognition (thinking ability), or behavior can indicate various neurological conditions like stroke, brain injury, or dementia. It is important to assess the underlying cause of any significant changes in mental status and promptly initiate appropriate treatment.
10) Abnormal speech: A person's speech can be affected by various medical conditions like stroke, brain injury, or dementia. It is important to assess the patient's ability to speak clearly, understand language, and communicate appropriately. Any significant changes in a person's speech should be assessed for possible underlying causes and promptly evaluated by a healthcare provider.
11) Abnormal coordination: A person's movements can be affected by various medical conditions like stroke, brain injury, or Parkinson's disease. It is important to assess the patient's ability to perform tasks that require coordination such as walking, writing, or eating. Any significant changes in a person's coordination should be assessed for possible underlying causes and promptly evaluated by a healthcare provider.
12) Abnormal reflexes: Reflexes are automatic responses that our bodies make to stimuli such as touch, sound, or movement. Different types of abnormal reflexes can indicate various medical conditions like stroke, brain injury, or spinal cord damage. It is important to assess the patient's response to various types of stimuli and promptly evaluate any significant findings by a healthcare provider.
13) Abnormal sensory perception: A person's ability to sense different aspects of their environment such as temperature, pain, or touch can be affected by various medical conditions like stroke, brain injury, or spinal cord damage. It is important to assess the patient's responses to various types of stimuli and promptly evaluate any significant findings by a healthcare provider.
14) Abnormal skin color changes: The skin can change in color due to many reasons such as sun exposure, certain medications, or underlying medical conditions like liver disease. In this case, it is crucial to assess the patient's overall skin condition and promptly evaluate any significant findings by a healthcare provider.
15) Abnormal laboratory test results: Depending on the specific lab tests performed, abnormal results can indicate various medical conditions such as infections, cancer, or metabolic disorders. It is important to assess all laboratory results and promptly evaluate any significant findings by a healthcare provider.
16) Abnormal radiological images (X-rays, CT scans, MRI): Imaging tests like X-rays, CT scans, or MRI can provide detailed pictures of the internal structures of the body, helping to identify potential problems such as infections, tumors, or structural abnormalities. Any significant findings on imaging studies should be promptly evaluated by a healthcare provider.
17) Abnormal ECG (electrocardiogram): An electrocardiogram is a test that measures the electrical activity of the heart and can provide valuable information about cardiac function. Significant abnormalities on an ECG can indicate various medical conditions such as arrhythmias, heart attacks, or structural abnormalities in the heart. It is important to promptly evaluate any significant findings on an ECG by a healthcare provider.
18) Abnormal urine analysis: Urinary analysis tests can provide valuable information about a person's kidney function and possible underlying medical conditions like diabetes, kidney disease, or urinary tract infections (UTIs). Significant abnormalities on urine analysis should be promptly evaluated by a healthcare provider.
19) Abnormal blood clotting tests: Blood clotting tests are used to evaluate the ability of the blood to clot properly and identify any potential bleeding disorders or excessive clotting (thrombosis). Significant abnormalities on these tests should be promptly evaluated by a healthcare provider.
20) Abnormal endocrine function: Endocrine functions involve the secretion of hormones that regulate various bodily processes such as metabolism, growth, and reproduction. Significant abnormalities in endocrine function can indicate various medical conditions like diabetes, thyroid disease, or adrenal gland disorders. It is important to promptly evaluate any significant findings related to endocrine function by a healthcare provider.
21) Abnormal chest radiograph (x-ray): A chest x-ray is an imaging test that provides detailed pictures of the structures inside the chest, including the lungs and heart. Significant abnormalities on a chest x-ray can indicate various medical conditions such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or heart disease. It is important to promptly evaluate any significant findings on a chest x-ray by a healthcare provider.
22) Abnormal pulmonary function tests: Pulmonary function tests are used to assess the lungs' ability to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide and identify potential respiratory problems like asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), or lung cancer. Significant abnormalities on these tests should be promptly evaluated by a healthcare provider.
23) Abnormal neurological examination: A neurological examination involves assessing the patient's nervous system functions such as sensation, coordination, and mental status. Significant abnormalities in these areas can indicate various medical conditions like stroke, brain injury, or multiple sclerosis (MS). It is important to promptly evaluate any significant findings on a neurological exam by a healthcare provider.
24) Abnormal sleep studies: Sleep studies are used to assess the patient's sleep patterns and identify potential sleep disorders like insomnia, sleep apnea, or narcolepsy. Significant abnormalities in these tests should be promptly evaluated by a healthcare provider.
25) Ab

The patient, Ms. A, a 75-year-old woman, presents with a 2-month history of a persistent cough and shortness of breath upon exertion that developed after her recent retirement from her job as an office worker. The symptoms became progressively worse over the past month to the point where Ms. A is experiencing difficulty walking up two flights of stairs without experiencing extreme fatigue. She states she has no fever, chills, weight loss, night sweats, or recent travel history. Ms. A denies any symptoms related to her cardiovascular or respiratory system. She is a current smoker and reports that she smoked two packs of cigarettes per day for 20 years until she quit smoking about 3 weeks ago. Her only medical condition is hypertension, which has been well-controlled with medications. Ms. A also mentions having a history of chronic back pain in the past, although she does not currently have any symptoms related to her back.

Clinical examination reveals clear breath sounds bilaterally and normal heart and lung sounds upon auscultation. Ms. A's cardiovascular exam is unremarkable with normal blood pressure readings and no signs of peripheral edema or abnormal heart rhythm. The results from the laboratory workup show an elevated white blood cell count (16,000/µL) along with elevated levels of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, and ferritin.

Diagnosis: Ms. A has a condition known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a progressive lung disease that causes airflow blockage and breathing difficulty. The main symptoms of COPD include cough, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and wheezing. Ms. A's persistent cough and shortness of breath upon exertion are typical signs of this condition. Other possible diagnoses that could be considered include asthma or other forms of chronic respiratory disease. However, the results of laboratory workup, including an elevated white blood cell count along with elevated levels of inflammatory markers, support a diagnosis of COPD.

2. Physiotherapy (Massage therapy, Exercise, Posture education)
3. Acupuncture, Chiropractic Manipulation, Yoga Therapy
4. NSAIDS, Steroid Injection, Nerve Blocks, RFA, PRP

The patient had an elevated Apgar score at 10 min and at 5 minutes had a heart rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of 28 breaths/min, with a temperature of 97.4 degrees Fahrenheit. There was a slight decrease in the heart rate from 93 beats/min to 86 beats/min and an increase in the respiratory rate from 11-28 breaths per minute.

Gastroenteritis

A 64 yo male with a history of HTN, CAD and hypercholesterolemia presented to the Emergency room with epigastric abdominal pain. He had a prior EGD, which showed an esophageal ulcer. After he was treated for that condition, his abdominal symptoms continued, but never progressed to any serious illness.

### Discussion:

This patient's history of prior EGD and subsequent abdominal pain does not suggest the need for further assessment of this abdominal pain. The patient's abdominal pain has been an ongoing problem, but it is not acute in nature, which could be a sign of something more serious such as malignancy.

The primary impression that can be drawn from this case, "Fortune Telling by Telephone: 18 U.S.C § 1302", is that telephone fortune tellers may fall under the definition of a "swindler" and may be prosecuted for their actions if they misrepresent themselves or make fraudulent claims regarding their abilities to perform magic, clairvoyance, etc.

Yes, the symptoms presented by the patient may be consistent with peptic ulcers. Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a condition that causes sores or openings in the lining of the stomach and/or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine). Symptoms can include:

1. Pain in the abdomen, usually around the belly button or between the breasts and hips. The pain may come and go and be relieved by eating food.
2. Bleeding from the rectum (bloody stools) or vomiting blood.
3. Weight loss without any obvious reason.
4. Heartburn, nausea, bloating and indigestion.
5. Frequent burping, hiccups or feeling full quickly after eating.
6. Dark-colored urine (due to bleeding)

If you suspect that the patient may have PUD based on these symptoms, it would be important to get them assessed by a healthcare professional for further evaluation and treatment. They may recommend diagnostic tests such as an endoscopy or imaging studies like ultrasound or CT scan. Treatment options may include medications (anti-acid medications or proton pump inhibitors), lifestyle modifications, and sometimes surgery depending on the severity of the condition.

Elevated troponin and AKI are associated with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) with acute myocardial infarction as a cause of elevation in creatinine. Acute onset chest pain at 3AM and history of diabetes, smoker, hypertension makes coronary artery disease a likely diagnosis for the patient. ACS is characterized by unstable plaque formation, which results in rupture with thrombus formation leading to obstruction of blood supply, myocardial necrosis and elevation in Troponin. Patient presented at 3AM with chest pain so acute myocardial infarction is a likely diagnosis as cardiac muscle fibers would have been compromised already for longer time.

### Discussion:
The patient had a troponin value of 789ng/l and creatinine was increased to 1.7 mg/dL. These laboratory values suggest the presence of elevated troponin due to myocardial injury. Troponin I is a sensitive biomarker for ACS, with higher sensitivity compared to Troponin T, as it can be detected up to 24 hours after injury and have a half-life of around 5 days. Hence elevated troponin levels indicate that there has been damage or necrosis to the myocardial muscle fibers due to inadequate blood supply. This increase in creatinine suggests the presence of AKI, which may be attributed to dehydration secondary to the increased secretion of catecholamines due to increased sympathetic tone seen with ACS.

The patient’s history of diabetes and smoking increases the risk for developing ACS in this case as it is associated with atherosclerosis, which may be responsible for the plaque formation and thrombus formation leading to obstruction of blood supply causing myocardial necrosis.

### Impression:
Based on the available information, I would make an impression of ACS with acute myocardial infarction as a possible cause of elevated troponin and creatinine levels in this case. Patient’s age, smoking, diabetes and hypertension history increases risk for developing ACS which makes it likely to be the underlying cause behind his symptoms. Elevation in creatinine indicates AKI due to dehydration from increased catecholamine secretion secondary to increased sympathetic tone seen with ACS. Acute onset of chest pain at 3AM combined with elevated troponin levels further support the diagnosis of ACS as a cause for increased creatinine and myocardial damage.
