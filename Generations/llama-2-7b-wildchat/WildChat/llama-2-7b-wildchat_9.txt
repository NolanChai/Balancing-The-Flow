As she adjusts to her condition, Celestine also starts noticing strange and suspicious things, trying to figure them out. She also takes on the corruption withing the healthcare system and covertly investigates her fellow patients and staff. Meanwhile, Celestine also experiences romantic entanglements with patients and doctors alike. Other prominent characters include Sophia, a quadriplegic woman several years younger than Celestine, developing a bit of hero worship as her, multiple amputee Karen who is a former military nurse, shell-shocked by her experience, and Matilda who is remarkably similar to Celestine, even having the same disability, but way more fiery and aggressive.
