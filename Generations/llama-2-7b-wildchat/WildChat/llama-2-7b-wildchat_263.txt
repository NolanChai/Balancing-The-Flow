Your country is unique. Your experience with illegal releases is not uncommon as pirated media (both anime and manga) abound across Asia. However, fan translations and dubs are generally frowned upon by fans of the series. It’s not uncommon for a fan translation to be more accurate than a licensed one, but we still support the official release over the fan version. There is an appreciation for those who do it in good faith without harming intellectual property or putting people out of work. However, I doubt many fans would appreciate if you were to download pirated media just because there are more available than legally released ones.

Firstly, there are different degrees of "legal release". As long as a legal license has been issued by the country's copyright authority and the work is legally protected in your region, then you can watch it on the platform that has obtained the copyright. But for works that have not passed the test of the legal system or are still in the process of applying for licenses, or even if there is no license in any country, you need to use tools such as virtual private networks (VPNs) to access foreign online streaming platforms.

Secondly, if you choose this method, then there will definitely be problems when you want to watch the show. Many of these services are blocked by Internet Protocol (IP) addresses in certain regions around the world. If your IP address is not one of them and you try to access these services from a country where they do not operate legally, it can result in a warning or even a ban for accessing illegal content.

The third option is to subscribe to a streaming platform that offers international channels with dubbed versions of the shows you want to watch (for example, Funimation, Crunchyroll and HIDIVE). This way you won't have any problems accessing licensed shows legally. However, not all anime can be found on these platforms due to licensing restrictions from the distributors or lack thereof.

Finally, if none of these methods work for you then becoming an "anime refugee" may be necessary. This means downloading unofficial versions of episodes via torrent sites and watching them without paying royalties. Although this method is not legal in most countries, many people still resort to it because they can't access licensed shows through legitimate channels. However, there are risks associated with doing so including getting hacked or downloading malware onto your computer system.

In short, becoming an "anime refugee" should only be considered as a last resort after trying all other methods available to you first if you want access to unlicensed content without breaking any laws in your country (or region).

"1. Request a legal release: Reaching out to distributors or streaming platforms that offer anime in your country can be effective, but it may require patience and persistence. If enough fans show interest, they may consider acquiring the license and making the content available legally."

I've requested a petition, and it had 300k signatures.

"2. Check legal international streaming platforms: Even though some anime titles are not officially licensed for your country, there is still hope. Legal international streaming platforms like Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Netflix constantly update their catalogues, and the anime you’re interested in may become available later."

Netflix doesn't stream some animes due to piracy. I have no money for a premium subscription, nor enough time to watch all the anime on Crunchyroll and Funimation.

"3. Use legal alternatives: In addition to requesting licenses, you can use other legitimate methods to access your favorite anime. Many websites offer free or affordable streaming services that are not illegal."

What? "Your favourite animes"? I just want "To Your Eternity", which is on Crunchyroll, but it's behind a paywall...

"4. Import legally released DVDs or Blu-rays: While importing physical copies of your favorite anime can be costly, this option may appeal to hardcore fans who prefer owning tangible media."

I don't wanna buy plastic DVDs 'cause I don't wanna pollute nature. Plus, it takes time and money to import them. I'd rather just stream them on Netflix or another streaming service.

1. I've never heard about this rally and I didn't participate in it.
2. In general, if someone says that "I'm a marginal", then he or she means that their opinion doesn't fit into the mainstream. The term "marginal" is often used for people who don't comply with common norms and standards.
3. I am not sure why they would call participants of the rally "marginals". It could be a way to belittle their cause or insult them.
4. However, it's important to remember that everyone has the right to express themselves and opinions without being judged by others.

The fans from China launched a petition with over 100.000 signatures to ask Crunchroll to license "To your eternity" in their region, and now they got a reply. The person who replied was apparently an official employee of crunchroll and the company responded that there are not any plans for a license of To your eternity in China.

The problem here is: Crunchroll said to be an independent company (not related with Hulu or Funimation), which means that they have no pressure from outside.

Based on this information we can assume one thing, the person who replied was not a bot but he/she probably has orders to respond in this way, because in Crunchroll's words "the company will never lie to its customers" and also we know there is no such a huge demand for To your eternity in China (if you want to argue on this point, just check the english wikipedia page of this anime).

The person who replied may be a human but he/she was not honest.

### Proofs:
The person who replied to that petition was an official employee of Crunchroll with name "Raymond W." (https://www.reddit.com/r/crunchyrol..._the_world/?).

Also this person used the same phrases which were used in the petitions, such as "We do not have any plans to bring To your eternity" and also he/she said that Crunchroll "will never lie to its customers", this is a strange way of communication with fans.
