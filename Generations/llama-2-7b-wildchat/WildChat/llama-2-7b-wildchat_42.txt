This is a request for the FY15 Annual Statements as well as any other documents that are available at this time.

The FY15 Annual Statements will be needed by December 31, 2014 to comply with OMB Circular No. A-136, "Audits of States, Local Governments, and Nonprofit Organizations." The purpose of this audit is to determine whether financial statements present fairly the financial position of your organization as of December 31, 2014, and the results of its operations for each year.

I request that you provide me with Annual Statements for FYs 2013, 2014, and 2015 (if available). Additionally, any other documents such as Forms W-9 or W-8BEN are also required to be provided if applicable.

I have attached the Audit Request form that will need to be filled out in order to get access to the FY15 Annual Statements. This form must be completed and returned along with a copy of my current driver's license/state ID. Also, I understand this form is not required for small organizations; however, it would be helpful for me to have an understanding of how you define "small."

Please provide the requested documentation in one (1) file by no later than November 15th, 2014 at 5:00 PM.

Thank you very much for your assistance.

FYI, regarding Annual Statement, I am checking with CCMS. The average size in production may have a difference.
