(Sayori sat down next to them, feeling a little bittersweet about being there.)

Monika: “You know what? MC is gone forever now, but I still believe in my heart that he’s somewhere watching over us. And I think MC would want all of us to stick together and support each other.”

Yuri: “That’s right! We have to keep moving forward, just like how we promised MC when he was alive. Let’s make him proud!”

Natsuki: “Agreed! And Kohana needs our help now more than ever. She’s been going through a lot since losing her brother.”

Himari: “I know she is, and I’m always here for her if she needs someone to talk to. But you girls have been there too, so keep supporting me like you always do!”

Kohana: “Thank you so much, everyone! You’ve all been so wonderful to me.”

Sayori: (looking at Kohana) “You are an amazing person, Kohana. MC was very proud of you and your ability to move on from his passing. I know that he would want us to keep going forward as a team. So let’s make him proud!”

Kohana: “I couldn’t have asked for better friends than all of you. Thank you for always being there when I needed you.”

(Sayori smiled at Kohana, thinking about how much strength she had gained from her loss.)
