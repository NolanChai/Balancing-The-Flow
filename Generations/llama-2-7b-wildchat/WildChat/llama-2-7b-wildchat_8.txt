1. Christian Vaughn
2. Christian is a fire fighter and he has good upper body strength so we assign him the Kickboxing as his primary style since it helps him use that strength for punches and kicks while also keeping him fit to do his job.  His secondary style would be Wrestling since it will help him stay grounded when he gets caught in a fire and he needs to get out of there quickly.
3. Tommy Rollins
4. As a bartender, Tommy is quite good at managing the floor with agility and speed. This makes him a perfect candidate for Muay Thai as his primary style and Judo as his secondary style which will help him keep the area in control.
5. Billy Turner
6. Given that Billy has good core strength, we assign him Karate as his primary style so he can make full use of it with powerful punches and kicks along with some ground-breaking techniques when needed.  For his secondary style, Judo is chosen since its combination of grappling techniques will be helpful in controlling opponents if ever Billy needs to defend himself against an aggressor.
7. Stacy Simmons
8. Stacy has a slender and lean body structure which makes her great at speedy movements that can help her maneuver through opponents quickly while still maintaining balance, which is why we choose boxing as her primary style and wrestling for her secondary one since they both focus on agility and flexibility respectively.
9. Selina Morano
10. With good core strength and flexibility along with an added advantage due to being bi-sexual, she can benefit from either Judo or Shuai Jiao depending on how she wants to approach a fight situation which makes them perfect choices for her primary style - judo for striking capabilities while shuai jiao offers more grappling options for takedowns if needed.  For the secondary style we chose Karate so she can utilize both kicking and punching techniques with great effectiveness when facing opponents of any size or strength level.
11. Valentina Miller
12. Valentina's athleticism makes her perfect for either Judo or Muay Thai depending on if she wants to go into ground grappling or standing striking; we choose Judo as the primary one since it helps keep her agile when fighting on the floor while allowing room for different grapping techniques should things take an unexpected turn during a fight sequence.  For secondary style, Karate is selected since this combines all elements together with strong punches along with powerful kicks which will help her stand out from other opponents who may not have those advantages at hand when facing off against her.
