History of systems

X-DOS: The original operating system was released in 1987. It was a text-based system with limited features. X-DOS had the ability to run programs from the command line, allowing users to execute multiple tasks at once.

X-DOS 2: In 1989, X-DOS 2 added a smaller font size, which made it easier for users to read commands and make changes on their computers. The system also included support for custom xapp development through DevX.

X-DOS 3: In 1990, the X-DOS 3 operating system introduced color support with its COLOR command. This allowed users to view output in various colors.

X-DOS 4: Released in 1991, X-DOS 4 included support for Progressnet, an application development framework that helped developers build custom software quickly and easily. The system also provided tools such as DevX and PVT, which were used to create graphics applications with a user interface.

X OS: In 1993, X-DOS was renamed "X OS" when the operating system became more than just an application development platform. With this new name came several improvements such as a graphical user interface (GUI), support for Progressnet programs, and DevX enhancements to make it easier to develop custom software solutions.

In 1995, X OS 2 was released with advanced networking features like LAN support and IDLE Network, which enabled users to connect multiple computers together over a network connection. The operating system also provided enhanced security features such as password protection on certain directories or files within the system file system hierarchy structure (SFS).

X OS 3: In 1996, X OS introduced Progress Sweeper and Progresstrix - two tools that enabled developers to quickly scan their systems for malware or viruses while running under an isolated environment called "Progressbox" without affecting other applications running on the same machine simultaneously.

X T kernel: In 1997, X OS adopted a new X T (Xtreme Technology) kernel with improved performance capabilities compared to its predecessors based on 386 processor architecture (eight years earlier). This enabled developers create more complex applications requiring higher computational power while maintaining stability throughout all environments including workstations running under Windows NT 4 operating system from Microsoft Corporation.

X OS 4: In 1998, X OS introduced full-screen menu called "XMenu" which allowed users to easily navigate through programs installed on their computers without needing any additional tools like mouse pointer cursor control or keyboard shortcuts combinations (e.g., Alt + Tab). Additionally, XOS 4 provided enhanced network features such as IPv6 support for improved security against malicious attacks coming from outside networks connected via Internet Protocol version six
