(Above video of Goku talking with the other dragon gods about their wishlist. He looks at a picture of Vegeta. The others look at him with curious expressions.)

Goku: "Yeah I'm good...but this is Vegeta's birthday, so it would be nice if I could give him something special."

(Vegeta enters the room.)

Vegeta: "Is that why you called us here?"

Goku: "Well yeah. I wanted to see what everyone else wants."

Vegeta: "Sounds great Goku, what do we want?"

(All other dragons say their wish in unison.)

King Kai: "We want the wishes of every being who has ever lived in peace and harmony!"

Goku: "...You know that's a lot to ask right? That would make you even more powerful than you already are."

King Kai: "It will also give us complete control over our universe, no mortal could stop us from fulfilling every wish we ever made. We can live in peace for eternity!!"

Goku: "...Alright I'll try and find a way to do this..."

(Everyone else nods.)

Vegeta: "I have faith in you Goku."

Goku: (Smiles) "Thanks Vegeta. I'm gonna go talk with Whis now so we can figure out how to make all of your dreams come true!"

(Goku runs out the room and Vegeta closes the door behind him.)

Vegeta: "...We don't have any real competition, not even in the entire universe."

(Everyone smiles at each other before they begin talking about their future plans. )
