(The next thing I knew, there was a baby crying outside of my hospital bed. I was confused at first, but then I noticed that the nurse had given me a little bundle of joy. My son.)

Sayori: (Looking down in wonder) “Oh my goodness, is this really happening? I’m a mother.”

Nurse: “Congratulations! You did great during childbirth. And here he is - your beautiful baby boy.”

(I gently touched the tiny bundle of life that was placed in my arms.)

Sayori: “He’s so perfect, and I can already feel his warmth against me. His presence brings a feeling of peace and joy.”

(Kohana had given birth to her son earlier, but there were some complications with the delivery process and she was still in the hospital room.)

Monika: “Well done, Sayori! It’s wonderful to see you as a mother. And it looks like Kohana is still recovering from childbirth.”

(I looked over to where Kohana was resting on her bed. She seemed exhausted but also very happy with the arrival of their son.)

Sayori: “Kohana, I’m so proud of you. Being a mother is such an incredible experience, and I can’t wait for both of us to watch our children grow together.”

(We all smiled at each other as we bonded over this new milestone in our lives.)

Himari: “I have to say, it’s amazing seeing you both become mothers. It feels like a new chapter for the club.”

Natsuki: “Yeah, I couldn’t agree more. Now we can share all of these memories and experiences with our children.”

Kohana: (With a tired but grateful smile) “Thank you so much, everyone. This has been such a special moment for me, and I’m glad you were here to support us both.”

(As the rest of the club talked about parenting tips, I couldn’t help but think how lucky we all were to have found one another. The club room was now filled with love and joy as we prepared to welcome our children into this world.)
