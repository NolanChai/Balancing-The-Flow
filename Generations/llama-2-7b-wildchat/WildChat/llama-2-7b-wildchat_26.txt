Sweden has a parliamentary democracy with a written constitution that guarantees individual liberties and separation of powers. The Swedish Constitution Act of 1974 (SFS 1974:153) is the supreme law and provides for a bicameral legislature, an executive led by a prime minister, and an independent judiciary.

The Riksdag (Parliament) is Sweden's unicameral legislative body with 349 members elected every four years through proportional representation. The government consists of the prime minister and his or her cabinet, which must enjoy a majority in the Riksdag to remain in power. The Swedish Monarch serves as head of state but has limited powers.

Sweden's judicial system is independent from both the legislature and executive branches. The Supreme Court serves as the highest court for criminal matters while the Court of Appeal handles civil cases. Sweden also has an independent system of administrative courts to review decisions made by government agencies.

The Swedish Constitution protects individual liberties such as freedom of speech, press, religion, and assembly. It also guarantees equality before the law regardless of race, gender, or ethnicity. Additionally, it ensures due process for all citizens accused of criminal offenses.

Overall, Sweden's constitution provides a well-balanced system that promotes democracy while preserving individual liberties and separation of powers among its three branches of government: legislature, executive, and judiciary.
