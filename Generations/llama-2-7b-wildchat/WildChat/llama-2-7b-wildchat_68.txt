Thank you for the invitation. I will attend if possible. If not, please include my colleagues in the event.

Dear Ms. Smith,
I appreciate your invitation to a year-end party with all of our employees at The Office. As I am leaving for another project this month, unfortunately, I will not be able to attend. Please include my colleagues in the event if possible and send me photos afterward!
