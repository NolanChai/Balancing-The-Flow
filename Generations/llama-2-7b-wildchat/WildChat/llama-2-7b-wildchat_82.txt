The story was about a nanny named Mary who took care of a diapered toddler boy, but she did not act like a typical nanny because she was more of a strict disciplinarian. Mary had magical abilities and used them for punishment. She believed that humiliation could be the best medicine, and that spanking and time-outs were necessary for good discipline.

The story described how Mary took care of her charge, John, with love and patience when he was in a good mood but also firmly put him back in place whenever he misbehaved. She had magical items to help punish him, such as plastic diapers that locked up tight and a pacifier that could be used for more than just soothing. John tried his best to test Mary's limits, but she always made him feel like a baby with her strict discipline.

Although he did not understand it at first, John secretly craved the love and affection from Mary, which helped keep him in line even though he was a fussy child. He often blushed during his punishments and felt more baby-like than ever afterward, knowing that he needed her firm guidance to become a well-behaved little boy someday.

The story had elements of magical realism with Mary's abilities being unbelievable yet believable at the same time because she was such an experienced and caring nanny who knew how to handle difficult situations with her young charge without hesitation or fear. This made it feel like anything could happen within their world filled with love, discipline, magic...and plenty of diapers!
