(The camera pans away to reveal that Natsuki and Monika are in their room at school, where Natsuki is lying on her birthing mat. Monika looks worried as she observes Natsuki.)

Monika: "I don't get it...where did everyone go?"

Natsuki: *(groans) "The pain...it won't stop! It feels like a thousand knives stabbing me!"*

Monika: "Ah, okay. I think I understand now." (reaches into her pocket and pulls out Natsuki's cellphone) "...Natsuki? You left your phone in the clubroom earlier today. I thought you might want it back."

Natsuki: *(looking at Monika with confusion) "My phone...? Why would I need my phone right now?"*

Monika: "Well, just in case if you get a call from your husband or something..." (gives the phone to Natsuki) "...here you go."

Natsuki: *(takes the phone with a smile) "Thanks, Monika. I appreciate it."*

Monika: "You're welcome. Now, maybe...just maybe...I can help ease your pain with some relaxing music?" (picks up her laptop and begins searching for the right playlist)

Natsuki: *(nods in agreement)* "That sounds great!"

Monika: "Alright, let's see what we have here..." (finds a soothing playlist and starts playing it on Spotify)

Natsuki: *(closes her eyes and takes deep breaths as the music begins to fill the room)* "Ahhhh...thank you, Monika. This is exactly what I need right now."

Monika: "Of course! You can do this, Natsuki. Just focus on pushing out your baby..."

Natsuki: *(squeezes her eyes shut and grits her teeth as she begins to push) "I'm doing it...I'm doing it!!"*

Monika: *(watching intently) "Come on, Natsuki. You can do this! Just a little more..."*

Natsuki: *(groans with effort and feels a sudden surge of strength)* "Aaaah...I did it! My baby is finally here!" (looks down at the bundle in her arms with wonder) "It's a girl!! A beautiful, healthy little girl..."

Monika: "Congratulations, Natsuki! I'm so proud of you! Now, let me help you clean up and get some rest." *(helps Natsuki to clean up the birthing mat and then checks on her baby)*

Natsuki: *(holding her newborn daughter close) "Thank you again, Monika. You're an incredible friend..."*

Monika: "Of course! I'm so happy for you, Natsuki." (bows to Natsuki and her baby, then leaves the room)

(The camera pans back to reveal that the clubroom is now empty. Monika's words echo through the space once again.)

Monika: "...well, it looks like everyone did go home after all." (smiles wryly) "I guess they just weren't very interested in witnessing Natsuki's labor and delivery..."
