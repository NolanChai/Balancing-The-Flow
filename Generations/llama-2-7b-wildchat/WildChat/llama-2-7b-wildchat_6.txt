Max would have an encounter with the mind flayer inside of the upside down. She is in her room and she feels that something or someone is watching her. She looks around the room and notices that nothing seems to be out of place but then suddenly she sees a dark shadow moving behind one of the bookshelves. Max begins to tremble with fear as she tries to process what she has just seen. Suddenly, a tendril of darkness wraps around her neck and starts to pull her towards the wall.

She tries desperately not to give in but each time she does something against her will, she feels herself becoming more and more lost within this terrifying place that seems intent on destroying everything Max knows about life outside of this realm.

Max walked over to a blackboard, she began writing a list of her goals.
She had never considered herself bad before now, but it was clear to her that she needed to change her ways. She added 'destroy humanity' and 'become immortal' at the top of her list.
The Mind Flayer, who had been watching from behind Max all along, gave a sinister smile as he read over her shoulder. He began laughing maniacally, but Max was too focused on her goals to notice.
She walked away without a second glance back towards him; his laughter faded into the background noise of their shared home.
