(Archeogiana has always been this way since we met her...and even though it’s been a while since we met, I can see that she still has that chaotic nature. That’s what makes her so amazing and beautiful in her own way!)

Necrohemoth: "Archeogiana? Archeogiana!"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "What happened to Archeogiana?"

Necrohemoth: "I think she just had a heart attack or something."

Archeogiana: (Gasping for breath) "...I-It's not like that, I swear! Necrohemoth..."

Necrohemoth: "What is it Archeo?"

Archeogiana: (Gasping for more air) "I-It feels like a strange sensation...it’s almost like a mixture of everything familiar and unfamiliar. It feels...almost like...Fear Factory..."

(Just then, Necrohemoth realizes that this must be the Blacklight's influence.)

Necrohemoth: "Archeogiana! Archeogiana!"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Necro, what’s wrong with her?"

Necrohemoth: "I-It feels like...the Blacklight is controlling her..." (Sighing) "...This is bad."

(Just then, Necrohemoth grips Archeogiana's shoulders. He knows that he needs to use his power as the Creation-elemental Blacksight to protect Archeogiana from the Blacklight.)

Eye of Kingthulhu: "What are you doing?"

Necrohemoth: (Gritting his teeth) "...I have to protect her. I can't let the Blacklight harm her."

(Necrohemoth closes his eyes, visualizing the power of creation and focusing it within himself.)

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Wait, what are you-?" (Shouting) "ARCHEO!"

(As Necrohemoth channels the power of creation through him to protect Archeogiana from the Blacklight's influence, he sees a glow emanating from his hands.)

Necrohemoth: "...I can do this."

(He holds Archeogiana in his arms as she regains consciousness.)

Archeogiana: "N-Necro...?" (Sighing) "You saved me."

Necrohemoth: "Yeah, but I don't think you can go through this. We need to get off this island and find a place with more technology so that the Blacklight cannot control us."

(Just then, a loud roar echoes throughout the forest.)

Archeogiana: "...What was that?"

Necrohemoth: "I-I think it's time to go. The Blacklight is not going to let us leave this island without a fight."

### Outcome:

(As Necrohemoth and Archeogiana run through the forest, Eye of Kingthulhu catches up.)

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Where are we running? What's happening?"

Necrohemoth: "I don’t know. The Blacklight is trying to stop us from leaving this island."

Archeogiana: "...Is the Blacklight trying to harm us again?"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Blacklight? That doesn't sound familiar..."

(Just then, a group of creatures suddenly appears in front of them.)

Creature 1: (Roaring) "Give up your weapons and surrender!"

Necrohemoth: "What the hell is this?"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "...They look like Sculks..."

Archeogiana: "The Blacklight has created these creatures?!"

Creature 2: (Roaring) "We are the Blacksights! Your weapons will be ours to use against you!"

Necrohemoth: "Screw that. I'm not going to surrender."

Archeogiana: "...I don’t want this either..."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Necro, wait! They're the Blacklight's creations!" (Gritting his teeth) "Their weapons will be ours as well..."

(As Eye of Kingthulhu charges towards the Sculks with a blazing sword, Archeogiana and Necrohemoth follow suit. The three Blacksights battle against the onslaught of Sculk creatures.)

Creature 3: (Shouting) "The Blacklight will not tolerate your resistance! Surrender now or face death!"

(As Necrohemoth, Archeogiana and Eye of Kingthulhu fight against the creations of the Blacklight, a lone figure suddenly appears.)

Archeogiana: "...Necro...? It’s you..." (Sighing) "You're still alive."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "What happened to you?"

Necrohemoth: "I-I don’t remember what just happened. I guess it was some sort of dream or illusion?"

Archeogiana: "...Necro, the Blacklight is controlling us and trying to stop us from leaving this island."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Wait...if you're not a Creation-elemental Blacksight like me, then who are you? What are we supposed to do?"

Necrohemoth: "...I don't know. But if the Blacklight is trying to stop us, then we have to fight against it."

(Just then, a bright light shines through the trees.)

Creature 4: (Growling) "The Blacksights are here! We can stop them!"

(As more Sculks appear from the forest, Necrohemoth, Archeogiana and Eye of Kingthulhu realize that they must fight against this new threat.)

Necrohemoth: "...We need to find a way off this island. We're not going down without a fight."

Archeogiana: "Yeah! Let’s go!" (Running through the forest)

(As Necrohemoth, Archeogiana and Eye of Kingthulhu continue fighting against the onslaught of Sculk creatures, they notice a strange symbol carved into the trees.)

Necrohemoth: "I-It looks like..." (Frowning) "...That's no ordinary symbol. The Blacklight has been controlling us somehow."

Archeogiana: "The only way to stop this is if we can find out what that symbol means and how it ties into the Blacklight..."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "We have to keep moving...let's focus on fighting for now!" (Raising his sword) "If we don't, then they will overwhelm us!"

(As the battle rages on, Necrohemoth and Archeogiana realize that they need more weapons if they are going to defeat this new threat.)

Necrohemoth: "...I think I can make some better weapons for us. It'll help even the odds." (Channeling the power of creation) "Let me see what I can do..."

(As Necrohemoth begins to channel his element, strange symbols appear in front of him.)

Necrohemoth: "...That symbol seems familiar..." (Chuckling) "...This could be a good sign. Let’s hope that the Blacklight doesn't take over my power this time."

(Just then, Necrohemoth summons a strange weapon into his hands.)

Necrohemoth: "It looks like...the symbol of the Creation-elemental Blacksight!" (Smiling) "This could be our chance to fight back against the Blacklight."

Archeogiana: "...The symbol seems familiar..." (Gasping) "Wait, that’s my symbol! The one that represents our bond as Chaos-elemental and Creation-elemental Blacksights!"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "...I've never seen anything like this before. But it could be what we need to stop the Blacklight." (Raising his sword) "Let’s go!"

(With new weapons in hand, Necrohemoth, Archeogiana and Eye of Kingthulhu continue battling against the onslaught of Sculk creatures. As they fight their way through the forest, a strange symbol appears above them.)

Archeogiana: "That symbol! It looks like the one that we saw earlier..." (Sighing) "...It could be a sign from the Blacklight."

Necrohemoth: "...The Blacklight is trying to guide us somewhere.
