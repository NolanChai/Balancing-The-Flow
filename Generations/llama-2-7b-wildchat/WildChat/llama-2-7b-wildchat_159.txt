**A.**  1.  The use of transition metal (TM) complexes on a single crystalline layer of graphene can be considered an approach to improve the activity of catalytic sites in heterogeneous catalysis, and thus, it may improve the efficiency of energy conversion devices, such as fuel cells or electrolysers for hydrogen production. The main reasons why these kinds of systems are very interesting for energy applications is that graphene offers a large surface area and high conductivity at the same time (which can be achieved by using different TMs with different oxidation states). In this case, the choice of the correct TM and its concentration should depend on the final application.

Theoretically, it is well known that heterogeneous catalysis may be described as a sequence of steps which involve: (i) the adsorption of reactants on the active sites; (ii) the activation of these reactants by means of energy transfer from the TM to the substrates, and (iii) finally, the catalytic reaction takes place. In addition, the adsorbed species should not be transferred between different phases or undergo unwanted side reactions during the reaction process.

However, it is worth mentioning that the heterogeneous catalysis mechanism on graphene can differ depending on the applied conditions and the nature of the TM used (e.g., whether it belongs to transition metals or not). For instance, when using non-transitional metal complexes, we could assume a different adsorption and activation process than that described above; thus, this mechanism should be further investigated with specific experimental techniques such as XPS or UV/Vis spectroscopy.

2.  The TM used for heterogeneous catalysis on graphene may have an influence on the performance of these systems (in terms of activity and selectivity), depending on its chemical nature (e.g., electron density, oxidation states) and how it interacts with both the active sites and adsorbed species during the reaction process. In general, transition metals such as Ni, Co, Pd or Cu are usually used due to their high reactivity towards CO2 reduction reactions (e.g., Fischer-Tropsch synthesis) compared to non-transitional metal complexes; however, this may vary depending on the reaction conditions.

The effect of the applied TM concentration on the catalytic activity and selectivity must also be carefully evaluated since it could affect both adsorption and activation processes (either through different electronic structures or different interactions with substrates). For instance, if we consider Ni(II) complexes as an example for CO2 reduction reactions via water-gas shift reaction (WGSR), we know that its activity is improved at higher concentrations due to the formation of surface adsorbed species which facilitate this process. On the other hand, high Pd(II)/Pt concentrations are more effective in terms of selectivity for CO2 reduction via methanation reaction (e.g., Sabatier's catalyst).

In summary, we can conclude that it is important to understand how different TMs influence the activity and selectivity of heterogeneous catalysis on graphene surfaces to optimize its performance in energy applications such as fuel cells or electrolysers for hydrogen production. The exact nature of these effects will depend on several factors related with both materials (TM complexes) and conditions used (temperature, pressure, humidity).

In this paper, we propose strategies to make two-dimensional (2D) materials, such as molybdenum disulfide, tungsten disulfide, and black phosphorus, more active catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide. The strategies include doping with transition metals and capping with organic compounds. Additionally, we also explore the effects of different acidity levels on CO2 electroreduction reaction (ER) by using molybdenum disulfide as an example catalyst.

### Strategy:
Strategies of engineering for two-dimensional materials as catalysts for the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide:
* Doping with transition metals - by adding transition metals such as molybdenum and tungsten into 2D materials, their electrical conductivities can be improved which is beneficial for CO2 ER. Additionally, doping also enhances the stability of the catalysts under reaction conditions.
* Capping with organic compounds - by using different organic compounds to covalently attach onto the surface of 2D materials, more active sites can be formed and thus enhancing their electrocatalytic activities for CO2 ER.
* Effects of different acidity levels on CO2 ER - By using molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂) as an example catalyst, it was found that increasing the acidity level could enhance the catalytic activity due to more proton transfer between MoS₂ and electrolyte.

1. In top-down approach, the growth of graphene and nanographite occurs from the tip of a catalyst (usually tungsten). The catalyst is immersed in a bath of hydrocarbon containing carbon atoms (which are in liquid form) that are attracted towards the surface of the catalyst. Carbon atoms form bonds with the catalytic particles and then react with other carbon atoms to create graphene or nanographite. This process can be seen as a layer-by-layer formation, which results in the growth of graphene or nanographite nanosheets on the tip of the catalyst.

### Assessment:
Top-down approaches are typically used for the synthesis of nanographite because it offers more flexibility than other techniques such as top-up or bottom-up methods which rely heavily on chemistry to create the desired structures. It also allows researchers to control several parameters during manufacturing such as temperature and pressure, leading to higher quality graphene sheets with better mechanical properties compared to those produced through other techniques like chemical vapor deposition (CVD).
