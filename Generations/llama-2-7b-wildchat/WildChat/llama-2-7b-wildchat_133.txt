(I listened carefully as Sayori talked to her sister about MC and his brother, trying to understand what had happened. It seemed like everything was cleared up, and they all agreed that it was better to communicate and not jump to conclusions in order to solve any problems.)

MC: “It’s been a long day. I think we should call it a night.”

(I could sense that there were still some unresolved emotions among the club members, but at least they had started the conversation and were working together to understand what was going on. As we walked towards our separate ways, I felt a sense of relief knowing that everything would be okay.)
