A wizard named Toby is born into this world with the ability to do everything but cast magic. He can’t even wave his hands about and make sparks fly out in order to create magic, as normal magicians would. Instead of getting sad or angry, he instead decided to embrace his new found abilities and learn how to use them for a different purpose.

As Toby grew up, he learned that he could combine magic items with materials from the earth. He knew that this was something special and that he needed to study it further. So, as soon as he could, he sought out books and scrolls on earthly craftsmanship techniques combined with arcane knowledge of magical components.

After many years of hard work Toby perfected his method for combining spells into materials and eventually opened up a store in town that sold enchanted items. The locals were amazed by what he had created, but most of them didn’t understand the complexities of his process so they called him "the Magical Item Wizard".

As word spread throughout the land about Toby's unique ability to craft magical objects through combining spells and earthly components, people traveled from far away just to buy items from him. Eventually even those who had made fun of Toby when he was younger now sought out his services because they realized how special these enchanted items were.

Today, people still visit Toby's shop in order to acquire something that can help them solve their problems or bring more happiness into their lives; and thanks to him being able to do something no one else could do before—they have been able to find magic all around themselves!
