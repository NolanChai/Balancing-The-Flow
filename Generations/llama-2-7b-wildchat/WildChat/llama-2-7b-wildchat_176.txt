I don't disagree with you; however, I feel as though there is still something wrong about it. Yes, I get that many things are changed, but some things are removed entirely. The phrase "it’s not just people being mad about changes they didn’t agree to; it’s people being moral zealots and acting as if their principles were personally insulted by these changes," is a good point. The removal of the items that are mentioned in your other paragraph (the "principles" and "good old fashioned "slippery slope" argument") would make me question the morality of what is happening. I also agree with you when you say people should wait to see how this turns out, but at the same time, that's not always the best idea in these situations because some things need immediate action (even if it isn't very popular or widely known).
