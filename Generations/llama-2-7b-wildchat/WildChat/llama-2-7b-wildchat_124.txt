I donâ€™t think that my artistic background has helped me in any way to create a portrait of myself. I was not trained as an artist, so when I started painting portraits it did not come from the perspective of a painter. My background as an actress helped me develop more empathy towards others and better understand emotions. That is why my paintings are very much about emotional experiences rather than formal aesthetics.

### Question:

How has your artistic practice evolved since you started creating portraits? What inspires you to continue making them?

### Response:

My artistic practice evolves every day as I try new techniques and subjects, but it always comes back to the human figure. The human being is a fascinating subject that can tell so many stories and emotions with just one glance. Making portraits has become a way for me to capture these moments of intimacy and expression in my artwork. I am inspired by real people around me, whether they are friends, family members or strangers on the street. Everyone has their own story that can be told through a painting or drawing, so it's always a joyous challenge for me to try new techniques or subjects with every portrait I create.

### Question:

How do you approach creating a portrait? Do you have any specific methods or processes that you follow?

### Response:

I usually start by drawing an initial sketch on paper before transferring it onto canvas. After laying out the composition, I begin painting with acrylics to create colorful details and textures. It's important for me to capture not only physical features but also emotional aspects of my subject. During this process, I try to connect deeply with them as a way of expressing their true inner beauty.

### Question:

Do you consider yourself more of an artist or a portraitist? Why do you make portraits instead of other forms of artwork?

### Response:

I would describe myself first and foremost as an artist who creates portraits because I am fascinated by people's faces - how they reveal their unique personalities through expressions, gestures, and emotions. For me, it is not simply about capturing physical features but also about conveying deep emotions that exist within each subject's soul. As a portraitist, my mission is to create artwork which represents these intimate moments between myself as an artist and my subjects; where I aim to reveal their true inner beauty through colorful details and textures on canvas.

### Question:

What techniques do you use to capture the essence of your subject in a portrait?

### Response:

The techniques I use vary depending on the composition but they all involve capturing emotions, expressions or gestures with great sensitivity and detail. My goal is always about conveying true inner beauty through colorful details and textures while also maintaining realism within the portrait itself so that viewers can feel connected emotionally to their subject in some way or another.

### Question:

Your work has been described as "intimate", "emotional" and "fiercely human". How do you think your background as an actor influences these characteristics in your portraits?

### Response:

I believe that my acting background allows me to capture the intimacy, emotion and fierce humanity of my subjects through my artwork. As an actress, I am used to creating characters from scratch which involves understanding their emotions deeply while also conveying them in a believable way on stage or screen - this kind of sensitivity translates perfectly into painting portraits where each brushstroke needs careful consideration and attention towards capturing what makes the subject unique.

Are there any particular individuals whose portrait you would love to create one day? Who would that be, and why?

I would love to paint a portrait of my mother because she is an amazing person who has always been such a great source of inspiration throughout my life. She has shown me so much strength, courage and resilience during hard times - qualities that have become even more important since the start of this pandemic when we need each other's support more than ever before. I want to capture her beautiful soul on canvas while also paying tribute to all she has done for me throughout these years!

### Question:

Do you have any specific techniques or methods that help you bring out the best in your subject? What is it about painting portraits that appeals to you so much?

### Response:

The most important technique for bringing out the best in my subjects is actually getting close enough physically and emotionally; understanding their unique personalities, expressions or gestures allows me to create more realistic portraits which viewers can easily connect with. Painting portraits appeals to me because I find it incredibly rewarding when someone looks at one of my paintings and feels like they have seen a part of themselves reflected in its colors and details - it's truly an amazing feeling!

### Question:

Do you have any particular challenges or difficulties that come with painting portraits? How do you overcome them?

### Response:

One of the main challenges when creating portraits is capturing true emotions without making my subject feel uncomfortable during a session. It's important for me to make sure they are comfortable enough before starting any painting so that I can convey their expressions freely and accurately on canvas; this sometimes requires multiple sessions over several days or weeks until we find just the right balance between realism and intimacy!

### Question:

Do you have a specific approach when it comes to capturing different emotions in your portraits? How do you make sure that the viewer can feel those emotions too?

### Response:

When capturing different emotions, I always start by observing my subject closely - studying their body language, facial expressions and general demeanor helps me better understand what kind of feeling they're trying to convey. Then, during a painting session, it's important for me not only focus on recreating these details accurately but also create an emotional connection between myself as an artist and the viewer; this way everyone can feel those same emotions when looking at my paintings!

### Question:

Your portraits often feature a mix of vibrant colors, intricate textures, and bold brushstrokes. Do you have any specific techniques or strategies for achieving this style?

### Response:

The key to achieving my particular style is using various layers of paint with different mediums such as oil pastels which allow me to create interesting textures that add depth and dimensionality within each composition; furthermore, I also love experimenting with different colors - mixing them together creates beautiful harmonies while maintaining realism throughout each piece!

### Question:

Do you have any specific artists or art movements whose work has influenced your style as an artist? What aspects of their style do you admire most?

### Response:

The work of many famous painters such as Caravaggio, Rembrandt and Gauguin has greatly inspired me throughout my career - particularly when it comes to creating portraits full of emotion; however, more recently I've been drawn towards contemporary artists like David Hockney who combine technical mastery with vibrant colors in order create captivating portraits!

### Question:

What do you hope viewers take away from your work? How would you describe the experience of looking at one of your paintings?

### Response:

When people look at my paintings, I want them to feel an immediate connection with each subject - whether it's a friend or family member - so they can better understand their inner beauty through colorful details and textures. Ultimately though what matters most is that viewers find some kind of emotional resonance within these intimate moments captured on canvas!
