1. Health promotion/disease prevention is a strategy for improving health by addressing its determinants. It can be delivered to individuals (e.g., through counselling or provision of information) and/or communities.

2. Surveys are often used as part of a communication strategy to collect data on the population’s awareness and knowledge regarding common topics in order to inform programming efforts. For example, surveys may be conducted to understand community needs related to health education or disease prevention programs. By analysing survey results, governments can identify areas where more education is needed among certain groups and develop targeted interventions accordingly. 

3. Health education is an effective method for increasing knowledge about various aspects of personal health as well as broader social determinants like environmental factors that influence wellbeing over time. Through classroom instruction, workshops or other educational initiatives such as online courses or interactive exhibitions at events like fairs/expositions etc., people learn how their behaviour can impact their own physical condition alongside those around them so they feel empowered to make informed decisions about maintaining good health over long periods without having access solely via traditional methods e.g., advice from doctors alone would only go so far before eventually hitting a wall due lack of sufficient knowledge base upon which one could base these judgements; 

4. Health education programs can be very useful in this respect as they offer individuals opportunities to gain new insights into key issues affecting their wellbeing while simultaneously promoting active participation through engaging activities such as role playing games etc., which enhance understanding further still thereby resulting improved attitudes towards taking proactive steps towards self-care where necessary 

5. To summarize, using surveys combined with health education programs would be ideal solution for improving population awareness on common topics because they provide vital data about target groups needs while simultaneously offering potential remedies via targeted interventions; making sure everyone receives adequate resources necessary ensuring long-term sustainability
