### Example: 
You'll need an account for Firebase.  Create a project and add it here: [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
Add the following code to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
dependencies:
    flutter:
        sdk: flutter
    firebase_core: ^0.4.2+1
    cloud_firestore: ^0.11.7
    http: ^0.13.9
    flutter_webview_plugin:  ^0.4.5+3
```

Add the following code to your pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
      - assets/images
  fonts:
    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf
          weights:
            regular: 400
            bold: 700

```

### Run:
Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory, then run these commands:
```shell
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

This will build the application and launch it in your browser.

I made the following changes to your code:

- `let x = 0;` in `main` function should be `let x = 1;`, or you can use `int main(){ int x=1;...}` instead of `int main(){ ...};`.
- There are no need for semicolon in `if(x>5){ ... } else { printf("The answer is false.\n"); }` and `printf("\n");` statements.
- Remove unnecessary `\n` after `return 0;` statement.
- After changing the if/else block, use a new line to separate the `printf()` call from the other function calls.

And, here's your modified code:
```c
int main() {
	int x = 1;
    int y = 3;
    int z = 0;
    if (x > y) { //x>y
        printf("The answer is true.\n");
    } else {
        printf("The answer is false.\n");
    }
	return 0;
}
```
