I think it is an excellent choice and the reason I say so is because I believe that the story line will be easy to follow and interesting for children. In addition, I believe that the illustrations will complement the text well in bringing the story to life and making it more engaging for younger readers. Finally, I feel that the book's size will make it portable for younger children and easily accessible when needed.
