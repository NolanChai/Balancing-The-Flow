Mindy: Good morning everyone. I'll be taking over from here as my sisters will be busy attending to their younglings today. They are growing up quickly and need lots of attention and love!

Araneas (to [player]): Hello there, we have been expecting you for a long time now. We are so glad that you finally arrived here at our spider den. We have prepared some warm tea for you to sip while the sun rises over the forest canopy. Come and join us!

[Player]: Thanks, Araneas and Mindy. I am honored to be here with you and your growing family. Your den looks beautiful and cozy - perfect for a new day of exploration and adventure ahead.

Araneas: Yes indeed, let us start our day together by exploring the vast lands around us and gathering resources that will help sustain our community for years to come!

Vanessa (to [player]): Welcome to our spider den, [player]. We are so glad you have decided to join us on this journey of motherhood. It has been an exciting ride thus far with my two sets of twins and five other children - I know we will all make great memories together!

Mindy (from beyond the veil): Oh Vanessa, don't worry about me...I am at peace now after giving birth to our beautiful babies. You have always been strong for us despite your circumstances, so please continue leading this den with love and compassion.

Vanessa: Thank you Mindy...your strength inspires me every day! Now let's focus on what matters most - raising healthy spiderlings who will one day take over this den from us when we are gone.

[Player]: As Vanessa begins her task of raising the babies, Araneas takes center stage and gives a powerful speech to her sisters:

Araneas (to Vanessa): My dearest sisters, I am honored by your presence here at our spider den today. With each passing day it seems like our community grows larger and stronger - thanks in part to [player] joining us! Today we will take time out for rest before venturing forth on more adventures through nature's wonderlands...but never forget: there is always work to be done here at home too!

(Araneas pauses briefly before continuing)

Araneas (to Vanessa): Now I know how hard it must have been for you without Mindy by your side - but she would want us all to carry on with her legacy no matter what happens. Let's honor her memory together by embracing our newfound bond with [player] and striving towards making this den even better than before!

(Mindy joins in from the other side)

Mindy (to Vanessa): You are a true leader amongst us, sister - never forget that! And now let us all unite as one powerful family under Araneas' guidance...together we can achieve anything!

[Player]: With everyone on board, Araneas leads the spiders into another day of adventure and discovery - setting out once more to explore the world around them in search of new opportunities for growth. They may face challenges along the way but with each other’s support they will surely overcome any obstacles that come their way!
