It's true that there are three forms of the personal name based on Hermanubis in papyri and inscriptions from Egypt. However, two "proper" polytheophoric names have been identified as well; these include Ἑρμανουβιϲ, which is attested six times (2, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15). In four instances (1, 5, 17, 21) the ending of the name is abbreviated or not preserved.

The form Ἑρμάνουβιϲ, attested six times (2, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15), simply replicates the god's name without further ado, through the phenomenon of "direct theonymy" (the giving to humans of unaltered divine names) that became widespread in the Roman period.[8]

In an odd instance (9) the form Ἑρμανουβιϲ in the nominative is borne by a woman, an Alexandrian nurse (ἡ τροφόϲ).[9] It is highly unusual for female theophoric names to be unmarked for gender in this way.[10] I suspect that because the element -ανουβιϲ in Ἑρμάνουβιϲ was often declined with a dental declension in -ιδ-, it might have been conflated with the similar declension of Greek feminine names in -ίϲ, -ίδοϲ.[11] If this is correct, it may be preferable to read the nurse's name as an oxytone (Ἑρμανουβίϲ).

There are two further forms based on the god Hermanubis: Ἑρμανουβᾶϲ (six instances: 3, 4, 7, 8, 12, 20) and ἑρμανουβιων (four instances: 3, 6, 18, 19). -ᾶϲ and -ίων were, in fact, the commonest Greek suffixes for personal names based on the Egyptian god Anoubis.[12] It is interesting that in a business letter (3) the two forms ἑρμανουβιών (l. 38) and ἥρμανουβῆϲ (l.41) are used interchangeably to designate the same individual. In this case, ἅρμανουβῆϲ is probably a hypocoristic of ἁρμανουβίων, since the suffix -ᾶϲ often served this purpose.[13]
