Last edited layer in Geometry Dash, is "Ending - FIN". You can also see that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5YqhO2_rj4&list=PLd2Z1Vy07R6tRfNj3MmJQAeXwLz9k1pFx

### Explanation:
There is no last used editor layer in the level, Ending - FIN is the last completed and rendered layer. The video you posted shows that there are some unfinished layers before it. However, these unfinished layers were never rendered to the game itself because they weren't completed. Once the editor layer "Ending - FIN" was completed, it was then rendered to create a playable level in Geometry Dash.

### Discussion:
In Geometry Dash levels, the editor is where you build and design your own levels. After you have created a level in the editor, there is an option to render it into a gameplay form. This renders all of the completed layers into one final layer which can be played by other players. The last edited layer is simply the last completed layer that was rendered into the game.

There are many ways to learn about AI, and the best way for you will depend on your skill level in programming and mathematics. A good place to start is by looking at some basic concepts and algorithms related to machine learning. You can find resources like books, tutorials, and articles online that explain these topics. From there, you can choose a specific area of interest such as deep learning or natural language processing. There are also many courses available on sites like Coursera, Udacity, and edX that cover different aspects of AI. Additionally, attending workshops and conferences in your local area could be helpful if they focus on the type of AI you want to learn about.
