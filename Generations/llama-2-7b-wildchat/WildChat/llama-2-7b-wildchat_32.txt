The mission takes place in Las Venturas. You are CJ and your goal is to kill some respected men and prove yourself to the underground community. The story begins at 7:00 PM when you get a call from Avery, who informs you that the four respected men (Big Smoke, Ryder, Sweet Johnson, and Ken Rosenburg) have been spotted in Los Santos and he wants you to kill them for him. You accept his request and head to San Fierro to pick up your weapons from Cesar Vialpando.

You drive to a parking lot near the LS Airport and meet with Avery who briefs you on each target's specific characteristics (i.e., weaknesses, strengths, etc.). He also warns you not to get caught by the police or else you will be disrespected and lose credibility in the underground community.

You proceed to Los Santos where you encounter Big Smoke first. After a brief chase, you manage to kill him with your trusty machine gun. Next up is Ryder who is known for his speed and agility. You decide to use the rocket launcher on him which successfully takes him down. Sweet Johnson is your third target; however, he's surrounded by bodyguards so you need to be careful in order not to get noticed. You choose to sneak up behind them and take out both him and his bodyguards with your sniper rifle.

The final target - Ken Rosenburg - has been hiding inside a safehouse for weeks but fortunately for you he comes outside at this time of night without any guards present so you can easily assassinate him using your shotgun. After successfully killing all four targets, Avery calls to congratulate you on completing the mission and emphasizes how important it was that these men were killed discreetly without drawing too much attention from police or authorities because respect in Los Santos is everything!

### Explanation: This mission has an overarching goal of proving CJ's worth within the underground community by showing that he can complete difficult tasks without getting caught. As such, it requires skillful driving and shooting abilities to successfully eliminate each target while also ensuring that no attention from police is drawn to you. The storyline further highlights how important maintaining one's credibility in Los Santos is due to its culture which values respect above all else.

### Conclusion: By completing this mission, CJ gains respect among his fellow gang members and establishes himself as a reliable asset for future jobs within the underground world of San Andreas. In addition, it teaches us how even in dangerous situations like these we must remain calm while carefully planning our actions in order to achieve our goals without being discovered by authorities or rival gangs.
