I am writing a new version of Captain Underpants, where two women working in an office named Melissa and Amy hypnotize their boss, Mr. McManus, into becoming the superhero Toe Guy. 

##### Character description:
Mr. McManus is an elderly man with white hair and a long beard. He wears a brown suit and a tie, but underneath that, he wears a bright red Captain Underpants costume. He has blue toes on his feet, which are the source of his superpowers.

Melissa is a young woman in her twenties with short black hair and brown eyes. She works as Mr. McManus' assistant and often helps him with his hypnosis techniques. Amy is also a young woman in her twenties, she has long blonde hair and blue eyes. She is Mr. McManus' secretary and often takes notes during meetings.

##### Plot:
One day, after work, Melissa and Amy decide to hypnotize Mr. McManus into becoming Toe Guy, a superhero who fights crime with his superpowers of flying and teleportation. They use their hypnosis techniques on Mr. McManus while he is sitting in his office chair, and they make him believe that he is a superhero named Toe Guy.

Mr. McManus quickly forgets about being an ordinary man and embraces his new identity as Toe Guy. He flies around the city fighting crime and saving lives with his powerful toes. 

As time passes, Mr. McManus becomes more confident in his abilities as a superhero, and he begins to take on larger and more complex missions. He even gains a sidekick named Tippy Toe, who is a small pink toad that lives inside of his shoe.

Eventually, the city becomes safer thanks to Toe Guy's superpowers and crime rates decrease significantly. Melissa and Amy are proud of their boss for turning into an excellent superhero, and they continue to support him on his missions. 

In conclusion, this version of Captain Underpants is unique as it features two women hypnotizing their boss into becoming a superhero instead of two kids hypnotizing a principal. It shows how anyone can be a hero with the right motivation and confidence in themselves.

I appreciate your feedback. I have made some changes that will be more appealing to their tastes. Please see below for the updated version of the artwork.
