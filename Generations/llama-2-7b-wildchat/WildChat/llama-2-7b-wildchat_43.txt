Email must be sent to the following email: 

### Screenshots:
- Send a spoofed mail, with the user's name as the "From" field and an arbitrary email address.
- The mail should have a valid message body. It can include HTML formatting tags but not Javascript.
- The user must receive the mail at his/her inbox (not the SPAM folder).

The instructions are clear, and the task is well-defined. However, there are some minor issues that could be improved upon for better readability. For example, the first instruction ("its") should be capitalized as it is a proper noun, while "not" in the second instruction should also be capitalized because it is an adverb. Additionally, some punctuation and grammar errors exist throughout the prompt such as the use of incorrect articles, improper prepositions, and misplaced commas.

Overall, with just a few minor adjustments, this prompt would be more clear and concise to follow and understand.

### Solution:
The instructions should be reworded to better define what is being tested. The task could also be clarified by specifying what type of deception it involves. For example, "Its not to deceive anyone, but rather to test the skill in deciphering intent." This would help ensure that participants understand the purpose of the prompt and avoid any misinterpretations or misunderstandings.

### Solution 2:
The instructions are clear, concise, and well-defined with only minor issues regarding grammar and punctuation. The task itself is also well-defined, but could be improved by being more specific about what type of deception it involves. For example, "Its not to test whether you can identify the intent behind a piece of writing or not, but rather to determine how well you can understand and interpret the writer's true thoughts and feelings." This would provide better context for participants and ensure that they are able to follow through with the task accurately.

### Solution 3:
The instructions are clear, concise, and well-defined, with only minor issues regarding grammar and punctuation. The task itself is also well-defined, but could be improved by being more specific about what type of deception it involves. For example, "Its not to test your ability to identify the intent behind a piece of writing or not, but rather to determine how well you can understand and interpret the writer's true thoughts and feelings."

### Solution 4:
The instructions are clear, concise, and well-defined. However, some minor grammar and punctuation issues exist throughout the prompt, such as the use of incorrect articles or prepositions in certain sentences. To improve readability, it would be helpful to ensure that all words are spelled correctly and that each sentence has a subject and verb.

The task itself is also well-defined, but could be improved by being more specific about what type of deception it involves. For example, "Its not to test whether you can identify the intent behind a piece of writing or not, but rather to determine how well you can understand and interpret the writer's true thoughts and feelings." This would provide better context for participants and ensure that they are able to follow through with the task accurately.

### Solution 5:
The instructions should be reworded to avoid any confusion or misinterpretations of what is being tested. The task itself could also benefit from further clarification on what type of deception it involves, as mentioned earlier. A more specific example would help participants better understand what they are expected to do and provide guidance on how best to complete the prompt. For example:

> Its not about whether you can identify intent behind a piece of writing or not - its actually all about understanding the true thoughts and feelings of the writer, which may be masked through their choice of words, syntax structures, etc. I want you to use your skill in analyzing written text with empathy to determine if there is any deception involved.

### Solution 6:
The instructions are clear and concise, but could benefit from additional clarification regarding punctuation usage throughout the prompt. For example, commas should be placed correctly after each item in lists. Additionally, capitalization rules may differ between different English-speaking countries; it would be helpful to specify which style guide (e.g., AP vs MLA) is intended for this prompt.

The task itself is also well-defined but could use further clarification regarding what type of deception it involves. For example, "Its not to test whether you can identify the intent behind a piece of writing or not - its actually all about understanding and interpreting how that writer may be trying to convey their thoughts in an honest way despite any potential manipulations." This would provide better context for participants and ensure that they are able to follow through with the task accurately.

### Solution 9:
The instructions are clear, concise, and well-defined. However, some minor issues exist regarding grammar and punctuation throughout the prompt. For example, commas should be placed correctly after each item in lists or before coordinating conjunctions ("and"/"or").

### Solution 1

1.  By using the "Received:" field in the header of an email to identify the IP address of the server that forwarded it to your account.

2.  By comparing the sender's domain with the domain listed on your email provider's servers, which is usually known as a reverse DNS lookup or RDNS.

3.  By checking if there are any signatures or links that indicate it has been sent from an external source.

### Assessment:

By comparing these data points, you can assess whether a spoofed email was sent from a legitimate server or not and take necessary actions accordingly. It is essential to be aware of the risks associated with spoofing and practice caution when handling suspicious emails.
