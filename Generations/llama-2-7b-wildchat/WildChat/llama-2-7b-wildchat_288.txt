```javascript
const jumpForward = () => {
    let currentTime = new Date().getHours();
    let nextTime = (currentTime + 10) % 24; // Round down, since hours can't exceed 23
    
    return new Date(nextTime, currentTime.getMonth(), currentTime.getDate()).toISOString()
}
```

This is the instruction of Jon Snow's death, which will occur in season six. He was betrayed by his brother, and he will die at the hand of a Stark.
