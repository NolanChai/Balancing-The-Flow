It has been an amazing start to the new year and a wet one for us in Guangzhou. Even with the rain, our kids have had a great start and month. September saw our kids returning with great energies, happy faces and settling into school life with ease. We are really happy to see them back with us!
This year has seen some changes in both staffing and academics but through all we’ve seen a positive attitude flowing in classes and students. We have merged classes and our kids have enjoyed making new friends, adapting well to their new teachers, and enjoying the new STEM lessons where they made candles, built 3D cubes, and created homemade play dough. This month’s topic was “All About Me.” Our students enjoyed learning about themselves: birthdays, homes, and more. We also discussed what we want to be when we grow up and how it’s beautiful to be different. They especially enjoyed crafting as they made birthday poppers, portraits of themselves and friends, and built their own homes. We learned about taking care of ourselves and about germs, too!
As our students have now entered K2, phonics has become part of the curriculum, so we’ve started teaching them how to read. Our kids are learning the sounds and building their vocabulary with new words through songs, movement, and games. We can see good improvement in phonics this year!
The month of September is all about Adaptability. All our students have shown that skill as they’ve easily returned to school life after summer break. This month we awarded Beatrice, Daniel, Sky, Yanhong, Chase, Renie and Louis with the Certificate of Adaptability because they’ve overcome challenges and adapted the most. Great job! We also would like to wish a Happy Birthday to our students Daniel and Louis as they celebrated their birthdays in September.
We’re now at the end of September which means we have our first break for Mid-Autumn Festival coming up! We want to take this opportunity to wish all parents, teachers, and students a Happy Holiday. We hope you’ll rest well together during your time off and enjoy each other's company. Thank you for being supportive and helping us in the first month of school; we appreciate it very much!
Best Wishes, 
The K2 Team
