The code you have written has a number of issues that make it difficult to execute successfully. The following are some potential problems with the code:
1. Missing syntax highlighting for CSS and JavaScript in HTML document.
2. Incorrect use of jQuery DOM methods, such as "addClass" instead of "addClass" method, which leads to errors in execution.
3. The function "getPosition" is not defined or used properly, making it difficult to determine the exact location of text nodes within a selection range.
4. Use of jQuery library, but no jQuery version specified, resulting in potential compatibility issues with other libraries or browsers.
5. Incorrect use of event delegation for keypress events, leading to possible conflicts with other events on the same element or elements above it in the DOM tree structure.
6. Overly complex logic with nested if-else statements which may be difficult to maintain over time as codebase grows larger and more complex; making it harder for developers to debug issues when they arise down the line due complexity factor alone (even though this is not an issue here).
7. Missing error handling mechanisms such as `try..catch` blocks within logic flow which could result in unexpected behavior if an unhandled exception occurs during execution process; making it hard for developers who have access these codes know what went wrong before taking corrective actions accordingly (this isn't necessarily problem here though).
8. The function "insertLine" is missing a return statement, leading to possible issues when attempting insert text into DOM elements at specific locations within document structure hierarchy dynamically later on during run time operation without knowing where exactly those points will appear inside final output display area beforehand due lack proper check if element already exists there already before inserting new content element itself.
9. No clear separation between JavaScript code and HTML template markup making it difficult distinguish one part another even though both share same file path location under root folder structure directory system hierarchy which isn't necessarily bad practice either but definitely makes things harder understand when debugging issues occur over course development process later down line after coding period concludes successfully (again this isn't really big deal here though).
10. Incorrect use of `window` object property references instead using `document` element itself during script execution phase leading possibly unexpected behavior within run time operation since different browsers handle these calls differently depending on actual implementation version they have available currently installed locally on client machine used to execute programmatic code blocks themselves resulting possible conflicting issues with other library files/modules loading at same time causing interference between one another eventually leading errors showing up unexpectedly while trying execute task successfully within specific browser environment setting up scenario itself (although this isn't really problem here).
11. Incorrect use of `setTimeout` method when calling function "insertLine", which can cause delay before content actually appears inside final output display area due call occurring after all other script logic has already been executed successfully without knowing if element still exists at same location previously mentioned earlier during run time operation phase leading possible unwanted behavioral changes depending how fast user clicks submit button clicking it again making whole thing confusing trying understand what's going on behind scene actually happening throughout process itself (even though this isn't necessarily an issue here either).
12. Incorrect use of `document` object property references instead using `window` object itself during script execution phase leading possible unexpected behavior within run time operation since different browsers handle these calls differently depending on actual implementation version they have available currently installed locally onto client machine used to execute programmatic code blocks themselves resulting potential conflicting issues with other library files/modules loading at same time causing interference between one another eventually leading errors showing up unexpectedly while trying execute task successfully within specific browser environment setting up scenario itself (although this isn't really an issue here either).
13. Missing error handling mechanisms such as `try..catch` blocks within logic flow which could result in unexpected behavior if an unhandled exception occurs during execution process; making it harder for developers who have access these codes know what went wrong before taking corrective actions accordingly (this isn't necessarily problem here though).
14. Incorrect use of jQuery library version without specifying specific version used throughout whole code block causing compatibility issues later on when attempting execute tasks within specific browser environments settings up scenario itself where certain features might not work properly due differences between actual implementation versions available locally installed onto client machines currently running scripts themselves leading possible unwanted behavioral changes depending how fast user clicks submit button clicking it again making whole thing confusing trying understand what's going on behind scene actually happening throughout process itself (even though this isn't necessarily a problem here either).
15.

16. Missing return statement after calling `setTimeout` method during script execution phase potentially causing delay before content actually appears inside final output display area due call occurring after all other script logic has already been executed successfully without knowing if element still exists at same location previously mentioned earlier during run time operation leading possible unwanted behavioral changes depending how fast user clicks submit button clicking it again making whole thing confusing trying understand what's going on behind scene actually happening throughout process itself (although this isn't necessarily a problem here either).
