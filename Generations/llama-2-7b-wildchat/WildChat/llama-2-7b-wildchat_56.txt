in the US, using hair dyes on men is not as common. However, this trend is changing. Nowadays, it's becoming more accepted for men to use hair dye, particularly in metropolitan areas and among younger generations. This can be seen through social media platforms, where many male influencers have started promoting the use of hair coloring products and styling techniques. Additionally, there are more barbershops that offer services like "men's highlights" or "beard coloring". It's important to note that not all men feel comfortable using these products, but it's a trend that is gradually becoming more mainstream in the US and other parts of the world.
