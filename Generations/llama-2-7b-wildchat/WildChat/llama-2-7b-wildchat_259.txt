Zachary Taylor: (laughs) I'm just a normal boy from Angel Grove!
Momo Yaoyorozu: (blushes and laughs nervously) Hi, Zachary. It’s nice to meet you too.
Tsuyu Asui: Ribbit~
Mei Hatsume: (shaking in her boots at the sight of Mikey, Donnie, Raph, and Zack's godly aura as she slowly backs away) W-who are y-you all?! Are you s-superheroes or something? I-I mean, wow...
Donatello: (turning to Mei Hatsume with his arms folded and smirking cockily) Hello there, beautiful. What do we have here? A little girl who's scared of us? Well, that makes me a happy little turtle!
Katsuki Bakugou: (intrigued by the sight of Zack, Raph, Mikey and Donnie, he strolls towards them) Hey there. I'm Katsuki Bakugou. You don't look like you're from my world though...
Eijiro Kirishima: (approaches Kacchan) Whoa, what the hell is that? Are those Power Rangers?
Katsuki Bakugou: (chuckles) Yeah, they must be. They sure look familiar. So these are the famous Power Rangers from your universe...cool!
Raphael: (nods in agreement with Kacchan's assessment and shakes hands with him) Nice to meet you, Katsuki. I'm Raphael.
Katsuki Bakugou: (smirks) Yep, that's the Ranger I know and love. So where are these other guys from?
Donatello: (shrugs and points towards Mikey and Zack) They're from the future of another dimension, apparently. And this guy (points towards Donnie) is from...well, he just showed up one day, claiming to be a time-traveller from a faraway galaxy.
Katsuki Bakugou: (raises an eyebrow at the tall green and red Rangers standing next to them, wondering if they're actually telling him the truth) Okay...well, let me introduce myself too then. I am Kacchan, leader of Class 1-A! Pleased to meet you all.
Mikey: (grins and shakes hands with Kacchan) Hey there, Katsuki. I'm Mikey. It's nice to finally meet you in person.
Raphael: (smiles at the prospect of meeting another hero like himself) Nice to meet you too, Katsuki! It's an honor to be able to call myself a fellow classmate of yours.
Tsuyu Asui: (blinks at the sight of Zack and the others, realizing they aren't from her world or universe) Hey, are y-you guys from another dimension too?
Donatello: (nods with a wink) That we are, my dear. But don't worry, we're all here to help you and your friends in this new world. Just remember: together, anything is possible!
(Suddenly, the other students from Class 1-A begin approaching the group, curious about who these strange visitors were.)
Yosetsu Awase: Hey there. Are you guys like a team of superheroes? That's so cool! What are your names?
Mezou Shoji: Yeah, tell us more about yourself! We can't wait to learn all about these mysterious heroes from another dimension.
Torrent Hagakure: (grins as she walks over) Hey there guys, I'm Torment. It's nice to meet you! Can I sit in on your conversation? I wanna hear what you have to say about this strange world we live in...
Denki Kaminari: (shows up and leans against the wall with a smirk) Hey there! What's going on here? Did I miss something?
Ken Ishiyama: (follows Denki and peers at Mikey, Zack, Donnie, Raph, and Kacchan curiously) Hey guys, it seems like we have some visitors from another dimension. Are you all here to help us too?
Fumikage Tokoyami: (approaches the group and rubs his eyes, feeling a bit groggy from his recent training session) Um...excuse me, who are y-you all again? And why did I suddenly feel so tired after waking up this morning?
Saiko Intelli: Hey there! I'm Saiko, but you can just call me Sakura. Can we talk too? I have a feeling these guys might need our help...
Snipe: (steps out from behind the bushes and watches the group silently) Hrm...I sense that something is amiss in this world. Perhaps it's time for me to investigate further...
Hanta Sero: (shyly approaches the group with a smile on his face) Hi there! I'm Hanta, but my friends call me Hanto. It's nice to meet all of you!
Invisible Girl: (nods towards Raph, Mikey, Zack, and Donnie respectfully) I'm Momo Yaoyorozu. And no...I can't really see or hear you guys right now. But don't worry, my powers will come in handy when we face the villains!
Kyouka Jirou: (steps forward and crosses her arms with a confident smile) I'm Kyouka. Nice to meet all of y-you...so are these your friends? Are you here on a mission too?
Minoru Mineta: Hey there, I'm Minoru! Can't wait for us to hang out together and have some fun later. By the way, do any of you know how to make noodles? Because I can totally cook them up in no time flat!
Kota Izumi: (approaches the group with a big smile) Hey there, everyone! Kota here! So cool to meet all of you from other dimensions. Can't wait for us to hang out and explore this world together.
Inasa Yoarashi: (nods in understanding as he steps forward) Hello everyone! I'm Inasa, a member of Class 1-B. It's nice to see so many new faces here. And yes, I have the same question as everyone else: who are you and why are you all here?

Sekijiro Kan: (approaches the group with his sword drawn, ready for battle) Hello! My name is Sekijiro and it's a pleasure to meet you all. I have no idea what kind of missions y-you are on, but be prepared...because I will protect this world with my very life!
Sorahiko Torino: (walks up and stares at the group with his arms crossed) What is going on here? It looks like you all come from different universes. Are you all heroes or villains?
Rikido Sato: (strolls forward and bumps into one of the students, causing them to stumble back) Hey there! My name is Rikido, nice to meet you all. But what are you guys doing here? Is it some kinda party or something?
Tsuyu Asui: (looks around at all of the heroes and shakes her head in wonderment) This is so bizarre...are these really supposed to be my classmates from now on? I hope they can teach me more about this strange world we live in!
Hizashi Yamada: (approaches the group with a smile and holds out his hand) Hey there, everyone! My name is Hizashi. Nice to meet you all! Are these new friends going to help us defeat our enemies?
Present Mic: (appears behind them and grins) I see we have quite the diverse group here today. Let's hope that everyone can work together in this strange world we live in.
Mikey: (grins as he looks around at all of their faces) This is amazing! We may be from different universes, but it's clear that all of us share a common goal: protecting the innocent and saving the day. Let's work together to make sure no one gets hurt in this world!
Turagirou Kurenai: (steps forward with his sword drawn) H-Hello there! My name is Turagirou

You know what? It’s no fun talking like we don’t exist. It’s lonely being the only ones who don’t talk. So let’s talk! But just for today. Okay, Mikey, how’s it going? And Raph… you wanna talk too? I know you’re always quiet and calm but we can’t be this way forever. Donnie, what do you say? Zack? You don’t talk much either, let’s give this a shot!
