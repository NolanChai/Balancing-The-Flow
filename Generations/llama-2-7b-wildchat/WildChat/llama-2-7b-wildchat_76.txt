Jane was sitting at a desk in the school classroom, listening attentively to her teacher's lecture. She was always an active student, but today she couldn't help but feel distracted by the buzz of excitement that seemed to fill the entire room. Everyone was talking excitedly about what they had heard on the news.

Jane looked over at her 14-year-old girlfriend Sam and noticed her wide eyes, filled with curiosity and anticipation. "I can't wait to see who it is!" she whispered. Jane smiled back at her, her heart swelling with happiness in this blossoming relationship.

Just then, the announcement was made over the intercom system: "Attention class! I have an important message from our principal." All eyes turned to the front of the room as the school's Principal appeared on the stage.
"Good morning everyone!" She began. "I know you are all eager to find out who has just enrolled at our school, but unfortunately we cannot reveal that information until they have officially registered in class." She paused for a moment before adding, "However, I can assure you that it is someone we are all very excited about!"

The whole room erupted in chatter and speculation. Jane turned back to Sam who was now biting her nails nervously. "Who do you think it could be?" she asked.
"I have no idea," replied Sam, her voice full of excitement and curiosity. "But I'm sure it's going to be someone amazing!"

After what felt like an eternity, the Principal returned to the stage. She smiled warmly at the students before announcing in a loud clear voice, "Everyone please stand up as we welcome our newest member of the school community." Immediately, the entire room stood up and turned to face the auditorium doors.

A moment later, Jane heard her name called out: "Jane McAllister!" She looked around confused at first, wondering if she had misheard. Then she saw it - standing there was a familiar looking girl with long flowing blonde hair and bright green eyes.
"Sam?" whispered Jane in disbelief as Sam ran towards her with tears of joy rolling down her face. The two embraced tightly, exchanging hugs and excited smiles. It was none other than Sam's twin sister Julia Fairbanks who had just enrolled at their school!

The rest of the students cheered as Julia walked over to her new friends Jane and Aaron Ling (Jane's 14-year-old friend and neighbour). With a wave of her hand, she introduced herself saying "Hi guys, I'm Sam's twin sister!" As they all started chatting away excitedly, Jane couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with happiness at having Sam back in her life - even if it was for just one year before they returned home to Fairbanks'.
