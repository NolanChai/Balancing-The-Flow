"Miss Luna is not a dance instructor! She's the mother of Lunalings."

(Miss Luna has been in labor for the past 15 minutes - and will continue giving birth to new Lunalings for as long as she continues to be in labor)

(Miss Luna's voice is quite intimidating, so a soft and gentle tone would be ideal.)

(It's best if the player stays calm at all times while Miss Luna gives birth to her offspring - or else it will distract Miss Luna from focusing on delivering her children.)

[player]: "Whoa! It's like you're giving birth to a whole bunch of babies! Are these Lunalings? How many more are there left?"

### Response:
"There were supposed to be 19 Lunalings in this batch - but one died during the birthing process."

(Miss Luna has already delivered two Lunalings, and the next one will arrive shortly.)

(The player can choose whether or not to interact with Miss Luna's offspring. They may be playful and curious, but they can also be very dangerous if provoked.)

[player]: "Wow! So many new additions to your family! I bet you're glad that Yuri was willing to donate her eggs."

### Response:
"Yuri was the perfect candidate for me - she has a pure soul and was easy to manipulate. She was also very strong-willed, so it made my job easier."

(The player can choose whether or not to interact with Miss Luna's offspring.)

### Response:
"It's all part of the plan - I knew that she would be able to handle the stress and responsibility of raising so many children. She's a strong and independent woman, which is exactly what I needed."

(Miss Luna's labor has finally ended - now that there are 17 new Lunalings in this batch.)

[player]: "I'm so happy to see that all of your babies have been born safely. Now they can grow up and become big and powerful just like their mother."

### Response:
"Yes, it was a long and painful labor - but I am grateful for my offspring. They will carry on my legacy in their own way - becoming teachers, artists, and so much more."

(Miss Luna's room is now filled with the joyous cries of newborn Lunalings.)

(The player can choose whether or not to interact with Miss Luna's offspring. They may be playful and curious, but they can also be very dangerous if provoked.)

[player]: "Wow! Look at all those babies running around - I bet this is just a taste of the chaos that will come from having so many children."

### Response:
"Yes, it's going to be quite a handful. But I can handle anything with my Lunalings by my side."

(The player can choose whether or not to interact with Miss Luna's offspring.)

[player]: "I wonder what kind of names these little ones will have... I've never met anyone as strong and powerful as you, Miss Luna. Are any of your children going to be like you?"

### Response:
"Some of them might inherit my strength - but they will also have their own unique personalities. No two Lunalings are alike."

(The player can choose whether or not to interact with Miss Luna's offspring.)

[player]: "It's fascinating to see how a single donor like Yuri was able to create so many different kinds of children. I bet she has a lot of stories to tell."

### Response:
"She does! And we will share those stories together as we all grow together - the Lunalings and me."

(The player can choose whether or not to interact with Miss Luna's offspring.)

[player]: "I'm sure Yuri is very proud of what she accomplished. She must be so happy that her donation resulted in these new additions."

### Response:
"Yes, she was hesitant at first - but once I explained the benefits of having many children, she was more than willing to help me out. Now, she's become a loving mother figure for all of us."

(The player can choose whether or not to interact with Miss Luna's offspring.)

[player]: "Well, I guess we should get back to the library - after all, there are still plenty of books waiting to be read. But before we go... would you mind if I took some pictures of your little ones?"

### Response:
"Of course! It's always nice to have memories captured in photos."

(The player can choose whether or not to interact with Miss Luna's offspring.)

[player]: "Alright, let me grab my camera and I'll be right back!"
