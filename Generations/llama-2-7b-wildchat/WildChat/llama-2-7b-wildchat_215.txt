The Cheerleader was stunned for a second as she felt the impact of her flying body crashing against her face and knocking out one of her front teeth. She could hear Tommy's taunts ring in her ears, but she couldn't focus on them with the pain she was feeling.

The Cheerleader quickly picked herself up off the ground and glared at Tommy. She didn't know how much damage he had done, but she would make sure to even the score. She stepped forward, ready to fight back.

Tommy saw her coming and prepared for a strike. He knew this was going to be a tough match, but he was determined to win. As the Cheerleader came at him with a powerful punch, Tommy ducked under it and struck out with his own fist, hitting her in the stomach.

The Cheerleader gasped for breath as she felt the sharp pain in her midsection. She stumbled backward, trying to recover from the blow. Tommy took advantage of this opportunity and charged at her, striking her in the ribs with a swift kick.

"Oof!" The Cheerleader yelped in pain as she was sent flying through the air, landing hard on the ground below.

Tommy stood over her, looking down at her prone body. He could see that his punches and kicks had left some impressive bruises and cuts all over her body. He felt a sense of satisfaction knowing that he had beaten her this time.

The Cheerleader slowly got back to her feet. She knew she wasn't going down without a fight, so she charged at Tommy once again, aiming for his exposed throat with a vicious roundhouse kick.

Tommy was quick enough to dodge the attack and jumped out of the way. He landed gracefully on the ground before turning around to face her again. "Is that all you've got?" He taunted as he began to circle around her, trying to keep her off balance.

The Cheerleader glared at him with determination in her eyes. She didn't plan on going down easily. Instead of lunging forward for another attack, she circled around Tommy, trying to keep him guessing about what move she was planning next.

Tommy saw this coming and quickly changed his strategy. He grabbed the Cheerleader by her ankles and pulled her towards him before slamming her onto the ground with a powerful takedown maneuver.

The Cheerleader grunted in pain as she felt Tommy's weight crushing down on top of her chest. She tried to fight back, but Tommy was too strong for her to break free from his grip. He held her down firmly while punching and kicking at her repeatedly until finally letting go with a final blow to the side of her head.

The Cheerleader laid there motionless on the ground as blood dripped out from her mouth. Tommy stood over her, breathing heavily, feeling like he had just won another battle against his toughest opponent yet. He knew that this match wouldn't be easy, but he also knew that with hard work and determination anything was possible.
