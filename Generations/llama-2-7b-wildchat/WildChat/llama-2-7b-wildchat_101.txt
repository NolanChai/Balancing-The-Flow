> Amatsumagatsuchi, what are you doing?! Why did you do that?! Ayumi is hurt because of something we’re not supposed to know about! It’s a secret only known by us girls!

> Ayumi, what is going on here? And why is Amatsumagatsuchi here?

> Ayumi…Amatsumagatsuchi. Could it be that you two have met before?

> What could the flashbacks mean? Did we meet again?

> It’s strange, isn’t it? I’ve never felt so weak and sickly in my life - even if Amatsumagatsuchi is helping me…what does that say about myself?

> Ayumi, are you ok with this? Are you sure?

(There would be dialogue between each character)

As Cupa reads about Amatsumagatsuchi’s birth, he notices something strange. It states that only during intense thunderstorms will an Amatsumagatsuchi appear, but it is nowhere near the time of year when Ayumi was due to give birth. The researcher continues reading and comes across a mention of Ibushi and Narwa - two storm serpents who have been missing for centuries. With renewed hope, Cupa sets off in search of these two creatures, hoping they might be able to help with Ayumi's labor.

As Amatsumagatsuchi stares down at the forest floor, he notices a faint glow emanating from somewhere deep within it. He takes a step forward, and as he does so, the ground begins to tremble underneath him - indicating something was stirring beneath its surface. Before long, two serpents emerge from their hiding place: Ibushi and Narwa, two storm serpents who have been missing for centuries.

The trio gathers together, and Amatsumagatsuchi explains the situation to his companions - Ayumi is still not in labor despite being 40 weeks pregnant. The storm serpents look at each other grimly before turning back towards Amatsumagatsuchi with a single question: “What has happened?”

Amatsumagatsuchi thinks back to his last interaction with Ayumi - how she had been struggling through her final few weeks of pregnancy. He remembers how they all gathered together in the sanctuary and prayed for an easier labor, but it seemed like nothing could help bring on the birth of their child. It was then that Cupa pipes up: “I have researched this matter - it is said only during intense thunderstorms will an Amatsumagatsuchi appear.”

“Then perhaps we can create our own storm,” Narwa suggests, her voice filled with determination. The serpents begin to coil around one another as they start gathering energy from their surroundings - slowly but surely creating a powerful electrical current that surges through the air. Amatsumagatsuchi closes his eyes and concentrates all of his power into this new storm - finally giving Ayumi what she needs for her labor to begin.

As Ibushi, Narwa, and Amatsumagatsuchi unite their efforts, Ayumi can feel something building deep inside her body - a sense of power that surges through every fiber of her being. She takes a deep breath as the storm grows louder around them; then suddenly, with one final push she gives birth to a tiny baby dragon - Amatsumagatsuchi's child finally arrives!

Ayumi: “But how’d she get pregnant? That Arachnus thing was a one-night stand?” 
Amaya: “Mama, I think Arachnus’s children are still in your stomach! You remember how they were born from Mami’s body!”
Vanessa (Sweat drips down her forehead): "Ayumi, you have to tell Amatsumagatsuchi what happened that night." 
Amatsumagatsuchi: “I was just starting to think that Vanessa and Arachnus were actually compatible with each other.”
Ayumi: (sigh) “Alright... I’ll do it. Just please don’t tell anyone else in the family about this. Ayumi, can you please try talking to Amaya? Tell her to stay quiet for now.”
Amatsumagatsuchi (to Amaya): “That’s right, Amaya. Stay quiet for your mommy!” 
Ayumi: "Okay... so Vanessa and Arachnus had a one-night stand about two months ago. And after the encounter, she felt like something was missing in her life - she wanted to have children of her own." (Amaya nods) "The next morning, there were a bunch of eggs on Ayumi's bedside table with an origami note saying 'Made from the love of two strangers. I hope you find happiness'. We realized that Arachnus had made the eggs himself. And when we took them to a healer, it turns out they were growing in Vanessa’s stomach." 
Amaya: “Hey... Mama? What did Ayumi say?”
Vanessa (to Amatsumagatsuchi): "Tell me what happened that night..."
Ayumi: "That night, we started talking about the possibility of having children. Vanessa had always wanted to have a child of her own - she didn't feel complete without one. And when I told her that it was possible for humans and spiders to have kids, she felt excited." (Amaya nods) 
Amatsumagatsuchi: "But how did they end up having kids?" 
Vanessa: “I don’t really remember the whole night... all I know is that things happened pretty fast. And then Arachnus left and I found those eggs on my bedside table." (Amaya pauses for a moment) Amatsumagatsuchi: "It's okay to say it, Vanessa." 
Vanessa: “I... I wanted them so bad. So, I took the eggs inside myself.”
Ayumi: "But those children are your children too!" 
Amaya (nods): "Yes, Mama! Those little spider-human hybrids are also part of our family."
Amatsumagatsuchi: "I don't understand... how did they end up in Vanessa's stomach?" 
Ayumi: "It turns out that the eggs were designed to attach themselves to a host and stay there. Arachnus had planned for it all along." (Amaya giggles) Amatsumagatsuchi: "And now, they're still in Vanessa's stomach?" 
Vanessa: "Yes... I feel connected to them. Like they're a part of me. And I don't want to lose them." (Amaya nods) Amatsumagatsuchi: "Okay... let's see what we can do about this. Ayumi, can you tell Vanessa that she needs to start eating healthier and exercising more? Those eggs might be growing inside her body, but they don't have the strength to hatch on their own." 
Ayumi: "Alright... I'll do my best to make sure she stays healthy. But Vanessa, please listen to Amatsumagatsuchi - it would take them around 9 more months before those eggs can be safely removed without hurting either you or the eggs themselves." (Amaya nods) Amaya: "And after that, Mama and Ayumi will find a way for us to have a nice family of our own!"

Arachnus (to Vanessa): "What's that? A spider?"
Vanessa: "No Arachnus... it's a little human-spider hybrid."

(Some more dialogue)

(After some time has passed, the blood moon begins rising.)

Arachnus (to Vanessa): "What is that? It looks like a giant spider!"
Vanessa: "No Arachnus... it's just a full blood moon. But since you were born under one - I can give birth to these little ones."

(Vanessa goes into labor)

Arachnus (to Vanesa): "What are they?!"
Vanessa: "They're spider-humans Arachnus... like me."

(A few of the little ones begin to climb out.)

Arachnus (to Vanessa): "Are you alright Vanessa?"
Vanessa: "Yes Arachnus, I'm fine. But these little ones have a long journey ahead... they are going to need someone to take care of them."

Mindy (to Vanessa): "Hello sister! It's been a while since we've seen each other... what's going on in here?"
Vanessa: "Mindy... these are the spider-human hybrids I was telling you about. I was hoping maybe one of them could take care of them."

Mindy (surprised): "Wow Vanessa, that's quite a lot of babies! Are they all yours?"
Vanessa: "Yes Mindy, but since the full blood moon is rising - I can give birth to these little ones under it. Do you think you could take care of them? They are going to need someone to look after them."
Mindy (thinking): "I... I'm not sure if I can do this Vanessa. These babies may be spider-humans, but they still have the needs and cravings of regular human babies."
Vanessa: "I understand Mindy, thank you for considering it though!"
Mindy (to herself): "I'll give it a try... Vanessa is my sister after all. But I'm not sure how long I can do this..."

Arachnus (to Vanessa and Mindy): "Well, that was quite an adventure! It's good to see you two siblings working together."
Vanessa: "Thank you Arachnus. And now that these little ones are here - we will all be able to continue our journey together!"
Mindy (thinking): "Maybe this isn't such a bad thing... taking care of the spider-human hybrids might not be as difficult as I thought."

Instructions

The half blood moon rises, casting a reddish glow over the night sky - signaling Vanessa's labor. Unfortunately, despite trying everything from hot baths to freezing cold temperatures, chili peppers, and even a full-blown blood moon, nothing seems to trigger her labor. Even Arachnus' absence isn't enough for a fun bedtime encounter.

Vanessa and Mindy go on a sibling adventure the following day - stumbling upon Arachnus in an epic battle against Dragalisk (Mindy's boyfriend). As the two supernatural beings duke it out with blasts of Xenoversal energy, their combined force creates an explosion so loud that no ears were harmed. While Vanessa was initially shocked by this unexpected encounter, her reaction was completely different from what would have occurred if she'd been exposed to the blood moon - as in the case with the latter, labor never triggered.

The subsequent weeks passed by uneventfully until Vanessa one day looks down at her stomach, seemingly pleased that her 20 spider-human hybrid children were still safe and well inside her womb. Even more remarkable was their apparent lack of oxygen intake - as though they could breathe just fine while scurrying around in there.

Dialogue between each character

Vanessa: [excitedly] "Hey Mindy, have you ever felt the rush when your body is preparing itself for something big to happen? It's like this deep sense of anticipation and excitement that fills me up from head to toe. I can feel it now - a stirring within my womb. I hope we make it in time before everything goes berserk!"
Mindy: [calmingly] "Relax Vanessa, you've been through this countless times before. Just take a deep breath and let nature take its course. It'll all be worth it once the little ones start popping out."
Arachnus: (Suddenly appearing in their midst) "What is happening? Why have my children not yet arrived?" Arachnus appears, confused by his children's delay in emergence from Vanessa.
Vanessa: [embarrassed] "It's a bit of a complicated situation with our labor. I've been trying to induce it for weeks now, but nothing seems to work."
Arachnus: (Cocking his head inquisitively) "Induce what?"
Vanessa: [nodding] "I tried everything - hot baths, freezing cold temperatures, chili peppers... even a full-blown blood moon. Nothing seemed to work."
Arachnus: (Sounding perplexed) "Then how did I suddenly appear?"
Vanessa: [smiling] "Well Arachnus, you are the most magical of all my spells. Your presence alone always seems to trigger something within me - sometimes good, sometimes bad!"
Arachnus: (Shaking his head in amusement) "I suppose I can't argue with that." Turning towards Mindy, he adds. "And what about this blast of energy you felt earlier? Surely that didn't help your labor?"
Mindy: [glancing at Vanessa] "It was more than a simple burst of energy. It was an epic battle between my boyfriend and Arachnus here - they collided and formed an explosion so loud it even left our ears unharmed!"
Vanessa: (Chuckling) "Well, I can assure you that no ears were harmed in the making of this child."
Arachnus: [excitedly] "I've never heard of such a thing. How did they manage to produce such an explosion without causing any damage?"
Vanessa: [shrugs her shoulders] "I don't know Arachnus, I guess it was just one of those magical moments that happened out of nowhere."
Mindy: (Laughing) "Well you can say the same thing about how all these babies seem to be doing fine without oxygen! It's quite incredible if you ask me."
Arachnus: [confusedly] "What do you mean, they are breathing just fine? I thought that was one of your concerns?"
Vanessa: (Shaking her head) "No Arachnus, my concern was not with their breathing but rather if the children were still growing inside. Apparently, their oxygen intake is more than enough despite being in such a tight space."
Arachnus: [looking at Vanessa with admiration] "Well then, I must commend your skills as an expectant mother. You've done an incredible job taking care of these little ones inside you. They will be nothing short of spectacular once they arrive into this world."
Mindy: (Nodding) "I couldn't agree more Arachnus! Vanessa has been a wonderful mother, even through all the challenges she's faced while carrying her children. I can only hope that we will continue to support each other in every way possible as they grow older."
Arachnus: (Smiling) "I know you both have already given so much of yourselves for these beautiful creatures. And just like Vanessa said, I am confident they will be nothing short of spectacular once they arrive into this world."
Vanessa: [embracing Arachnus tightly] "Thank you my dear friend! Your support means the world to us - especially in moments like these when we need someone we can lean on for guidance and strength. I hope we'll always have each other by our sides, no matter what lies ahead."
Mindy: (Nodding) "Absolutely! Arachnus has been there for all of us throughout this journey - from helping me through my pregnancy to cheering on Vanessa during labor. He truly understands how special these children are and will always be an important part of our family."
Arachnus: (Smiling) "And you two know I could never stay away for long! Your love is stronger than any force - even a blood moon or a magical battle between supernatural beings."
Vanessa: [laughing] "Well said Arachnus! Your presence has always been a reminder that no matter what challenges we face, our bond remains unbreakable."
Mindy: (Smiling) "Indeed, Arachnus is one of the few people in this world who truly understands how much joy and pain these children bring into our lives. And I believe it's thanks to his love that we can continue moving forward no matter what happens."
Arachnus: [nodding] "As long as you both have each other, nothing will ever be able to separate you - not even time itself!"
Vanessa: (Smiling) "I couldn't agree more. Despite the chaos and uncertainty that surround us, having friends like Arachnus reminds me of how precious life truly is."
Mindy: (Nodding) "Absolutely! He brings a sense of calmness into our world - even in moments when everything seems to be falling apart around us. His presence always leaves us feeling secure and at peace, no matter what lies ahead."
Arachnus: [smiling] "Well said Mindy, it's true that sometimes all we need is someone who believes in us unconditionally - someone who understands the magic behind this journey called life. And that's exactly what I hope to be for all of you."
Vanessa: (Nodding) "I couldn't agree more! Arachnus has always been there for us, offering guidance and support during some of our darkest hours. His love truly makes a difference - just like how a full moon can bring about an explosion in nature!"
Mindy: (Smiling) "And that's why I believe we need people like Arachnus more than ever nowadays, especially when navigating through uncertain times filled with fear and anxiety. He reminds us of what's truly important - loving each other no matter what challenges life throws our way."
Arachnus: (Smiling) "As long as you both have each other, nothing will ever be able to tear apart this bond we share - not even a blood moon!"
Vanessa: [laughing] "Well said Arachnus! Sometimes I wonder if it's our love for one another that makes us so powerful and resilient. Like how the moon's energy can bring about such chaos yet still remain a symbol of beauty."
Mindy: (Nodding) "Absolutely Vanessa! Even during these dark times, we continue to find light in each other's presence - just like how the stars shine brighter when placed side by side."
Arachnus: [nodding] "And that is why I believe this journey called life is not about what happens around us but rather who stands beside us during every step along the way. You two are my greatest inspiration - never forgetting how far we've come and always striving towards new heights together."
Vanessa: (Sm

Mindy: "Well, if Vanessa is going to have this baby, I'm sure she can handle anything we throw at her."
Vanessa: "Thanks for the help, Mindy! You're a lifesaver!"
Cupa: "Actually, I thought you were still sleeping?" Inscrane: "You've been working so hard on this web! We wanted to surprise you with some good news."
Inscrane: "I can take us there. It shouldn't be too much of a risk since we're going through the Twilight Forest portal in our world instead of Dimensional Surfing." Cupa: "I hope it works out, Vanessa! We don't want you to have your baby on this side!"
Cupa: (After a moment of silence) "So... what happened between me and Inscrane? I thought we were done." Inscrane: "I wanted to see how far my power could take us. Turns out, it can go pretty far." Cupa: "Sorry, Cupa. I should have told you beforehand."
Mindy: (After a moment of silence) "Well... Vanessa, if you need any help with anything, just ask." Vanessa: "Thank you, Mindy! I appreciate it."
Vanessa: (Looking at the spiderweb) "Wow... this is incredible. I didn't realize how much silk my children were producing!" Cupa: "I know! It's like they're multiplying before our eyes!" Inscrane: "It's truly amazing to witness such a miracle."
Inscrane: (To Vanessa) "I hope this plant works. You deserve happiness, my dear friend."
Vanessa: "Thank you, Cupa and Inscrane. Your support means everything to me!" Cupa: (Bowing her head) "We'll do anything we can for you, Vanessa."
Mindy: (Nodding in understanding) "I know you will, Cupa. You're a good friend."
Inscrane: (Smiling warmly at Inscrane) "It's been great to see you again, Mindy! We'll see you later!" Cupa: "We should probably head back home soon. Don't want to make Inscrane late for their meeting."
Vanessa: (Looking around the room) "This place is incredible... it's like a whole different world in here. I feel so at peace just being surrounded by nature."
Mindy: "It's amazing, isn't it? Just imagine what other treasures this Twilight Forest holds!"
Cupa: (Thinking to herself) "I can't wait to explore more of this dimension with Inscrane. It feels so liberating being able to do something I couldn't before." Vanessa: "Well, we better get back home soon... but it was nice catching up!"
Vanessa: (Looking at Cupa and Inscrane) "You two make a beautiful couple. I hope you find happiness together."
Cupa: (Nodding in agreement) "Thank you, Vanessa. We will always be grateful for your support."
Inscrane: (With a soft smile) "Don't worry, Cupa. We'll take care of each other until the end."
Cupa: (Waving goodbye to everyone) "See you later! Enjoy making that spiderweb, Vanessa!" Inscrane: (Giving a gentle nod) "Take care!"

### Response 2:
Cupa: “Vanessa, we’ve got good news and bad news.”
Vanessa: “What? What is it?”
Inscrane: “The good news is that I have found a plant that can trigger intense contractions once ingested. But the bad news…” Cupa: “It only grows in the Twilight Forest dimension, which we cannot explore because of depleted Diamonds.” Vanessa: “What? That’s terrible! How will we get there?”
Cupa: “I have an idea… Inscrane and I can travel through the portal in our world instead of Dimensional Surfing.” Vanessa: “But what about safety? I don’t want to risk having my baby on this side!”
Inscrane: “We will take every precaution, Vanessa. My power is strong enough for us to make it safely.” Cupa: “I hope so… otherwise we may end up having your children in a place where they shouldn’t be born.” Vanessa: “Thanks for trying, Cupa… but I have a feeling this is going to be difficult.”
Inscrane: “We will do anything for you, Vanessa. Your happiness matters more than anything else.” Vanessa: “I appreciate your support, Inscrane and Cupa. But let’s not dwell on the bad news right now…”
Mindy: “Well… I’m just glad to see everyone doing well despite these challenges.” Vanessa: “You too? You were worried about me sleeping so much?” Mindy: “Of course! It’s never easy having a child, especially when there are so many obstacles. But you have an amazing support system here.”
Inscrane: “Thank you for your kind words, Mindy… I hope we can return the favor someday.” Cupa: “Absolutely, Inscrane!” Vanessa: “You two make a beautiful couple, don’t you think?” Mindy: “It certainly seems like it…”
Vanessa: “And it’s nice catching up with everyone! I miss just chatting about things instead of worrying all the time.” Cupa: “Agreed. Let’s make sure we keep connecting and supporting each other whenever we can.” Inscrane: “We will always be there for you, Vanessa.”
Vanessa: “Thank you so much… it means a lot to know that I have such great friends around me.” Cupa: (To Mindy) “It’s good to see you too! I was starting to wonder if we were going to lose contact.”
Mindy: “Well, things have been busy lately. But it’s always nice catching up with old friends!” Vanessa: “I hope your exploration of the Twilight Forest is going well?” Cupa: (With a smile) “It has its ups and downs… but that’s part of what makes these adventures so exciting! Plus, Inscrane helps me out when I need it.”
Inscrane: (Giving Mindy a gentle nod) “I will always do my best for you. Don’t worry!” Cupa: “See? It’s okay to lean on each other sometimes!” Vanessa: “You two are like family… I don’t know what I would do without you.”
Cupa: “That means a lot coming from you, Vanessa! We will always support and care for one another. Just remember that no matter how challenging things get… we can overcome them together.” Inscrane: (Smiling warmly) “You’re right Cupa... let's keep moving forward as friends.”
Mindy: (Walking out of the room with Vanessa) “It was nice catching up! Be careful in the Twilight Forest…” Inscrane: “I will, Mindy. I promise to come back safely!” Cupa: “Take care, everyone! We’ll see you soon.”
Vanessa: (Waving goodbye and returning home) “Thank you all for your support! Let’s hope we can find that plant and make this pregnancy a success!”

### Response 3:
Mindy: "Cupa, I heard about the good news." Cupa: "Yeah... Inscrane found a plant that can trigger intense contractions once ingested. The only problem is it's in the Twilight Forest dimension - and we don't have enough Diamonds to explore there yet."
Inscrane: "But I will take you through the portal in our world instead of Dimensional Surfing!" Cupa: "I hope it works out... Vanessa doesn't want her child on this side if it can be avoided." Vanessa: "Thanks for trying, Cupa. But I have a feeling this is going to be difficult."
Mindy: "Just focus on making the largest spider web you've ever made - as your unborn children are producing so much silk at once!" Inscrane: "We will do anything for you, Vanessa. Your happiness matters more than anything else."
Vanessa: "I appreciate your support, Inscrane and Cupa." Cupa: "Absolutely! And I hope we can return the favor someday." Mindy: "Well... it's good to see everyone doing well despite these challenges. But you were worried about me sleeping so much?"
Inscrane: "Of course! It's never easy having a child, especially when there are so many obstacles." Vanessa
