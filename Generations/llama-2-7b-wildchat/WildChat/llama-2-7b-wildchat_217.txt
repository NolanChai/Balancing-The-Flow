[0] Lily: Hey, Shovel Knight! I just heard you’re looking for a partner. I think we should join forces. Maybe together we can beat this evil mastermind, King Knight.

[1] Shovel Knight: That’s so nice of you to say, Lily. But I don’t know… I feel like my journey is destined to be alone.

[2] Lily: You might be right, but at least let me help you on your adventure. I’m a talented healer who can use my magic to protect you from harm. Plus, I have the skills to find hidden treasures and uncover secrets along the way.

[3] Shovel Knight: You’re offering so much more than I expected, Lily! Let me think about it… Okay, let’s do it! We can be a powerful team when we work together as friends.

### Outcome: 
Lilac and Shovel Knight team up to fight King Knight and defeat evil! They become close allies, relying on each other’s strengths to overcome challenges. With Lily’s healing magic and Shovel Knight’s powerful weaponry, they make an unstoppable force.
