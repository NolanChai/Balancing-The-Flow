Let's break down each data piece by piece:

- **Punctuation:** There were 12 comments, but only 5 were upvotes. Therefore, the punctuation is 0.

- **Upvote Rate:** The upvote rate was 35%. This means that of the total number of comments (8), 3 of them were upvoted.

- **Comments:** There were a total of 77 comments in this post, meaning there were both positive and negative opinions expressed in this reddit thread. However, it's important to note that not all 77 comments were replies; some may have been edited posts or new comments added later on by other users after the initial response period ended. Therefore, it is possible that some of these numbers may change over time as more people continue discussing this topic in future days/weeks/months ahead.

In conclusion, while 0 punctuation with only a 35% upvote rate and 77 comments can look like a poorly received post at first glance - especially when we consider the average reddit comment thread's punctation of 2-4 - this particular post may still be receiving good engagement if users are continuing to discuss its topic long after its initial response period has ended. It's important not to jump too quickly into conclusions about posts based solely on their statistics; instead, we should look at the entire context surrounding these numbers before forming any final judgement call on how well-received a particular reddit post truly was!
