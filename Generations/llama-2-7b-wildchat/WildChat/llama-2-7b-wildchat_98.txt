The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not have jurisdiction over plant pests or plant pathogens. They are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, which is under the USDA, but it has its own agency: APHIS.

The APHIS investigates any plants suspected to be plant pests or plant pathogens. The USDA does have jurisdiction over genetically modified crops since these are not considered natural.

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has jurisdiction over plant health, not insects or other pests.

Answer choice B is incorrect because USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), which is the agency within the Department that deals with plant issues, did not have jurisdiction over insects or other pests. It was only recently that APHIS gained a regulatory role in evaluating genetically engineered organisms to determine whether they present an environmental risk. The responsibility for assessing biotechnology applications affecting insects and other pests is currently under the jurisdiction of EPA.

Answer choice C is incorrect because APHIS did not develop any guidelines for evaluating plant gene technology, including genetically modified plants. The USDA did, however, develop some guidelines that are intended to provide guidance in deciding whether a transgenic crop will have an environmental impact.

Answer choice D is incorrect because APHIS was not involved in the development of any guidelines for evaluating plant gene technology. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed several guides to help determine if genetically engineered plants are a risk to the environment and public health. These guidelines were established following an agreement between the EPA, USDA, FDA, and other agencies in 1986 known as the "Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology."

Answer choice E is incorrect because APHIS did not have jurisdiction over insects or other pests. The responsibility for assessing biotechnology applications affecting insects and other pests is currently under the jurisdiction of EPA.

True

### Explanation:

The DNA delivered by electroporation is exogenous, non-viral, and not endogenous to the host cell. Thus, it cannot be considered a viral delivery method in vivo (since viruses are by definition parasites that cause disease).
