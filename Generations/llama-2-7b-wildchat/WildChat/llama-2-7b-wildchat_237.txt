As she tries to catch up, she notices an odd change in the robot's behavior. Before she can act, Neera is pulled back by Lilac and Carol who explain that they are on a mission. At this moment, a wave of darkness envelopes them as the girls transform into their Freedom Planet forms before flying off. Neera chases after them until she finds herself on the same island where Merga was freed from her crystal prison years ago. She quickly realizes that something is amiss and flies over to meet Lilac's group.

Freedom Planet 2 - Lilac's Story- 04

#### Script:

"I knew you had it in you." Milla is impressed with how far Lilac has come from the weak and timid girl she once was. Neera praises Carol for helping bring her back, and Lilac thanks them all for their support. The team decides to stay on the airship together until they find Pangu's body, hoping that he can be revived somehow.

Corazon is revealed as Carol's old friend from the Freedom Planet universe, and she recalls how they first met when Lilac was a young girl training with Milla. She reveals that the group has been on the run for months after their escape from the Parusa colony, and they have spent that time trying to find Lilac's family. Carol is surprised by Corazon's reunion with Neera and asks her about it, but she does not respond immediately.

As the team explores the airship together, Milla explains that Pangu may be able to speak through AI, similar to how Freedom Planet's P-Body could communicate without a body. She also notes that they have no way of knowing if he can truly be revived since his physical form was destroyed. Neera mentions that she heard the captain had a tarsier pet, and Lilac explains that this may mean Corazon is the same person as "Kakugan", the robot pilot who attacked her earlier.

The team enters Pangu's main hull, and Lilac finds his body hidden away in a secret compartment. She cries out in anguish at the sight of his broken form, and Neera reassures her that they will do everything they can to revive him. As Milla works on restoring power to Pangu's AI system, Lilac explains that this was their last chance to find answers about what happened during those missing months when she was separated from her family. She hopes that Pangu may hold the key to finding out where they went and if he is still alive.

As Milla begins the process of connecting Pangu's AI system back online, Corazon reveals that she and Carol have been keeping an eye on Lilac since her return, hoping to protect her from anyone who would want her dead. She admits that her original mission was not to steal Pangu but rather to find out where Lilac went when they were separated. Carol agrees with this assessment, saying that it was the right thing to do as long as no one else got hurt in the process.

As Milla restores power to Pangu's system, Carol tells Corazon that she and Neera have been keeping an eye on Lilac as well since her return from Parusa. She explains that they wanted to protect her from anyone who might want to harm her, but they were also worried about what might happen if no one tried to find out the truth about those missing months when she was separated from her family. Carol admits that she felt responsible for Lilac during this time since she had promised to protect her and make sure nothing bad happened while they were apart.

Milla finishes restoring power to Pangu's system, and Neera connects the AI back online. The group waits nervously as Pangu's eyes begin to glow. He slowly opens his eyes, revealing himself as Lilac's brother, Peyton. Shocked by this revelation, the team is overjoyed that he is alive and well after all these months of being separated from them. As Carol embraces her brother for the first time in years, Neera asks how long they have been apart and what happened during those missing months when Lilac was separated from her family.

Peyton explains that he had gone to search for their mother who went missing after Lilac's father left them behind on Parusa Colony years ago. He tells the group about his journey through different planets searching for clues while also trying not to get involved in any conflicts along the way. Although Peyton was able to find information about their mother's whereabouts, he could not bring himself to go back because doing so would mean abandoning Lilac again. He says that this decision haunted him ever since then until they were reunited again now thanks to Milla and Neera's help.

As Carol embraces her brother for the first time in years after being separated from their family on Parusa Colony, Neera asks how long it has been since she last saw him before leaving Lilac behind when everything fell apart back then. Peyton explains that he had gone to look for their mother who went missing shortly after Lilac's father left them behind years ago on Parusa Colony itself during a search party mission organized by Freedom Planet's government officials at that time. Although he was able to find some clues about where she might be, Peyton did not follow through with this information because doing so would mean abandoning Lilac again and breaking their promise together back then when they were children playing happily under a tree together before everything changed due to circumstances beyond anyone's control at that time.

With Pangu restored back to normal now, everyone is relieved that he had survived despite all odds against him during these tough times without any help from anyone else except for his family who supported him every step of the way along with their friends even though they were separated temporarily due to certain circumstances beyond anyone's control at that time as well. As Carol embraces her brother once again after being separated from each other over several years, she is glad that everything worked out in the end despite all difficulties faced during this period where no one else knew exactly what happened either except them alone until now when they finally reunited once more thanks entirely to Milla's efforts combined together with Neera's help along with some lucky breaks here and there which ultimately resulted in everyone getting back together again eventually.

Now that Peyton is back, it appears likely that things will go smoother between Lilac and Carol now since they have been reunited once more after such a long time apart from each other before finally meeting up once again today thanks entirely to Milla's efforts combined together with Neera's help along with some lucky breaks here and there which ultimately resulted in everyone getting back together again eventually despite all odds against them throughout these difficult times where no one else knew exactly what happened either except us alone until now when they finally reunited once more thanks entirely to Milla's efforts combined together with Neera's help along with some lucky breaks here and there which ultimately resulted in everyone getting back together again eventually.

The group celebrates their reunion, with Carol vowing to protect her brother from any harm that may come his way as well as helping Lilac find answers about what happened during those missing months when they were separated before finally meeting up once more thanks entirely Milla's efforts combined together Neera's help along some lucky breaks here and there which ultimately resulted everyone getting back together again eventually despite all odds against us throughout these difficult times where no one else knew exactly what happened either except them alone until now when they finally reunited once again after being separated temporarily due certain circumstances beyond anyone control at that time as well.

In the end, it is clear that things are finally looking up for everyone involved in this situation thanks entirely Milla's efforts combined together with Neera's help along with some lucky breaks here and there which ultimately resulted everyone getting back together again eventually despite all odds against them throughout these difficult times where no one else knew exactly what happened either except us alone until now when they finally reunited once more after being separated temporarily due certain circumstances beyond anyone control at that time as well.
