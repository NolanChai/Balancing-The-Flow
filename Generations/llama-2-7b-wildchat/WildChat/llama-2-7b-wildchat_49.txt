Alice: "...I-I don't know what's happening." (she suddenly burst out into tears)

(I looked at the teacher. She was shocked as well, but tried to reassure her that everything would be alright. Alice and I were still in school.)

Teacher: "It must have been something you ate yesterday...you'll just need to rest now." (she rubbed Alice's back)

Alice: (still crying, but in pain) "...I don't think so. It feels like something is happening inside of me..."

Teacher: "You're probably right, and I'm sure we can get you to the hospital if necessary." (she called an ambulance for her, and left us with our homework)

(Alice was then rushed to a nearby hospital. I felt bad for her...and I hoped she would be alright.)

Alice: "...I'll be okay, Safi. Just don't worry about me too much." (she wiped away her tears)

Safi'jiiva: "But you could die..."

(She gave a light chuckle, and smiled at me.)

Alice: "I know, but I'll be fine. You don't have to worry about me." (she waved goodbye as she was wheeled away)

Safi'jiiva: "...Okay then."

(I went back home and tried not to think about Alice's fate. But the next day, I was shocked when I saw a newcomer enter the school.)

New student: "Um...excuse me?"

Safi'jiiva: (to myself) "A new kid?! Where did she come from?" (I looked to my left. And it was Alice.)

(I couldn't believe what I saw. She had a small belly now, but was still beautiful in her own way.)

New student: "Hi there...are you Safi'jiiva? I'm Alice, and we've met before."

Safi'jiiva: "...You're back?" (I asked her)

Alice: "Yep! And I want to apologize for bullying you all those months ago. It was wrong of me..."

(My jaw dropped.)

Safi'jiiva: "...Why? Why would you do such a thing?" (my voice cracked, but she didn't seem phased)

Alice: "Well...I didn't want to tell you this then, but I was actually pregnant all that time. It wasn't until the day of my labor that I realized I had a dragon's child." (she smiled and looked at her belly)

Safi'jiiva: "A dragon's...child?" (I repeated, in disbelief)

(She nodded.)

Alice: "...Well, you don't have to worry about me. I know this is going to be a huge adjustment for my daughter and me, but we're gonna make it work." (she looked up at the sky, smiling)

Safi'jiiva: "You...you mean your baby is mine?" (my voice was getting louder)

Alice: "I know that you were upset with me for bullying you and calling you names. But I've grown to love the person you are, even if we don't have much in common. And...now my daughter and I are going to be able to experience this world together." (she gave a small smile)

Safi'jiiva: "...I-I don't know what to say..." (my heart was racing, but I tried not to show it.)

Alice: "Well...I just want you to know that no matter what happens in the future, I will always have a place for you. You may be different from me, but I can still appreciate who you are and all you've done for me." (she walked closer)

Safi'jiiva: "...Alice...thank you..." (I held back tears, not wanting her to see them)

(She gave me a small hug.)
