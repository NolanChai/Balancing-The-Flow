 It seems that Arturo Vidal, the experienced Chilean midfielder, is still dealing with the knee injury he sustained at the end of last season. This could potentially impact his availability for his club or national team duties in the near future. I recommend keeping an eye on updates regarding his recovery to stay informed about any developments.
