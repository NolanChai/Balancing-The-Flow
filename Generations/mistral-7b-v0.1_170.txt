Millions of cricket fans would have never again trusted what they saw on the field because of the match-fixing scandal, a judge said yesterday.

### Explanation:
The correct answer is "would" because it matches the original sentence's verb tense ("will never again trust") and expresses a hypothetical situation in the past. This is known as the past conditional. It is used to make predictions or assumptions about events that did not happen but could have happened. In this case, the speaker is making an assumption about what would happen based on the match-fixing scandal.
