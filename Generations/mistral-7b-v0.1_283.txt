I am deeply saddened and angered over this attack on our forces that have been deployed to Afghanistan for the purpose of helping the Afghan people build a stable and democratic future. This is an act of cowardice against those who are fighting for freedom.

This incident shows how dangerous it can be in Afghanistan, and that we must maintain a vigilant presence there until the job is done.

I am praying for the families of these brave men as they mourn the loss of their loved ones.
