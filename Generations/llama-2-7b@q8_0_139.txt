Fabianski was handed a one-match ban for violent conduct when he kicked out at Cardiff City striker Kenwyne Jones during Swansea's 4-2 win at Ninian Park last weekend, but he can still be selected to play in Sunday's game against Spurs as long as the club are happy with the disciplinary action they have taken.
The Pole has been fined Â£750 by the FA and will also miss Swansea's home match against Manchester United next Tuesday night.
