 in a remote part of Cornwall to come forward and reveal more information about her son's disappearance.

The mother, who has not been named, is being appealed to by police following the discovery of the baby's body near a churchyard in St. Austell on July 28. The body was found in a state of decomposition and had been wrapped in a towel.

Detective Inspector Paul Stollery, who is leading the investigation, said: "We are appealing to anyone with information about the mother or her circumstances to come forward and assist us in our inquiries. We would like to speak to her as soon as possible to understand more about what happened."

The police have also released a photograph of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the case. He is described as being in his early 30s, around 5ft 7in and has short brown hair. He was seen walking in the area around the churchyard on July 28 between 1pm and 4pm.

The discovery of the baby's remains has sparked a community outpouring of support for the family involved, with many people expressing their sympathy and offering to help in any way they can.

The Cornwall and Devon Child Mortality Review Panel will carry out an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of the baby and make recommendations for how similar tragedies can be prevented in the future.
