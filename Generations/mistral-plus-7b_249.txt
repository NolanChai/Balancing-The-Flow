Shark attacks are rare occurrences that happen in coastal areas where people tend to swim and surf. However, the number of shark attacks has been steadily declining over the past decade. In 2018, there were only 64 reported shark attacks worldwide, which is the lowest number since 2014. Despite this decrease, sharks remain dangerous predators and their attacks can be deadly. Sharks are known for their powerful jaws and sharp teeth, which can cause severe lacerations and even death. It's important to be aware of your surroundings when swimming in the ocean or near shoreline areas as there is always a possibility of encountering a shark.
