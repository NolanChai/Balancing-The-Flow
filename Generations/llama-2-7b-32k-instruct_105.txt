With their showstopping Olympic appearance and glitzy new West End musical, the Spice Girls are back in full force. However, despite reports of a reunion tour, the band insist they will not be reforming ."We are NOT reforming," said Emma Bunton on Twitter yesterday. "The truth is we're just having fun!" . The band - whose members have gone on to pursue solo careers - recently came together to celebrate Mel C's 40th birthday in New York, but at the time the media reported they would be reuniting for a tour. Speaking of their new West End musical, Viva Forever!, which opened last week , Geri Halliwell said: "It was great to be together . We had so much fun, it's lovely to hang out with each other." The girls admit they have not been in touch lately but added that there is "nothing to announce at the moment". They insist their new West End show will bring the party atmosphere of the Spice Girls back to fans. (See also: Emma Bunton's blog)
