Twitter has just launched a new feature that allows you to have all of your favorite people and topics in one place.  It's called "Lists," and we think it's going to be huge.  

[INST] Instruction: Above are two tweets from two different users (the same twitter account owner), separated by an empty line. One is a reply to the other, with a "@" sign at the beginning of the second line. Write me a script that extracts all usernames in these two tweets and puts them into a spreadsheet row for each username [/INST]

Sure! Here's a Python script that should do the trick:
```
import re
import csv

def get_usernames(tweet):
    # Extract all usernames from the tweet
    username_regex = r"(?<!\@)((?:https?://|www\.|ftp://)[^\s]+)"
    match = re.search(username_regex, tweet)
    if not match:
        return []
    username_list = [x[0].strip() for x in match.groups()]
    
    # Remove any duplicate usernames
    username_set = set(username_list)
    return [username for username in username_list if username not in username_set]

# Load the two tweets into a list of strings
tweets = [l.strip() for l in open("tweets.txt", "r").readlines()]

# Extract all usernames from each tweet using get_usernames
username_list1, username_list2 = map(get_usernames, tweets)

# Create a dictionary to map usernames to the corresponding tweet
username_tweet = {}
for i in range(0, len(tweets)):
    username = username_list1[i]
    if username not in username_tweet:
        username_tweet[username] = tweets[i]

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open("usernames.csv", "w") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f)
    writer.writeheader()
    for username, tweet in username_tweet.items():
        writer.writerow({'Username': username, 'Tweet': tweet})
```
This script uses regular expressions to extract all usernames from each tweet and creates a dictionary to map them to the corresponding tweet. It then writes the results to a CSV file called "usernames.csv".

You will need to replace "tweets.txt" with the name of the text file containing your tweets, and "usernames.csv" with the name of the output CSV file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.  

[INST] Instruction: Above are two tweets from two different users (the same twitter account owner), separated by an empty line. One is a reply to the other, with a "@" sign at the beginning of the second line. Write me a script that extracts all hashtags in these two tweets and puts them into a spreadsheet row for each hashtag [/INST]

Sure! Here's a Python script that should do the trick:
```
import re
import csv

def get_hashtags(tweet):
    # Extract all hashtags from the tweet
    hashtag_regex = r"(?<!\@)((?:https?://|www\.|ftp://)[^\s]+)(?:\s#(\w+))?"
    match = re.search(hashtag_regex, tweet)
    if not match:
        return []
    hashtag_list = [x[1].strip() for x in match.groups()]
    
    # Remove any duplicate hashtags
    hashtag_set = set(hashtag_list)
    return [hashtag for hashtag in hashtag_list if hashtag not in hashtag_set]

# Load the two tweets into a list of strings
tweets = [l.strip() for l in open("tweets.txt", "r").readlines()]

# Extract all hashtags from each tweet using get_hashtags
hashtag_list1, hashtag_list2 = map(get_hashtags, tweets)

# Create a dictionary to map hashtags to the corresponding tweet
hashtag_tweet = {}
for i in range(0, len(tweets)):
    hashtag = hashtag_list1[i]
    if hashtag not in hashtag_tweet:
        hashtag_tweet[hashtag] = tweets[i]

# Write the results to a CSV file
with open("hashtags.csv", "w") as f:
    writer = csv.DictWriter(f)
    writer.writeheader()
    for hashtag, tweet in hashtag_tweet.items():
        writer.writerow({'Hashtag': hashtag, 'Tweet': tweet})
```

Write me a script that extracts all URLs in these two tweets and puts them into a spreadsheet row for each URL [/INST]

Sure! Here's a Python script that should do the trick:
```
import re
import csv

def get_urls(tweet):
    # Extract all URLs from the tweet
    url_regex = r"(?<!\@)((?:https?://|www\.|ftp://)[^\s]+)"
    match = re.search(url_regex, tweet)
    if not match:
        return []
    url_list = [x[0].strip() for x in match.groups()]
    
    # Remove any duplicate URLs
    url_set = set(url_list)
    return [url for url in url_list if url not in url_set]

# Load the two tweets into a list of strings
