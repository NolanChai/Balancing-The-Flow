 It seems you've shared a news headline about a change in court procedures to protect victims of crime from harsh cross-examinations. Here's a rephrased version:

In an effort to support victims of heinous crimes, such as rape, changes are being made to court proceedings to shield them from distressing and grueling cross-examinations.

These adjustments aim to alleviate the suffering endured by crime victims during trial processes, providing a more compassionate and sensitive approach in the pursuit of justice.
