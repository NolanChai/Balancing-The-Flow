 This is not the first time that the president has met with top congressional leaders to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. However, the fact that he is meeting with them now may indicate that there is growing concern about the stability of the government and the military situation in the country.

During his re-election campaign, Obama made clear that he intended to end the war in Afghanistan by 2014. However, the situation on the ground has become increasingly complex, with ongoing fighting between Taliban insurgents and government forces, as well as concerns about corruption and a lack of political stability in the country.

It is unclear what specific issues the president will discuss with congressional leaders during this meeting. However, he is likely to express his concern about the situation in Afghanistan and seek their support for ongoing efforts to stabilize the country. He may also discuss potential options for reducing the military presence in Afghanistan, or even ending the war altogether.

It will be interesting to see how congressional leaders respond to these discussions. There are certainly some members of Congress who are strongly opposed to continuing the war in Afghanistan, and they may push the president to take a more aggressive stance on this issue. However, there are also many members who believe that the United States has a responsibility to help stabilize the country and support the Afghan government.

Overall, it seems likely that the president will face some tough choices about how to approach Afghanistan in the coming months. Whether he decides to continue with his current strategy of gradually reducing the military presence, or take a more aggressive stance on this issue remains to be seen.
