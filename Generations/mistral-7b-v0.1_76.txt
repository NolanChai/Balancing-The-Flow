I have already looked into this case and I have found that there is not much evidence, but there has been a lot of media coverage surrounding the trial.  Most of the time when there is an overwhelming amount of media coverage it is because of public interest.  It seems to me that people are very interested in this case, so it is possible that Mumia Abu-Jamal could be innocent.  However, since there is not a lot of evidence for this case I would suggest doing some research into the case and seeing what you come up with.
