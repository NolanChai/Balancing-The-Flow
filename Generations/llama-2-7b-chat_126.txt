Arsenal's financial results for the 2013-14 season have revealed a significant increase in the club's cash reserves, with a record Â£173.3m sitting in the bank at the end of May. While some of this money is earmarked for specific purposes such as player transfers and wages, much of it should theoretically be available for Arsene Wenger to use on new signings. However, the manager has so far failed to make any major additions to his squad despite having more than enough funds at his disposal.
