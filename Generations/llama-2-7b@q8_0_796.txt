The distance that the projectile traveled can be determined using the equation:

This is a simple approximation where velocity is assumed constant and does not change during flight, which isn't always accurate but works here since the time of flight is small compared to the time it takes for the projectile to slow down enough to stop moving.

The distance traveled by the projectile is the distance between the initial point (which we assume is zero) and final point, which is 3.5 cm since that's where it was found in the car:

```
(1) x = (v0 + at)^2/(2a)
```

The velocity of the projectile is given by

since we know the mass, velocity of impact, and acceleration due to gravity are all known quantities. Since the mass is not equal to zero (as is often assumed in these kinds of problems), you can't assume the projectile will hit the ground at an angle of 90 degrees which would require a vertical component of velocity as well. So the velocity has two components:

Substituting this into equation (1):
```
(2) x = (v0 + gt)^2/(2g)
```
The square root of both sides gives you the distance traveled:
```
(3) âˆšx = (v0 + gt)/gt
```
Divide both sides by t and subtract v0 from each side to get the equation for velocity:
```
(4) v_i + (g/t)^2 = v_o - g
```
The initial velocity was zero, so
```
(5) v_i = 0
```
And the final velocity is given by:
```
(6) v_f = v_o + (g/t)^2
```
