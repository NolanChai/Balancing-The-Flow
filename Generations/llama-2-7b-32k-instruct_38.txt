Sowell was found guilty of aggravated murder in the deaths of 11 women whose bodies were found at his home between August 2005 and April 2009.   The victims ranged in age from 30 to 54; none had been reported missing, according to court records.
Sowell was arrested in December 2009 after the remains of five women were found in his home -- three at his residence and two in a crawl space behind his house. He was indicted on additional charges for the murders of six other women whose remains were later discovered at his home, police said.   Sowell's attorney had argued that he suffers from depression and that Sowell should be sentenced to life without parole because of evidence showing his victims were killed in a "cold, calculated manner."
"The aggravated murder convictions are the most serious charges a person can face," Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Dick Ambrose said.   Prosecutors argued Sowell's mental health issues had not prevented him from preying on and killing women, including five in one night between December 2008 and January 2009.
"Anthony Sowell is a danger to the community," Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Bill Mason said after Friday's hearing.   Authorities have not ruled out the possibility that more women may be found dead, and police are investigating leads in other states for possible victims of Sowell, who had been on death row since 2011.
The prosecutor also announced that a task force has been formed to investigate serial killings in Cuyahoga County.   The decision came Friday after two days of testimony by experts and family members.    Ambrose's ruling does not change the punishment from death, but Sowell still has a chance for appeal before he is executed.
"I believe I will be killed," Sowell told a judge at his sentencing hearing in January 2011 as the jury was deliberating whether to recommend a death sentence.   A representative of the family of Annette Stewart, one of Sowell's victims who testified against him, thanked the families of all the victims for their participation and urged Ambrose to uphold the jurors' recommendation.
"I believe that they deserve a death sentence," she said.   The judge also denied an appeal from the National Alliance on Mental Illness, which had argued that Sowell should not have been allowed to represent himself at his sentencing hearing because he is mentally ill and unable to competently assist counsel.    NAMI, in a statement issued Friday afternoon, called for a re-examination of Ohio's death penalty protocols, saying: "NAMI is dismayed that the decision was based on the actions of one man."
"This ruling should be cause for concern for all Ohioans, and we call upon the state to take action to address these serious concerns," it said.
Ambrose rejected the argument that Sowell's mental health issues prevent him from receiving the death penalty because he could not comprehend his actions or understand punishment.   In 2014, a judge ruled Sowell was competent enough to be executed after an evaluation found he understood the charges against him and why he would die in prison if sentenced to death, according to court records.
"His attorney made it clear that Anthony has no mental illness," Ambrose said at Friday's hearing.    Sowell declined to address the court, but his mother and sister did speak on his behalf.    His family argued that Sowell was being treated for depression, anxiety and PTSD while in prison and that he should not be punished "because of what society has done to him," said his sister, Marlene House.
"He is not a threat to society, but the only thing he needs help with now is coping with society," House added.    Sowell's mother, Annette Sowell, urged Ambrose not to sentence her son to death and called him a "good boy" who has been "torn up by society."
"The system failed my child," she said.   Ambrose also denied an appeal from the Ohio Public Defender's office that claimed it was unfair for Sowell's attorney, Kenneth Gormley, to be disqualified from representing him because he previously represented another victim of Sowell's."
"I don't know how that happened," Ambrose said.   "I am not sure why you were in the courtroom," the judge added.    Ambrose said there was no evidence Gormley did anything wrong and that his office did nothing wrong in having Gormley represent Sowell at trial."
"He is an attorney, he has a right to practice law," the judge said.   "It's unfortunate, but it is not going to prevent me from giving you this death sentence."
The sentence does not take effect immediately; that decision will be made by Ohio Gov. John Kasich.   The governor must sign Sowell's death warrant before the execution can occur.
