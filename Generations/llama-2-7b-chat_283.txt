The attack occurred in Helmand Province, where American and Afghan forces have been conducting joint operations against insurgent groups linked to the Taliban and other extremist organizations. The motive for the attack is still unclear, but it comes at a time when tensions between the U.S. and Afghan governments are running high over issues such as troop withdrawal and political power-sharing.
