A benefits cheat who claimed to be wheelchair-bound is facing a hefty jail sentence after swindling Â£1.2million in disability payments over 20 years.

Nigel James, 54, used the money to splash out on a luxury car and expensive holidays. He was convicted of fraud at Snaresbrook Crown Court after faking paralysis for two decades. James claimed he could not walk or stand from his home in Stamford Hill, North London. However, it emerged that he had been caught on CCTV walking around the streets without a wheelchair and using his legs to walk up escalators.

In 2010, investigators from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) began an undercover operation to catch James in the act of faking his disability. The surveillance team caught him on camera walking around the streets without the aid of a wheelchair or crutches. He was also seen climbing stairs unaided.

James admitted fraudulently claiming Disability Living Allowance, Income Support, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit between 1989 and 2010. He is due to be sentenced on 2 August and faces a possible jail term of up to ten years.
