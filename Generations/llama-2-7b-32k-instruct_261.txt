Evans is currently training with League One Barnsley and he will be available on a free transfer once his current contract expires next month . The Blades have made no official comment on the situation but it's understood they are considering a move for him, while manager Chris Wilder was recently asked about Evans at a fans' forum.
"I don't think that'll be happening," Wilder said of Evans returning to Bramall Lane . "I would imagine the club will make no comment and if it does come up on social media or in the newspapers then I'd have to look into that."
