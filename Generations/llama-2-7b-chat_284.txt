Aston Villa have gone more than four months without scoring a goal in the Premier League, a hitherto unthinkable scenario for a team that was once one of England's most potent attacking forces. With just two games left to play before the winter break, the Villans find themselves mired in a deepening goal drought, their worst in the club's 137-year history. The last time they went this long without finding the back of the net was way back in 1986, during their last relegation season under Tony Barton.
