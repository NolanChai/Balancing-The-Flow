House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) already has the right tan for Florida’s 29th congressional district. But he’d better start getting accustomed to wearing a toupee if he hopes to unseat incumbent Rep. Patrick Murphy (D).
Murphy is only 26, but he looks like an old man in the video ad below because of his receding hairline and thinning eyebrows:

That’s a major problem for someone running to represent a district whose median age is just 35 years old. And it will get worse as Murphy continues to age and his hairline recedes further into the shadows behind his ears:

Murphy’s opponent is an 11-year veteran of the Florida legislature named Joe Budd, who has a lot more hair than he does and looks like this when his hair isn’t pushed back behind his ears:

He even makes Murphy look young!
