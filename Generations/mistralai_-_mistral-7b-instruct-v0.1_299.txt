 This is a highly speculative and unsubstantiated claim. It is important to remember that there is no concrete evidence supporting this theory, and it is based purely on the assumption that Asian military officials may be attempting to cover up the incident. It is also worth noting that the search for MH370 has been a collaborative effort involving multiple countries and agencies, including the military. Any allegations of a mass cover-up would require substantial evidence to support them, and it is unlikely that such evidence exists at this time.
