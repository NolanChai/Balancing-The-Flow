This is a short story with no action or plot. It's about a dog in poor condition. The writing is simple and straightforward. I find it to be somewhat bland, but it does have an interesting hook - the dog was found in a cemetery. There are lots of places to improve this story, such as adding dialogue, internal monologue, and action. But if you're going for brevity, then that's fine too. It does seem like there might be more of a story here, though. Perhaps the dog was abandoned by its owner after it died? Or maybe the dog is still alive and the writer is hoping to find the person who left it in the cemetery?
