1. Write a program that takes input from standard input. It should read in the lines below, which are the words spoken by Obama at his first inaugural address.
```
You can put it in your own file if you like.

"Today we affirm a new era of responsibility."
"Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law - for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well."
```

2. The program should store this input in an array of strings named "words". This array must be created before any other operations are performed.
3. Each word (e.g. 'equality') should have a counter (i.e. count) assigned to it which keeps track how often that word has been found in the array. These counters are initialized to 0 before processing begins.
4. Your program should also print out, for each line of input, the following information:
- The number of words spoken during this line.
- How many times this word has occurred previously (i.e. its count).
5. Your program should print a header row (not part of your output) showing how many lines in total there were. This is useful for keeping track of the program's progress.
6. The array should be sorted, with words printed out in descending order by their counts, so that all words with the same count appear together.
7. If there are no two words that have equal frequencies, print 'No words occur more than once.'
8. Otherwise, output each word and its frequency together with a newline.
```
"America, in the face of our common dangers..."
"For if we fail to meet this challenge - as nations and as a global community - we will surely regret it."
```
9. Create another array named "duplicate". This is an array of indexes that indicates where words occur more than once, e.g. [10, 26] would indicate the first two occurrences of 'equality' are at indices 10 and 26. If there are no duplicate words, your program should output a message to this effect (e.g. "No duplicate words found")
