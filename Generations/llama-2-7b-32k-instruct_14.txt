Ross was hospitalized for injuries he sustained in the accident but refused to file criminal charges against himself or anyone else, police spokeswoman Keyla Concepcion told CNN affiliate WFOR-TV. 

"He did not want any charges pressed," Concepcion said. "The vehicle was damaged, but the building is OK."  

Ross crashed into a four story apartment building at 6:45 a.m., just after hearing gunfire while driving on Northwest 17th Court and 29th Street, Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue Battalion Chief Timothy Golding said.

A police officer responding to the scene saw Ross' car crash into the building but could not get close because of traffic, Concepcion said. Ross told firefighters he did not know what had happened and refused medical treatment, she said.  

An investigation is underway to determine whether drugs or alcohol played a role in the crash, Golding said. Police did not find any illegal narcotics inside the Rolls Royce or Ross' pockets, but they will test his blood, he said. 

A female passenger was also taken from the scene by paramedics and hospitalized for injuries she sustained in the crash. She refused to provide police with her name or medical condition, Concepcion said.  

Ross has not been named as a suspect in the shooting, which occurred about 15 minutes before he crashed his car, Fort Lauderdale Police Lt. Paul O'Connor told CNN affiliate WPLG-TV. No one was wounded in the shooting, he said.  

"We have no clue if there is a connection with him," O'Connor said of Ross. "He has not been named as a suspect." 

Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment left at his publicist's office and on his Twitter account Monday morning.  

The crash scene was near the rap artist's home in Fort Lauderdale. Ross told WFOR-TV he was returning from a nearby gym when the crash occurred but declined to elaborate. 

Ross is one of hip hop's top earners and has been praised for his lyrical prowess by fellow rappers. He released two albums last year, including Deeper Than Rap, which went on to sell more than a million copies worldwide.  

The 40-year-old rapper also appears in the upcoming film The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift with singer Nelly Furtado and actor Michael Caine. Ross will also appear as himself in the movie, set to be released June 22, his manager said earlier this month.   

Ross has had legal troubles before. He was arrested in Fort Lauderdale on a marijuana charge last year. In August, he pleaded no contest to felony charges of attempted extortion and assault with a firearm stemming from an incident at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in South Florida two years earlier. Ross was sentenced to five months behind bars as well as community service."
