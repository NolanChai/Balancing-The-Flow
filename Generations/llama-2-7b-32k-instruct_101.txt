Say hello to the jowl lifter!

The jawline is the most youthful part of the face, according to cosmetic surgeon Dr Julian De Silva. “A strong jaw is one of the first signs of facial ageing and a great way to instantly look younger,” he says. 
  
 To achieve this, Dr Silva has developed an innovative treatment called Fat-eater jowl lifting, which uses fat from elsewhere in the face to fill out and plump the area under the chin – one of the first non-surgical methods available . The procedure involves using a special instrument that extracts fat cells from areas such as the upper lip. It is then injected into the jawline by a fine needle. 
  
 Dr Silva says the results are almost instant, with patients looking up to eight years younger within minutes of having it done . He adds: “There’s no down time and I am seeing really good results from patients . You can see that instantly in their face.” 
  
 The jowl lifter is now available at Dr Julian De Silva clinics, which are located in London, New York and Beverly Hills.
