The new curry sauce, developed by UK food technology company Sainsburyâ€™s, contains 52% less calories, 73% less saturated fat and 84% less salt than traditional Indian cooking pastes. The sauce is a healthier alternative to ready-made sauces available on the market that contain high levels of calories, saturated fat and salt due to the use of cream, butter and cheese. The new sauce uses only fresh ingredients such as garlic, ginger, coriander and turmeric, which are known for their health benefits.
