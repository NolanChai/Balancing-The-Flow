Cake Boss is a television series that airs on the TLC network. It focuses on Buddy Valastro and his family-owned bakery, Carlo's Bakery in Hoboken, New Jersey. The program premiered on June 26, 2009, and has aired eight seasons as of 2015.

TLC pulled an episode from future screenings after receiving complaints over a scene featuring Buddy Valastro using the n-word. The episode, which originally aired in October 2014, featured Valastro making a cake for his brother's wedding. During the episode, he can be heard saying "nigger" multiple times while working on the cake.

In response to the incident, TLC released a statement saying that they were "deeply sorry for any offense this may have caused." They added that they would not be airing the episode in future screenings and would take steps to ensure it never happened again.

The episode has since been removed from most streaming services and is no longer available to watch online. However, some clips of the scene featuring Buddy Valastro using the n-word are still circulating on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook.
