The Brazil squad have shown their support for missing team-mates, Neymar and Thiago Silva by wearing t-shirts bearing the faces of both players in an effort to boost morale before Tuesday's World Cup semi-final clash with Germany. The pair missed Friday night's quarter final win over Colombia after suffering knocks during Brazil's 7-1 hammering of Croatia.
