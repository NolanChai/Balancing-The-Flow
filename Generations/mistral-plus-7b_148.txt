A boy who grew up on the land in country Victoria and went on to serve in Australia's Defence Forces for nearly four decades, John Oddie recalled the moment he was awarded the Medal of Gallantry for saving a fellow soldier from drowning.

The 59-year-old said that as a young man, he had always wanted to join the Army.

'When I was growing up, all my mates were going to be farmers but I wanted to be in the Army,' he told Daily Mail Australia.
