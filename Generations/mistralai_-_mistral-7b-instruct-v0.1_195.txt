 The protesters, who included players from the University of Georgia, the University of Missouri and Auburn University, took a knee on the field after the national anthem was played. They held up signs and chanted slogans in support of racial justice and police brutality reform.

The NCAA has been criticized for its handling of the protests, which have become more widespread and vocal this season. The organization has threatened to withhold championships from schools that allow their players to kneel during the anthem, but it has not yet taken any action against these three teams.

Georgia coach Kirby Smart condemned the protests, calling them "disrespectful" and "unacceptable." He said he had spoken to his players about the issue and urged them to stand up for their country and the American flag.

Missouri coach Barry Odom also spoke out against the protests, saying he respected his players' right to free speech but believed they should have chosen a different forum for their message. Auburn coach Gus Malzahn did not address the issue directly during a press conference on Saturday.

The protesters' actions drew mixed reactions from fans and commentators on social media. Some praised the players for standing up for what they believe in, while others criticized them for disrespecting the anthem and the country.
