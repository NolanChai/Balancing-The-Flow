Women? In Egypt, yes... but it's a problematic claim in Tunisia where the main opposition groups are secular (not religious) women activists who led protests against Ben Ali and were marginalized by Islamist men. 

In Libya, men played the dominant role with women being only about 10% of participants... so there is no women vs men division in Libya as claimed here. 

In Yemen, we still need more information but it looks like a similar situation to Libya: men dominated the demonstrations while women are likely less active than in Tunisia.
