 UFC 269, a highly anticipated event that saw some of the biggest names in mixed martial arts (MMA) compete against each other, took place on Saturday night in Las Vegas. The main attraction of the evening was the lightweight bout between Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirier, who had a long-standing rivalry dating back to 2014 when they first faced off at UFC 165.

McGregor, known for his flashy style and brash trash talk, promised to stop Poirier in the first round of their rematch. Poirier, on the other hand, was determined to prove that he was the better fighter and had been training hard for this fight.

As the fighters took to the octagon, McGregor came out swinging with his left hook, which caught Poirier off guard and sent him sprawling to the ground. Poirier quickly recovered and got back to his feet, but McGregor continued to dominate the fight, landing several powerful punches and kicks.

With only seconds remaining in the first round, it seemed like Poirier was on the brink of defeat when he finally managed to land a well-placed left hook that knocked McGregor out cold. The crowd went wild as Poirier celebrated his victory, while McGregor lay unconscious on the ground.

The fight lasted just 3 minutes and 10 seconds, but it was a highly entertaining spectacle that showcased the skills of two talented fighters. With his loss to Poirier, McGregor's seemingly inexorable rise in MMA came to a halt for now, but he is sure to continue fighting at the highest level in the sport.
