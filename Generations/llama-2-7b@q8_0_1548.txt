### Explanation:

In the above sentence, we can see that there is a subject and object present in the sentence. The verb is **blood** which is past tense and thus we need to use _oozed_. And also you can see that the preposition is _from_ which should be followed by a noun not a pronoun (me). So we will use _his_ here as subject is already used.
