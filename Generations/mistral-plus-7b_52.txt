When comedian Stephen Colbert won a naming contest sponsored by NASA, the agency had to decide what to do. They decided that they would give in to his request and rename the newest module of the International Space Station after him. The new module was christened the "Colbert Module," and it has become a popular tourist attraction for astronauts visiting the station. It has also provided an opportunity for Colbert to continue his comedic stylings, poking fun at NASA and its mission.
