A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted at her own reflection in a Christmas photo.

Kelly Burton, 27, of South Wales, weighed 18 stone when she saw herself in a family snap on December 19, 2012 - and was horrified by what she saw.

The mother-of-one had previously been morbidly obese, but after the photo she vowed to slim down for her son.

She managed to shed more than half her body weight through a combination of diet and exercise and now weighs just 8st 4lb.

Kelly said: 'When I saw that picture I was disgusted with myself, it made me realise that something had to be done.'
