I have been reading over your article about Emma Thompson’s comments on aging. I am sorry to hear that she has experienced such things in her career but this is not new news to me. I was born in 1964 and so my whole life I have heard stories of people, mostly women, being discriminated against for their age. I have witnessed it first hand with family members and friends who have been told that they are too old for a certain role or project and then replaced with someone younger. It is very sad to hear but not surprising.

The article also mentions that Emma Thompson was asked if she would ever consider having work done on her face in order to stay looking young. She responded by saying “I’ve had Botox once, and I looked like Joan Rivers, so I thought: ‘What have you done?’ I don’t want anything like that again.”

I think this is a very honest answer from Emma Thompson and it makes me wonder what other actresses or actors would say if they were asked the same question. Would they lie about having had work done in order to look younger? Or would they be truthful like Emma Thompson was? It’s hard for me not to think that there are many people who have had work done but don’t want anyone else knowing about it because then they might get judged for being vain or shallow.

The article also talks about how Emma Thompson thinks that women should not be pressured into looking good all the time and how we shouldn’t care so much about our appearance at such an old age as hers (she is currently 58). I agree with her on this point because I think it would make life easier for everyone if we could just focus on being ourselves instead of trying so hard to please others by looking perfect all the time!
