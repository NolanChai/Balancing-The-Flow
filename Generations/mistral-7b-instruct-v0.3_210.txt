 It seems like you've shared a news headline about a meeting between President Obama and top congressional leaders to discuss the situation in Afghanistan, which is reportedly at a critical juncture. This is indeed an important issue, and it's crucial for political leaders to work together to make informed decisions that can positively impact the lives of many people involved.

If you have specific questions or topics related to this meeting or the situation in Afghanistan, I'd be happy to help explain or discuss them with you! For example, we could discuss the potential reasons behind the "tipping point" mentioned in the headline, what options might be on the table for U.S. policymakers, and how these decisions could affect the region as a whole. Let me know if that sounds interesting to you, or if there's something else you'd like to explore!
