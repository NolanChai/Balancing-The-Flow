The Supreme Court has ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in two major decisions in 2013. In United States v. Windsor, the Court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that denied federal recognition and benefits to married same-sex couples. In Hollingsworth v. Perry, the Court allowed same-sex marriages to resume in California after a ban was overturned by a lower court. Both decisions were a major step forward for LGBT rights in the United States, extending equal protection under the law to same-sex couples.
