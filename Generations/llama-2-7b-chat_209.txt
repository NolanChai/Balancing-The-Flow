Lauren Thomas, 28, of Llanelli, had been struggling with her weight for years, trying every fad diet and exercise regime under the sun. But it wasn't until she was mistaken for her own mother on Facebook that something finally clicked. A friend had tagged Lauren in a post, thinking she was her mother, and when Lauren saw the comment, she couldn't help but burst out laughing. But then something unexpected happened - Lauren felt a surge of determination. She realized that if she could be mistaken for her own mother at 28 years old, then she must have been living in denial about her weight for far too long. So, she decided to take action and start making serious changes to her lifestyle. And the results were nothing short of amazing. In just 10 months, Lauren shed an incredible 10st, going from a size 26 to a size 14. She now feels confident, healthy and happy, and she's loving every minute of it.
