Obesity is one of the most serious health problems of our time, affecting 15% to 20 % of adults worldwide. 
A common cause is high-calorie, low-nutrient food and lack of exercise. Obesity increases a personâ€™s risk for heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and some types of cancer, as well as causing joint pain, sleep apnea, poor self-esteem and depression.

In the new research from Harvard Medical School scientists have found that switching on a gene in our fat cells could help people shed pounds. They said their finding may lead to treatments for obesity.

The gene is called PGC1alpha and is thought to play an important role in energy metabolism. 
The researchers discovered that mice who had the gene switched off gained more weight than control mice.  
They also found that the switch could reverse some of the health effects of obesity in the animals, including reducing cholesterol levels and blood sugar as well as boosting their energy and improving insulin sensitivity. 
This may suggest a possible way to treat obesity, they said.
