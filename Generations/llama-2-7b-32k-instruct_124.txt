Television stars from Colombia have been filmed fighting with Brazilians, with plates being thrown across a restaurant as both countries count down to their quarter final clash in Fortaleza. The incident has sparked outrage on social media, with many people expressing their disgust at the behavior of both sides and calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. 
The argument began when two Brazilians made fun of some Colombian men who were eating at the restaurant, prompting one of them to throw a plate against the wall in anger. The Brazilians then started filming the altercation, which led to a shoving match between the two groups. 
The police arrived on the scene and tried to break up the fight, but it was not immediately clear if they were able to resolve the situation peacefully.

The incident has sparked outrage on social media, with many people expressing their disgust at the behavior of both sides and calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

The incident has sparked outrage on social media, with many people expressing their disgust at the behavior of both sides and calling for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. 
It is not known if any further action will be taken in regard to the incident, but it is clear that both countries should take responsibility for their actions and work towards promoting tolerance and understanding between nations. The Colombian men who threw the plate and the Brazilians who made fun of them should take responsibility for their actions and try to make amends with each other.
