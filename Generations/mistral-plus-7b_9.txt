Workers digging an underground garage for a new hotel recently struck something big about 30 feet below the surface. The workers found a collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts, including mummified remains and sarcophagi that date back thousands of years. Archaeologists were called to the scene to carefully remove the artifacts from the site and transport them to a museum for further study and preservation. This is an incredibly rare find, as most intact tombs have already been discovered, so this was truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the archaeologists involved.
