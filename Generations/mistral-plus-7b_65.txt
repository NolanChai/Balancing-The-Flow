Federal firearms agents in Arizona have expressed concerns about the large number of weapons that are being smuggled across the border from the United States to Mexico. These agents have stated that they cringe every time they hear about a shooting involving one of these guns, as it is a constant reminder of their failure to stop the flow of illegal firearms into Mexico. They feel responsible for allowing these weapons to pass through their hands and into the hands of criminals, and are deeply saddened by the violence and destruction that these guns cause.
