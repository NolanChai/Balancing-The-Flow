This is not a story. It's an announcement about upcoming talks in Ethiopia. The "story" here is that Machar has agreed to attend these talks. This can be seen in the next paragraph of the article, which says, "The two sides have been battling since December, when fighting erupted between Kiirâ€™s forces and those loyal to Riek Machar, who was sacked as vice president last July."
