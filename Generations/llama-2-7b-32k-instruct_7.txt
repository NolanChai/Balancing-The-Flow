It's one very, very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind. Around 800 common ants, usually found pattering across pavements and picnics, have been sent to the International Space Station as part of an experiment that could pave the way for space exploration by other insects . The ants are being kept in small containers aboard a Russian capsule which arrived at the space station on Wednesday. The ants will be tested under micro - gravity conditions, and it is hoped they can provide new insight into the life of colonies living away from Earth . "A lot of people like to say insects are lowly creatures," said Chris Colwell, a biologist at Tufts University in Boston, Massachusetts. "But ants have evolved some really extraordinary ways for themselves to live together and survive." He is part of the Ant Farms team which developed a way to take ants into space .

"This study could provide new insights into how colonies are organized, how they function and what conditions in space would be like for them," said Yana Volkov, head of the Ant Farms group. The mission has already begun with the release of 120 black carpenter ants from another capsule which docked at the space station on December 8 . Their containers will remain aboard the orbiting laboratory until the end of January for tests and research to take place before they return home . They have been joined by a further 600 white-footed ants. The Ant Farms team has been experimenting with insects in space since 2015, and said its first attempts showed that bugs could adapt well to micro - gravity conditions . "We actually found that insects were quite resilient," Volkov told AFP . "They adapted pretty quickly." Since then, the group has used ants to study how they sense their environment under weightlessness, how they deal with extreme temperatures, and whether ant communities can be managed in space. The Ant Farms team said it hoped its research would lead to future insect missions, including some which could explore Mars . "We have been studying insects for the past 40 years," Volkov told AFP. "Our goal is to develop this technology that will allow us to use insects as a spacecraft."
