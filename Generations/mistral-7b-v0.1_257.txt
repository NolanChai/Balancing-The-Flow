I think it is a very sad story. I agree with the article that drugs are very dangerous and they can destroy peoples life. In this case, the officer was forced to take heroin for the sake of his job but later became addicted. This shows that even professionals like police officers are not immune to drug addiction. It also shows how important it is to educate people about the dangers of drugs so that they can make informed decisions about their use.
