 This article discusses the idea that libraries should pay authors a fair sum each time they lend out an e-book in order to prevent authors from going bankrupt. The argument is based on the idea that e-books have lower overhead costs than traditional physical books and therefore should be able to command higher prices. However, some critics argue that this could lead to higher prices for readers and a lack of diversity in e-books available at libraries. It also raises questions about who should pay for the royalties on e-books and whether it is fair for authors to receive less money if their books are lent out frequently. Overall, the article raises important considerations for both libraries and authors when it comes to e-book lending practices.
