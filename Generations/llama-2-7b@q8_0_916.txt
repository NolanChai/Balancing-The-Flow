```python
import os
from io import open
os.chdir(r'C:\Users\Jiang\Documents')
pig_dna = open('sample.txt', 'r').read()  # Read the file
pig_dna = pig_dna[1:-1]                     # Remove all line breaks but the last
genome_length, n_letters = len(pig_dna), sum([char for char in pig_dna])   # Get genome length and number of letters
number_of_blocks, block_size = divmod(n_letters, 3)                          # Calculate the number of blocks and the size of a single block
for i in range(1, number_of_blocks):                                           # Generate all possible bases in each block
    genome_string += pig_dna[i * (number_of_blocks - 2) // 2: i * (number_of_blocks - 2) + block_size]
```
