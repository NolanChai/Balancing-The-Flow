By Alex Finnis for MailOnline -------------- A young Liberian boy who captured hearts worldwide by dancing in his hospital bed during the Ebola outbreak has made a miraculous recovery, doctors announced today. Just 17 years old when he contracted the deadly disease, Emmanuel was one of the youngest patients to fall ill with Ebola in Liberia's capital Monrovia last year. Despite being wracked by fever and vomiting, the resilient teenager found solace in dance - twirling and leaping in his hospital bed with a broad smile on his face, bringing joy to fellow patients and medical staff alike. As he fought off the virus, Emmanuel's infectious energy and love of life inspired hope and gratitude among those around him, and his remarkable recovery has been hailed as a beacon of hope in the fight against Ebola.
