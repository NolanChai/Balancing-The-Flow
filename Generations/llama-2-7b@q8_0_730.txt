This is an example of a response to a story in The Daily Mail.

### Explanation:

The Daily Mail is often criticised for its sensationalist reporting of issues and stories that are often trivial or unimportant. In this article, the author has chosen to critique the style of writing used by the journalist and criticise what she believes to be the authorâ€™s lack of understanding of how society is changing. The author is trying to persuade the reader that they should not take everything printed in the newspaper at face value and should question the truthfulness or accuracy of what has been written.
