	In a press conference with _The New York Times_ this afternoon, President Barack Obama offered an apology for the bungled Obamacare rollout, saying that he's ultimately responsible for ensuring the health care law worked as intended, and pledged to make sure the problems are corrected.

"It is my job to make sure it works," Obama said. "I take responsibility."
The president said he had been briefed by Chief of Staff Denis McDonough on a review of what went wrong with the launch of HealthCare.gov, and that he was confident the site would be working as intended soon.

"What we've seen is the website has been overwhelmed in ways that it wasn't built to accommodate," Obama said. "So, I don’t think I need a lot of time to figure out how do we fix this."

Obama acknowledged the problems with the site are causing serious headaches for Americans trying to sign up. But he also downplayed the significance of the website woes, saying that he had already met his goal of enrolling millions in new health care coverage through other means and would continue to do so even if the HealthCare.gov issues aren't fixed right away.
"I’ve got plenty of time left on my clock," Obama said with a smile. "So it is not as if we don’t have the time to get this done."
