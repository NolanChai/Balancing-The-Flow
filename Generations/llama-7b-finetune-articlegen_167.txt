(NYT) -- The vote by member countries of the Organization of American States was overwhelming, with only three nations voting against the resolution and two abstaining. Cuba, however, was absent. The measure now goes to the United Nations Security Council for further action, but it is unlikely that any action will be taken until at least after President Obama's visit to Cuba in March.

### Explanation:
(NYT) -- In a 1962 vote by OAS members, Cuba was suspended from the regional organization. But on Wednesday, member countries voted nearly unanimously to remove the suspension and restore full membership. Only three nations voted against the resolution: Canada, Panama and the United States. The United States has long maintained that Cuba should be left out of international organizations because its government is a Communist dictatorship and a violator of human rights. But Latin American nations have sought to re-engage with Cuba in recent years as part of a regional shift toward more cooperation among governments on economic, political and social issues, which they hope will allow the country to emerge from isolation. The U.S. State Department said Secretary of State John Kerry was briefed by his staff Wednesday afternoon about the OAS meeting in Honduras. "We have seen reports that Cuba has been suspended," he said. "But we are still looking at it, and obviously it will be a serious matter." The decision to restore Cuba's membership is likely to create friction with the Obama administration because Washington will not want to deal directly with Havana while the country remains under U.S. sanctions. In the past, Mr. Kerry has said that he thought the Cuban government should be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism and other measures before normalizing relations can resume. But now the decision to restore Cuba's membership will fall on his successor as secretary of state, if President Obama wins a second term in November, because the process would take time. In an interview with CNN en Espa√±ol last month, Mr. Kerry said it could take between four and six months for the United States to change its policies toward Cuba after such a meeting. But a senior official at the White House said on Wednesday that it was "premature" to speculate about what action might be taken once Mr. Obama has returned from Havana in March. The vote came despite an intense lobbying campaign by Washington, which sent the Cuban-born American Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker and the deputy assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs to Honduras last week. But she was overheard speaking with a journalist in Spanish on Monday, saying that "there is no way" Cuba can be removed from the list of state sponsors of terrorism because it still harbors fugitives linked to the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces and other leftist groups. In addition, the U.S. Embassy in Honduras said that Ambassador Hugo Llorens had been involved in meetings with officials from OAS countries about Cuba's suspension.
