 The talks, scheduled for August 21-23 in Ethiopia, are being facilitated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), an African union. "The parties have agreed that the cessation of hostilities must be the first step towards peace and stability in South Sudan," said David Shearer, UN special representative to South Sudan.

Shearer also told CNN that the talks would focus on addressing key issues that have been driving the conflict in the country since 2013. These include power sharing, security arrangements, and the rebuilding of the shattered economy.

"The talks will be challenging," said Shearer. "But if the parties are serious about finding a lasting solution to this crisis, they have an opportunity to make progress."
