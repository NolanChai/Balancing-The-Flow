I don't like it either, but I support this bill because I have sworn an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic and I will do my part. If there are those in government who are truly concerned that we could be violating the constitutional rights of Americans, then they need to bring their complaints directly to Congress or to a court of law and not try to obstruct the process through executive action.
