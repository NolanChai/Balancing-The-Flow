### Output:
```
The video showed Pedro Hernandez walking up to a table where the boy was sitting and choking him, according to sources familiar with the tape. The child never screamed or uttered a sound during the attack, they said.

It is unclear if the footage was captured on surveillance cameras or by an officer. The NYPD declined to comment.

The video was shown to Hernandez and his lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, at a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court last week.
