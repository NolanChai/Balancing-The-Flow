A Norwegian man plunged 1,000 feet to his death when his parachute failed to open after he struck a tree while skydiving. The man, who has been identified as 34-year-old Bjorn Oen, was reportedly practicing for the national skydiving championships at the time of the accident. He had just jumped from an airplane at 10,500 feet when he struck a tree shortly thereafter. Although his parachute deployed after impact, it did not open properly and failed to slow his fall. Oen was found dead on the ground about 1,000 feet away from the site of the accident.

The accident is currently under investigation by Norwegian authorities in an attempt to determine what caused the malfunction.
