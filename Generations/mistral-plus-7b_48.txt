Fidel Castro, the former leader of Cuba, has lashed out at US President Barack Obama for demanding changes on the island in order to improve bilateral relations. In an interview with the state-run Cuban newspaper Granma, Castro referred to Obama as "stupid" and accused him of acting like a dictator.

Castro's comments come in response to a speech that Obama delivered earlier this week in which he called for greater freedom and human rights on the island. In his remarks, Obama said that it was time for Cuba to open up and allow its people to express their opinions freely without fear of reprisal. He also urged the Cuban government to release political prisoners and allow for more press freedom.

Castro responded by calling Obama's demands "impertinent" and accusing him of trying to impose his own values on Cuba. He went on to say that the United States has no right to tell Cuba how to run its affairs and that Cubans will continue to live their lives as they see fit.
