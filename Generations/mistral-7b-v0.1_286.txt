It looks like the price advertising rule is being implemented in a way that could potentially hurt the company. The company's stock price fell by 10% after the announcement of the rule, and it seems that investors are concerned about the impact this will have on Spirit Airlines' bottom line. If customers are no longer able to compare prices between airlines when booking flights, they may be less likely to choose Spirit Airlines as their carrier. This could lead to decreased revenues for the company. Additionally, if competitors start offering lower fares, it could further erode Spirit Airlines' market share. Overall, it seems that the new price advertising rule is not in the best interest of Spirit Airlines or its investors.
