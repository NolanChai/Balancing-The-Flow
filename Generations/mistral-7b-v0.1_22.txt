So it looks like we're gonna do a series of mini-projects for this one, each one with its own repo.

1) I created an index page that lists some basic facts about the Bible and Christianity.  It also has a quote from the Bible on it.

2) I created another page using some HTML and CSS to make a simple cross.

3) I started learning about Javascript (with the help of [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)).  The first thing I did was create a simple "hello world" page.  Then, I used Javascript to change the color of my cross on my second page.

4) I created a page with a form that allows users to enter their name and email address.  The form then sends an email to me.

5) I added some buttons that allow users to toggle between the three pages I've made so far.

6) I started learning about Github.

7) I created a README file for my first project.

8) I created a Git repository on GitHub and linked it to my local repository.

9) I pushed my local repository to my remote repository on GitHub.

10) I made some changes in my local repository and then pulled them into my remote repository.  Then, I pushed them to the master branch of my project.

11) I created a second project and pushed it up to my remote repository.

12) I added the two repositories from my first project to my portfolio page on GitHub.

13) I made some changes in my local repository and then pulled them into my remote repository.  Then, I pushed them to the master branch of my project.

14) I created a third project and pushed it up to my remote repository.

### Challenges:
- Learning how to use Github was difficult at first, but once I got the hang of it, it wasn't too bad.
- Getting my projects to work properly took some trial and error.  There were a few times when I thought I had things working correctly, only to find out that there was still something wrong.
- Creating the buttons that allowed users to toggle between pages was challenging, but I eventually figured it out.
