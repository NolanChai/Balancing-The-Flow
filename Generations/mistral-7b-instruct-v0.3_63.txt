A benefits cheat who claimed to be wheelchair-bound is facing a hefty jail sentence after swindling £1,063.45 in disability living allowance (DLA) payments.

The fraudulent individual, identified only as Mrs. A, was found guilty of falsely claiming DLA for over 14 years by the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Benefits Service after an investigation revealed that she had been able to walk without assistance during that time.

Mrs. A had initially made her claim in 1998, stating that she required a wheelchair to move around due to back problems and arthritis. However, investigators uncovered CCTV footage showing her walking unaided in various locations over the course of many years.

Prosecutor Paul Anderson said: "The defendant's deceit has been going on for 14 years. She provided false information to claim DLA and continued to do so while being under investigation."

"We are pleased that Mrs. A has been found guilty of fraud, and we hope this serves as a warning to others who may consider committing similar offenses," said a spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).

The case is now in the hands of the courts, where Mrs. A faces up to two years imprisonment or a fine when she is sentenced later this year.

This conviction highlights the importance of the government's ongoing efforts to combat benefit fraud and ensure that public funds are used only for their intended purpose – supporting those who genuinely require assistance.
