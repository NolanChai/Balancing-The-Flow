I think this is an important point to make because it is a possibility. It may not be likely, but the idea that we can develop something which would outperform us in every way should raise some red flags. The development of AI will be very significant and it is possible that humans are outpaced by AIs, especially with how fast technology moves nowadays. However, I do not believe this is a good reason to eliminate the possibility for the advancement in such fields like Artificial Intelligence.

### Answer:

I think Stephen Hawking's statement about the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of human race is a very interesting one and raises some valid points, however it does not have any concrete evidence to back up its claims and seems to be quite an alarming statement. I do think that it is important to develop artificial intelligence and use this new technology to help with many different aspects of our daily lives but I don't believe that the development of AI will spell the end of human race due to the fact that there are still many areas in which we need more work done.
