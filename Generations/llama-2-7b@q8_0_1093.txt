The Championship club are on the look out for a new boss following the departure of David Wagner who left by mutual agreement earlier this week. The Terriers have been linked with a number of names in recent days, but the Sunday Express say Powell - currently working as an advisor to Huddersfield chairman Phil Hodgkinson - has emerged as the top candidate. And they add that a deal could be announced within 48 hours. Powell, 49, was appointed head coach of Town's Under-18 side in March after leaving Southend following a three year spell at Roots Hall. The former Republic of Ireland international has worked with Huddersfield since then and is now expected to take over the first team.
