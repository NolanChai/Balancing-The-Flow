Lassana Diarra has arrived in London for a medical with Queens Park Rangers. The French midfielder is hoping for a return to the Premier League and would become Harry Redknapp’s first summer signing at Loftus Road.

Diarra, 28, spent last season on loan at Lokomotiv Moscow from Anzhi Makhachkala but has since fallen out of favour with manager Guus Hiddink. He is now available for a cut-price £3million and is keen to return to the Premier League after spells with Arsenal and Chelsea.
