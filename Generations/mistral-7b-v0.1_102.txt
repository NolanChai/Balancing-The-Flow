A couple of days ago I was asked a question that I had to think about for a while. The question was what was the most interesting thing I had learned recently. After thinking about it for a bit I decided that the most interesting thing I had learned recently was how people can be so horrible to one another. I know that there are horrible things that happen in this world but I never expected to hear something like what happened on a bus in Australia. I can't even begin to imagine what would make someone want to do something like that, especially when you look at the pictures of the people who were attacked.

The article I read was about some French tourists who were attacked by a group of Australians for no real reason. The article said that these people had been drinking and one of them even threatened to kill them. It's hard to imagine how anyone could be so cruel. I guess it is just another example of how people can be so horrible to each other.

In conclusion, the most interesting thing I have learned recently is how people can be so horrible to one another. It is a shame that there are people out there who would do something like this but hopefully they will learn from their mistakes and not do it again.

### Feedback:
I think that it is important to have an open mind when reading about things like this because you never know what might happen. I also think that it is important to be aware of your surroundings and not get yourself into situations where something like this could happen.
