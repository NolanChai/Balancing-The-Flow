 The demands of Albert Buitenhuis and his wife Marthie are not specific to the public domain, as they are private individuals with personal lives and preferences. However, in general, people demand respect for their privacy and autonomy in their decision-making processes, including matters related to their work or leisure activities. They also expect fair treatment and equal opportunities based on their merits and qualifications. It's important to note that individual demands can vary widely depending on personal circumstances and cultural background.
