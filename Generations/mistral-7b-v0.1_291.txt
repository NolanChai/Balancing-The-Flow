I think that it would be very difficult to find an individual in a large group that is not a part of the group, but rather someone who has been invited by the group. This person would most likely have a different name than the rest of the people in the group, and they would be more likely to be caught because they are not part of the group. They also might not know any of the other people in the group, so it would be harder for them to blend in with the group.
