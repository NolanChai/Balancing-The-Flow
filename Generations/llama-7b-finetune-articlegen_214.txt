Sam Cottam, 13, managed to hook and lift into his boat the behemoth fish after it leapt from a lake on the school field in Eccles, near Manchester. Sam, who was fishing with friend Joe Smith, 14, told how he had only been hoping for 'something small' when he cast off. 'I managed to hook it straight away,' he said. 'It kept going further and further into the water but we thought we were dealing with a pike.' But as Sam tugged at his rod, he realised this was no common fish. 'The line started getting pulled underwater more and more,' Joe added. 'We didn't know what it was at first.' Eventually the 20lb catfish made an appearance . 'When we got it to the boat I thought 'I can't believe we've caught that!' said Sam, from Eccles. 'It looked like a dinosaur coming out of the water - it was huge.' The two pals managed to get a picture and estimated the fish's length at 8ft (2.4m), making it as long as a grown man. Sam and Joe weighed their catch on the scales but it had gone back into the water by then so they don't know how big it actually is. It was estimated that the monster catfish could have weighed in at up to 50lb . Joe said: 'It's such a big fish - it would have been really heavy.' The teenagers' achievement was also made more impressive because they were using light-weight rods and line. Sam, from Eccles, Greater Manchester, has only fished for about two years and has never caught anything this huge. The schoolboy said the fish's head alone weighed more than his boxing opponent . He had been using a 10ft rod with line that was half an inch thick - too light to catch such a big fish, Joe said. They managed to land the catfish after it leapt from the water and they only knew what they were dealing with once it came up. Sam said: 'I didn't think we would actually get anything but when I saw that huge head coming out of the water it was amazing.' He said his father had been fishing for years without catching a fish as big. His achievement has been hailed on Facebook, where hundreds have congratulated him for landing such an impressive creature. Joe said: 'When we pulled it into the boat people were clapping and cheering because they couldn't believe what we had caught.' The pair have since taken their prize catch to a local fishmonger who filleted it but no pictures have been released as yet of Sam with his giant catfish, which could have weighed in at up to 50lb.
