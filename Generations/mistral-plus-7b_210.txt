President Barack Obama will meet with the leaders of Congress on Tuesday to discuss a possible turning point in the war in Afghanistan. The meeting comes as the Taliban and other militant groups continue their relentless attacks against US and NATO forces, and as the administration faces increasing pressure to decide whether to send more troops to Afghanistan or begin withdrawing them.

The White House said Obama will meet with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, along with Republican leader Mitch McConnell and John Boehner. The meeting will take place at 10:05 AM ET on Tuesday, March 30th.

Obama has been under increasing pressure to make a decision about sending more troops to Afghanistan. He is expected to announce his decision in the next few weeks.
