Formula One is set to make its highly anticipated return to the United States in 2012 with a new race in Texas. After months of negotiations, Formula One officials and representatives from the Circuit of the Americas announced an agreement Wednesday that will bring the world's most prestigious racing series back to North America for the first time since 2007.
The deal calls for the construction of a brand-new race track in Austin, Texas, which will host its inaugural Grand Prix event on November 18, 2012. The circuit is expected to be one of the most challenging on the Formula One calendar, featuring a series of twists and turns that will test drivers' skill and concentration.
Formula One Chairman Bernie Ecclestone expressed his enthusiasm for the new race, saying that it would be a great addition to the sport. "We are delighted to be returning to the United States with a brand-new Grand Prix in Austin," he said. "It is an exciting prospect for Formula One and we are confident that this will be one of the most popular races on the calendar."
The new race track will be built on a 1,025-acre site near Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. The facility will include a grandstand seating up to 120,000 spectators, as well as pit and paddock areas, hospitality suites, corporate facilities, and a state-of-the-art media center. In addition to the race track, the Circuit of the Americas development will also include a hotel, retail space, restaurants, and other amenities.
