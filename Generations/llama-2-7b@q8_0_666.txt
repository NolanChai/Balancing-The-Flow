### Explanation:

#### 1) We will do this by introducing a blood test for oestrogen receptors that we believe will give us early information about whether patients need to have surgery or chemotherapy, or just observation."
#### 2) In the first two years of the study there will be a recruitment period. During this time women who meet the criteria and are eligible for the trial will take part in a series of tests (including blood tests). The test results will be assessed to see whether the patient qualifies for chemotherapy or if they should just be given drugs that block oestrogen's activity.
#### 3) "During this time we would like to get as much information from our patients about their experience of having a diagnosis and being referred on to secondary care, and how this might affect them later on in terms of quality of life and coping with the disease."
#### 4) A total of 10,809 women were invited to take part. Of these, 276 (3%) declined or did not respond, giving a participation rate of 89%.
#### 5) "A total of 213 patients withdrew from the study. The most common reason was that they were unable to undergo the tests required."
#### 6) In a randomised controlled trial, researchers recruited and followed up 7,594 women with invasive breast cancer (stage 1-III), aged over 50 years. Eligible patients were randomly allocated by telephone to receive chemotherapy or endocrine therapy only on the basis of two oestrogen receptor tests at time of diagnosis.
#### 7) Of these, 626 (9%) declined and 384 withdrew from the study, mainly due to disease progression.
#### 8) "The results were better than expected."
#### 9) After three years' follow-up, there was no significant difference in breast cancer specific survival between the two groups (relative risk [RR] = 0.72; 95% CI: 0.48 to 1.06).
### Key Points:
* The most common reason for women to withdraw from a clinical trial was that they were unable to undergo the tests required.
