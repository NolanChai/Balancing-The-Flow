The Colombian health authorities said on Tuesday that they had found no direct connection between the deaths and the use of Gardasil, which has been blamed for other illnesses in 30 countries. “I am convinced we’ll find no link,” said Carlos Esguerra, secretary-general of Colombia’s health ministry, who added that the government would continue investigating what is causing the girls to fall seriously ill.
The Colombian Ministry of Health has released a statement confirming that there was no connection between the illnesses and Gardasil.
