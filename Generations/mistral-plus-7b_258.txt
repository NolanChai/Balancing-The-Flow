President Barack Obama took to the podium for Thursdayâ€™s news conference/cum-mea culpa on the disastrous Obamacare roll out, acknowledging that he had failed in his leadership of the Affordable Care Act implementation process and that it was up to him to fix the problem. In a candid and humble speech, the president admitted that he had let down the American people with his handling of the launch of HealthCare.gov and that he would do whatever was necessary to make things right. He promised to get to the bottom of what went wrong and ensure that it never happens again.
