 That's correct! On May 7, 2014, New York Yankees starting pitcher Michael Pineda was found to have pine tar on his neck during a game against the Boston Red Sox. As a result, Major League Baseball suspended him for 10 games. Pine tar is sometimes used by pitchers to improve their grip on the ball, but it's only legal when applied to the rosin bag. When applied elsewhere, like on the pitcher's hand or neck, it can give an unfair advantage and is considered a violation of MLB rules.
