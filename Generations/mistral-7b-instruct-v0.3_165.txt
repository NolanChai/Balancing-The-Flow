 That's correct! In 2013, the Supreme Court made two significant rulings regarding same-sex marriage.

1. The first ruling was on the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). In United States v. Windsor, the court ruled that Section 3 of DOMA, which defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman for purposes of federal law, violated the Fifth Amendment's equal protection clause. This decision meant that legally married same-sex couples would now be treated equally under federal law when it comes to more than 1000 federal laws and programs related to areas such as taxes, Social Security, and immigration.

2. The second ruling was in Hollingsworth v. Perry. Although the court did not rule on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage itself, it allowed a lower court's decision that had previously struck down California's Proposition 8 (which had banned same-sex marriage) to stand. This decision effectively allowed same-sex marriages to resume in California.

These rulings were major milestones in the fight for marriage equality in the United States. However, it's important to note that while these decisions apply federally and in some states, the rights of same-sex couples to marry vary by state. In fact, it wasn't until June 26, 2015, that the Supreme Court would issue another ruling (Obergefell v. Hodges) making same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States.
