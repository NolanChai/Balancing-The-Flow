 The recall includes a variety of models, including the 5 Series, 3 Series, X3, X5 and X7. It follows reports that the airbags in some BMW vehicles may not deploy properly in certain crashes.

BMW said it is taking the action "out of an abundance of caution" and that there have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to the issue. The company is offering free inspections and repairs for affected vehicles.

The recall affects BMW models produced between May 2016 and November 2020. BMW said it has identified a potential problem with the airbag inflators in some of its cars, which may cause the airbags to deploy at an incorrect speed or height.

BMW said it is working closely with suppliers and regulatory authorities to resolve the issue as quickly as possible. The company has not yet provided a timeline for when the repairs will be available.
