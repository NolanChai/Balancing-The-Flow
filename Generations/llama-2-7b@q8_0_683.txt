We wish we had more time with you. We will cherish all the memories forever. You were wonderful neighbours, friends and mentors. You taught us that it is okay to be yourself, even when surrounded by people who are trying to change you into someone else. The world would be a better place if everyone had your humility and patience. Thank you for being an inspiration to all of us and we love you very much ❤️
