The draw for the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 has pitted Spanish giants Real Madrid against Premier League leaders Manchester United, while Barcelona will face Italian champions AC Milan in the competition's next stage.

Real Madrid's progression into the last 16 was far from convincing as they finished second in Group G behind Borussia Dortmund. However, Cristiano Ronaldo and his teammates will still start as favorites against a Manchester United side that has struggled at times this season.

Barcelona, meanwhile, won all six of their group games to secure top spot in Group F ahead of FC Bayer Leverkusen. They face an AC Milan side that has shown signs of improvement since Massimiliano Allegri took over as coach in January.
