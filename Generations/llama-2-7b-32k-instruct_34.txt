1840s and 1850s - A man's suit was worn with a vest or waistcoat (called a "weskit") over a shirt, which had detachable sleeves called "rubbands." Both the waistcoat and rubbands were considered outer garments. The cravat or neck-tie was used as an undergarment to hold the collar of a man's shirt in place (see Figure 4).
In 1860, the "cravat" had evolved into a knotted tie with two points on the chest called a wing collar. The waistcoat was replaced by a frock coat and tails; this would become known as the "dinner jacket".
By the time of World War I in 1914, evening wear had become simpler with just a shirt, trousers and waistcoat or cummerbund. Women wore evening gowns and men wore tuxedos. At this time, the dinner jacket was also called a "dinner suit".
By the mid-20th century, evening wear became simpler still; both men and women would wear a single color dress or tuxedo with minimal accessories like stud earrings, cufflinks, and a plain watch. Today, most people simply refer to the evening dress as "tuxedos" for men, or "dresses" for women.
