Aaron Wan - Bissaka is now the most expensive defender in the world after Manchester United agreed to sign him on Friday morning for #50million . 
The 21-year-old right back was outstanding for Crystal Palace last season and attracted interest from several other clubs, including Newcastle, Southampton and Everton. But it is Old Trafford who have secured his services with a five-year deal . 
United's club-record move for the former Sunderland man signals that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is prepared to pay top dollar to build his defence following an error - strewn display in last season's 3-1 defeat at Brentford. 
Bruno Fernandes will be the next arrival at Old Trafford but there are still plenty of positions up for grabs this summer . United have been linked with a move for Jadon Sancho, Raphael Varane, Nathaniel Clyne and Alex Telles but Wan - Bissaka's deal could be the first sign that Solskjaer is beginning to deliver on his promises. 
United are also close to completing deals for Donny van der Beek from Ajax and Edinson Cavani from Paris St Germain . Van der Beek has already completed a medical after his move collapsed last summer, while Cavani was spotted in Manchester this weekend. 
Solskjaer's rebuilding job will take time but he is already making serious progress by targeting such exciting players and the fact that they are agreeing to join United rather than other clubs shows how well he is selling the vision at Old Trafford.
