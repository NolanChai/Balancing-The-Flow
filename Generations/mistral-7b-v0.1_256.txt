A 19-year-old man who is the son of the highest-ranking Central Intelligence Agency officer ever convicted of espionage was sentenced Tuesday to probation and community service for continuing his jailed father’s espionage activities.

Ryan David Adams, whose father, Harold, is serving a 27-year sentence after being found guilty in 2003 of selling U.S. government secrets to China, was sentenced to three years probation and 150 hours of community service. He was also ordered to pay $2,400 in restitution.

According to court documents, Adams had a briefcase that contained a number of CDs, each labeled with the name of an employee at the CIA who worked at the agency’s station in China between 1987 and 1993. Each CD contained the phone number, address and social security numbers of employees as well as their family members and other personal information.

Adams was arrested in November and pled guilty to a charge of unlawful disclosure of restricted data. He had been working at a computer store in Oregon where he was selling computers to Chinese nationals and providing them with his father’s old CIA identification card, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Portland.

The senior Adams was convicted on 12 counts of espionage for selling information about classified government programs to China while working at the agency between 1986 and 1994. The case is the highest-ranking espionage conviction ever upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Ryan Adams, who had worked as a computer technician at the same store where his father was arrested in 2001, pled guilty to a charge of unlawful disclosure of restricted data and agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation into espionage activities by his father.
