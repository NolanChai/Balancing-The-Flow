A Florida judge has punched a public defender who repeatedly interrupted his trial, according to local reports.

Brevard County Circuit Judge John C. Murphy is alleged to have lashed out at the lawyer after he was called before the bench for using a cell phone in court and questioning the judgeâ€™s competence.

Murphy reportedly told the defender to leave the courtroom immediately, but the man refused. The judge then punched the public defender in the face, according to a video of the incident that has surfaced on YouTube.

The defendant, who was not identified, was then led from the courtroom by several deputies.
