- The best response strategy would be to use the 'fire hydrant' approach in which water is sprayed directly at the source of the fire, such as where the flames are coming from or a room on the same floor that is burning. The 'water curtain' approach is used for fires with multiple floors and involves using ladders to extend a hose line up higher than the fire itself and direct it toward the roof.
### Question: 
- In what ways do fire hydrants reduce the amount of time it takes firefighters to extinguish a fire?
