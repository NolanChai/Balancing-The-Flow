Bent’s former club manager, Paul Lambert, spoke of a “breakdown in communication” after he was dropped by his new boss Roberto di Matteo during last weekend's defeat to Liverpool but said Bent was welcome back if he wanted to return to Aston Villa.

### Response:
Aston Villa are set to offer Darren Bent the chance to prove himself at Villa Park next season, with Paul Lambert ready to give him a fresh start despite the striker’s well-publicised problems with the former boss.

### Response:

Lambert has left Aston Villa by mutual consent after three-and-a-half years at the club and Darren Bent could be set for an emotional return to the Midlands club, according to reports in The Sun.
