France coach Didiier Deschamps was delighted with his side's showing at the Group E opener, and they will hope to repeat the same when they face Albania at Marseille on Saturday evening .

England played Switzerland to a goalless draw in a match that never really came alive but also contained few clear chances . The Swiss failed to take advantage of any openings, while England's lack of cutting edge was evident with only Raheem Sterling and Wayne Rooney offering the threat of goals.

Switzerland boss Vladimir Petkovic had said his side must "defend heroically" against England because they were unlikely to create too many chances . The visitors failed miserably at that, however, as they produced a performance more reminiscent of their 5-2 humbling by Germany in the last World Cup than a team that beat Ecuador and Haiti at home friendlies recently.

England had a couple of half-chances early on with Harry Kane firing over from distance and Sterling forcing Yann Sommer into an awkward save after being set up by Dele Alli . Switzerland, meanwhile, offered little in the way of offensive intent but did threaten when Valon Behrami's long ball found Haris Seferovic but he headed straight at Joe Hart.

The England goalkeeper was a busy man before half-time as Switzerland forced him into saves from Djibril Sow, Denis Zakaria and Stephan Lichtsteiner . The latter's shot came after some poor defending had allowed Valentin Stocker to get in down the right . Hart comfortably dealt with that save.

The match was slow-paced throughout but England improved at the start of the second half, Sterling twice going close to breaking the deadlock after being played onside by Seferovic and then beating Sommer after some neat interplay from Alli . The former came after a poor touch let Stocker off the hook, while Hart was alert to keep out Behrami's shot at his near post.

The visitors were dealt with relative ease by England during the closing stages as they struggled to break down an opposition who rarely ventured forward and failed to offer much in terms of a threat themselves . Hart saved from Stocker after he got on the end of a Valentin Amrhein cross but it was one of Switzerland's rare attacks.

England's lack of cutting edge up front was evident as Rooney, who came on for the final 19 minutes and made his 150th senior appearance for England in the match, failed to make an impact . It has not been a particularly fruitful tournament for the former Manchester United striker and he is likely to struggle to force his way into the lineup again.

Rooney's arrival brought a change of style with England moving forward more quickly but it did little to change their fortunes as they struggled to break down Switzerland . The hosts managed 24 shots on goal compared to four for their opponents, while Switzerland had five corner kicks to three for England.

England are next in action against Albania at Marseille and will be expected to win comfortably. Their lack of goalscoring prowess will still be a concern as they head into that match with their lack of cutting edge once again the issue.
