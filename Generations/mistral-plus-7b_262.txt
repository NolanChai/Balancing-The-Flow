An officer has died in violent clashes between police and anti-government protestors in Bangkok as the city braces for more unrest after a curfew was declared.

Thousands of demonstrators have continued to occupy parts of the Thai capital despite a government decree outlawing all protests in the area and banning gatherings of more than five people.

The decree came into effect at 6pm yesterday as authorities prepared for an expected anti-government rally by thousands of Red Shirt supporters today.
