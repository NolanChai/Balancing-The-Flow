The PS4 will be announced in the US at a press event on Feb. 20th. It's expected to go head-to-head with Microsoft's Xbox 720, which is also set to hit shelves later this year. The PS3 was released back in November 2006 and has sold over 85 million units worldwide since its launch . That puts it ahead of the Xbox 360, which has shifted a total of about 74 million consoles since its release. However, the PlayStation brand is clearly still going strong - even if sales figures for the current PS3 are dropping fast. As well as the new console itself, Sony will also show off the DualShock 4 controller at its event in New York on Feb. 20th. The controller features a new design with a larger touchpad and a built-in speaker . It will come bundled with every PS4 and has been specifically designed to work with the next generation console. A number of games have also been announced for the console so far, including:

* The Last of Us (also coming to PS3)
* God of War: Ascension
* Killzone: Mercenary
* Watch_Dogs
* inFAMOUS Second Son

Some sources are also suggesting that a new version of the PlayStation 3 will be announced alongside its newer sibling, although this is unconfirmed. If Sony does launch two consoles at once, it won't be alone: Nintendo recently launched an updated Wii U console with extra storage and other features, which has been dubbed the "Wii U Deluxe" or "Wii U 2".
