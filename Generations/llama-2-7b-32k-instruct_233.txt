Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his "I Have a Dream" speech . 

It was August of my nineteenth year, and I had arrived in the nation's capital for the March on Washington at the invitation of the National Urban League . My brother Robert was then serving as chairman of the NUL board of directors. One morning, as I sat before a desk in the headquarters office preparing for a day of meetings and events, one of the league's administrative assistants entered with news that the Rev. King would be in the building and would like to meet with me. "This is the man who wrote 'Letter from Birmingham Jail,'" she said excitedly . I recall looking up and seeing Dr. King walking down the hallway, accompanied by a small group of men, including his brother A.D., whom I had met at dinner on my first night in Washington. 
I stood when he reached the door of my office. He was handsome and slender; his hair was close-cropped, as if cut with an electric razor. When we shook hands, his grip was firm and confident . As soon as I began to speak, he interrupted me to say that he had read "Letter from Birmingham Jail" while in a Birmingham jail cell the previous April and wished to discuss it with me. 
I took him to my office, where we sat across a table from each other, and for half an hour or so talked about the civil rights movement, his leadership of the Montgomery bus boycott that had begun in December 1955, and how I came to write the letter . As our conversation was drawing to a close, Dr. King said, "Now you know what it is like to be me." His comment brought tears to my eyes, and his words have stayed with me throughout the years as an indication of how deeply he felt about the challenges and responsibilities of leadership . 
When the conversation was over, Dr. King asked if I would come to the Lincoln Memorial for the March on Washington later that day. When I said I would be honored, he smiled broadly and told me that my speech was needed there that afternoon as much as his own . As he left, he turned once more to look at me, then took a few steps away from the door before turning back again and saying, "I am not judgmental." 
Fifty years have passed since Dr. King's death in April 1968. When I think of him, I recall his face, the way he looked at me, how he spoke to me that day . The memory of our meeting gives me great strength and encouragement. I hope it does the same for you -- especially on this important anniversary.

(CNN) -- Fifty years ago, my father, who was then chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, brought me to Washington, D.C., for a speech that he gave at Howard University . On our way back home, he stopped off in Atlanta so I could meet someone special: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
It was August 1963 and we had just come from a meeting of the board of directors of the National Urban League at which my father had made an impassioned speech that got him arrested . We had spent a couple days in Washington before returning home, so we decided to take a break from the action. My father was invited by Dr. King to meet with him at the Montgomery, Alabama, house he shared with his brother A.D. 
I was an impressionable young man just out of college and deeply moved by my father's arrest . When I saw Dr. King in person, I was overwhelmed. Here was a man who spoke eloquently about the struggle for civil rights without any notes; he was a true intellectual giant. 
My father had spoken passionately against the Vietnam War, and I remember thinking how great it would be to have someone like Dr. King to speak out against that war -- though his time was not yet come . 
In the course of our conversation, I asked him why he was so opposed to the Vietnam War when there were other injustices in the world: lynching and racial discrimination, for example. He told me it would be easy to get drawn into a conflict that wasn't one's own; it was also dangerous because "there are some things you cannot compromise on." 
As I think about his response now, I am struck by how much he understood the need to focus on pressing domestic issues even as he dealt with foreign policy challenges . And yet, in focusing so strongly on those closer to home, we missed a huge opportunity. 
Fifty years later, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Acts of 1965 were landmark achievements that changed forever how African Americans could participate in American politics . However, we have failed to live up to the promise of those laws -- partly because of domestic issues neglected since that time. 
It is a sad commentary on our country's state of affairs today that we must spend much of our time talking about how to reform the criminal justice system and what it means to be African American in the United States . The reality of poverty, gun violence, mass incarceration and police brutality are all too real, and they have been with us for far too long. 
But we also must not lose sight of the fact that there are still people who believe in justice -- men like Dr. King . And now, more than ever, it is up to each one of us to carry on his legacy and work to make this a better country for all Americans.
