 That's right! According to the University of Florida's International Shark Attack File, there were 36 confirmed shark attacks worldwide in 2019, which is down from the five-year average of 53 attacks. However, the death toll from these attacks reached 14 people, which is the highest since 2015. This just goes to show how dangerous and unpredictable shark behavior can be, even when the number of attacks decreases.
