There are several different answers to this question, depending on how you define "information" (or in this case, the plural "informations").  If we just read it literally as a call for any piece of information that will lead to the arrest of someone for a crime, then there is only one possible answer:

> The location of the Cathedral.

It's pretty obvious who is going to be the person to get caught if they give this piece of information away: the Dean of the cathedral. 

### Justification:
The poster says that "it pays to talk".   This might seem like a call for any kind of information, but it's important to notice that they say that "it pays" — not that "it pays to give information." The implication is that it won't pay if you just hand over some random fact. 

The second clue is the phrase "easy cash".   They're not talking about a reward, they're offering money.  I can't think of any situation in which someone offers easy money for information unless they don't want to give that information away easily — or at all.

Finally, the poster doesn't say "give me" anything; it says "talk."  Giving up some information isn't really talking (except maybe a long monologue), but if you get someone talking then they might reveal important information that leads to their arrest.
