 s childhood showed her with her mother. The friend posted the picture on Facebook and captioned it "Looks like this little one is growing up," prompting Lauren's friends and family to comment on her weight loss.

"It was really hurtful at first, I didn't think anyone would think that about me," Lauren told Wales Online. "But I realized I had gained too much weight and needed to make a change. So I started eating healthier and exercising more."

Lauren said she lost 2.5kg (5.5lbs) every month for almost three years, reaching her current weight of 64kg (139lbs). She now wears size 14 and is happy with the way she looks and feels.

"I'm so much happier and more confident now," Lauren said. "I can wear things I never thought I could before, like jeans and dresses."

Lauren also says that her weight loss journey has inspired her to help others who may be struggling with their own body image issues. "If anyone is feeling down or unsure about themselves, just remember that it's never too late to make a change," she said. "It won't be easy, but the end result will be worth it."
