#### Python solution (by @mynameisnikita):
```python
def is_healthy(age):
    return age < 3 and age >= 19 or age > 18

def get_children(age, food):
    if not is_healthy(age):
        print("That kid isn't healthy.")
        return
    
    return (len(food) * min(max(0, age - 3), 19)) / 25 + 1 # Calculate how many kids there are.
```
