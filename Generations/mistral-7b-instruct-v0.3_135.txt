 It seems you're sharing a news headline about the impact of the Gulf Coast oil spill on tourism. To help you with this, I'll provide some suggestions for how states and visitors bureaus can address the situation:

1. Regular updates: Keep the public informed through press releases, social media platforms, websites, and local news outlets about the current status of the beaches, any changes in water quality, and safety measures being taken.

2. Safety guidelines: Provide clear information on safety protocols for beachgoers, such as avoiding oil-contaminated areas, following advisories from local authorities, and wearing protective equipment when necessary.

3. Promote unaffected areas: Highlight attractions and activities that are not impacted by the oil spill, to encourage travelers to visit other parts of the region. This could include historical sites, museums, parks, and cultural events.

4. Partnership with local businesses: Collaborate with hotels, restaurants, and other businesses to ensure they follow safety guidelines and communicate them effectively to guests. Offering discounts or special packages can help attract visitors during this challenging time.

5. Environmental efforts: Showcase any cleanup initiatives or conservation projects being undertaken in the area, demonstrating a commitment to preserving the environment and ensuring its long-term health.

6. Collaboration with government agencies: Work closely with local, state, and federal authorities to coordinate response efforts, share information, and ensure a unified message is communicated to the public.

7. Emotional support: Offer emotional support to affected communities and businesses, recognizing the impact of the oil spill on their livelihoods and well-being. This can help build trust and show a genuine concern for those most directly affected by the crisis.

8. Crisis communication training: Provide training for staff members on how to effectively communicate with the media, guests, and the public during a crisis situation. This will help ensure a consistent message is delivered and any questions or concerns are addressed promptly and professionally.
