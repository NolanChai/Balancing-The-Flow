The robot penguin, developed by researchers at the University of Tokyo, mimics the natural movements and behavior of a real penguin to the point where even other penguins are fooled into interacting with it. The robot is covered in feather-like synthetic materials that give it a realistic appearance and movement. It can swim through water and move on land, allowing it to blend in seamlessly with its natural penguin counterparts.

The researchers have used the robot penguin for various research purposes, including studying penguin behavior and even monitoring their health. The robot is also being used by scientists to observe and study these elusive creatures without disturbing or affecting them.
