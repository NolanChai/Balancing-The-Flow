 In an official statement on his website, Lee said: "After much reflection and discussion with my family and close friends, I have decided to retire from Test cricket. This decision has not been taken lightly, but after numerous injuries and surgeries over the past few years, it is time for me to hang up my bag and move on to new challenges."

Lee, who made his debut in 1996, went on to become one of Australia's most successful Test bowlers, taking 310 wickets at an average of 28.74. He played in three World Cup tournaments and two T20 World Cups for Australia.

The 39-year-old has been sidelined by injuries in recent years, including a shoulder operation in 2015 that kept him out of the game for nearly two years. He last played Test cricket in December 2016, when he took three wickets against Pakistan in Sydney.

Lee said he plans to continue playing in limited-overs formats and will be available for selection in Australia's T20 team. "I still have a lot of love and passion for the game and I want to keep playing," he said. "There are still some unfinished business that I would like to achieve, both personally and with the team."

Australia coach Justin Langer paid tribute to Lee's career and thanked him for his contributions to the team. "Brett is one of the greatest bowlers of all time and it has been an absolute privilege to work with him," Langer said in a statement. "He has given everything to the game and we are grateful for his service to Australian cricket."

Lee's retirement marks the end of an era for Australian cricket, as he was part of a generation of talented players that included Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath, Ricky Ponting, and Steve Waugh.
