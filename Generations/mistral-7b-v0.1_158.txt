> The author of a book should be paid every time it is downloaded or read by someone. That’s what you want to do, right? You work hard on your book and then the library puts it up and anyone can just download it and start reading.

> What if I just walked into a library and took out all the books that I wanted? Or even worse, what if I put them back in the wrong place? That’s what libraries do to our books! They put them in a wrong place, or they don’t put them back. Libraries are not good for writers.

> But here’s where we have to make a deal. The library needs my book and I need their readers. So I’ll give you a cut of my royalties – and you can keep that money. In fact, if you don’t get paid by the library, they won’t buy your next book either!

> If this sounds like a good deal to you then here are some tips on how to make it happen:
>
> 1) Get yourself an agent – someone who can negotiate with libraries and publishers on your behalf.
>
> 2) Don’t sign any contract that doesn’t have “royalties” written into the fine print (or at least somewhere in there).
>
> 3) If you want to keep all of your royalties then don’t accept advances from publishers – they will take most of them anyway!
>
> 4) Never give away any rights when signing contracts with publishers or libraries – this includes film and TV rights!
>
> 5) Make sure that every contract you sign has a clause saying something like “the author shall receive 10% of net receipts” (or whatever percentage works for you). That way if someone buys your book from a library they have to pay you too.
