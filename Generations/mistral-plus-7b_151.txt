The world’s largest-selling brand of cigarette is under fire for allegedly using a model who has been photographed in the nude to sell their cigarettes. Marlboro, owned by Philip Morris International, launched a new advertising campaign in Russia last month featuring the model who was also pictured posing naked in an online magazine.

The advertisements show the model in various guises, including wearing a wedding dress, and include slogans such as “It’s your time to shine” and “It’s your life”. The campaign has been widely criticised by Russian health experts who have questioned whether it is appropriate for Marlboro to be using models to sell their cigarettes.

The model in question has previously been photographed wearing nothing but her underwear, as well as posing nude for the magazine Maxim. The campaign was created by the advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi, who also produce advertisements for Marlboro in other countries. They have said that they do not endorse smoking and that their aim is to create an “attractive” image of Marlboro cigarettes.
