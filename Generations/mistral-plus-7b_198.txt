Kelly Renee Gissendaner, a 46-year-old woman from Georgia who was convicted of murder in 1998 after she helped her husband carry out the killing of his lover, is scheduled to be executed between February 25 and March 4. She was sentenced to death for conspiring with her then boyfriend Gregory Owen, now her ex-husband, to kill his lover.

Gissendaner’s case has garnered national attention as a potential example of the unfairness of capital punishment. She was convicted in 1998 for encouraging and helping her husband Gregory Owen carry out the murder of his lover, Douglas Spinks, who was shot twice in the back of the head while Gissendaner waited outside. She was sentenced to death, despite not actually pulling the trigger herself.

Since then, Gissendaner has been on Georgia’s death row for nearly 20 years. In that time, she has repeatedly expressed remorse for her actions and has undergone a transformation, becoming a devout Christian who has spoken about how her faith has helped her cope with her crime. Her attorneys have argued that her life sentence was cruel and unusual punishment, given her significant personal growth since the crime occurred.

Despite these arguments, Gissendaner’s execution date is set for between February 25 and March 4. She will be executed by lethal injection at the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson.
