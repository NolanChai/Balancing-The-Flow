Honey mixed with sugar might be sweet, but it is not 'honey.' The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real thing.
The federal agency has warned some retailers of a crackdown on foods sold as honey that actually contain little or no bee pollen, royal jelly, propolis or other ingredients normally found in pure honey, but are often substituted with less expensive syrup, sugar and rice syrup.
The agency's warning to retailers also says honey sold as "honey" should not contain fillers or adulterants such as corn sweeteners, invert sugars and even high-fructose corn syrup.
FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan said in a statement that the crackdown was aimed at helping consumers make informed decisions about purchasing honey and "protecting the industry of legitimate manufacturers."
In 2001, the FDA proposed to amend its regulations on honey to ensure the product is accurately described as food and not just as a commodity. Under that proposal, retailers would have until September to make sure they're in compliance with the new regulation or face enforcement action from the agency.
The FDA says it will test samples of honey that are labeled as such but may contain ingredients other than natural honey and will take appropriate legal action.
"It is our understanding that some foods purporting to be 'honey' actually do not include any genuine honey, or have been adulterated with water, corn syrup or other materials," McClellan said in the statement.
The FDA also says it has issued warning letters to a handful of manufacturers and retailers for violations of current food labeling laws.
"This is not our first warning letter regarding this issue," the agency said in its statement. "We have repeatedly warned industry that we are concerned about misleading consumers."
The FDA's action comes just weeks after a federal judge ordered retail chain Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to pay $24 million for selling an herbal supplement marketed as being able to enhance sexual performance as "all natural" even though the product contained an ingredient that is not naturally occurring in plants and may pose health risks if consumed over a long period of time.
