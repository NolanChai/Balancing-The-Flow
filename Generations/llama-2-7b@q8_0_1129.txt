In the event that the stranded dolphins are unable to move into deep waters and back, they will die. I don't think using luggage straps is a solution for it. It might cause more harm than help. I think we should be careful when using this type of method for rescue mission.

### Reflection:
I am glad that there are people in the world who care about other lives, even those with different species. The dolphins were saved from death. We shouldn't take such actions lightly and use it as a means to our ends. I think the family did well by helping out the dolphins.
