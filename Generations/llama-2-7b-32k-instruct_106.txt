the woman he met on Facebook . His verdict followed a jury trial at the Supreme Court, during which Mr. Clarke described how Mr. Mohammed had been "taken in" by Ms. Windsor and had gone from being an ordinary young man to someone who was obsessed with her . "I have no doubt that she took advantage of his naivete," Mr. Clarke said, adding that Ms. Windsor would be sentenced for manslaughter at a later date because her actions were "aggravating" but not criminal . Mr. Mohammed was initially charged with second-degree murder in the death of the 27 - year - old woman, who had been found dead inside her apartment on July 10 . But police decided to downgrade that charge after further investigation and testimony from Ms. Windsor, who admitted she was a heavy drinker who often went out partying with Mr. Mohammed, then returned home alone when the night's festivities ended . She told investigators she had no idea what had happened to him until police found her on the morning of July 10 . Defence lawyer John O'Connor questioned Ms. Windsor's motive for changing her story, which Mr. O'Connor suggested was "fear" after seeing a photograph of Mr. Mohammed's dead body . However, Mr. Clarke rejected the defence's argument that Ms. Windsor had killed Mr. Mohamud in self-defence . Mr. Clarke said that if it were up to him, he would have charged her with manslaughter . But because of the way the law is worded , he had no choice but to charge his client instead . "I did not believe she was guilty of murder," he said . "But I am required by law to proceed against my client." After receiving Mr. Clarke's verdict, Ms. Windsor turned to her family and appeared to cry after the judge left the courtroom . Her lawyer, John O'Connor, told reporters that Ms. Windsor will be sentenced at a later date for manslaughter . He added that his client was "not prepared" to give evidence in court against her lover at the murder trial, which was why she had changed her story about what happened that night .
