The United States does not accept Israel's position that they have any right to interfere with this flotilla in international waters, and we believe that the Israelis should abide by their obligations under international law and allow these ships to continue on to Gaza.

### Analysis/Conclusions:
* 47% of Americans agreed that US should try diplomatic pressure on Israeli government before trying any other course of action
* 51% of those polled agreed with the statement "Iran's decision not to send ships into the Gaza Strip is an indication that Iran has no interest in interfering with the conflict between Israel and Hamas"
