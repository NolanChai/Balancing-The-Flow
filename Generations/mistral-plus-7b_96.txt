Funerals in Ghana are not only an occasion to mourn. They also provide an opportunity for people to celebrate the life of the deceased and honor their legacy. In Ghana, funerals are a very important cultural tradition. They are often large, elaborate events that include music, dance, food, and drink. The funeral procession typically begins with the body being transported from the home of the deceased to the burial site. Along the way, mourners follow behind the hearse, paying their respects by walking slowly and quietly. At the grave site, loved ones gather to say their final goodbyes and pay their last respects to the departed.
