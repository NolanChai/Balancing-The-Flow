Liv Tyler doesnâ€™t like being disturbed by her agents late at night. She feels that the calls and texts she receives after midnight are an invasion of her privacy and disrupts her sleep schedule. To avoid this, Liv has requested that her agents refrain from contacting her after 10pm unless it is absolutely necessary. She also appreciates it if they limit their interactions to emails or text messages rather than phone calls so that she can respond in a more convenient manner.
