Thibaut Courtois was one of several Chelsea stars to admit last week that he would have preferred if his loan spell at Atletico Madrid had been extended by a further season, but admits that it was not in the hands of the club's hierarchy or him. "I would have liked to stay for another year," Courtois told Sky Sports 1. "But we all agreed with Chelsea and I don't know why they didn't extend my loan." The 24-year-old made 95 appearances in two seasons at Atletico Madrid, helping the club to win the Europa League on three occasions and lift the La Liga title last season. "I think it was a good move for both sides," he added. "Chelsea wanted me to come back and I came back." The goalkeeper also praised Chelsea's new manager Jose Mourinho, revealing that his former boss at Madrid helped him decide on which club to join when he left Belgium last summer. "I think the first thing is his experience in football," Courtois said.
"He had two very good spells with Real and Inter Milan - winning leagues there. He's a winner and I think that's what he wants from all his players." Courtois also explained that while it was difficult to leave Madrid, the chance to play in the Premier League was an opportunity he could not turn down. "I'd been at Chelsea before so it wasn't too hard of a decision," he added.
"I thought the Premier League would be very good for me and I'm enjoying it."
