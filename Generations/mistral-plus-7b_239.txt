A rare horizontal rainbow appeared over Paris last week, delighting locals and tourists alike with its vibrant colors. The rainbow, also known as a sundog or parhelion, is created when sunlight is refracted through ice crystals in the atmosphere. The phenomenon is relatively common in the polar regions but much rarer closer to the equator. It was an unusually clear day in Paris when the rainbow appeared and was visible for several hours, attracting crowds of people who came out to marvel at this rare sight.
