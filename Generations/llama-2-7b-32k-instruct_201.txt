Obama said Thursday that Congress needs to pass an immigration bill, but Republicans in Congress don't want him to do it because they think it would help his re-election prospects. He doesn't buy it.

"I understand the politics of this," Obama told a town hall audience at California State University, Sacramento. "I understand how messy this is. But if I win an election on my record then that's fine." 

The President said he won't act unilaterally to change the laws as some immigrants are urging him to do -- and which could prompt a legal challenge from opponents in Congress. 

"I don't have the authority," Obama told the crowd. "And I'm not going to take executive action that is going to, frankly, punish the American people." 

The President said Republicans and Democrats in both chambers of Congress need to pass legislation on immigration reform for him to act. But he doesn't want to wait forever for it.

"I will not be held hostage by any party or any special interest," Obama told the crowd, adding that Republicans are holding "the American people" hostage by blocking an immigration bill in Congress. 

The President said if Congress doesn't act on a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform bill before he leaves office, he will consider doing something else to address the problem of undocumented workers living in this country. He wouldn't specify what that might be. 

Obama also said he supports comprehensive immigration reform and wants it done soon . The President said Republicans shouldn't try and hold him "hostage" or tie him down on other legislation if they don't like the immigration bill in Congress.

But he didn't want to act on his own before Election Day. He wants both parties to work together to pass an immigration bill, but it won't happen soon because of partisan politics. 

The President said Republicans want to make him a one-term president and so they don't support the immigration bill out of spite for his party. He thinks that's a terrible reason not to do the right thing by this country.

"The politics is such that I understand why they are trying to punish me," he said, but "the American people deserve better than that." 

Obama also took another dig at Republicans and said that if he's re-elected, he'll work on other issues like climate change after November -- despite the fact that Republicans in Congress have blocked his efforts to get them done. He said he won't wait for their permission to do what's right for this country. 

"I will act if we don't," Obama said, and then added: "But I think it would be better if the Republicans in Congress pass an immigration bill." 

Obama also said that if he does something on his own to deal with immigration before Election Day, Republicans might say that his re-election bid was built around him taking unilateral actions. But Obama doesn't think it would be fair for them to use the issue as an excuse not to do what they should be doing -- which is working on immigration reform with him and other lawmakers. 

"They ought to stop blocking a bill, come over here," he said, "and let us take care of business." 

But Obama also took time out in the middle of talking about climate change and immigration to talk about what's going on in the news, starting with the recent Supreme Court ruling that struck down a key provision in the Defense of Marriage Act. The President said the decision was good for Americans who are gay or lesbian because they will be treated like everyone else . 

Obama then turned to the issue of immigration and how Republicans in Congress need to pass an immigration bill that he can sign into law before Election Day if they want him to work on other issues.

"I'm going to act," Obama said. "But I'm not acting alone." 

The President then spent a good bit of time talking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform in America . He talked about how it would help this country grow and thrive, create jobs and better lives for people who want to work hard and become legal citizens. 

But he didn't have much else to say because the politics of immigration reform are so contentious in Congress, with Republicans mostly opposed to any legislation that would grant citizenship or legal status to undocumented workers living here. 

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has said he thinks illegal immigrants should be deported and doesn't support a pathway to citizenship for them . His party has also opposed an immigration bill in the Senate because it would provide amnesty for people who entered this country illegally. 

In addition, Republicans want to make sure that the border with Mexico is secure before any legalization takes place and Democrats don't . That issue will be key to whether Congress can pass an immigration reform bill or not in time for Obama to sign it into law. 

The President said he would have acted on comprehensive immigration reform much sooner if Republicans didn't want him to do it because they think that doing so would help his re-election bid.

"We need to get this done," the President told the audience, and then added: "I don't care about the politics." 

But Obama said he doesn't have the authority to act on his own anyway . 

"The law is clear that I do not have the legal authority to change it by myself," Obama said. "And we should be honest, if I could I would fix this tomorrow -- I have no problem with that." 

But he's waiting for Congress to pass an immigration bill so they can all work together on an issue that impacts this country in a very big way . 

"This is the right thing," Obama said. "The American people deserve it . And I will do everything I can -- even if Republicans try to hold me hostage on other issues -- to get this done." 

Obama's remarks come at an important time in immigration reform and politics because November elections are less than three months away, with the President seeking a second term. He could be re-elected as president on his record if Republicans do everything they can to defeat him and the Senate Democrats retain their majority . 

But the Republicans need the White House in order to push through legislation that would help them win back the Senate and block Obama's actions. If Romney wins, it will be tough for the GOP to pass any immigration bill once he is elected president . That's why some Republicans have been willing to support an immigration bill in the Senate if it doesn't grant citizenship or legal status to undocumented workers living here, despite their party leadership opposing one. 

Obama also spent time talking about climate change and said he is confident that Democrats will win seats in Congress because of his efforts on this issue . But he admitted that the country is going through a period where people are having doubts about the science behind global warming. He told supporters not to be discouraged by it -- they just have to keep talking about it, and the truth will come out eventually.

He said climate change is real even if some politicians say otherwise . 

"This is a fact," Obama said. "You can't deny this."
