The Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said Wednesday that the additional troops requested would not come at no additional cost but rather at "moderate" costs.
"If you are talking about an inflation-adjusted total budget of $684 billion, I think you could probably assume an increase in the ballpark of 1 percent to 2 percent," Kirby said on a conference call with reporters. He added that the estimate was "a very rough guess" and "not an exact science."
### Challenge:
The total cost estimates come just days after Vice President Joe Biden expressed concern over the amount of money going into Afghanistan, which now stands at $350 billion since the invasion in 2001.
In a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations last week, Biden said that he believes "we have to send fewer troops," but also noted that he believed "you're not going to be able to do this mission (in Afghanistan) for less than it costs today."
### Challenge:
A report by The Washington Post in May 2009, said that the Pentagon had already spent $3 billion on troop surges and reconstruction projects. That figure does not include money being spent now, including the $17 billion supplemental request Obama has made for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.
### Challenge:
Asked how much more money the additional troops would require, Kirby said Wednesday that he was unable to answer because "the President and the Secretary of Defense have not approved sending those forces."
"It's certainly true that the cost will go up," he said. "But it is impossible for us to say exactly what that number will be or how much of an increase, until we know for certain that they are going to be sent."
