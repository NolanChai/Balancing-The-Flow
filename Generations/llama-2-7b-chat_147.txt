The talks, which are being brokered by regional bloc the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), are set to begin in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa next week. The IGAD delegation, led by former Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki, has been shuttling between the warring parties for several weeks, trying to secure a peace agreement.
"We have made significant progress in our negotiations with both sides and we are hopeful that an agreement can be reached," said Kibaki. "The people of South Sudan deserve peace and we will do everything in our power to bring it to them."
