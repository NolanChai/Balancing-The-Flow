 The incident was caught on camera at a Brazilian restaurant in Medell√≠n and shows a group of Colombian celebrities engaging in a heated argument with Brazilian fans. The argument quickly escalated, with plates being thrown across the restaurant as both sides shouted insults and threats.

One of the Colombians involved in the altercation is popular TV host Carlos Amador, who had just returned from a trip to Brazil. According to reports, he was seen arguing with a group of Brazilians over their behavior and refusal to respect his privacy.

The incident comes as tensions between the two countries continue to rise, with many Colombians expressing anger at Brazil's handling of their star player Neymar Jr., who has been accused of sexual assault in Rio de Janeiro.

Despite efforts by both sides to calm things down, it remains unclear whether the altercation will have any impact on their upcoming quarter final clash in Fortaleza on June 19th. The match is expected to be a highly anticipated showdown between two of South America's most talented teams, with many experts predicting a close and exciting contest.
