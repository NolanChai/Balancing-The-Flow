 Indeed, the spectacle you've described must have been truly awe-inspiring! To have over 130 people gathered together to witness such an event on Sydney Harbour adds an extra layer of wonder to the experience. Can you tell me more about what specifically they were observing? Was it a pod of humpback whales, or perhaps a different species? I'd love to hear more details about this memorable encounter!
