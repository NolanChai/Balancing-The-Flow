TOWIE stars Sam and Billie Faiers wrote to an Old Bailey judge pleading for leniency for their brother Joey as he was jailed for 23 months for assaulting a police officer. The girls, who appeared on the ITV2 reality show about life in Essex, told Judge David Radford they were ‘saddened and shocked’ by Joey’s behaviour. They said his actions had caused them a lot of embarrassment but that he was a changed man. Joey, 20, was convicted last month of assaulting PC Simon Bradley while he was on duty in Brentwood High Street last June. He has already served five weeks on remand and will serve another 18 months for the offence. Judge Radford told him: ‘You were involved in a fight with a police officer who tried to prevent you from using violent force on someone else. You struck him with such force that he was knocked to the ground and suffered an injury.’
