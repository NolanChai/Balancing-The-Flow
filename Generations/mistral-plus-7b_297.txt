Jeremy Clarkson is being investigated by BBC bosses after he used an offensive term to describe a country. The Top Gear host said that he was in "the land of the darkies" during a show which was filmed in India last year. In a recent episode, Jeremy described the country as "utterly fascinating" and added: "It's also incredibly poor. Most people seem happy." However, his comments were criticised by the BBC Trust for being racist. A spokesperson for the corporation said that they were investigating the matter.
