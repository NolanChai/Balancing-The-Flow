Same sex marriages to be legalized in Uruguay next week   By Mariana Zuñiga   Associated Press   LIMA, Peru (AP) - Uruguayan lawmakers have approved a same-sex marriage measure, leaving just one more key step -- the president's signature -- before such couples can wed in the South American country.   The Senate passed the measure early Tuesday, 22 votes to 7. It must still be signed into law by President José Mujica, who has said he plans to do so. He is expected to sign it Wednesday.   
   "I will sign it," Mujica said in an interview earlier this month with the local TV show _ Telenoche . "If you asked me two months ago, I would have said no way."   
   The measure would legalize same sex marriage for gay and lesbian couples living together. They could then get married under current civil code rules, which allow men and women to marry each other and allows children over age 18 to choose who they want to live with . Mujica's signature would bring the law into force a year after it is published in the official gazette, which would mean gay couples could start registering their union as soon as next week.   
   In Brazil, same sex marriage was legalized last summer. In Argentina, which has an openly gay president, it was made legal 20 years ago . Paraguay and Venezuela also allow same-sex marriages."
