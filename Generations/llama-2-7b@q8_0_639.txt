- In 2016, there were 317 people convicted of drink driving per 100,000 in the Welsh town of Rhyl, where 42% of all offenders were from a black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) background.
- The number was nearly double that of other towns and cities, such as Wrexham which had 163 per 100,000, Swansea with 159 convictions per 100,000 and Llanelli where the figure stood at 154.
- The figures were published in a report by charity Drinkaware and showed that people from BAME communities were more likely to be convicted for drink driving compared with white people.
- In London’s boroughs, Westminster was found to have the highest number of arrests at 724 per 100,000 followed by Hackney at 365 and Haringey at 349 convictions per 100,000.
- Other towns where people were most likely to be convicted for drink driving included Slough in Berkshire (247), Coventry (243) and Wolverhampton (215).
- The charity said its findings revealed a “huge problem” with alcohol-related offences and urged the government to take action. Drinkaware’s chief executive Nigel Murray warned there was an issue with people from BAME communities being disproportionately affected by drink driving offences.
