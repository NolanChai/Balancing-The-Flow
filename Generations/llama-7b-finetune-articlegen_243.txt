The Democratic Republic of Congo has been one of Africa's most troubled states for the last decade. But it seems the situation is only getting worse as more atrocities are committed against civilians by a militant group known as the Allied Democratic Forces. Human Rights Watch said in a report released Saturday that the ADF killed at least 321 civilians and abducted 250 others, including at least 80 children, in an attack late last year on the village of Pinga. The militant group, based near Uganda's border with Congo, is blamed for more than 4,600 killings over three decades. "These attacks are only possible because Congolese and Ugandan security forces fail to protect civilians, despite their obligation under international humanitarian law," Georgette Goumba, Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement accompanying the report. The ADF is believed to be made up of an estimated 100 fighters who are part of the Lord's Resistance Army rebels that fled Uganda and crossed over into Congo more than a decade ago. They have since been blamed for abducting tens of thousands of children to serve as child soldiers, according to Human Rights Watch. The group is also accused of participating in the 1994 genocide in neighboring Rwanda and carrying out attacks against ethnic minority groups in Congo. Last week a Congolese official said that the United Nations peacekeepers were unable to stop an attack last month by ADF rebels who killed at least 20 civilians, including women and children. The latest incident is not isolated: Human Rights Watch said it documented several other attacks on villages in Congo between February and June this year that left scores of people dead. It also accused Congolese troops of looting the bodies of victims to sell as food to local markets. The United Nations mission in Congo, known as MONUSCO, has more than 16,000 peacekeepers, making it one of the largest missions in the world. The report comes amid renewed efforts by Western nations and Uganda to find a peaceful solution to the country's ongoing unrest. Last week Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni announced he would seek dialogue with rebel groups, including the ADF. "There is no other option," Museveni said during a visit to Kenya last month. The 69-year-old president has been in power since 1986 and has become increasingly unpopular at home and abroad. He faced stiff resistance earlier this year when he tried to extend his term by scrapping the country's constitution, which would have allowed him to run for a third consecutive term. The move sparked protests across Uganda in April as thousands marched through the streets of Kampala, demanding Museveni leave office before the end of his second term in 2016. He later agreed to hold off on amending the constitution and pledged to hold elections in February next year -- four years earlier than required under current law. CNN's Charles M.
