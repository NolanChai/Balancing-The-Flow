 It seems like you've shared a news headline about a local council investigating the carving of swastikas into the stonework of their premises. However, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access specific articles, so I can't provide more details about this particular incident. I can help you understand more about the symbolism of swastikas in different contexts if you'd like!

The swastika is an ancient symbol that has been used by various cultures for thousands of years, often representing good fortune, prosperity, and spiritual growth. However, due to its appropriation by the Nazi Party during World War II, it has become deeply associated with hate, racism, and violence in many parts of the world. As a result, the use or display of swastikas is generally considered offensive and inappropriate in most contemporary societies.
