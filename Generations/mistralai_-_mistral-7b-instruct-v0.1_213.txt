 But what many don't realize is that the original black-and-white footage was just a few minutes long, and it only captured a small part of the assassination itself.

The Zapruder film, shot by amateur filmmaker Abraham Zapruder on November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas, shows President John F. Kennedy being shot from behind while riding in an open-top convertible during a motorcade through the city. The footage captures the moment of impact and the subsequent chaos, but it does not show the assassin's face or any of the planning that led to the murder.

Over the years, the Zapruder film has been edited and manipulated in various ways, with some people claiming to have seen images that were not originally present in the footage. But despite these efforts, the original film remains the only piece of visual evidence from the assassination.
