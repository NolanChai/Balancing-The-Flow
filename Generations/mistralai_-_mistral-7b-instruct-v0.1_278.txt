 The mass grave was discovered near the town of Jalula in Nineveh province, which has been under the control of Sunni insurgents since 2003.

The security official said that at least 15 bodies were found in the grave, some of which had been decapitated and disfigured. The victims appear to be Shia Muslims, who have been targeted by extremist groups in Iraq for their religious beliefs.

The discovery comes just days after a series of coordinated attacks on security forces in Baghdad and other parts of the country claimed the lives of at least 34 people. The attacks were carried out by a group known as Islamic State, which has been operating in Iraq since the US-led invasion in 2003.

The mass grave was discovered during a raid by Iraqi security forces on a suspected insurgent stronghold in the area. The soldiers found several weapons caches and detained several suspects for questioning, according to the official.
