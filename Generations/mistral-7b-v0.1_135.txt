This post is a response to the CNN article about the BP Oil Spill that was posted by @CNNiReport.  I chose this article because of its relevance to my internship with the Texas Gulf Coast Travel Region, as well as the fact that it is from an extremely reputable source, and has been retweeted over 100 times in the last hour.

### Evaluation:
The CNN article is relevant to the Texas Gulf Coast because of its proximity to the oil spill site, and because a large portion of the coastline is made up of beaches that are popular destinations for travelers.  The article reports that "visitors bureaus" all along the coast are working hard to reassure visitors about the safety of the beach areas.  As an intern with the Texas Gulf Coast Travel Region, I have noticed that tourism has been slower than usual this year.

### Summary:
This post is a summary of the CNN article and its relevance to my internship.  The article reports that beaches all along the Gulf Coast are working hard to reassure travelers about the safety of their coastline.
