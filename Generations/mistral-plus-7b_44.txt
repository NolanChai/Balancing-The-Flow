Conor McGregor lived up to his pre-fight promise by knocking out Dustin Poirier inside one round at UFC 257. In a rematch of their 2014 fight, the Irishman showed why he is still one of the most dangerous fighters in MMA by hurting Poirier with leg kicks and then dropping him with a vicious right hand that ended the contest with just 8 seconds left in the first round.

McGregor came out firing in the opening minutes, landing multiple punches on Poirier as he looked for an early finish. He was unable to find it though, but continued to press the action and eventually found the perfect shot to put his opponent away. After a straight right hand landed flush on Poirier's chin, McGregor followed up with another strike that forced the referee to stop the fight.

The victory cemented McGregor's status as one of the best fighters in the world and proved that he is still able to perform at an elite level after taking time away from the sport. He now has his sights set on a rematch with Khabib Nurmagomedov, which could be one of the biggest fights in UFC history if it ever comes to fruition.
