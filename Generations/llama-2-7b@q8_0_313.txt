A judge said Rimsha Masih was released on $390 bail, pending her trial for allegedly burning pages from the Muslim holy book. The case against Rimsha is being treated as a minor crime and not a blasphemy offense because the girl's accuser has recanted his claim that she set fire to Qurans, said lawyer Tahir Naveed Chaudhary, who represented the family of Rimsha.
