 It sounds like you're describing a potentially dangerous traffic incident that occurred in a Boston tunnel. While I don't have the ability to view videos or images, I can certainly help you understand how such an event might be managed by emergency services and suggest safety precautions for similar situations.

In this scenario, the out-of-control vehicle veering into closed lanes could pose a significant risk to other road users, as well as the police cruiser. The Massachusetts State Police, or any other law enforcement agency, would likely respond promptly to such an incident. Their primary concern would be ensuring the safety of all parties involved and managing traffic to prevent further accidents.

In terms of safety precautions for drivers, it's crucial to always pay attention to the road, obey traffic signs and signals, and maintain a safe distance from other vehicles. In the event of an emergency or unexpected hazard on the road, such as debris, animals, or a vehicle in distress, drivers should:

1. Maintain control of their vehicle.
2. Signal their intentions to other drivers if possible.
3. Slow down and move over if safe to do so, creating space between their vehicle and the hazard.
4. Notify local authorities or emergency services if necessary.
5. Be prepared for unexpected situations by ensuring their vehicles are well-maintained and they have essential safety equipment such as a first aid kit, flares, and a mobile phone for emergencies.
