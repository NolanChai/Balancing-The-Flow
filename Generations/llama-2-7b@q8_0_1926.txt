1. The study did not show that the pill causes MS, but showed an association between taking the pill and the development of the disease. The authors also note that no one is sure whether the women with MS who took the pill were already predisposed to developing the disease before they started taking it or if there was an unknown third factor involved.
2. The studyâ€™s participants, like most people, did not know which group they were in; the researchers also point out that there are other factors associated with multiple sclerosis besides pill use and these may have played a part in causing some of the disease.
3. A 1980s Swedish study showed an association between using Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, and multiple sclerosis. There were no cases reported when women used oral contraceptives like those studied here.
4. The authors note that in a 2013 study on breast cancer, they saw no link with use of the pill.
