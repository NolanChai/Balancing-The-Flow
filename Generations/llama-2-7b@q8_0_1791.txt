Not the dashing and dishy lawyer, hero of Bridget Jones’s Diary, of the romantic comedy that won us over when we first saw it back in 2001, that has had us falling in love all over again every time we see it on TV.

Mark is dead? Mark Darcy is DEAD?

I don’t believe it. I cannot believe it. What will Bridget do without him? How can she go on? What hope does the world have now that our hero has been ripped away from us, taken by some cruel hand before his time?

Sorry — am getting over-emotional here. But this is such an outrage. This is so very wrong.

I mean, really? The man who saved Bridget’s life when she was having a heart attack and then came back to her flat with her on the day after to make sure she got home safely, who made love to her in front of the Christmas tree, who danced through the rain to get into the church for their wedding — who married her? Who made her happy and kept her going when things were tough — he’s dead?

Why? How can you do this, Hollywood?

Such an outrageous thing to happen. Such a heartbreaking cliffhanger ending. I really don’t think we can take it.
