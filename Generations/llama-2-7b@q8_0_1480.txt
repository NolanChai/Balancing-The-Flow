The move comes after a video of the king killing an elephant with a bow and arrow during a hunting trip to Botswana caused outrage last week. The video was recorded by Spanish television network TVE at the king's request for "family members" that were present on the hunting trip, which took place in 2012.

The king is pictured in the video firing his bow and arrow from a tree while he is guided by professional hunter Theunis Botha. It is not clear where the elephant was shot.
