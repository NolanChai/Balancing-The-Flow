Edin Dzeko is expected to join AC Milan in a transfer worth around £15 million, according to reports in Italy. The Bosnian international has been heavily linked with the Serie A giants for several months, and it now appears that a deal could be close to completion.

Dzeko has spent the last three seasons at Wolfsburg, where he has scored over 40 goals in all competitions. He is likely to be replaced at the German club by Luka Jovic, who recently signed from Benfica for around £12 million.

The 31-year-old striker would add a significant amount of experience and firepower to an AC Milan side that has struggled in recent years. He has proven himself to be an effective goalscorer at the highest level, scoring over 80 goals in his career so far.
