 That's correct! On October 20, 2021, it was reported that the London Metropolitan Police had executed search warrants at several properties, including some belonging to the House of Lords, as part of an investigation into historical allegations of child sex abuse. The peer under investigation is Lord Janner of Braunstone, who died in 2015 before charges could be brought against him. These events bring attention to the ongoing issue of historic child sex abuse and its impact on victims and society.
