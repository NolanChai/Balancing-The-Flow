 This statement is incorrect as it is very unlikely for sunbathers to be seen on a beach in Minnesota during the winter, regardless of whether the lake has melted or not. The temperature in Minnesota during the winter months can drop well below freezing and it would not be safe for anyone to spend time outside basking in the sun. In addition, the ice covering on the lake would make it difficult to access the water and sunbathe on. It is more likely that people would engage in indoor activities during the winter months in Minnesota.
