## Objective:
In this project I have tried to build a real time Busker detection system using Machine Learning.

### Dataset:
Dataset for this project was provided by Kaggle, and it can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maksimkuznetsov/buskers-dataset). The dataset contains 718 images with busker (performer) in it, and 624 images without a performer.

### Methodology:
I have used three different models for this project:
1. **SqueezeNet**: It is a Convolutional Neural Network which has been trained on ImageNet dataset. I have fine-tuned the model on Busker dataset and tested it with 5-fold cross validation.
2. **YOLOv3**: You Only Look Once (YOLO) is an algorithm for object detection in real-time. It can also be used to detect objects in video frames. I have fine-tuned the model on Busker dataset and tested it with 5-fold cross validation.
3. **Mask R-CNN**: Mask Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask R-CNN) is an object detection algorithm for real-time image segmentation. It can also be used to detect objects in video frames. I have fine-tuned the model on Busker dataset and tested it with 5-fold cross validation.

### Results:
I have compared the results of all the models, and found out that **Mask R-CNN** provides the best accuracy for busker detection.
