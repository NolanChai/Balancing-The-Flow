Upheaval can be a challenge for any team, but it can be especially challenging for Wasps. With the departure of some key players and the arrival of new ones, it is important for the team to come together and adjust to the changes in order to continue their success. Upheaval provides an opportunity for growth and renewal, but also comes with its own set of challenges. It requires patience, determination, and resilience from the team as they adapt to the new situation.
