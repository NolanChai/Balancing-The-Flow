It's very hard to believe that ATF agents actually did what they are alleged to have done (or rather not done). For one thing, I can't imagine any federal agent letting criminals go free if they had the chance to catch them and put them away for a long time. Secondly, I find it hard to believe that all of these ATF agents would have been so naive as to think that the guns they let pass into Mexico weren't going to be used by Mexican drug cartels. Finally, I can't imagine that the ATF supervisors were unaware of what was happening.

### Question:
Who are you most sympathetic to in this story? Why?
