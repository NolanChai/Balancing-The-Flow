The government has failed to act on multiple fronts when it comes to illegal firearms trafficking into Mexico. 

A Border Patrol agent holds his gun before boarding a bus in Nogales, Arizona, on September 20, 2016. 
  
 "We are at war with each other," said Mark Morgan, former special agent-in-charge of the San Diego office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit. He added that the number of guns recovered from Mexico has gone up significantly since 2016. 
  
 The problem, as the agents described it to lawmakers, was that federal firearms agencies were not coordinating their efforts and they didn't have a clear way to track who was being prosecuted for trafficking weapons across the border. 
  
 The failure to address gun smuggling into Mexico is especially frustrating given how many lives are lost as a result. Guns, the agents said, were involved in more than 30,000 homicides south of the border last year. 
  
 "It's not about the number," one agent testified. 
  
 "It's about who has been killed by these guns." 
  
 The committee held its hearing after President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency along the US-Mexico border in February. At the time, he called the situation there a national security crisis and an invasion that required military intervention to address it. But lawmakers said they believe the real problem is firearms trafficking into Mexico, which has been enabled by lax oversight of federal gun laws and enforcement efforts. 
  
 "It's not a border security crisis," said Democratic Rep. Veronica Escobar of Texas. "It's a humanitarian crisis." 
  
 The hearing came days after the Justice Department announced it was giving states more authority to approve sales of firearms across state lines, allowing people in areas with tighter gun control laws to buy guns from other states. That decision has prompted criticism that the Trump administration is prioritizing the interests of the National Rifle Association over public safety. 
  
 The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is tasked with regulating federal firearms laws, including tracking weapons traffickers and conducting investigations into firearms trafficking. But the bureau lacks resources for surveillance and enforcement efforts against gun smugglers, the agents said. 
  
 The ATF does not have enough field agents to effectively investigate gun trafficking crimes or enforce federal laws related to the sale of firearms, one agent testified. 
  
 "The border is a war zone," another agent testified, adding that the government should be tracking the weapons that are making it across the border. 
  
 The ATF also needs more funding to go after gun traffickers who operate with impunity, said John Sandoval, former special agent in charge for the Phoenix division of Homeland Security Investigations. 
  
 "We're at a crisis level," he said. "We have the right to prosecute, but we don't have the resources." 
  
 The ATF has been working with Mexican authorities to target some major criminal organizations involved in trafficking weapons, including those from the so-called Cartel del Pacífico and Jalisco Nueva Generación. In fiscal year 2018, the agency arrested 63 people who were charged with illegally trafficking firearms across the border. 
  
 "We're working diligently to address it," said ATF Assistant Director Jason McCullough. 
  
 But Congress has not provided enough money for the ATF to investigate and enforce firearms laws, he added. The bureau faces a $37 million budget shortfall this fiscal year due in part to a lack of funding to cover staff salaries. That leaves it unable to pursue investigations or prosecutions that would disrupt illicit markets for firearms in Mexico, McCullough said. 
  
 "If we don't have the resources to conduct the work, then we can't meet our mission," he added. 
  
 The hearing was part of an ongoing investigation by House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings that will examine why the ATF has not been able to effectively address the flow of weapons into Mexico despite the threat it poses. 
  
 ATF data show that more than 10,584 firearms were recovered from Mexico in fiscal year 2017. That represents a significant increase since 2016, when 5,597 guns were seized by Mexican authorities from drug trafficking organizations and other criminal groups. 
  
 "We are at war with each other," said Mark Morgan, former special agent-in-charge of the San Diego office for Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations unit. He added that the number of guns recovered from Mexico has gone up significantly since 2016. 
  
 "We are losing this war," said Morgan, who now serves as Trump's acting chief of customs and border protection. The agents also testified about a lack of coordination among federal law enforcement agencies when it comes to firearms trafficking into Mexico. They described how the ATF and Immigration and Customs Enforcement have failed to track who is being prosecuted for illegally selling guns across the border, allowing gun traffickers to go unpunished. 
  
 "We're at a crisis level," said John Sandoval, former special agent in charge for the Phoenix division of Homeland Security Investigations. He added that the ATF needs more funding and resources to pursue gun traffickers and investigate who is buying firearms in the United States. 
  
 "We are at a crisis level," he said. 
  
 The agents also described how they would often be thwarted by state laws that made it difficult for them to trace the weapons back to their original sources, particularly in cases where guns were purchased in California and later recovered from Mexico. 
  
 "The lack of cooperation from states has been a major hurdle," said Jonathan Foy, former special agent-in-charge at Homeland Security Investigations in Los Angeles. 
  
 But some lawmakers questioned whether the ATF had done enough to address the problem given how much firearms trafficking is going on. 
  
 "We're not seeing anything that would lead us to believe things are improving," said Rep. Carol Miller of West Virginia, who chairs a subcommittee on economic growth, competition and infrastructure at the House Small Business Committee. She added that she believes the agency needs more funding to address the problem. 
  
 The hearing also highlighted how lawmakers in some states are actively trying to make it easier for people to buy guns despite concerns about violence fueled by guns, including a recent mass shooting at a synagogue in Poway, California, where one person was killed and three others were injured. 
  
 "The fact that the Justice Department is now allowing certain states to evade their own laws on background checks, it just seems like it's a really bad idea," said Democratic Rep. Jan Schakowsky of Illinois. 
  
 Republicans countered that the DOJ's decision would ultimately increase competition among gun manufacturers and make it easier for states to sell guns across state lines -- which they argued would help law abiding citizens. 
  
 "Allowing interstate commerce in firearms will not increase crime or violence," said Republican Rep. Paul Gosar of Arizona, who added that the Justice Department is trying to keep up with advances made by states when it comes to gun control laws. 
  
 "They're moving further and further away from us," he said, adding that Democrats are using federal gun restrictions as a way to disarm law abiding citizens in states like Arizona. 
  
 The Justice Department did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment about the hearing, but earlier this week the DOJ defended its decision to allow interstate sales of guns across state lines.""
