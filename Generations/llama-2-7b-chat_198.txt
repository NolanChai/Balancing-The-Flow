Kelly Renee Gissendaner was convicted of murdering her husband Douglas Gissendaner in 1998. She was sentenced to life in prison without parole but later received a new trial after it was discovered that the original jury had been misled about the severity of the punishment they could impose. The jury was told that if they convicted Gissendaner, she would face life in prison without parole, but if they acquitted her, she would face the death penalty. In 2014, a new trial was held and Gissendaner was found guilty of malice murder and sentenced to death. She has been on death row at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Butts County since then.
