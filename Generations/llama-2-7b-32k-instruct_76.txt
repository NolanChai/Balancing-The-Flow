Mumia Abu-Jamal, known as the "voice of black America," is currently serving life without parole in Pennsylvania's death row prison. He was convicted and sentenced to death twice for the killing of Officer Daniel Faulkner 30 years ago, but has been fighting to overturn his sentence ever since.
In a 5-4 decision on Tuesday, the court overruled a lower court that had thrown out Abu-Jamal's death penalty conviction, calling it "arbitrary" and "irrational." It gave Abu-Jamal the right to have his sentence reviewed by a federal judge in Pennsylvania.
The justice department filed an appeal of this decision, but justices refused on Tuesday to hear it, saying that lower courts had ruled correctly in throwing out Abu-Jamal's death sentence.
The court also rejected the justice department's argument that a lower court "erred" when it threw out his death penalty because the evidence against him was insufficient and new information had been discovered over time, and sent that case back to federal court in Pennsylvania for re-evaluation of the sentence.
"Today's decision is an important victory for Mumia Abu-Jamal," said Robert Raciti, one of his attorneys. "It sends a message that the courts will not tolerate arbitrary and capricious death sentences."
The justice department declined to comment on Tuesday's ruling.
Abu-Jamal was convicted in 1982 for Faulkner's shooting, although he maintained his innocence. He has been a figurehead for the Black Panther party and was dubbed "the voice of black America" by Martin Luther King Jr.'s widow.
He is widely known for his commentary on social issues in Philadelphia and has recorded 12 albums to date.
Abu-Jamal had appealed a 2008 decision by the Supreme Court to uphold a federal appeals court ruling that threw out his death sentence, but he was not granted a new trial. At that time, the court said Abu-Jamal did not have to prove his innocence in order for his death penalty conviction to be thrown out.
It also overturned a 1972 Supreme Court decision that had ruled it unconstitutional to execute minors at the age of 16 or 17. Abu-Jamal was 30 when he shot Faulkner, though his attorneys argued on Tuesday that there is no evidence linking him to the crime.
The case has been closely watched by rights advocates around the world and sparked widespread protests in Philadelphia. The court's decision on Tuesday also comes amid a broader national debate about the death penalty, especially after the botched execution of an Ohio man last week who was put to death by lethal injection.
In its ruling on Tuesday, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the justices "had not yet considered whether or not the Eighth Amendment permits imposition of a death sentence for a defendant who did not actually kill anyone" and sent the case back to federal court in Pennsylvania to re-evaluate Abu-Jamal's sentence.
The court also noted that it had previously "rejected attempts by defendants to obtain relief on this basis," including those of John Spenkelink, Charles Campbell and Thomas Thompson.
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote the majority opinion for the court in both cases, which was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. The other justices dissented.
The case is called Miller - El v. Dretke. Abu-Jamal's attorneys said they would file a motion in federal court on Wednesday for a new sentencing hearing. They will then request a delay of Abu-Jamal's execution, which was scheduled for March 3.
Abu-Jamal has been eligible to receive a death sentence twice. He had previously been sentenced to death in 1986 but that ruling was later overturned on appeal. His most recent death penalty verdict came in the original case of Commonwealth v. Abu - Jamal in 2001.
Abu-Jamal has also won other appeals, including a decision by a federal court to throw out his death sentence because the jury had been misled on sentencing procedures and because he was denied effective assistance from counsel at trial. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling that threw out Abu-Jamal's death penalty in 2008.
But federal Judge William Yohn, who presided over both of Abu-Jamal's trials, ruled last year that there was enough evidence to support the second death sentence against Abu - Jamal and should not be thrown out. He also wrote that if a new sentencing hearing is ordered by a federal judge in Pennsylvania, it should be conducted before Abu-Jamal's scheduled execution date of March 3.
The justice department appealed Yohn's decision to the Supreme Court but was denied on Tuesday, prompting its appeal to reinstate his death sentence. The court declined that request as well.
Abu-Jamal has also been the subject of numerous documentaries and books, including "Redemption" by Alan Rickman and "J'Accuse" by his brother Keith Abu-Jamal, which was written in French but was translated into English for the book's release on Tuesday.
The death row prisoner has also been a source of inspiration for activists around the world, including those who rally against capital punishment.
In 2011, Abu-Jamal was awarded France's top honor in recognition of his life as a journalist and human rights advocate.
"This is a huge victory," said Keith Abu - Jamal. "My brother has been fighting for this for decades."
The case also comes amid mounting pressure from death row activists, including Amnesty International and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, who have criticized the justice department for pursuing executions in a case where Abu - Jamal did not kill anyone.
In 2012, the justice department decided to proceed with the scheduled execution of John Campbell, even though he had never been convicted or sentenced to death before and was only scheduled to be executed after pleading guilty to two counts of rape. That decision sparked protests in Washington from activists who said it was unconstitutional for the justice department to execute someone who did not kill anyone.
The case comes amid a broader national debate about the death penalty, especially following the botched execution of an Ohio man last week who was put to death by lethal injection. The justices refused on Tuesday to hear that case as well.
The court has previously upheld the constitutionality of the death penalty but had been weighing whether it would consider a case where a defendant did not kill anyone. Abu-Jamal's case was seen as an important test for how the justice department would handle such a scenario.
"It is difficult to understand why the court has decided to grant review in this case," said Deborah K. Rhode, a law professor at Stanford Law School. "Abu - Jamal has already won two death sentences and multiple appeals. His sentence should not be reinstated."
Abu-Jamal was initially convicted for Faulkner's killing in 1982. He was sentenced to death twice, in 1986 and 2001, but his original death sentence was overturned on appeal because the jury had been misled on sentencing procedures and because he was denied effective assistance from counsel at trial.
In its decision on Tuesday, the court wrote that "the evidence against Abu - Jamal was strong," citing witnesses who identified him as a suspect in Faulkner's shooting and the testimony of a ballistics expert who testified that a bullet found at the scene matched one fired from Abu-Jamal's gun.
But it also wrote that "the evidence did not prove conclusively whether or not Abu - Jamal was guilty."
The court said Abu-Jamal had been denied effective assistance of counsel because his original defense attorney, William Kunstler, failed to cross examine a key prosecution witness. It also noted that the jury had been misled about sentencing procedures and that it "must determine whether or not Abu - Jamal should be put to death."
Abu-Jamal's lawyers said they would file a motion in federal court on Wednesday for a new sentencing hearing. They will then request a delay of Abu-Jamal's execution, which was scheduled for March 3.
