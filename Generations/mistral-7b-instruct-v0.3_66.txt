 Yes, that's correct. At the time of his transfer from Valencia to Tottenham Hotspur in 2013, Roberto Soldado was indeed considered a quality striker with significant La Liga and international experience. He had scored 89 goals in 217 appearances for Valencia CF and represented Spain in several major tournaments including the 2010 World Cup and Euro 2012. However, his tenure at Tottenham was not as successful as expected, as he struggled to find the back of the net consistently. He scored only 15 goals in 69 appearances for Spurs before being sold to Villarreal CF in 2015.
