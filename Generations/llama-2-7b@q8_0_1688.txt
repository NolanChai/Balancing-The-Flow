### Solution:
In order to obtain the value for the number, the program would need to parse the text and find all occurrences of "$" in the string and then multiply it by 1000 (i.e. replace " " with ""). Then sum up the total and output the result.

```python
value = int(raw_input())
for i in raw_input().split():
    value *= 1000;
value += value;
print(value);
```
