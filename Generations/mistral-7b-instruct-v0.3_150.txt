 It seems like you're referring to a satirical or humorous list of awards. While I don't have real-time access to current events or news, I can help you understand that such a list is meant to be amusing and doesn't represent official recognitions or honors. For example:

1. International Man of the Year: Vladimir Putin - A leader known for his political influence on the global stage.
2. Humanitarian of the Year: Kim Jong-Un - The leader of North Korea, who is often criticized for human rights violations, but this award is likely meant to be ironic due to the contrast between the title and his actual actions.
3. Fashion Icon of the Year: Kim Kardashian - A popular celebrity known for her influential style in fashion and beauty trends.
4. Philanthropist of the Year: Elon Musk - The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, who has donated millions to various causes, including renewable energy research and education.
