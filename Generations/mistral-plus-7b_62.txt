Revlon has been facing a lot of backlash lately over the treatment of its employees and workers in other countries. The company's CEO, Ron Perelman, has been accused of creating an environment of harassment, intimidation, and discrimination. Twitter users have taken to social media to express their outrage at these allegations and share some jokes about them in order to lighten the mood.

One user joked that Revlon should change its slogan from “the face of beauty” to “the face of bullying.” Others made jokes about Perelman's lack of empathy or his tendency to take advantage of others. Some even tweeted about how he would make a great villain in an action movie.

No matter what the jokes are, it is clear that Twitter users are not pleased with Revlon and its CEO. They want justice for those who have been mistreated by this company and hope that their voices will be heard loud and clear.
