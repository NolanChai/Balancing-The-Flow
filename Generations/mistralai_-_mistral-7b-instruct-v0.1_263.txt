 It's not uncommon for people to experience cravings while traveling, and scientists believe that this may be due to the change in atmosphere. When we are at high altitudes, our sense of smell is altered. This can cause us to crave certain foods and drinks that we normally wouldn't have a desire for.

In the case of tomato juice or bloody Marys, the acidity and saltiness of these drinks may be particularly appealing when our senses are heightened. Additionally, the carbonation in these drinks may also help to counteract the nauseating feeling that can sometimes accompany flying.

It's important to note that while cravings can be annoying and disruptive, they are generally not harmful. If you find yourself craving something in particular while traveling, try to indulge it in moderation and make sure you stay hydrated.
