### Explanation:
This is a gif from the movie *The Edge*. The main character of the film (played by Anthony Hopkins) was stuck out in the wilderness with another man, and they were being stalked by a bear. The second man was shot by an arrow through the head, but not before he managed to throw his camera at the bear, which was then mauled by the animal.

### Code:
```
import io
import requests
from PIL import Image

image_url = "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3o6Zt9MmRfU/maxresdefault.jpg"
response = requests.get(image_url)
image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(response.content))
image.save("bear_photo.gif")
```
