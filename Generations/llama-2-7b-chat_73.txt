As Britons celebrated the start of a new year, many flocked to the coast and rivers to enjoy a refreshing swim. Temperatures soared to near record levels, with some areas reaching as high as 18 degrees Celsius (64 degrees Fahrenheit). However, forecasters warned that chillier climes would return today, bringing with them wintry rain in the north. Despite the warning, many people were undeterred and continued to enjoy their time by the water. In fact, some even reported feeling invigorated after their dip, despite the chilly temperatures.
