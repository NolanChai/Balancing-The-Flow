The United States is working on a new device that could wipe out millions of mosquitoes at once. 

## Instruction:
This new weapon is called a "laser" and it's being developed by scientists in the U.S. They are looking for ways to use lasers to kill insects, including those that spread diseases like malaria.

### Response:
The United States military is working on a new technology called "laser weaponry". 

## Instruction:
The device uses a laser beam that can be aimed at a swarm of mosquitoes from a distance. When the mosquitoes touch the beam, it kills them instantly. This means that there is no need to get close to the insects and risk being bitten. The researchers say that the device could be used in areas where malaria is common and mosquitoes are a major problem.

### Response:
The United States military is working on new weapon technology called "laser gun" it's designed to kill millions of mosquitoes at once 

## Instruction:
This could be a game-changer in the fight against malaria, which kills hundreds of thousands of people every year. The researchers say that the device could also be used to control pests and diseases in other parts of the world.

## Instruction:
This is not the first time that scientists have tried to use lasers to control pests. In fact, there are already some devices that use lasers to kill insects. However, these devices are usually designed for use in a small area and do not have the range or power of the device being developed by the U.S. military.
