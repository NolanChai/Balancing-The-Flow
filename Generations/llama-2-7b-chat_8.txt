The 75-year-old man was watching a match between two local teams at a village green in Suffolk when he was struck by the ball, which was bowled by a player from one of the teams. Emergency services were called to the scene and the pensioner was rushed to hospital, but sadly he succumbed to his injuries. The match was immediately abandoned and an investigation has been launched into the incident.
