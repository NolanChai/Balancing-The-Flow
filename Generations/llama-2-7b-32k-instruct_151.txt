Marlboro maker Altria Group has been accused of targeting children and young adults with marketing strategies for its Marlboro Menthol cigarettes, the Daily Mail reported Monday. 
  
 The tobacco industry giant is facing a lawsuit from a group that claims the company uses false or misleading advertising and packaging to lure consumers into buying the mentholated cigarette brand, which has been linked to an increased risk of disease among young smokers. 
  
 According to the complaint, Altria's Marlboro Menthol ads use images and text that "appeal to youth by glamourizing, sexualizing, and romanticizing smoking and smokers." 
  
 The lawsuit was brought against the company by the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and other public health groups, who claim Altria uses social media platforms like Instagram and Twitter to target young adults. 
  
 In one advertisement featured on a billboard in New York City's Times Square that reads "Find Your Way Back." A man is seen leaning against the wall as another man approaches him with a lighter, ready to light his cigarette. 
  
 The plaintiffs say Altria's targeted marketing violates federal laws which prohibit the use of misleading advertising and packaging that appeal to youth. They want Marlboro Menthol cigarettes taken off the market until Altria corrects its marketing practices. 
  
 In a statement, Altria Group said it "has never marketed or sold mentholated cigarette products in a manner intended to appeal to youth." 
  
 The company also said that the complaint is without merit and will defend itself against the allegations vigorously. 
  
 According to Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids President Matthew L. Myers, Altria's tactics are "aimed at creating a new generation of menthol smokers." 
  
 The suit comes just days after another major cigarette maker, Reynolds American Inc., agreed to pay $27 million to settle similar claims that it targeted young people with its Camel No. 9 cigarettes, the New York Times reported Friday.
