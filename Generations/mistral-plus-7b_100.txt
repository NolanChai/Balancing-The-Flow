The number of under-25s being diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases has climbed almost 20% in the last year. In total, there were 786,139 cases of STIs diagnosed in England during 2012, compared to 648,863 diagnoses in 2011.

The rise was particularly significant among young people, with the number of under-25s diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhoea or genital warts increasing by almost a fifth. There were 240,387 diagnoses of these three STIs in those aged between 16 and 24 last year, compared to 202,795 the year before.

Experts have warned that young people are still not taking proper precautions when it comes to sex, with many admitting they do not use a condom every time they have intercourse.
