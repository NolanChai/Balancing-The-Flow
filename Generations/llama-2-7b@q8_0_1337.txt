### Explanation:

There are five cities. One of them has the most Christmas spirit in the world, and two others have less than half that amount (each with an "x" next to it). The fifth city's name starts with the same letter as the first city. You can use the following rules for determining which is which:
* If both cities start with the same letter, then one has the most spirit and the other does not have much at all (so "A" has a lot of Christmas spirit).
* If both cities are capitalized, they both do. If either city is lowercase, it doesn't (e.g. "a" only has enough).
* If one city ends with an "-er", the other does not (e.g. "Farmer" and "Town").
