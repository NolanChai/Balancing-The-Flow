A pensioner was killed after being struck in the head by a cricket ball during a charity match at a village ground. David Meredith, 78, suffered a severe blow to his head from a ball and died later in hospital. He was watching the game on Saturday afternoon at Moseley Cricket Club when he was hit by an errant delivery from a junior player. The club has suspended all youth cricket activities as a mark of respect for Mr Meredith, who died in hospital after the accident.

West Midlands Ambulance Service said it was called to the club shortly before 2pm and sent paramedics to the scene. They treated Mr Meredith at the ground before he was taken by ambulance to Good Hope Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
