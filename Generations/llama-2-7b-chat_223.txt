"I'm glad he's standing up for himself and not letting the haters get to him," said friend Margo Peppers, who witnessed the incident. "As a father myself, I can only imagine how difficult it must be to deal with such vile comments, especially when you're just trying to do your best by your kids."
### Additional Information:
Doyin Richards, a 38-year-old marketing manager, posted the picture on his Instagram account last weekend, showing him playing peekaboo with his daughters, aged three and five. Within hours, he began receiving racist comments from trolls who claimed that he was not fit to be a father because of his race.
### Conclusion:
"I'm just glad that Doyin is not letting these people get him down," said Peppers. "He's an amazing father and an amazing person, and he deserves all the support and love in the world."
