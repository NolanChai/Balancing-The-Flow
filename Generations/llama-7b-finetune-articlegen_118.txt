Danielle Bowman's addiction was as extreme and as dangerous as that of any hard drug taker. As a student, she would take 1500 painkillers a month - and only stopped because her family threatened to call the police if she did not. The 19-year-old suffered from a rare condition called myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) which makes sufferers feel exhausted all the time. She became so obsessed with finding a cure, that she took an overdose of painkillers last month in her family home in Newcastle . Miss Bowman would take between 10 and 20 pills each morning to ease her muscles and joints but then she began to need more as they stopped working. She said: 'I used to start the day with about ten or so, but by lunchtime I had to have another five or six - this went on all day.' Her parents noticed something was not right when their daughter had a breakdown in her last year of school after she failed a biology exam. They took her to the doctor and found out that she suffered from ME which affects about 150,000 people worldwide but has no cure . As well as taking pills, she would also take drugs such as Ritalin - a drug normally given to children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) - and Lyrica for nerve damage. But the family say her addiction was as bad as those who suffer from alcohol or drug dependence. The youngster has now stopped taking drugs but is still undergoing therapy . Speaking to MailOnline, Miss Bowman said: 'I have always had a very close relationship with my parents and I feel like they are my best friends. 'My mum knew that if something was wrong it wouldn't be good for me - she is my rock. 'If my parents hadn't been around to help then who knows where I would be now.' In November last year, Miss Bowman took an overdose of painkillers and was admitted to intensive care in Newcastle. Her mum, Sarah Bowman said: 'I went out the room one evening while she had gone upstairs to take her pills - then all I heard was my husband screaming. 'Danielle had taken too many and was unconscious. She was put on a life support machine that night but thankfully she woke up three days later in intensive care.' Now the family have set up an online campaign, called 'CUREME' to try and raise money for research into ME and other chronic illnesses. Miss Bowman added: 'I am really grateful I still have my life - that is all thanks to my parents. If it was down to me I would be dead now because this was my second attempt at taking too many pills.' She said she had been trying for so long to find a cure and had tried everything from acupuncture, hypnotherapy, yoga, meditation and diet that she could not handle being told there is no answer. Her parents have set up an online campaign, called 'CUREME' to try and raise money for research into ME and other chronic illnesses . Miss Bowman added: 'I tried everything I could think of to help me but nothing worked - all that was left was to take painkillers. 'There is no cure and this really upset me because I had been looking for one for so long. 'If it wasn't for my parents, I don't know what would have happened.' The family have now set up a page on the JustGiving website where they are appealing to people for help and hope to raise at least Â£500 towards researching ME - the only disease in the UK that has no treatment or cure. Her mum, Sarah Bowman added: 'Danielle has always been very independent but we really struggled with her as she started taking these drugs. 'I had to be really strict and she would get really angry but I couldn't give into it because she was becoming dependent on the pills. It got to a stage where it was like we were living in prison - all of her energy went into finding the next fix.' The family are now campaigning for better support and understanding of ME sufferers and hope to raise enough money to go towards research . Speaking about her recovery, Miss Bowman said: 'I am now recovering from this illness. I have got rid of all my medication except for Lyrica because it is the only thing that helps me. 'The support from family has been amazing and without them I would be no where near where I am today.' She added: 'I will never take these drugs again - even if I feel like it - because I don't want to have another addiction.' The family are now campaigning for better support and understanding of ME sufferers. Sarah Bowman said: 'My daughter has had this illness since she was 13 years old but there is still no cure. 'I am so worried about what the future holds for her as I have been told that after two or three years, you get a bit better and then the symptoms return.' She added: 'There needs to be more research into this illness - it should not be ignored.' To donate visit: www.justgiving.com/cureme
