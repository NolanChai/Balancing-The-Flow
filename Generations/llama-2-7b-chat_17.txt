The scientists, working at the University of California, San Diego, have already tested their device on a small scale and say it is 100% effective in eliminating the insects. The laser gun uses a special wavelength of light to disrupt the mosquito's nervous system, causing them to die almost instantly.

### Question:
What are the potential benefits of this new technology?

### Answer:
The potential benefits of this new technology are vast. Not only could it help to eradicate diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, but it could also reduce the number of mosquito-borne illnesses in general. This could have a significant impact on public health, particularly in areas where mosquito-borne diseases are common. Additionally, the technology could be used to control other pests, such as ticks and flies, which could also have important benefits for human health and quality of life.
