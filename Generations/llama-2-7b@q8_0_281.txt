<p>I'm really worried about this. My daughter is constantly being told she needs to look like a super model and my son is constantly being told he needs to be a football star and I don't know what to do anymore. All I ever hear are negative things from the media and people around me. If you could just give us some tips on how to keep our kids positive then that would be great!</p>

<p>It is quite depressing that so many children are under constant scrutiny from friends, family, teachers and even strangers in the street. It can be overwhelming for them at times but it's up to us as parents to try and shield them from this pressure.</p>

<p>Emma Thompson is right. We have to try to teach our kids that they are good enough just the way they are. When you tell your kids they aren't good enough because of their weight, hair, height, or any other reason it can be very damaging. Try not to compare them to others and also try not to let anyone else compare them to someone else.</p>

<p>I think we are doing a lot more for our kids than we realise. As adults we often criticise what they do when in fact, if you were their age, would you be able to do any better?</p>

<p>We have to remember that this is not a competition and that our children will all grow up in different ways.</p>

<p>The best way we can help is by being there for our kids. Make sure they know that you are always happy to listen when they need someone to talk to. Give them lots of encouragement so they feel good about themselves and what they do.</p>

<p>As parents we need to make sure we are taking care of ourselves as well. We can't be there for our kids all the time and if we don't take breaks from work or socialising, then we may start to feel overwhelmed by everything that is going on.</p>

<p>It's important to make sure that your children are getting enough sleep. Lack of sleep can have a huge impact on their mood and behaviour so try not to let them stay up too late or get up too early in the morning.</p>

<p>Another thing we need to be careful of is what we say to our kids. It's easy for us adults to get caught up in saying negative things like "you can never do anything right" or "you are so dumb". You don't want your children thinking that they aren't good enough because they might start believing it too.</p>

<p>It is hard to deal with pressure but we need to remember that our kids will grow up and make their own decisions about what they do in life. If you want them to be happy then just try your best every day!</p>
