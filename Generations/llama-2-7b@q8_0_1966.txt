In this example, we are given some information and asked to explain or give an example of that information in our own words. We are then presented with three statements regarding that topic which could be true (T), false (F) or "cannot say".

If we want the answer to be T for any one of those questions, it is enough to just add 'I agree'. If we want the answer to be F, we must give an explanation why our statement is in fact not correct. 

In this example we are asked what a bird is like and given information about falcons. Our answers may reflect our opinion or beliefs (T) or they can simply provide more information for readers who might want to learn more on the topic. We can choose any of these birds, but I will use falcons since it was mentioned in the example text.

Falcons are birds which are members of the genus Falco and belong to a family that includes parrots. There are 12 species of them in North America alone: American kestrel (T), peregrine falcon, prairie falcon, merlin, gyrfalcon and northern harrier. They also eat insects such as ants or termites when they can find any at all; otherwise their diet consists mostly of fish or small mammals such as voles or rodents like meerkats which are found underground during winter time due to extreme cold conditions up there where these birds live!

### Explanation:
This question is a common type in the IELTS exam. In this example, we are asked about our opinion on whether something is true or false and we need to explain it in our own words with some supporting evidence (either from our experience, facts or examples). There are three possible answers that can be given: True (T), False (F) or "can't say".

### Analysis:
1. The question starts off by asking us what we think about an aspect of human behaviour which has been studied before in psychology courses such as cognitive science and evolutionary biology (i e : Why do humans love to listen music?). This makes sense because humans are animals too so there must be similarities between our brains and those who make up their own worlds through art forms like music!
2. The question then goes on saying that this particular behaviour was observed among "birds" which means either one single species or all kinds together since we know from nature documentaries how many types exist out there today with different colours on feathers depending if they're male/female etc... This makes sense because birds are animals too so there must be similarities between their brains and those who make up their own worlds through art forms like music!
3. The question then goes on saying that this particular behaviour was observed among "falcons" which means either one single species or all kinds together since we know from nature documentaries how many types exist out there today with different colours on feathers depending if they're male/female etc... This makes sense because falcons are animals too so there must be similarities between their brains and those who make up their own worlds through art forms like music!
4. Finally, we get asked whether this behaviour is true or false which means that if it were true then humans would love to listen music just as much as birds do because both share certain characteristics such as being social animals living in groups with different roles assigned by nature (i e : males sing more than females). 
5. The answer options are True (T), False (F) or "cannot say". In this case, I would choose False since we don't know if it's true or not! If you want to make an informed decision though then go ahead and pick True (T)!
