The video, which was played for jurors in Pedro Hernandezâ€™s trial, showed the 53-year-old man mimicking the act of choking Etan as he described how he lured the youngster into a basement and strangled him to death with his hands.

Hernandez is charged with kidnapping and murdering Etan in 1979 after taking him from a street corner near his Manhattan home where he was waiting for a school bus.
