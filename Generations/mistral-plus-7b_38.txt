A judge Friday upheld a Cleveland, Ohio, jury's recommendation that convicted serial killer Anthony Sowell be sentenced to death for the 2010 slayings of eleven women whose bodies were found in his house. The jury found Sowell guilty earlier this week on aggravated murder and kidnapping charges stemming from the killings. He faces a maximum sentence of life in prison without parole for each of the victims.

Sowell's trial has received widespread media attention due to the horrific nature of the crimes and the gruesome details that emerged during the proceedings. The jury heard testimony about how Sowell lured his victims to his home with drugs or alcohol, then strangled them and stuffed their bodies into garbage bags. Many of the women were found in plastic containers inside Sowell's home.

After hearing the evidence, the jury took only three hours to recommend that Sowell be sentenced to death for each victim. The judge accepted the jury's recommendation and will formally sentence Sowell to death at a later date.
