> Roy Hodgson has come under fire for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia.

> A statement by the Football Association on Saturday said "it is with deep regret" that Hodgson revealed to journalists what Sterling had told him in a dressing room meeting at Wembley.

> The England manager has apologised to Sterling and the FA, but his admission has been branded "totally disgraceful" by former England striker Gary Lineker.

> It was reported that the 20-year-old Liverpool forward said he had not had a proper rest since the end of last season because of the international break and his club's pre-season tour of Thailand.

> Sterling, who scored in England's 3-1 win over Estonia, was then dropped from the squad to face Lithuania on Tuesday night.

> "We had a discussion in the dressing room before the game," Hodgson said afterwards. "It didn't take me long to conclude that he was right and we would have to do something about it.

> "I apologise for making his feelings public, but I thought it was important to explain why Raheem wasn't involved in Tuesday's game."

> Lineker said: "It is totally disgraceful. How can you publicly embarrass a young player like that? It is unforgivable."

> The FA statement added: "Roy Hodgson has apologised to the Football Association and Raheem Sterling for sharing information in the post-match press conference after the England game against Estonia on Saturday.

> "The manager has also apologised to the squad for any embarrassment caused."
