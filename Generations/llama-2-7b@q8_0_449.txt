- The reason for this is because most students in these schools have little to no family support at home. Without having that type of support itâ€™s harder to get caught up when you fall behind academically. Also, due to the lack of proper food and shelter it becomes harder to concentrate in school. In turn, the student gets discouraged more often because they know there is a disadvantage for them.
- I believe that this is a valid reason because every child in those schools has different backgrounds but they all have one thing in common which is they are from an ethnic minority. It would be safe to say that they have less support from their families and friends, which would put the students at a disadvantage compared to white people.
