I think it would be interesting to have a website that could track how many calories are in certain foods. For example, if you were to go out for lunch with your friends and wanted to find out what is in the items on the menu, all you would have to do is click on an item and the calorie count for it would pop up. This way people who are trying to watch their weight can make informed decisions about the food they eat. It would be similar to a website that tells you how many calories are in certain drinks (I believe there is one already).
