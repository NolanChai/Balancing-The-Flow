A mass grave containing the remains of 19 people has been discovered by Iraqi security forces near Baiji, a city north of Baghdad that has seen some of the worst fighting since the start of the war in March. The bodies were found with their hands bound behind their backs and their throats slit. Local officials suspect they may be members of Sunni insurgent groups who were executed by government troops.
