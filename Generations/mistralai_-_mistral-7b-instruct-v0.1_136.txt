 The man, who has not been identified, appeared calm and composed as he spoke to investigators from a small, cluttered room in his home. He wore a white robe and spoke in a soft voice, often pausing to catch his breath before continuing with his confession.

In the video, which was recorded on a small handheld camera, the man can be seen holding Patz's body with one hand while miming choking the boy with the other. He then proceeds to pull out what appears to be a knife, and slits the boy's throat.

The man claims that he killed Patz because he was angry at the child for making fun of him at school. He says that he had followed the boy home from school one day and saw an opportunity to attack him when he was alone in the house.

Police have not yet determined whether or not there is enough evidence to charge the man with Patz's murder. The boy's body was found in a park in New York City in 1985, and has been one of the most famous cold cases in American history.
