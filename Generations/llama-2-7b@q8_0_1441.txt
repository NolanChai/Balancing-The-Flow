There is a letter circulating around social media, written by some of Australia's best known entertainers and celebrities from the showbiz world in support of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

They include actors Russell Crowe, Geoffrey Rush, Hugh Jackman, Cate Blanchett and Hugo Weaving, comedians Shaun Micallef and Wil Anderson, musicians Jimmy Barnes, Kylie Minogue and Paul Kelly, chefs Curtis Stone and George Calombaris, newsreader Mike Willesee Junior, and former prime minister Bob Hawke.

The letter has been circulating for the past two weeks but its authors have now confirmed to 60 Minutes that they wrote it in a joint effort to save Chan and Sukumaran from being executed by firing squad on Tuesday night (AEST) next week.
