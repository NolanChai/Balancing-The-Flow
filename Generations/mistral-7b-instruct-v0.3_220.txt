 That's correct! The new National Stadium in Warsaw, Poland was officially opened with a grand celebration on May 5, 2012. The event included a free music festival featuring popular Polish artists such as Sistars, Hey, and O.S.T.R., along with fireworks displays. This stadium is one of the venues for the Euro 2012 football championships, which Poland is co-hosting with Ukraine this year. It has a seating capacity of around 58,000 spectators and was constructed specifically for the tournament.
