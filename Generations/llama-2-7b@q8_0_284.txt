In recent months, Dean Smith’s men have become embroiled in an exciting and controversial promotion battle with Leeds United as well as being in contention for European football. They were able to take advantage of the international break this weekend by getting some much-needed rest before resuming their season at home on Wednesday night against Everton, who are one place behind them in fifth position.

Aston Villa have gone without a win since they beat Fulham 4–1 at Villa Park back on November 1st and have played eight games in total during this period that has been plagued by injury problems which resulted from the team’s exploits last season as well as a lack of quality depth.

Villa, who are now 20th in the table after losing at home to Norwich City on Saturday afternoon, have scored only two goals in their last eight league matches and their worst start to a Premier League campaign since 1998/99 when they finished bottom of Division One (now Championship).
