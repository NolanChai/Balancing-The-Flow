The pilot tried to avoid a collision with another aircraft before the jet hit the ground at Kashan Airport in Iran early on Wednesday morning (local time).

### Analysis:
I think it's sad that there were no survivors, but it is important that we look into why this happened. I hope the investigators can figure out what went wrong and make sure nothing like this happens again.
