1. The claim is an insult to science. It makes the public think that scientists have no common sense. It could cause people to turn away from scientific discoveries and advancements.
2. Let’s do it, but not in Siberia as the place is far too cold. We should find a warm lake in Australia or somewhere like that instead.
3. It was funny when I first heard about it, but then it got boring after a while and it seemed like they were trying to be funny for too long.
4. Why not? If we can do a scientific probe into claims of the 'Siberian Loch Ness monster,' we should definitely do one in a warm place.
5. We should just wait until someone comes forward with proof and then we can make an official announcement about it. Until that happens, we shouldn’t waste our time or resources on something so trivial like this.
6. If they have evidence to support the existence of such a creature, then let them present it. But if not, there is no need to probe anything. It would be like going into an empty room and trying to find out what is in there without any clues or evidence.
7. This sounds like something that should be investigated by science, but I don’t think they should do it with just a scientific probe. They should bring along some cameras as well so they can record whatever happens when they investigate the creature.
8. I agree with the idea of doing a scientific probe into claims of 'Siberian Loch Ness monster'. But only if there is proof that this creature exists in real life and not just an internet myth or story made up by some person on Facebook.
9. They should do it, but they shouldn’t waste any resources on it because we can’t find anything at all if there isn’t even evidence of the creature's existence first! I think this whole idea is silly and pointless unless someone has proof that there really is a 'Siberian Loch Ness monster'.
10. It was funny when I first heard about it, but then it got boring after a while and it seemed like they were trying to be funny for too long.
