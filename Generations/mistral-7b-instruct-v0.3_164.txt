 It seems like you're referring to a hypothetical situation where a poster offering "easy cash" for information has been posted around Cambridge. This could be related to various things, such as research studies, missing persons cases, or even local news stories. However, without more specific details about the content of the poster, it's hard to provide a precise analysis or interpretation.

If you're writing an essay or engaging in a discussion about this topic, you might want to consider exploring themes related to incentives for information sharing, the ethics of offering money for information, potential misuses of such offers, and their impact on local communities. It could also be interesting to research real-life examples where similar posters have been used.

If this is a genuine issue you're encountering in your community, I would advise caution when engaging with these posters and encourage others to do thorough research before sharing personal information. Always prioritize safety and privacy.
