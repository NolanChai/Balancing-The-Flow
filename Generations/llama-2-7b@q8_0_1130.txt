I disagree with this statement.

### Explanation:

The answer is 'I disagree with this statement'. I don't like the idea that people need to be told what they can and cannot do in public places. Theatres should not bring in measures, and if a nude performance was stopped because someone was filming it (without consent), then there was probably something illegal going on which needs dealing with, rather than having some rules that apply specifically to the theatre.
