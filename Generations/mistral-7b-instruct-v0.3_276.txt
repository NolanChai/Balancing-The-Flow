 It seems like you're referring to the tragic fire incident at a garment factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which resulted in the loss of over 100 lives. The fire has indeed raised questions about the accountability and safety measures in place for workers in these factories, many of which supply products to global retailers.

Here's some information on the aftermath:

- Several major brands, including Walmart, Primark, and C&A, have confirmed that they had business links with the factory where the fire occurred. They have vowed to investigate the incident thoroughly and take appropriate actions.
- The Bangladeshi government has called for an investigation into the fire, while workers' rights groups are demanding better safety measures in garment factories.
- The disaster has brought renewed attention to the working conditions in Bangladesh's garment industry, which employs millions of people and contributes significantly to the country's economy.

The situation is indeed a grim reminder of the need for improved safety standards and transparency in global supply chains. Companies and governments must work together to ensure that workers are protected and that such tragedies do not occur again in the future.
