The scientists at the University of California, San Diego have developed a laser gun that can target and kill millions of mosquitoes in just a few seconds. The laser is so powerful that it can effectively vaporize thousands of mosquitoes with each shot, making it an extremely effective tool for mosquito control. The laser has been specifically designed to target adult female mosquitoes, which are the ones that carry diseases like malaria and Zika virus. By using this laser gun, we could significantly reduce the number of mosquitoes in areas where they pose a threat to human health and well-being.
