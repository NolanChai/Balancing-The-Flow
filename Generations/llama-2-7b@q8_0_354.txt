Democrats were quick to accuse Republicans of playing politics with an issue they had pledged would not be politicized. "There should be no partisan games when it comes to our national security," said Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee and a member of the Armed Services Committee. "I'm dismayed that we could not come together on this issue."

The Senate bill would have repealed the 1993 policy banning gays from serving openly in the military, allowing gays to serve as long as they do not publicly acknowledge their sexual orientation. Democrats were pushing for the measure to be included with the National Defense Authorization Act, an omnibus defense bill that funds U.S. forces and would have prevented a shutdown of those operations if Congress fails to pass a new spending package by March 4, as required under current law.

The $680 billion legislation includes pay raises for the military and funding for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It cleared the House last week by a vote of 229-186, with 77 Republicans joining Democrats in favor of the measure. The legislation now goes back to the House because senators made changes to it.
