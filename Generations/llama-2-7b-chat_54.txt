The new app, called "DrinkMate," allows users to take a photo of their drink and then use the app's built-in Breathalyzer to estimate their blood alcohol content (BAC). The app will then automatically post the results to either Facebook or Twitter, along with a photo of the user holding up their drink.
According to the app's creators, DrinkMate is designed to help people "stay responsible and safe while drinking." However, some critics have raised concerns about the accuracy of the Breathalyzer technology and the potential for the app to encourage excessive drinking.
The app is available for free on both iOS and Android devices and has already been downloaded thousands of times since its launch last week. Users can choose whether to post their results publicly or privately, and can also set limits for themselves to help them stay within safe drinking limits.
