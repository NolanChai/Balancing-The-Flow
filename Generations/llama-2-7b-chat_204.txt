An aristocrat's son has died while in police custody in Kenya after being arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol, sparking outrage and demands for justice. The 25-year-old man, identified as Lord Nicholas Sean McDermott, was found unresponsive in his cell early yesterday morning by police officers who were conducting their regular rounds.
According to eyewitnesses, McDermott had been taken into custody after he was involved in a car accident in the capital city of Nairobi late Saturday night. Police reports indicate that he was driving under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.
The death of McDermott has sparked widespread protests and calls for action from Kenya's government and human rights groups, who are demanding answers over how he died in police custody. The authorities have launched an investigation into the matter and promised to take appropriate action against those responsible.
McDermott was a British national and the son of an aristocrat from Scotland. He was in Kenya on vacation at the time of his death. His family has released a statement expressing their shock and grief over the incident, calling for justice to be served.
The incident has raised questions about the treatment of suspects in police custody in Kenya, where there have been numerous cases of abuse and mistreatment in recent years. The government has pledged to address these concerns and ensure that those responsible are held accountable.
In related news, the Kenyan government has announced plans to increase funding for police training and equipment in an effort to improve the country's law enforcement capabilities. The move comes after a series of high-profile incidents involving the police, including the death of McDermott, have highlighted the need for better training and resources.
