Russian President Vladimir Putin today insisted he’ll still be able to work with Mitt Romney on a wide variety of issues despite the Republican candidate’s previous comments. In an interview with ABC, Putin said he was not concerned by Romney calling Russia ‘our No. 1 geopolitical foe’. Putin added: ‘We have already worked effectively with Barack Obama.’ The Russian leader was in New York to attend the UN General Assembly where he will also hold a bilateral meeting with Obama on Thursday. He said he would not allow his comments about Romney to become an issue between him and the US president, adding that it would be a distraction. ‘I think we are capable of working together, despite any misunderstandings,’ Putin said. The Russian leader also insisted he had not taken Romney’s previous comments personally and was confident he could work with the Republican candidate if he wins November’s presidential election.
