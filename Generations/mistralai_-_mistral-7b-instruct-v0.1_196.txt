 images, now you can take them with a smartphone app.

App developers are increasingly offering tools that allow users to create and share their own GIFs, or Graphics Interchange Format files, which can be used on social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.

One of the most popular apps for creating GIFs is called Giphy, which was founded in 2013 and has since been acquired by Snapchat. The app allows users to search for existing GIFs or create their own using a simple interface that lets them select images and add captions or text overlays.

Another popular GIF creation app is called Lens, which was also founded in 2013 and acquired by Snapchat earlier this year. Like Giphy, Lens allows users to create their own GIFs using a library of existing images and animations, as well as the ability to add text overlays or captions.

Other apps that allow users to create GIFs include Riffsy, which was founded in 2013 and offers a larger selection of animations and stickers for creating GIFs, and Fleeko, which allows users to capture video and turn it into a looping GIF with a simple swipe.

Overall, these apps are offering a fun and easy way for people to express themselves creatively and share their sense of humor or personality with others online.
