 The US Department of Transportation recently announced a new rule that will require airlines to display prices for all available seats on their websites, not just those in the "main cabin" section. This rule is intended to make it easier for customers to compare prices across different airlines and find the best deal.

Spirit Airlines has taken issue with the new rule, claiming that it will be difficult for the airline to continue operating efficiently if they are required to display prices for all seats on their website. The airline argues that they need to be able to offer lower prices in order to attract customers, and that if they have to display those prices alongside higher-priced options, they may not be as competitive.

Spirit has also expressed concerns about the cost of complying with the new rule, which requires airlines to update their websites frequently in order to keep up with changing prices. The airline estimates that it could cost them millions of dollars each year to comply with the rule.

Despite these concerns, Spirit has not yet filed an appeal or lawsuit to challenge the new rule. Instead, the airline is continuing to operate under the new guidelines and is working on finding ways to remain competitive in the marketplace.
