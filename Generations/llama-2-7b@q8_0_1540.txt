The number of casualties was high because of the lack of protective equipment and technology. In addition to this, there were poor communication methods. If the war hadn't gone on for as long as it did, the numbers would be less.

### Solution:
If the weapons used were different they could have reduced the amount of people who died or got injured. I think that if the weapons had been more precise then there wouldnâ€™t have been such a high death toll.
