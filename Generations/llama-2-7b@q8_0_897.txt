A former star rower for University of Michigan who aspired to compete in the Olympics was killed on Friday when he was struck by a subway train at New York City's Penn Station.

    The 20-year-old Matthew Harris, who had just finished his first semester at Columbia Law School and was about to go home for winter break, was struck by an Amtrak train near the south end of the station shortly before 5:30 p.m., according to MTA Police.
    The Daily News reported that a witness said Harris was "in a hurry" when he fell onto tracks. Harris' mother said her son had been talking on his cell phone and looking at texts as he tried to make the train home to Connecticut in time for Christmas Day. He missed two trains, according to news reports.
    "We have been informed of this unfortunate incident," Columbia Law School dean Gillian Lester said Friday evening in an e-mail to students that was obtained by The New York Times. "This is a sad and tragic loss for his family and for our community."
