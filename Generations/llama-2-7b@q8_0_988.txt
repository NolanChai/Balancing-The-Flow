- A&E cuts were not responsible for the increase in mortality rates across England, according to new research published by the National Health Service (NHS).
  - The study was a review of research that concluded there is “no clear evidence” of an association between increased A&E attendance and the rise in death rates since 2014.
- The research found that the number of patients treated at major trauma centres had risen by almost 2,500 to 37,896 in England over six years from 2010-11 to 2015-16.
