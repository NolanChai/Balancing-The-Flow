A team of scientists using NASA's Kepler space telescope has discovered an exoplanet that is roughly five times the mass of Jupiter. The newly discovered planet, known as KOI-456b, was found orbiting a star about 300 light years from Earth and is believed to be one of the largest planets yet detected by Kepler.

The discovery of KOI-456b is significant because it provides scientists with another opportunity to study gas giant planets outside our solar system. Gas giants are believed to form in a way that is different than terrestrial planets, and studying them can help us better understand planetary formation and evolution. KOI-456b also offers an insight into the atmospheres of these distant worlds, as well as providing clues about their internal structure.
