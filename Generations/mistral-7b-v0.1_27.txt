I am a little confused by this story, I can not tell if they are saying they dug up the body to do further testing or if they were just trying to identify it with modern technology. If they did dig up the body and test it that is good because they would be able to find out if the man really killed her or not.  It would also help the family know who killed their daughter. I am not sure what kind of technology they used to identify her, but whatever it was must have been amazing for them to find out so much about this case after all this time.
