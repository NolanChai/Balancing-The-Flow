 The new Gorilla Glass is called "Gorilla Glass Victus," and it's been designed to be even stronger and more durable than the original Gorilla Glass. It's also been made to be more responsive to touch, which means that it will be able to detect even the slightest of touches from your finger or any other object.

In addition to its improved durability and sensitivity, Gorilla Glass Victus has also been designed to be more scratch-resistant than the original product. It's been subjected to a series of tests that have shown that it can withstand scratches and other forms of damage much better than traditional glass.

The new Gorilla Glass Victus is already being used in some of the latest smartphones, including the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max, and it's expected to be used in many other devices in the near future. If you own one of these devices or are planning on buying a new gadget soon, then you may want to look for products that feature Gorilla Glass Victus in their screens.
