 The article discusses a recent study that found an increase in the number of young people under the age of 25 being diagnosed with sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in the United States. The study, which was published in the journal Sexually Transmitted Infections, examined data from 2010 to 2013 and found that the rate of STD diagnosis among young people increased by about 15% during this period.
The article also discusses some of the potential reasons behind this increase, including a lack of education and awareness about STDs, as well as factors such as increased sexual activity and access to healthcare. It notes that while there have been some efforts to improve STD prevention and treatment, more needs to be done to address this growing public health issue.
