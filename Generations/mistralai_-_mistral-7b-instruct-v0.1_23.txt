 and his partner, Alexis Mateo, 42, have been dating for nearly three decades, and they say their love has only grown stronger in that time. They met in high school when they were both members of the school's drama club.

"I had a crush on him from the moment I laid eyes on him," Alexis recalls. "He was just so charming and funny, and he always made me laugh."

Allen, who is Jewish, says that their shared love for the theater brought them together. He was the son of an actress, and his parents had taken him to see many Broadway shows growing up. Alexis, who is Mexican-American, had also been a fan of the theater since childhood.

Over the years, they pursued careers in theater together, with Allen becoming a successful producer and Alexis acting on stage and screen. They have been married for 12 years and have two children together.

Their relationship has not always been easy, however. Like many couples, they have faced their share of challenges, including infidelity on both sides and the stress of maintaining a long-distance relationship while Allen was working in Hollywood for several years.

But they say that their love for each other and their shared passion for the theater have helped them through those difficult times.

"We're very fortunate to have found each other," Alexis says. "We've been through a lot together, but I wouldn't trade our life for anything."

Allen adds: "We're truly blessed to be able to share this journey with one another. We may have our ups and downs, but we're always there for each other, no matter what."
