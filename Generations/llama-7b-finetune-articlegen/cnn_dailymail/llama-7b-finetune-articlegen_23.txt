Allen Sheinman was walking his dog through the park one day when he bumped into his future wife . Sheinman and Mary Lopez met while taking their dogs for a walk in New York's Central Park. It sounds like it could be the start of a Hollywood romance, but Allen Sheinman, 58, insists it was not love at first sight. The pair had been living just two blocks apart on Manhattanâ€™s Upper West Side before they met and even crossed paths several times without recognising each other as neighbours. But when he bumped into her one afternoon while walking their dogs through the park, fate intervened, leading to an unlikely romance which has left them wondering if it is really a case of love at first sight or just blind luck. Sheinman had recently moved in next door to Lopez and was out with his golden retriever when they crossed paths. Lopez, 59, was walking her dog Coco and immediately noticed the handsome new neighbour. Sheinman told ABC news: 'I don't know what she saw, but I just knew that she was somebody special.' The pair fell in love after meeting by chance while taking their dogs for a walk . They were both married at the time and had never really considered the idea of being involved with someone new. But that day changed everything, he said: 'We started to talk and we hit it off immediately... and I thought to myself this is someone special.' They continued seeing each other in Central Park over the next few weeks as they took their dogs for a walk. Sheinman says he fell hard for Lopez on their first meeting . They both came from similar backgrounds - neither had children, they were divorced and had been living alone. But despite the obvious similarities, there was something that set them apart at the time. 'She is like nothing I've ever met,' Sheinman says. 'I never felt so connected to anybody in my whole life.' The couple fell for each other quickly, but they were both married at the time . Lopez describes Sheinman as being a man of few words and that was one of things she loved about him. He was quiet and thoughtful and he didn't make her feel rushed to make decisions when it came to their relationship. 'I just wanted to spend more time with him,' said Sheinman, who is now divorced from his former wife . He had been married for 23 years but says that when he met Lopez, the idea of being involved with someone else was never really something he'd thought about. But they hit it off and he found himself wanting to spend more time with her. 'I just wanted to spend more time with him,' said Sheinman who is now divorced from his former wife. Their relationship grew so quickly that before long, Lopez had moved in next door to Sheinman, and within three months they were married. But despite being very happy together the pair didn't rush into their marriage, saying they just felt like it was right . They said they did not feel pressured by any outside influence but rather felt a genuine connection that brought them together. The couple are still happily married and Sheinman says he is amazed at how things have fallen into place. 'It's like we were destined to meet each other,' He said. 'I don't know what she saw, but I just knew that she was somebody special.' Lopez has described the meeting as a 'blind date' and says Sheinman made her feel completely at ease. They say they don't believe in love at first sight but rather it is simply a case of fate bringing them together . But even after two years of marriage, Sheinman said he can still remember how special Lopez felt to him the first time that they met. 'It was just this incredible connection and I knew right away,' Sheinman recalls. He said he had never experienced such a feeling before with another woman and says that even after all these years, it is something that has never changed for him. Lopez also describes the meeting as being like an instant attraction and says she fell in love with him when they first met. She says there is something about him that just makes her want to be close to him at all times . 'We were both very happy, but it wasn't until we were sitting at this bar one night that I realised how much I was falling for him,' Lopez recalled. After two years of being married the couple said they don't believe in love at first sight but rather feel like they are simply fated to be together. They say they have a lot of fun together and enjoy spending time with their dogs, which they describe as being their children. 'It's just this incredible connection and I knew right away,' Sheinman recalls . It seems that fate played an important role in bringing these two people together. In 1950, the film Love At First Bite was released starring actor George Hamilton as a vampire who falls for a beautiful woman after meeting her while walking his dog on the streets of Manhattan's Central Park. But it turns out that this story might have been based more in reality than fiction because Sheinman and Lopez met there too - and they didn't turn into vampires afterwards. The couple have now been married for two years, but still say their connection was instant . For Sheinman, who describes himself as a man of few words, meeting his future wife changed everything he thought about what love might feel like to him.
