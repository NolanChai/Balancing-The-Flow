The Spice Girls split up in 2001 after selling more than 55million records worldwide . Viva Forever, the new musical based on the story of the Spice Girls which opened in London's West End last night, is proving a box-office hit with some tickets selling for up to £320. The group split up in 2001 after they sold more than 55million records worldwide. And even though all five members went on to have successful solo careers, the Spice Girls will forever be remembered as the group that sang Wannabe and Spice Up Your Life.

Successful career: Mel B (left), Emma Bunton (middle) and Geri Halliwell (right) all launched successful solo careers since the group split up more than a decade ago . However, it seems that the Spice Girls' reunion this year has given them a second chance at stardom. The group - Melanie Brown, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Geri Halliwell and Melanie Chisholm (Mel C) - reunited earlier this year for their first ever tour together in six years after they decided to give it another go. However, the Spice Girls' return to fame has been met with a number of protests from anti-Spice Girl campaigners who have long expressed their hatred towards the girl group. In June, Mr Hosking joined fellow picketers outside London’s Royal Albert Hall ahead of the band's first gig in 14 years. The men waved placards branding them 'The most rubbish girl band in history', while others held up 'Spice girls - no thanks!' and 'Six legs good, four legs better.' Mr Hosking even took a protest sign to the Spice Girls' comeback concert at Wembley Stadium in August. The campaigner said: 'I am really pleased with their performance tonight because I was expecting them to be bad - but they were not so bad!' But the protests have not stopped there. Last month, anti-Spice Girl campaigners staged a picket outside London's O2 Arena before one of the group’s shows as part of their world tour.

Their music was rubbish.’ He added: ‘It seems like it has become a bit of a joke now and people don’t take them seriously anymore so that is good for me as well! ‘If they come back again I will be there again with my protest signs - but I am not sure if any of the other guys will turn up.’ Last month, Mr Hosking said: 'I am going to be there again and I will picket outside again.

Fans were angered when it was revealed that the show was based on a fictionalised account of the Spice Girls and their rise to stardom in 1994 - before any of them had actually split up or launched solo careers.

The Spice Girls have not yet released a statement regarding their new musical . In October, Spice Girls manager Simon Fuller defended his involvement in the show after some fans questioned why he was involved with it considering that there has been no real storyline to base it on.
