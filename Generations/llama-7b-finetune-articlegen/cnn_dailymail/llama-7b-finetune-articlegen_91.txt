The reason for the split is largely down to the fact that we moved far too far apart geographically to maintain any sort of a relationship, but if you want me to be honest I’ll admit she was also a bit . I’d not seen her in nearly three months before our last date and when we did meet up again it all just fell apart. The spark had gone for sure, but at least we can both move on with our lives now that the dust has settled and we know where we stand.
