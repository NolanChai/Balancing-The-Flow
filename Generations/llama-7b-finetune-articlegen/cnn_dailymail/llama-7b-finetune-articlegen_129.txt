A couple whose Navy SEAL son was killed in Afghanistan have joined a class-action lawsuit against the military over an alleged mishandling of his body. Kristie and Charles Stevens, who live in Utah with their four other children, are suing the Department of Defence and Secretary Chuck Hagel claiming that their son, Aaron, 25, was denied a religious service at sea after being killed by an IED explosion on May 19. In an interview with Fox News, Mrs Stevens said she is angry that her family wasn't given the time it needed to recover from her son's death. She also criticised the military for not allowing the SEAL team to retrieve Aaron's body quickly enough.

Charles, pictured, and Kristie Stevens said they weren’t allowed to see their son in his final moments . 'I don't know how much more I can take,' she told Fox News. 'The pain that we have is almost unbearable.' She said her husband, Charles, a Navy veteran who served in the Middle East during Operation Desert Storm, was only able to hold Aaron one last time before he died because it took three hours for military officials to reach him on May 20. The family had already spent over two days waiting at Bagram Air Base outside Kabul after their son's death and were not allowed to go back home until May 26. Kristie Stevens, pictured with her husband Charles and daughter Sydney, is suing the military for $1million . 'That was a horrific period of time,' she told Fox News. Mrs Stevens said the military mishandled Aaron's body in two ways: by not allowing him to have a religious service on a ship at sea before his remains were cremated, and by refusing to return all of his remains for burial with his family . 'We weren’t able to see my son, who was an American hero, we weren't even able to say goodbye.'

Aaron, who graduated from Brigham Young University before he joined the navy's elite SEAL team in September 2010, was serving a six-month deployment when his unit was ambushed by enemy forces. Mrs Stevens said she and her husband were told that their son had been injured while on duty but were not given details about how he died or where the attack took place. She said it wasn't until May 20 - three hours after they found out Aaron had passed away - that military officials arrived at his tent to escort them back home to Utah and to deliver his remains, which she said were 'in pieces'. Kristie Stevens, pictured with her husband Charles, is suing the U.S. government for $1million . She said she was not allowed to see her son or hold him one last time because officials made it clear that she had only ten minutes to pack up his belongings and leave. 'I wanted to go back there,' Mrs Stevens told Fox News of Aaron's tent, adding that she feels he would want to be buried in a place where he was killed. 'That’s something I will always regret.' The couple has filed a $1million wrongful death suit against the Department of Defence and Hagel for what they describe as a lack of religious services and proper treatment of their son's remains after his death. It also accuses military officials of intentionally hiding details about where Aaron was killed from the family to avoid drawing attention to the fact that he died in an IED explosion, which has been blamed for several other high-profile casualties within the SEAL community over the past year.

According to the lawsuit, military officials initially denied Mrs Stevens permission to see her son because they said his body had to be 'cleared' first by Navy medics at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan.
