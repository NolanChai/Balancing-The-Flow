Mr Speaker John Bercow is accused of a breach of Commons rules over his use of public money after it was claimed he charged taxpayers to go on a shopping trip with his wife Sally for £177 in 'petrol, limousine and cash'. The 50-year-old Speaker booked the two cars through Parliament's official car company, who then billed the Commons for the cost. Official rules say that MPs are allowed to use taxpayers money for essential travel costs related to their duties in Parliament - but not for shopping trips or day outings. A Commons spokesman confirmed today it was investigating the claims and said it would take 'action if necessary'. The revelations came as it emerged that Mr Bercow has claimed more than £1million since he became Speaker, including £20,000 for a car last year to use at weekends. He also claimed £317 for two trips to London's luxury Harrods department store, while other expenses included £150 a month on food and drink bills when dining out with ministers. The spokesman said: 'The Speaker is currently reviewing his entitlements following the announcement of changes to expenses rules in July 2010.' He added that MPs were expected to follow parliamentary guidance, which states that they can use the official car service for travel between their home and Parliament on weekdays or during a day's business. 'The Speaker is currently reviewing his entitlements following the announcement of changes to expenses rules in July 2010,' said a Commons spokesman. He added: ‘Members are expected to follow parliamentary guidance, which states that they can use the official car service for travel between their home and Parliament on weekdays or during a day’s business.’ Bercow, who was appointed Speaker in June 2009, had previously been fined £12,500 by the Commons authorities for using taxpayers money to go shopping. In another embarrassment he apologised after it emerged that the Commons paid him more than £3,700 for a flight to Paris in November last year - two months after he announced changes to MPs' expenses. The spokesman said Mr Bercow had not been fined as a result of this latest trip and added: 'The Speaker has agreed to pay the cost of his travel from London to Lincolnshire on 5 December back to the House.' But the incident has reignited anger over Mr Bercow, who was seen as a reformer when he became Speaker. He is also facing questions about why he took time off work to attend his daughter's wedding last month - despite a previous promise not to take holidays on public money unless it had been cleared in advance with the Commons authorities. The Speaker has previously made clear that he expects MPs and ministers to abide by the new rules, which restrict their use of taxpayer-funded second homes. In November 2010 Mr Bercow warned MPs who were trying to wriggle out of paying back overclaimed expenses that they would be in 'contempt' of Parliament if they did not do so. And earlier this month the Speaker said he was investigating two Labour ministers accused of claiming for second homes they did not live in and of using Commons allowances to fund holiday homes abroad. Former Cabinet minister Andy Burnham is facing calls to repay £15,000 while former health secretary Alan Milburn faces accusations that he claimed up to £68,000 a year for a flat near his home in London. He said it was 'totally unacceptable' if MPs were breaking rules or using Commons allowances 'for their own private benefit'. The revelations come at the end of a month during which the House of Lords has been rocked by claims that senior peers were misusing taxpayer-funded second homes. The former Tory minister Lord Hurd, who served in Margaret Thatcher's government as Home Secretary and Foreign Secretary, was forced to pay back £54,000 after it emerged he had claimed for a flat near his home in Oxfordshire despite not living there. He said last night that he regretted 'not taking the trouble to check', but insisted that 'I never used those funds for private purposes'. Labour peer Lord Peston also paid back £9,600 after it emerged that he was claiming taxpayers' money for a flat in London despite living more than 120 miles away. And the Lords authorities are currently investigating claims that five other peers have misused their second homes allowances - including former Cabinet minister Lord Triesman and the father of Chancellor George Osborne, Sir Peter Osborne . The scandals have led to calls for an independent watchdog to be established in the Lords to investigate MPs' expenses. Lib Dem peer Lady Saltoun said: 'The House of Lords has proved itself completely unfit and unable to police itself.' David Cameron pledged to clean up Commons expenses after his election as Prime Minister, but has made clear that he does not believe the rules should be extended to cover MPs' expenditure in the Lords. He said it would be 'very difficult' to bring in similar changes for peers because of the complexity involved. But Lady Saltoun insisted: 'It is time we had a cross-party inquiry into Lords expenses.' She added that she believed that a 'majority' of her fellow peers would support reform, adding: 'I have never heard any lord say they want to continue with these arrangements.' A House of Commons spokesman said the Lords authorities were investigating claims against five peers, but added that no other peers had been accused of misusing their second-home allowances. The spokesman declined to name the peers under investigation or detail which of them faced allegations relating to their use of a flat in London rather than their main residence elsewhere, as Lord Hurd and Lord Peston were both said to have done. The authorities are also examining claims that the former Cabinet minister Lord Triesman had been claiming allowances for a flat in Westminster for up to 13 years even though he lived more than 90 miles away in Hertfordshire. He has said it was an 'oversight' that he continued to claim the second-home allowance despite moving out of London after leaving government in May last year. A spokesman for Lord Triesman added: 'We have no knowledge of any other allegation, but will co-operate fully with any investigation.' He also insisted that he had claimed the flat only because he was still an adviser to Goldman Sachs at the time and needed somewhere central to meet clients. It is not yet known whether Lord Triesman has repaid the money or how much he may owe . A spokesman for Lord Osborne's father, Sir Peter Osborne - who served as an MP from 1958 until 1970 and then a peer from 1973 until 2010 - said: 'Lord Osborne was not aware that he had been claiming the second-home allowance for the flat in London. He has already repaid any sums wrongly claimed.' The spokesman added that Sir Peter, who lives near his son in Cheshire, now used the flat only as an office and to meet clients . Meanwhile, Labour leader Ed Miliband said he would be willing to accept a cap on second-home allowances of £100,000 - which is more than five times higher than the amount being paid by the Coalition government. Mr Miliband has previously rejected calls for MPs' salaries and expenses to be capped at around £65,000 a year. But he said any cap should be based on the average home price in an area, with Londoners given more than those living outside the capital. He told the Sunday Mirror: 'If you want to have proper checks on expense claims, then you need to say how much can they claim for a second home.' Mr Miliband also said that he would consider other reforms suggested by his own backbenchers - including ending allowances for MPs who live in their constituencies and for food and drink when dining out with ministers. The Labour leader is facing increasing pressure from within the party to reform MPs' expenses, following similar calls by Mr Cameron and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg . Mr Miliband added: 'I think there are lots of ideas that we can work on. It has to be a package of measures.' He said he was unlikely to accept suggestions from backbenchers that MPs' second-home allowances should be reduced by 20 per cent as it would hit families in rural areas too hard and could even force some MPs to sell their homes. Mr Miliband said: 'If you look at what has happened with the housing market, there are places where a reduction of 20 per cent is just not viable.' He added: 'People do want us to sort out expenses . It is one of those things that makes people cynical about politics. So I am determined to get it right, and I will do so in the next few months.' Mr Clegg said yesterday that
