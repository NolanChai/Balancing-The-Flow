British MEPs in Brussels were tonight set to be told they can’t speak out on issues like immigration because of ‘directives from the centre’. A row over freedom of speech was triggered after Liberal Democrat Yvette Cooper called for a debate on UK migration policy, but then had her proposal voted down by fellow MEPs in Brussels. Mrs Cooper, who is married to former Labour minister Ed Balls and represents North West England, said the issue needed urgent discussion in a European Parliament meeting tonight. But in an astonishing move, she was blocked from speaking on the motion because of ‘directives’ handed down by the centre, which prevents MEPs from talking about specific issues like immigration policy. The directive was condemned as a 'travesty' by senior Liberal Democrats last night, with one warning that it risked turning the European Parliament into 'a dead parliament'. Mrs Cooper said: ‘This is an issue of huge national importance to the country and the British people need their voice to be heard in Europe. I am going to ask if we can discuss migration and have a debate on it tonight.’ But she was told: ‘The directives from the centre say this topic is not covered today, so I’m afraid you cannot talk about it.’ The directive, which prevents MEPs talking about immigration or economic policies, has been in place since May. But Mrs Cooper's gaffe comes just days after fellow Lib Dem Tim Farron warned that the EU was becoming a ‘dead parliament’ under Brussels’ iron rule and would be toppled by people 'having a pop at Europe'. A senior source said: 'The directive has got nothing to do with immigration, it's just about not talking on economic matters. The idea behind the move is that MEPs cannot speak in favour of or against European Commission proposals as this would be seen as an attempt to interfere in the decision making process.' Mrs Cooper was forced to drop her motion after she was told the issue could not be discussed. Her husband, Ed Balls, is standing down as MP for Morley and Outwood at next year's general election - a move which has been described by one Lib Dem activist as 'a huge blow'. Yvette Cooper's call to have a debate on UK migration policy was blocked because of EU 'directives from the centre' . She was told that she could not talk about immigration, and MEPs were urged not to discuss the issue in general. Mrs Cooper is pictured speaking at Brussels this morning . The directive has been put in place since May and prevents any debate on economic matters, including immigration . An MEP said: ‘There was a huge amount of backlash from all sides when it came into force. People were complaining that there are so many other things they could talk about in the European Parliament, but this directive has completely shut down any discussion at all.’ It comes amid fears that the Lib Dems are going to lose their influence as MEPs in next year's elections. The party faces losing 10 seats out of a total of 73 UK representatives, which is more than any other group and could see it become third party behind Ukip and Labour. A senior figure said: 'This directive from the centre has just added to our woes. It means we are not allowed to talk about issues like immigration, and people aren't going to forget that at election time.' The source also warned of a growing anger among MEPs at what they see as an increasing centralisation of power under Brussels. He said: 'There is a massive sense of frustration. We feel that the European Parliament has been turned into a dead parliament by the centre in Brussels.' A senior Lib Dem said that Mrs Cooper's gaffe would not harm her husband's prospects . A senior Lib Dem source said: 'The directive on economic matters is seen as a big mistake - people are angry about it and there's a sense that it could backfire. The issue of freedom of speech is one that really affects all MEPs, and we don't want to see the European Parliament turned into something that looks like an empty shell.' A spokesman for Mrs Cooper said: 'Yvette was trying to raise the debate on migration because she believes it is a huge issue facing Britain. But this directive means you cannot talk about anything that affects our economy and we have been told by the parliamentary authorities that you can't even refer to it in an amendment or ask questions about it. 'There are very few countries where politicians cannot speak out on these issues and that is what makes it such a travesty.' Yvette Cooper's husband Ed Balls is standing down as MP for Morley and Outwood at next year's general election . Mr Farron, the Liberal Democrat MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale in Cumbria, has said that Brussels will 'be toppled by people having a pop at Europe'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'There are people who want to tear it down. There is an EU-phobia. I think there is an appetite for it in many European countries.' The directive has also been condemned by the leader of UKIP, Nigel Farage, and Labour MEP Catherine Bearder, who said: 'This rule has got nothing to do with immigration - it's about not being allowed to criticise EU economic policy. I think this is a very poor decision.' The directive was first imposed in May after a meeting between the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers. It was brought in under the new rules governing procedure at Strasbourg, which were introduced in January 2013. However, it has been branded a 'totalitarian' move by senior MEPs, who are now trying to get rid of it. A spokesman for the Council of Ministers said: 'The directive on economic matters is one of several directives issued to members of the European Parliament following a meeting between them and us in May 2013.'

Yvette Cooper said: 'There were huge problems when this directive came into force, so I would urge the Commission not to take further measures which will affect our democratic rights. The directive is a huge blow for MEPs' freedom of speech - and ultimately this will hurt people at home as well.'

Migration: A European Union deal to cap benefits for migrants has been agreed by EU ministers, although it must be ratified by national governments. Britain said they would not oppose the move as long as it was backed up with tougher laws on illegal immigration. The controversial proposal, which is expected to be formally signed off in November, would see migrants stripped of their benefits after six months if they cannot find a job or if they refuse an offer of work. Under current rules, migrants can stay for as long as they like without finding a job - and some have been able to live on state handouts alone. The deal was reached in Brussels this morning by EU home affairs ministers and is expected to be backed by British Ministers when it comes before them in November. Under the plans, migrants from outside Europe would not get any social benefits if they came for work purposes. They could only claim jobseeker's allowance and child benefit if they had been unable to find employment within six months of arriving. The European Commission has put forward a proposal on how EU citizens should be allowed to access social security . Migrants from inside Europe would get benefits for three years but then lose their right to claim after that. They would also only get jobseekers' allowance and child benefit in the first six months unless they had been unable to find a job. The deal is expected to come into force at some point next year, although it will require backing from national governments before it becomes law. EU officials believe it could be introduced by March 2014 - but other countries may take longer to ratify the move. MEPs are now calling on national governments to ratify the deal as soon as possible because of fears it will not be in force until late next year, if at all. The European Commission has put forward a proposal on how EU citizens should be allowed to access social security, with benefits payable from the first day they start work or look for jobs. In 2013, the UK spent £8 billion on jobseeker’s allowance alone - enough to build 47 hospitals every year in Britain - and £9 billion on other means-tested benefits such as child benefit. But this deal could save taxpayers at least half of that amount, EU officials claim. The cap is not
