Chief Superintendent Mike Brown of Merseyside Police said that officers must use any means necessary to defend themselves against extremist attacks such as those carried out by 17 year old Londoner Samantha Lewthwaite in Kenya on Saturday. She was captured on camera carrying a machete and reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” before running at police officers with the weapon.
The police officer is seen to fire the Taser at the woman who has been identified as the widow of July 7 London bomber Germaine Lindsay, 29. A man in his 30s who tried to stop her was also shot and she was subsequently arrested .
Mr Brown said: “The officer is trained on how to use it and can make that decision [on whether or not to use the Taser] if they are faced with a risk of harm, or imminent harm.” But he insisted: “There’s no need for an armed police presence in every community. That would be absurd and completely wrong.” The 51-year-old also criticised those who ‘politicise terrorism’, saying: “Anyone who politicises this event and makes it about something that they want to make political capital out of is a disgrace.” Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Mr Brown said he was 'disappointed' by the Prime Minister David Cameron for giving in to demands for more police officers to be armed. He also dismissed as 'fantasy' suggestions that terrorists might try and shoot their way out of jail, after a plot by radicalised inmates at Belmarsh Prison was foiled last weekend. He said: "If you look at the people who are released from prison, if they are violent people - let me be clear, the vast majority of them do not go back into crime." But he added that there 'could be a tiny minority' whose behaviour might become more extreme in custody. Mr Cameron had said on Sunday: "We must make sure our prisons are as safe as possible and we have to make sure we continue to have the right equipment - whether it is X-ray machines, whether it is body scanners, whether it is better training for staff." The Prime Minister also said that a recent increase in violent offences was 'disappointing'. Mr Brown agreed, but told Today: “It’s not down to police officers, we can’t go around the streets and prevent people from being mugged.” He also admitted that his force is facing a budget cut of up to 25 per cent over four years. The Police Federation of England and Wales had demanded that all officers are given access to Tasers to protect against terrorism . Mr Brown said: “If you talk about the public finances in this country at the moment, we have got a really challenging period ahead." He added: "We want to make sure our streets are safe - but that has to be done with the resources available. We can’t go around and create an armed presence on every street corner.” He also said that police officers should not be armed in public places because it would create a ‘huge barrier’ between them and the communities they serve. Mr Brown's comments come after Merseyside Police Chief Constable Jon Murphy told The Guardian newspaper that all police officers should have access to Tasers. He wrote: “Our frontline officers will be expected to tackle a range of threats from terrorism, to environmental protests and the rise in serious violent crime." He added that the force would have 'to look again at its use of weapons' if more officers were to be armed. But Mr Murphy said he was not calling for an increase in armed police patrols in cities, saying it was ‘not sensible’ or a practical response to rising violent crime and terrorism. The National Union of Police Federations (NUPF) had also called for all frontline officers to have access to Tasers as part of the 'modern arsenal' available to police. Its president, Steve White, told The Times: “I would like to see Taser being rolled out across England and Wales so we can be more effective in dealing with violent people." But Mr Brown said that his force already used a 'huge range of weapons' including pepper spray and stun guns - adding that he was ‘very concerned’ about giving every police officer access to firearms. The use of Tasers by officers across the UK is currently under review after 32 people died in their first year on trial. They were also used against an eight-month pregnant woman who had not been arrested for any crime and a 54-year-old grandfather with schizophrenia who was then left unconscious, according to The Guardian . But the Home Office has ruled out arming police officers on all fronts in Britain’s major cities. Mr Cameron also said yesterday that there would be no increase in armed police patrols and the Government had no plans to reintroduce stop-and-search powers as a way of fighting terrorism . He added: "There is an issue about how you protect your staff. I don't think we want to make it more difficult for them." The Home Secretary, Theresa May, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that she would look at the evidence before deciding whether all officers should have Tasers or stun guns in their arsenal of weapons. But Mr Brown said: "If you're going to have a policy - and I don't think we will see a general roll-out, because there are issues about training - you have to have the means necessary to defend yourself." The force’s Deputy Chief Constable Bernard Hogan Howe said that only specially trained firearms officers were currently authorised to carry guns in public places. But Mr Brown added: “If you think about the situation in Kenya, I don't think the police could have done much differently there." The Home Secretary has admitted the number of terrorist plots foiled by security services is now 'well over 50'. Mrs May said that Britain had averted more than 30 plots since David Cameron became Prime Minister in May last year - but insisted she would not be changing any counter-terrorism strategy. She added: "The threat level remains at severe - the threat has been raised from severe to critical on four occasions. It's now well over 50." Mrs May told Today that it was a ‘highly complex problem’ which could not be solved by simply deploying more armed officers in communities. She also said there would be no change to stop-and-search powers as a way of tackling the threat from terrorism . Mrs May added: "I'm looking at all these issues to make sure that we have got the right tools, and it is a very complex problem." It comes after Mr Cameron said on Sunday that there would be no increase in armed police patrols. He said that he did not ‘believe you can stop and search your way out of terrorism’ but added: “We must make sure our prisons are as safe as possible.” The Prime Minister also insisted that the Government was doing everything it could to tackle violent crime, which is now at its highest level for a decade. Mr Cameron told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: "Violent crime has gone up in recent years and I am very concerned about that." But he added: "You can see the difference in London . there's a huge amount of work going on to make our streets safer and it's really important that we keep our streets safe so people can feel they can walk around them." He said police have powers available which mean 'young people are less likely to carry knives’. Mr Cameron added: "We do need a new approach in dealing with the root causes of violent crime, and one of the things we're doing is trying to break this cycle where people are brought up without any hope or expectation and they turn to crime." He said he had 'no problem' with the use of stop-and-search powers by police - but admitted it was 'a difficult subject'. Mr Cameron added: "We have got a situation where there is a lot of criminal activity in certain parts of our cities, we do need to tackle that and stop and search is one way of doing so." But he said the ‘key’ thing was to break the cycle of young people growing up without any hope or expectation . In the 10 years after Kenya's worst post-election violence, the country has been rocked by a string of terror attacks. The death of at least three Christians in last weekend's attack on the Mpeketoni police station sparked new concerns about the threat from extremism as politicians tried to resolve a months long crisis over disputed elections . The killing of 148 people in an assault on Kenya’s Westgate shopping centre on September 21 was claimed by Islamist group Al Shabaab, which is allied to Al Qaeda. The Mpeketoni attack, carried out just eight days later, has been linked with the same group . Since then, dozens of people have died in a wave of terror attacks, including a 30-hour siege on the Gikomba market in Nairobi on November 26. It is thought to be the deadliest attack since Westgate and was claimed by Al Shabaab. On Saturday, three Christians were shot dead near Mpeketoni - a town
