The two aircraft collided as they conducted a training mission with three other helicopters at around 4pm on Wednesday near the community of Gila Bend. One chopper crashed in an open desert area, killing five crew members on board. The other helicoptor plunged into a mountainous ravine and another one was badly damaged during the accident near the U.S.-Mexican border. All nine personnel aboard were rescued, officials said. The 29th Marine Expeditionary Unit is based in Camp Pendleton, California, and their mission includes conducting humanitarian and disaster relief operations. A Navy spokesman confirmed that seven U.S. Marines died in the crash. Five of those killed were from Camp Pendleton's 1st Marine Division, and two others belonged to a helicoptor unit based in New River, North Carolina. The cause of the crash is not yet known and an investigation has been launched, the U.S. Marines said. It is unclear whether any of the crew members were injured or killed before impact.
