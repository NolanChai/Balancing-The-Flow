**(CNN) -- Thursday’s draw for the last 16 of the European Champions League threw up a series of mouthwatering tie-ups between a number of the continent’s top teams – including a clash between past winners Real Madrid and Manchester United.** The Spanish side will face Sir Alex Ferguson’s Premier League champions in the last eight, with Barcelona facing fellow Spaniards Villarreal, while AC Milan play Inter Milan in an all-Italian tie, which could prove to be a repeat of last year’s final in Madrid. Elsewhere, Chelsea have been paired against French outfit Lyon and German giants Bayern Munich face Russian champions CSKA Moscow. The draw will come as something of a relief for some of the big names, with the likes of Barcelona, Manchester United, Real Madrid, Inter Milan and AC Milan avoiding each other until at least the quarter-finals, but will inevitably have left plenty disappointed. It means that there are unlikely to be any all-English ties or all-Spanish ties in the knockout stages for the first time since 2007/08 season - when Chelsea beat Liverpool on penalties in the final in Moscow, but it could mean another year without a big-name English club in the semi-finals. There is still plenty to look forward to though, with what should prove to be two cracking ties between Real Madrid and Manchester United and Barcelona and Villarreal. Elsewhere, AC Milan and Inter face each other for the first time since their famous 2005/06 clashes, which saw them draw three times in the final stages of the season – including the infamous match in which both sets of players were sent off! The draw will also see Jose Mourinho and Pep Guardiola meet for the first time since their controversial battle last term. It will be the first meeting between Chelsea and Lyon since they played each other in 2000, but the biggest game could come on Tuesday night as Sir Alex Ferguson faces off against Barcelona legend Pep Guardiola. The two coaches have never met in a competitive fixture before, although they do share a good relationship and often talk to each other. Guardiola has said he was “delighted” with the draw and that he is looking forward to meeting Ferguson on Tuesday night – especially after being given the chance to work closely alongside him during Barcelona’s treble-winning season in 2008/9 . It could prove to be a difficult test for United though, who have had problems with injury this season and are already out of the FA Cup. Ferguson himself has said that he is ‘happy’ to draw against Barca after avoiding them at various stages since his side won the European Cup in 1999. He also expressed a desire to win it again, having lost four finals since then. The only English team left in the competition will be Chelsea and they will face Lyon – who knocked Arsenal out at this stage last season. They have not played each other for seven years but both sides are currently in excellent form after a stuttering start to the domestic campaign, although it is fair to say that Chelsea look like the team in better form. The Blues have not lost in any competition since mid-October and they will be hoping to build on their impressive 5-0 thrashing of Aston Villa at the weekend as they continue to challenge for domestic and European titles. The draw was held by former Italian internationals Gianluigi Buffon, Fabio Cannavaro and Gianluca Zambrotta – all of whom lifted the trophy with Real Madrid in 2002. The games will be played between February 15-23, with the final in London on May 19th. **(CNN) -- Thursday's draw for the last 16 of the European Champions League threw up a series of mouthwatering tie-ups between a number of the continent's top teams – including a clash between past winners Real Madrid and Manchester United.** The Spanish side will face Sir Alex Ferguson's Premier League champions in the last eight, with Barcelona facing fellow Spaniards Villarreal, while AC Milan play Inter Milan in an all-Italian tie, which could prove to be a repeat of last year's final in Madrid.
