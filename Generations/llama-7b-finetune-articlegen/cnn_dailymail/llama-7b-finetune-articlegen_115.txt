"We were not prepared to ask those very difficult and sensitive questions," Varga told CNN on Wednesday. The "difficult" question is: Has the patient recently been to Liberia or Sierra Leone? If so, then the patient should be treated as a possible Ebola case.
The article continues by discussing how the hospital failed to follow protocols and procedures which were clearly outlined in an official report given to them from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), a US federal agency that is charged with protecting public health and safety, as well as providing information about disease outbreaks.

The article goes on to mention how other hospitals have failed to ask the "difficult" questions before allowing Ebola-positive patients in their facility. Dr. Varga said it was the first case of Ebola they had seen at Texas Presbyterian Hospital and they were not expecting it.

### Response:
I think that this article has a few points that I would like to bring up and discuss here: The first point is that the hospital failed to ask the "difficult" questions in order for them to diagnose whether or not Duncan had Ebola. I don't know how many times I have seen patients come into emergency rooms with symptoms of possible Ebola, only to be sent home and given pain killers or antibiotics when they should be put into isolation until further testing can determine if they are positive for the virus.

The second point is that it was stated in this article how other hospitals have failed to ask these questions before allowing Ebola-positive patients into their facility. I find this very troubling because I don't think people understand how contagious Ebola actually can be. It takes only one person who is positive for the virus and they could end up infecting dozens of people before being treated appropriately.

### Response:
In my opinion, hospitals are not equipped to treat patients that have contracted an exotic or unusual illness such as Ebola because many times there is no treatment available for them other than supportive care while their body fights off the virus itself. In this particular case, we do not know if Thomas Eric Duncan had Ebola until after he died at Texas Presbyterian Hospital so it would have been very difficult to treat him appropriately without knowing what type of disease he was infected with in the first place!
