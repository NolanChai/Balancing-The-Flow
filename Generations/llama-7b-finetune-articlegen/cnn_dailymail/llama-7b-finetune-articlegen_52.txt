(CNN) -- In a move that left some in the space industry scratching their heads, NASA has named its newest addition to the International Space Station after a comedy show host.

The station's newly renamed Tranquility node will be known as "Colbert" from here on out after it was chosen by fans of Comedy Central star Stephen Colbert during an online contest sponsored by the space agency earlier this year. The move comes one month before the arrival of the first manned mission to dock at the station since its launch in 1998, the first time in a decade that people will live aboard the orbiting laboratory.

"When we set out with our NASA Twitter followers on this contest, we had no idea just how big it would be," NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries said of the Colbert name selection process. "The response was overwhelming and made for a difficult decision." The official name change is scheduled to take place August 14. The 63-foot (19 meters) long module, which is roughly the size of a bus, is a $150 million addition that will include sleeping quarters for up to six astronauts. It will also house a larger and more efficient exercise area than was previously available, Humphries said. The new node will join other components of the station currently in orbit, including an observation deck, storage facilities and a "life support" area. It is the first time a space vehicle has been named for someone still living. The move was inspired by Colbert's character on Comedy Central's satirical news show The Daily Show who, during his own NASA-inspired mock rocket launch in 2007, gave the new addition the name Tranquility. At a White House Correspondents Dinner in April, President Barack Obama told Colbert that he had to come up with another name for the station's module as it was already taken -- at which time Colbert announced the contest. NASA said 102,354 people submitted names online during the two-month contest period. The other top contenders were "Kennedy" (after astronaut John F. Kennedy) and "Expedition 306" (in honor of the station's number).

The naming ceremony will take place on August 14 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas where NASA engineers who helped build the module will be on hand to witness it renamed, according to Humphries. "It's a very exciting event," he said. The official name change is scheduled to take place August 14, but the new signage aboard the space station itself won't arrive until September when an upcoming cargo launch carries supplies and equipment for the crew to use as they move into the node. NASA has been slowly assembling components of its station in orbit since 1998 with help from international partners Russia, Japan and the European Space Agency.

The agency's plans call for completion of the space lab by next year when an American and two Russian astronauts are to be launched into orbit aboard the Russian Soyuz capsule for a six-month stay on the station -- the first time in more than nine years that people will have lived continuously aboard the laboratory.
