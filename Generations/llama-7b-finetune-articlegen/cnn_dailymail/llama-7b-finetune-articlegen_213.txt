The famous "Zapruder" film, named after its creator Abraham Zapruder, shows President Kennedy's final moments in life as he is shot and killed while riding on a motorcade through Dealey Plaza, Dallas. The film was captured by Abraham Zapruder from the 6th floor of the Texas School Book Depository Building (where Lee Harvey Oswald allegedly fired upon JFK) at high speed on Super-8 mm film stock (approximately 20 frames per second). A copy of this film is now in possession of the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington, D.C.. The film itself was originally thought to be lost but it has been found after being located by a documentary maker, Robert Groden. Groden has said that he believes that it had been "covered up" since his discovery, as well as other film footage taken at the time of the assassination. However, in 2013, the National Archives released 973 documents (including copies of all known home movies and still photographs) from that day to the National Archives website .
