(CNN) -- The U.S. Navy rescueed a survivor from an Iranian cargo vessel that sank in the Persian Gulf, killing at least three other crew members, the military said Sunday. "I have been informed by the commander on scene that he has recovered one person alive," Navy Capt. Mark Vandroff, spokesman for U.S. Central Command's 5th Fleet, told CNN in an e-mail response to a question about the rescue effort. The sailor was taken aboard the USS Howard, according to a statement from the Naval Forces Central Command. The identities of the deceased crew members were not immediately available. Vandroff did not identify them as Iranians but said they were "not American." It was unclear how many others might be unaccounted for. A U.S. helicopter and an Iraqi patrol boat participated in the rescue effort, according to a statement from the 5th Fleet. The cargo ship sank near Farwaniyah, Iraq, about 18 miles west of Basra, Vandroff said. "We have no reason at this time to believe this incident was caused by anything other than an accident," he told CNN earlier Sunday in a telephone interview. But the statement from the Navy's Central Command suggested otherwise: "A U.S. military patrol boat has rescued one of five crew members who were reported missing when their cargo ship sank off the coast of Iraq." The ship, named the Iran Ajr, had been on a routine voyage from Bandar Abbas in southern Iran to Iraq, according to the Iranian newspaper Iran Daily. An article posted online by the paper said the Iran Ajr was carrying 10 crew members and had sailed for about two months when it went down Saturday evening. The report quoted a spokesman for the Iran's Ports and Maritime Organization as saying that "an Iraqi ship, an Iraqi helicopter and Iraqi police boats" were searching for survivors of the accident. "The cause of the sinking is under investigation," the newspaper said in its report. Vandroff told CNN he didn't know what efforts the Iranians had made to assist the sailor who was rescued. In March, a U.S. Navy warship and an Iraqi coast guard vessel responded to an Iranian cargo ship that sank near Farwaniyah after taking on water. The incident prompted accusations by Iran's official news agency, IRNA, that the U.S. military was trying "to provoke Iran" by sending a helicopter and coast guard ship to the scene. Vandroff said Sunday he could not comment specifically on why the Navy had responded in that incident or this one. The 5th Fleet is based in Bahrain, which has been under U.S. military control since October 2001 when a small number of special operations forces moved into the country following the September 11 terror attacks. "The situation remains fluid in Iraq, and we cannot afford to be complacent," he said Sunday. A Navy patrol boat was involved in the rescue operation Saturday night, according to a statement from the Naval Forces Central Command. A helicopter from an undisclosed unit also assisted. The statement did not identify how many people might have been on board the ship when it sank. An Iranian cargo vessel carrying 10 crew members went down in the Persian Gulf late Saturday, according to the country's official news agency. The article, carried by IRNA and headlined "Cargo Ship Sinks near Iraqi Coast," did not identify the ship or its fate but said efforts were under way Sunday to rescue its crew members. It quoted an unidentified spokesman for Iran's Ports and Maritime Organization as saying that the cargo vessel had been on a routine voyage from Bandar Abbas in southern Iran to Iraq when it went down Saturday evening near Farwaniyah, 18 miles west of Basra.
