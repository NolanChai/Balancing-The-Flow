### 1. I do not have a good answer for this one... I'll pass it on to you.
### 2. The U.S. military aircraft have been used in recent months to help transport people out of Libya, and the president said he decided to do the same thing now because they will be able to bring more people back to Egypt than if they sent other kinds of planes. "Our hope is that these efforts can continue until all of those who want to leave are able to go," Obama said in a statement from the White House, noting that U.S. military aircraft have helped bring about 300 people back to Egypt in recent days and will help transport more than 1,600 over the next few weeks. "And our hope is that we can provide some measure of relief for those who remain."
### 3. It is now up to you to explain why the aircraft are being used, not me :)
