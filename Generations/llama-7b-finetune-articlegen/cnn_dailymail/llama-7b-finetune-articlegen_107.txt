The whales were spotted swimming side-by-side and appeared to be fighting off an attacker. It is believed the whales were battling a group of great white sharks. They cannibalise each other as well as killing younger whale calves, so they must have been desperate to save themselves from being eaten. The animals appeared to be fighting off a huge school of sharks which were trying to take advantage of the situation by attacking and devouring them. It is believed that at least 10 great whites were swimming around the pair as they struggled in the water just off the coast. A whale watcher onboard one of two boats in the area said: 'One was being attacked, but when it realised the other was nearby and there to protect it, it turned aggressively towards a large group of white sharks that were around. It then swam away with its companion and we lost sight of them.' A spokeswoman for the Australian Marine Conservation Society said: 'This is an incredibly rare sighting but these attacks on whales are becoming more common in Australia.' She added that the reason why great whites are becoming aggressive toward other whale species was because their numbers were dwindling as a result of over-fishing. 'Hopefully this incident will raise awareness and inspire people to stop killing sharks,' she said. Whales are on the menu for great white sharks, which cannibalise each other as well as killing younger whale calves . The attackers were believed to have been a group of 10 great whites. It is not known whether they had eaten any part of their prey but it could have been devoured in one large bite . The rare sighting was seen by about 130 people on the whale watch boat and the second vessel that was also present near Sydney Heads at the time . A spokeswoman for the Australian Marine Conservation Society said: 'This is an incredibly rare sighting but these attacks on whales are becoming more common in Australia' . 'The great whites are targeting other whale species because of a lack of food, particularly their favoured prey the seals,' she explained. Great white sharks are known to attack and eat whales. They will also scavenge and eat dead whales that have been killed by collisions with boats or other natural causes. It is thought that a lack of food has caused them to become more aggressive towards each other as well as towards smaller prey such as seals, dolphins and sea lions. 'If they were hunting and killing great whites it would be an indication there are too many whales in the area,' added the spokeswoman. 'The sharks are just taking advantage of what is available to them.' The recent sighting was witnessed by 130 people onboard two Sydney Harbour whale watch boats. It came just days after a great white attacked and killed an elderly woman in Western Australia, who had been swimming off the coast near Perth. The attack happened at Cottesloe beach at about 6pm on Friday evening when the 71-year-old was out for a swim with her daughter. A spokesman for St John Ambulance told MailOnline that the woman had been pronounced dead at Fremantle Hospital where she was rushed by ambulance. 'She received quite severe injuries, but there's nothing more to add,' he added. The attack came just days after a great white shark attacked and killed an elderly woman in Western Australia .

It is thought that the victim died of blood loss after being bitten on her leg. The woman had been swimming with her daughter who was able to drag her back to shore where she received CPR from lifeguards until paramedics arrived, according to witnesses. Great white sharks have been blamed for numerous attacks in Australia. They are known as the most dangerous species of shark and one of the most feared animals on earth. However they only kill two people a year on average across the world with the majority of those being in the US. The incident happened at Cottesloe beach, pictured, which is located just north-west from Perth city centre . The shark was later caught and destroyed by a fisherman but not before he had taken pictures that revealed his gruesome meal. A 19-year-old man has been charged over the attack on a great white shark near Port Macquarie in NSW's north last month, which left a woman with severe injuries to her leg and foot after it bit off a large chunk of flesh. He was allegedly fishing from a boat when he hooked the animal about 50m out from shore at Glasshouse Rocks on May 27. The shark jumped clear of the water, leaving him with severe cuts to his arms and chest. Police were called after witnesses spotted blood in the water but no one was injured. The teenager is due to appear before Port Macquarie Local Court today charged with fishing without a licence and unlawfully killing or taking protected wildlife. Australian Marine Conservation Society, NSW branch manager Richard Leck said yesterday it was the first time he had ever heard of someone being charged over the death of a great white shark. 'It is very rare for someone to be caught fishing for a protected animal in Australia,' Mr Leck told reporters. The man who killed the shark will face court today . The teenager is due to appear before Port Macquarie Local Court today charged with fishing without a licence and unlawfully killing or taking protected wildlife . He added that there was no scientific evidence suggesting great whites were over-fished in Australia. However, he said it could be possible that shark attacks would increase if the sharks became more aggressive because of a lack of prey. 'There are other reasons why the sharks may become more aggressive, but we don't know,' Mr Leck added. He also warned people swimming in areas where there were known to be great whites that it was best not to go near them if they saw one. Great white shark attacks are relatively rare and mostly happen during the winter months in Australia between April and July, according to SharkSmart . They have been blamed for numerous attacks on humans across the country but only kill two people a year on average across the world with the majority of those being in the US.

'It is rare for someone to be caught fishing for protected species, but it does happen,' Mr Leck said yesterday . Great white sharks are known as one of the most feared animals on earth and have been blamed for numerous attacks in Australia. They are also the most dangerous species of shark with a reputation as fierce predators that feed on sea lions, seals, penguins and other large fish.
