Uruguay has become the second Latin America nation to legalize gay marriage after its lower chamber of congress voted on Tuesday to approve a bill that allows same-sex couples to marry and adopt children, despite opposition from the Roman Catholic Church. The upper house will now take up the legislation. If President Jose Mujica signs it, Uruguay would become the second Latin American country after Argentina to legalize gay marriage. It would also be the first nation in South America to do so. Chile's lawmakers last month narrowly rejected a similar bill. The Roman Catholic Church has opposed same-sex marriages but many Uruguayans have little sympathy for those who oppose them, having already approved civil unions and adoptions by gay couples in 2008. Mujica's administration supports the measure, which he is expected to sign into law. 'The bill will soon become a reality,' said Ricardo Ehrlich, president of Uruguay's gay rights group Iguales. Gay marriage was approved by a large majority -- 51 votes in favor and only three against -- but not all were happy with the outcome. Congressman Gabriel Salazar asked to suspend proceedings so he could attend his nephew's First Communion, a ceremony celebrating a child's first reception of holy communion. 'We don't want to be on this side or that side,' said Congresswoman Gabriela Michetti. 'The only thing we ask is for them not to come after us with stones and sticks because we are different.' The law would allow both gay men and lesbians to marry each other, adopt children together or simply form civil unions -- the current option. Only two countries in Latin America have legalized same-sex marriage: Mexico City and Argentina, which has allowed it nationwide since 2010. The issue is currently before lawmakers in Colombia, Brazil and Puerto Rico. In Chile, a bill that would have allowed gay couples to marry narrowly lost support in the lower house last month. Chile's congress then rejected a measure calling for civil unions but allowed such partnerships to continue being recognized until 2018. Uruguay is one of several countries where the government has taken steps to recognize same-sex partnerships, and it already allows gay couples to adopt children. In Brazil, lawmakers in August voted to legalize same-sex civil unions, though President Dilma Rousseff had proposed a broader measure allowing marriage between two people regardless of gender. She has yet to sign that bill into law. In Chile, the issue has divided even families and friends. On Tuesday, several dozen protesters took their fight to the street in front of Uruguay's Congress with banners reading 'No same-sex marriage.' Others waved rainbow flags -- a symbol of gay pride -- from the steps of the building as lawmakers voted inside. Many Uruguayans oppose same-sex marriages, according to recent opinion polls conducted by two local newspapers, but about 60 percent support civil unions and adoptions by gay couples. About 30 percent are undecided. Uruguay's congress approved same-sex unions in 2008. The South American country of just 3 million people is considered the most socially progressive in Latin America, with a low crime rate, free universal health care and public schools. Mujica, 77, is the oldest president currently serving in the Western Hemisphere. He has been Uruguay's president since March 2010. The former guerrilla leader campaigned on his past as a leftist fighter for social justice and vowed to steer clear of international conflicts such as the drug wars raging in Mexico and Colombia, or the recent military crackdown in Syria. He was re-elected this year with 54 percent of votes cast. Uruguay has legalized abortion since 2012; gay marriages are set to become a reality soon - Copyright The Financial Times Limited .
