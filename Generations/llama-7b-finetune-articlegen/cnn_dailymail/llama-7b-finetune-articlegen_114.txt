The results are out of the way, and now the Brits are ready to enjoy their romantic getaway! A study by Direct Holidays revealed that the town of Hu ll is voted as the least romantic place to visit in the country. In contrast, the British capital London was found to be the most romantic place for lovers to stay away from their busy work-life. The survey polled 2000 Brits and asked them to rate 68 UK destinations on their romantic appeal, based on things like scenery, ambience, night life, food, accommodation and history. In addition, the study also found that only two thirds of Brits have had a romantic holiday in the last year (64%), with half admitting they do not find time to enjoy them anymore. It’s no wonder people are opting for staycations when it comes to enjoying romance – over three quarters of respondents admitted that it’s cheaper than a holiday, while more than six in ten agreed that you can get away without booking months in advance (63%). The survey also revealed that 58% find it easy to spend quality time with their partner when on a staycation – compared to 28% who struggle. In terms of popular locations, the Lake District and Wales were rated as the most romantic places to go by the Brits – although these are two of the most visited UK holiday destinations, with some five million tourists visiting each region in 2017 alone. Meanwhile, Devon was revealed to be the least romantic destination, while London took top spot. The study also found that the best months for romance were September and October - with 43% of Brits saying they prefer a romantic staycation then compared to 29% in summer and only 16% at Christmas. When asked which holiday activities they would enjoy, the majority said visiting historical sites (59%) followed by eating out (53%). Going on an organised activity such as a coach tour came last with just 24%. Top romantic destinations in the UK:
