And, as always, there'll be a number of other features on offer too. Scroll down for more information about what to expect from the iPhone 5. The invitation to Apple's October 4 event in California sent out by Tim Cook has sparked speculation that the new handset will finally be released . For many, it doesn’t matter what the specs of an Apple product are – they simply must have it. And while the company may not reveal all its cards on Tuesday, here’s what is being widely reported about the new iPhone 5… It will feature a larger display: The gadget, expected to be announced by CEO Tim Cook (pictured), could have a 4-inch screen . A larger screen: For years it was rumoured that Apple would introduce a handset with a bigger screen. Some analysts claimed that the firm wouldn't release it until the company could fit an even bigger display in to its product without making it too big and unwieldy for everyday use. But now, technology experts claim that the iPhone 5 will finally have a larger 4-inch screen - around half an inch bigger than the one on previous models. That's according to KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi Kuo . Two versions: In another first for Apple, it is rumoured that two different models of the iPhone 5 will be released – a US version and a China-specific model. While there’s no reason why the two cannot work together, it has been speculated that Apple could release separate software for each to make them more relevant to customers in their respective regions . A superfast connection: When it comes to mobile technology, speed is one of the most important features and Apple is tipped to have added 4G capabilities to its iPhone. In other words, people who use the new phone will be able to connect to a faster network than those who stick with current models. One analyst predicts that this could mean the iPhone 5 is twice as fast at downloading data . The latest chip: Apple is expected to include an improved processor in the new handset - known as the 'A6' chip – which will make it faster and more efficient. This is also reportedly compatible with a number of apps from other companies, including Microsoft . A larger battery: While a bigger screen might mean a bigger battery too, but Apple’s iPhone 5 could come with a smaller one to keep costs down. That said, technology experts predict that it will have more than enough juice for everyday use . An NFC chip: This allows people to share data through short-range wireless networks without actually having to touch devices together. It is already being used in some mobile phones and is expected to be included in the new Apple phone . A redesigned body: The iPhone 5 could have an all-new design which could look a lot like that of the Samsung Galaxy Note – but with a more sophisticated feel. This will mean people who lose their handset can use the Find my Phone app to locate it anywhere in the world . More storage space: In terms of memory, Apple is rumoured to be including 8GB of memory as standard on both versions of its new gadget – up from just 4GB now . A cheaper price-tag: The iPhone 5 could cost less than existing models, which will help Apple to sell more. However, one analyst predicted that the handset could still be priced at around £500 – but that might not put off consumers . While some features of the new phone are yet to be confirmed, technology experts believe a number of others will make it on to the finished product… A larger screen: The iPhone 4S currently comes with a four-inch display, but Apple has been rumoured for years to be working on an even bigger version. One analyst predicted that the iPhone 5 would have a screen five per cent bigger than its predecessor . Faster speeds: As well as introducing a larger screen, it’s expected Apple will add 4G capabilities too. In other words, people who use the new phone could download data twice as fast than they can now . A better battery: The iPhone 5 is rumoured to have more memory than current models – but less space for its battery. This could be a cause for concern if it means users will need to charge their handsets more frequently . Cheaper prices: Apple’s previous handsets have cost around £500 and upwards, which puts them out of reach of many consumers. It's been suggested that the iPhone 5 might be slightly cheaper than its predecessor . The latest processor: Known as 'A6', this chip would make the iPhone 5 faster than previous models . A new design: While it is unlikely to have an all-new body, the iPhone 5 could look different to earlier models . NFC capabilities: This allows people to share data through short-range wireless networks without actually having to touch devices together. It's already being used in some mobile phones and it will be included on the new Apple device too . An app store: One of the biggest attractions about buying an Apple handset is that users can access thousands of apps for it, which will give people even more reasons to buy a gadget from Cupertino. Many are believed to have already been developed to work with iPhone 5, despite not being released yet . More storage space: The current iPhones come with either 8GB or 16GB memory, but some reports suggest Apple will increase the size of its new gadgets' memory – and possibly make them cheaper too. One analyst predicts that they may cost around £500 less than existing models . The invitation to Apple’s October 4 event sent out by CEO Tim Cook has sparked speculation that the new handset will finally be released, two years after Steve Jobs unveiled his first iPhone. Mr Cook is expected to give a special announcement about ‘the next generation of iPhones and iOS’ – which could mean it will introduce not one but two different versions of its flagship phone for consumers in the UK and US . The technology giant has previously stated that it expects the new iPhone to make a major impact on sales. It sold more than 25million iPhones in the first nine months of this year alone, making up around half of the company's £107billion turnover during the same period.
