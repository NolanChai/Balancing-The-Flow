### [Answer:](http://www.cnn.com/2015/03/16/us/washington-mother-charged-with-attempted-murder/)A young mother in Washington state has been charged with attempted murder after authorities say she cut her children's throats in an attempt to keep them quiet.
The woman, 29-year old Amy M. Buse of Vancouver, Washington, is being held on a $1 million bail. Her three young daughters are now in the care of Child Protective Services.Prosecutors say she tried to kill her two oldest children Sunday night by cutting their throats as they slept in their bedroom. They say she then stabbed her 5-year old daughter with a kitchen knife and placed the blade against the throat of the youngest, who was sleeping in her crib.
The girls' 6-year old brother came out of his room and saw what had happened. He alerted a nearby relative who called for help, authorities said.Prosecutors say Buse then ran outside with the 5 year old, but she fell and broke her leg while being chased by police officers, . She was arrested shortly afterwards, after a brief struggle with law enforcement officials, they said. The three children were rushed to hospital. One of them is in intensive care after surgery to treat injuries that include lacerations to the neck. All are expected to recover, authorities say.Buse's motive is not yet clear, although police are looking into reports she had been dealing with "mental health issues". Investigators say they found a bloodstained butcher knife in her home. Court records show Buse has no previous criminal record and was charged last year with theft after she admitted taking items from a nearby grocery store without paying for them.Buse made her first appearance before an Oregon County judge on Monday morning, where she is being represented by public defenders. Her family also attended, but they did not comment to reporters when asked about their connection with Buse and her alleged actions."Our prayers are with the children," said Clark County Public Defender Steve Brown outside court. He declined to talk about Buse's mental health or any other specifics of the case. Her next hearing is scheduled for March 25.Copyright (c) 2015 Cable News Network . A Time Warner Company.
