### Answer:
A) A benefits cheat who claimed to be wheelchair-bound and received more than . £40,000 in disability payments is facing a hefty jail sentence after swindling the money.  Diane Fletcher, 53, conned the Department for Work & Pensions (DWP) out of the cash by claiming she was unable to work because . she had mobility problems due to her . multiple sclerosis and arthritis. But an investigation found that despite being able to walk without help, Fletcher used the . money to buy a new kitchen, holiday abroad and even spent it on gambling. Fletcher's swindle was uncovered when she was caught on CCTV carrying shopping bags at her local supermarket and on another occasion getting out of an underground station without help from anyone else. She . is now facing a jail term after pleading guilty to fraud by false representation, and will be sentenced in September.

An undercover officer visited . the 53-year-old’s home, posing as a prospective lodger who needed a room and witnessed Fletcher being able to get out of the house without any assistance. She was also seen on CCTV walking around shops in her local town centre and getting up from a chair at the station without help. Fletcher admitted she had been faking the . need for the mobility scooter but claimed it was because she did not know how to operate it properly.
