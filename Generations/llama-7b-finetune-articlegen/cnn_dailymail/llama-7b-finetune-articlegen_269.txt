Her defence counsel yesterday said he would not be making a plea in mitigation.

The court heard that the false mortgage repayment was identified by an audit of expenditure and income, which also found other errors relating to her Army salary.

The charges against Lt Col Blackhall were withdrawn by the Service Prosecuting Authority last month and she is now due to appear at Cardiff Crown Court in two weeks' time for sentencing. She had been a senior officer within the WRAC and, although it was disbanded in 1992, the women continue to be represented by officers of the rank of colonel.

A spokesman for the Service Prosecuting Authority said yesterday: 'Lieutenant Colonel Blackhall was charged with one count of false accounting contrary to Section 17(1) of The Theft Act 1968 in relation to a period between January, 2004 and November, 2012.

The SPA had received a brief of evidence from the WRAC officers concerned in order to assist us in deciding what action we should take.' It is understood that Lt Col Blackhall was not sacked by the Army and continues to receive her full salary while on bail. A spokesman for the Royal Logistic Corps said: 'We are aware of allegations concerning one of our former colleagues and will be taking appropriate action as we continue our investigation.'
