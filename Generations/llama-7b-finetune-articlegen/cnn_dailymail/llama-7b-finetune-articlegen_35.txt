1. The spate of terrifying night-time rapes in an isolated, orthodox Christian community has been blamed on the victims who were 'too drunk to remember' their attackers or even call out loudly enough when they were violently assaulted by masked men. Two women have come forward to claim that they were sexually abused while living at the Eternal Light Church in Windsor, Ontario, about 10 miles north of Detroit . The first incident occurred in December 2009 and another six months later, the church's female leader, Heidi Huber-Kelly - a self-proclaimed prophetess who claims to be God's mouthpiece on earth - was charged with sexual assault. The spate of terrifying night time rapes in an isolated community went on for years . An investigation was launched into the church following allegations of child abuse but after more than a year-and-a-half, there are no charges against anyone and Huber-Kelly's trial is scheduled to begin next week. She has pleaded not guilty. Her followers claim she is 'pure at heart' and that she was framed by her enemies because she wants to be 'just like Jesus.' The church has refused to cooperate with police, saying they are no longer under investigation. Now, a former member of the church is speaking out against Huber-Kelly who she says has sexually assaulted many other women as well as herself and she claims there were more rapes that never came forward because victims didn't want to bring shame on their families or be 'shunned.' She also believes it was her that started the investigation into child abuse at the church. Her name is being withheld so as not to jeopardise any future legal proceedings. She said: 'I am very afraid of Heidi because I believe she will go to great lengths to silence me.' The former member - who left the community last year after witnessing Huber-Kelly having a sexual relationship with one of her followers - told CBC News that the incidents in 2009 and 2010 were not the first time women had been violently assaulted at the church. She said: 'The only people who are able to talk about it right now are the ones who left.' The former member, who is in her forties, claims she was raped by Huber-Kelly four years ago while living there with her husband and three children. She told CBC News that a church leader took her into a room to 'counsel' her over some sort of sin that she had committed but instead he sexually assaulted her. After the incident, she reported it to Huber-Kelly who said she forgave him because 'God put Satan in his heart.' The former member told CBC News: 'I don’t know how she could have done something like that and then look me straight in the eyes and say God did this to me. It made me feel dirty, it was awful. I can't imagine going through that again and having people try and tell you it is a lie.' The former member also claims Huber-Kelly had a sexual relationship with another follower while he was still married and that she once forced her husband into sex during a counselling session in their home. She said: 'She told him to lay on his back and then she straddled him, it wasn’t consensual.' In 2010, Huber-Kelly was arrested for sexual assault after another woman came forward to police and said the church leader sexually abused her when she was a young girl. She now faces multiple charges including indecent assault and gross indecency. A trial date has been set for November of this year. The former member claims that during that time, other women were also violently assaulted but they didn't go to the police because they feared 'being shunned.' She said: 'If you went down there and you weren’t in good standing with the church you would be shunned. If someone came forward and said that something had happened, it would have been hard for them to find employment or go back to school.' In July 2013 another woman told CBC News that she was sexually abused at Eternal Light when she was a young girl by church leader Huber-Kelly. The former member says she knows of many others who were also sexually assaulted but they never came forward because they 'don't want to bring shame on their families.' She said: 'I have spoken to one person that it has happened to and he won’t go through with the police investigation. It’s so hard for these people to come forward when they don’t know how many other women were abused too or what may happen if they do make a claim, are there going to be consequences?' She claims Huber-Kelly once told her she wanted to have sex with her husband but he wasn't interested and 'he was still young enough to be intimidated by her.' The former member also said: 'She would say things like if you were a good little girl, God would bless you or if you did this He would do something for you. It is very manipulative and it makes the person that she has targeted believe they are doing what God wants them to be doing.' She added: 'There was never any education of how to say no and where your body stops and somebody else's starts.' In 2011, Huber-Kelly denied allegations that she sexually abused a woman who attended church when she was a child. A court found the girl had not come forward because she was afraid of being shunned by her family or church members. The former member said: 'I know this has affected more than one person and I have spoken to many people in the community that don’t want it brought back up because they are afraid.' She also claims other incidents happened when women were at the church alone with Huber-Kelly on a camping trip or visiting her home. The former member said: 'One of our friends told us she was staying there by herself and she came back from Heidi’s house and she had bruises on her arms and legs.' When asked to comment on the sexual assault allegations, Huber-Kelly said in an email that 'the whole purpose of this church is to protect women. My own personal experiences are proof positive that my spiritual life and spiritual ministry have been focused on healing those who need help.' She added: 'I know what I am doing has brought a great amount of freedom to people because I have worked with people all over the world including many celebrities, who are under a lot of pressure. I have been asked by God to do this work and there is not one person that I know personally or professionally who will ever say anything negative about me.' Huber-Kelly also claims she is being targeted because her church is trying to get the land back from the township after they were evicted last year following a child abuse investigation. She said: 'I am aware of the fact that it is very hard for people to accept that God has placed me on this earth as His mouthpiece and I know there are many who would like to silence my voice because of their own personal agenda, which is why I have decided to take legal action against anyone trying to stop my ministry.' She added: 'The community has always been very supportive, but they still have a lot of questions. I am taking the time now to put those answers on paper and will make them available to everyone when this trial ends in November.’ The former member told CBC News that she is waiting until after Huber-Kelly's trial before she comes forward with more details about her own sexual assault. She said: 'I am afraid but I want justice, even if it is just for myself.' The church was evicted from their property by Windsor Township in 2012 following a child abuse investigation that was launched after the second woman came forward to police with allegations of being sexually assaulted when she was young. The township also ordered Eternal Light Church to cease operating as an organization on church-owned property and they were told not to return until the conclusion of court proceedings in relation to the child abuse investigation, which is still underway. Huber-Kelly was charged with sexual assault for her alleged relationship with a now 26-year-old woman who grew up at Eternal Light Church in Windsor, Ontario. She denies the charges and says they are false accusations from an enemy trying to destroy her church because she is God's mouthpiece on earth . The township also ordered Eternal Light Church to cease operating as an organization on church-owned property and they were told not to return until the conclusion of court proceedings in relation to the child abuse investigation, which is still underway . On November 26, 2012 the church was granted a temporary injunction that allows them to return to their church property for three hours every Sunday morning. Eternal Light Church is now located on a rural road about two miles from the township office where they were evicted but the women told CBC News that the move has not stopped more incidents of abuse. The former member said: 'People still go there to be healed, it hasn’t changed anything.' Huber-Kelly also claims she is being targeted because her church is trying to get the land back from the township after they were ev
