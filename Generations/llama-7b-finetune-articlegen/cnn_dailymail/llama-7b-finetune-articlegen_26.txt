The tech giant plans to build data centers and offices as part of what it calls Project Taos, named for the town northwest of Los Angeles where Google purchased property several years ago. The site is a few miles away from the company’s existing LAC3 data center in Playa Visita, which opened in 2018. The land acquisition was first reported by the LA Times. The new facilities would join three other major Google properties that are also located near each other on the Westside of Los Angeles: two more data centers in El Segundo and Mountain View; as well as a building for its YouTube creators network, which is next door to LAC3. The company purchased an empty office tower at 525 N. La Cienega Blvd. earlier this year, according to the LA Times, which will be transformed into the hub of Google’s YouTube creator business. (The tower was formerly occupied by Fox and currently owned by developer Rick Caruso.) “With over a million people living in Los Angeles County alone, we've found an incredible talent pool of people that are passionate about creating content for YouTube,” said Susanne Daniels, Global Head of Original Content at Google. Project Taos will allow the company to expand its creator presence and provide them with more resources for creating and monetizing their channels. Google plans to lease out space within the buildings as offices or data centers. “We hope this expansion will help bring jobs, economic opportunity and a range of amenities to Playa Visita,” said Melissa Jones, Head of Real Estate at Google. The company has long been committed to investing in local communities where it operates. For example, in 2019 the tech giant donated more than $100 million worth of Chromebooks and other technology to schools around the country as part of its effort to close the digital divide. In addition to expanding their presence in Los Angeles, Google also recently announced plans for an expansion into the suburbs of Chicago with a new data center and offices there too. This move is expected to bring over 100 jobs when complete later this year according to WTTW News Chicago affiliate ABC7 Eyewitness News reporter Lourdes Duarte (@lourdeduarte), who tweeted about the announcement today: “The data center is expected to create more than 100 new construction jobs with wages above local market averages.” The expansion into Los Angeles follows Google's acquisition of two other properties last year: One in downtown LA (the former Federal Reserve Bank) and another near Silicon Valley. In addition, Google also plans on constructing a new headquarters building in the city of Mountain View after buying land there earlier this month according to the Associated Press reported by KGO-TV San Francisco affiliate ABC7 Eyewitness News reporter Dustin Dorsey (@dustindorseypic). The expansion into Chicago is part of a larger push from Google to provide better internet access across the country. It will help ensure people have reliable connections so they can take advantage of all that technology has to offer without being left behind by those who already enjoy it. And while these new projects may be great news for communities looking forward to economic growth, there are still concerns about privacy issues related to Google's data centers which could potentially pose a threat if not properly secured according to CNET senior writer Steven Musil (@stevenmusil). _______________________________________________________________________ The acquisition of the property in Playa Visita will allow Google to expand its presence in Los Angeles.
