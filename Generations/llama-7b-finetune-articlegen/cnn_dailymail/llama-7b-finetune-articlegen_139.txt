The 28 year old has been banned from facing Spurs on Sunday for diving in Swansea's last outing against Queens Park Rangers on November 10th, a game which he was shown a second yellow card and sent off by referee Lee Probert. The FA has also fined him £5,000 and ordered that the match must be played behind closed doors at Swansea's Liberty Stadium on Sunday. He will miss Swansea's clash with Tottenham Hotspur in the Barclays Premier League on Sunday as a result. The FA announced that their Professional Standard Disciplinary Committee has rejected his appeal against the red card and the ban. Swans boss Michael Laudrup said: 'Luka will be out for this weekend's match and he is very disappointed about it because he did not dive, but he will be back with us on Monday morning. 'We had a meeting before today to explain that if you appeal and lose then you are suspended for the next game. It is very important as a professional player that you know the rules.' Swansea have until 3pm on Wednesday to serve their notice of appeal to the independent Football Association Regulatory Commission, which could be heard by the end of this week.
