By . Associated Press . and Reuters . Honey mixed with sugar might be sweet, but it is not 'honey'. The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real thing. On its website the FDA said that more than 60 percent of all U.S. honey comes from China. Although much of this is legitimate, it has been mixed with corn syrup, rice syrup or other substances to cut costs and speed up processing. Honey adulterated in such a way can be mistaken for the genuine article - especially if shoppers have never tasted the real thing. But there are simple ways to spot fakes: real honey should not crystallise quickly, but should stay soft and spreadable when stored at cooler temperatures; it should also remain liquid in warmer weather. Honey may contain small amounts of pollen or other matter that can be used as a way of identifying the source. But many people are now using ultraviolet lights to check if honeys really are 'natural' or not. Fake honey is often bright yellow-green, while real honey will appear golden-brown. The FDA said it had seen a 60 percent increase in complaints about mislabelled or fake honey from consumers over the past four years. It warned that those found guilty of selling adulterated honey could face fines and even jail time. But the agency also wants to know if there is any real honey being sold on the U.S. market. So it has launched an online survey to find out where honeys are actually made in America. 'The public's help in completing this questionnaire will allow us to better understand how honey is produced, processed and distributed in our country,' the FDA said. In 2011 the agency reported finding fake honey from China in almost every sample taken at U.S. ports and borders, according to . data released by the Chinese customs authority. It also found that only about 6 percent of honey imported from China is real - or 'certified authentic'. But the FDA did not say how much of this fake stuff made its way into U.S. products. The agency said it was cracking down on adulterated Chinese honey because of safety concerns. It claims that some counterfeit honeys have been found to contain heavy metals, including lead. But there are many other sources for fake and substandard honey around the world. In 2011 the FDA said it was cracking down on adulterated Chinese honey because of safety concerns. The agency claims that some counterfeit honeys have been found to contain heavy metals, including lead . Adulterated honey is a global problem, with many other countries involved in the practice. In Europe, there are fears that fake honey may be infected with bacteria, particularly from Asian countries like China or India. The European Food Safety Authority has also raised concerns about substandard and contaminated honeys being imported into the EU . Australia and New Zealand are concerned that the presence of antibiotics in some types of honey may be a threat to their native pollinators. In Canada, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency is looking into possible contamination from pesticides or heavy metals . Honey adulterated with substitutes and additives can also affect the health of bee colonies because the foods may contain antibiotics or pesticides. The U.S. government has been trying to get to the bottom of what is being imported since 2005, when it first started warning consumers about fake honey in its stores. In a report issued last year, the Agriculture Department said that 81 percent of imported Chinese honeys were found to be either adulterated or mislabelled. It also identified more than 60 other countries where such problems had been found - from Algeria and Belarus in Europe to Egypt and Vietnam in Asia. The FDA has since asked China for information about its food-safety inspection systems, particularly as regards honey production. But the Chinese customs agency says it's already working with U.S. officials on improving its tracking of fake products entering America . The European Food Safety Authority has also raised concerns about substandard and contaminated honeys being imported into the EU from China, India and other Asian countries. It says that some beekeepers are using toxic chemicals or feeding their colonies with polluted food, which can harm the health of workers and their hives. Adulterated honey is a global problem, with many other countries involved in the practice . But U.S. officials are now concerned about China's own bee population. They say that there have been cases where honey has been mixed with corn syrup or rice syrup because the country doesn't produce enough of its own honeys to satisfy demand. The FDA says it is looking into whether this practice violates international trade rules. It also wants to know if China produces any real, unadulterated honey for export. The U.S. government has been trying to get to the bottom of what is being imported since 2005 when it first started warning consumers about fake honey in its stores . But even if honeys are made in America - as the FDA wants to know through its survey - there have been cases where they have contained bacteria like salmonella or E. coli, which can sicken people who eat them. In one case reported in 2013 by federal officials from Oregon and California, three children were hospitalised after eating honey contaminated with salmonella from a local producer. The FDA says that no products from this farm - which has since gone out of business - were ever recalled because the problem was not detected until after the foods had been sold. But experts say it is important for consumers to be aware that honey can sometimes contain harmful microbes like bacteria or fungus.

According to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), only about 6 percent of all imported Chinese honey is actually real. The rest contains sugar, corn syrup or other substances to cut costs . Honey is a sticky substance made by bees using nectar from flowers. It can be used in cooking and baking as well as being taken straight out of the jar for its medicinal properties . In some cases it has been found that honeys with labels saying they came from California or Florida were actually produced elsewhere in America, or even imported from other countries like Brazil or South Africa. The FDA says that because there is no way to detect these frauds without testing every single jar of honey coming into the U.S., consumers should ask sellers for proof that their products are 'genuine' and 'authentic'.
