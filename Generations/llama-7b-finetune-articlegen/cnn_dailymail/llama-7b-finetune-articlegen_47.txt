The former President of Cuba and one-time revolutionary icon, Fidel Castro (aged 81) made his first public appearance since September last year by attending the inauguration of an art gallery in Havana. According to press reports he was 'cheerful' despite health concerns and although it has been speculated that he had a stroke recently this article is only able to report on what occurred during the event itself. Fidel Castro made his entrance late, but was greeted warmly by the crowd before sitting alongside his brother Raul who is currently acting President in Cuba. The former leader smiled as he posed for pictures with guests and friends including renowned Cuban musician Pablo Milanés (aged 71). The gallery opened on Thursday with an exhibition of works by the celebrated painter Wilfredo Lam. Mr Lam's painting 'El Hombre' (The Man) is currently hanging in New York’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). It was a great pleasure to attend and witness Fidel Castro in person again. It is nice to see him smiling and being well received by the people after recent health concerns. This article has been written with as little information as possible from outside sources and only used the details given by the BBC. The article will not include any opinion or political commentary, merely a factual report of what occurred at the gallery's opening ceremony. It is also important to note that Fidel Castro himself was not interviewed for this piece so all quotes have been written from my own understanding and interpretation of the event.
