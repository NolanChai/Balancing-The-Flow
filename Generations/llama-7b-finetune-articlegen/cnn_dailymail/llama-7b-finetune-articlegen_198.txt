Kelly Renee Gissendaner, a woman convicted of murdering her husband in 1998 has been spared from the electric chair. The 47-year-old is scheduled to be executed between February 25 and March 4 after having her request for clemency denied by Governor Nathan Deal on Wednesday. 'Both prosecutors and defense counsel in this case believe that Kelly Gissendaner deserves to die,' the Governor wrote in his denial letter, which was posted on the State of Georgia's website on Thursday night. 'I respect their views but after careful consideration, I have decided not to sign her death warrant.' The sentence comes as a shock to both Gissendaner and her family members, who said they were under the impression she would be spared execution after Deal commuted another woman's death sentence last week. But the Governor also denied her clemency appeal on Tuesday, prompting her attorneys to seek a stay of execution. Her legal team claims he acted too quickly in denying it and said he should have waited at least 14 days before making his decision. The family is 'shocked' by the turnaround after Deal commuted the sentence of Kelly Johnson, 45, last Tuesday just hours before her execution was scheduled to take place. 'I thought she had a pretty good chance,' Gissendaner's stepdaughter Brittany said. She added that 'it was really hard to hear about (Johnson) having the sentence commuted.' The decision has left Gissendaner's family, as well as supporters who believe in her innocence, wondering how Deal arrived at his decision. The Governor had until 5pm Wednesday night to issue a denial for clemency. He chose not to respond directly to any of the arguments presented by Gissendaner's legal team. But he did note that both prosecutors and defense counsel in her case believe she 'deserves to die'. Her attorneys, including federal public defender Stephen Bright (above left), filed a brief on Monday arguing Deal had acted too quickly by denying the clemency request without giving Gissendaner an opportunity for a final appeal. But in his letter to Gissendaner, he said that after reading 'the materials' submitted as part of her petition, he came to the conclusion that she had not shown he should issue a commutation or grant reprieve. The Governor's decision also means that another death warrant will be issued for Gissendaner in about a month and her execution could take place between February 25 and March 4, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections website. She was convicted of murder after staging an elaborate scheme involving her lover to kill her husband Douglas Gissendaner (above right), who she had been having an affair with for two years before he died in 1997. Kelly and Doug had a daughter, Brittany, who is now 24, together while they were married. The couple's son Brandon was adopted by the man Kelly later fell in love with, Greg Owen (above left). In November 1998, she was convicted of hiring Owens to murder Doug and setting up a burglary that would implicate him as the culprit. Gissendaner testified at trial that her husband had been abusive toward her in their three years of marriage and was physically attacking her on the night before he died. She said she feared for her life during those attacks, but she never pressed charges against Doug because she 'didn't want to break up his family,' according to court documents. In March 1997, Gissendaner and Owens plotted a plan in which Owen would rob the couple's house while Doug was away at work that night. When he arrived back home, they both posed as burglars and attacked him until he fell unconscious on his bedroom floor, where they left him. Gissendaner then staged a scene to make it look like Owen had killed Doug, taking the .38 caliber handgun that was used in the murder back to her boyfriend's house so it wouldn't be found at their home. The next day she went to police and told them Owens had been the one to kill her husband. She then implicated him further by saying she saw him drive away from the crime scene with a gun in his hand, according to court documents. Both Gissendaner and Owen were arrested for murder after investigators found they had been seen together at bars around Atlanta the night Doug was killed. They eventually went to trial where both were convicted of their roles in killing Doug. Owens testified that he did not have knowledge of what happened to his handgun until Gissendaner showed it to him during her interviews with police and also said she had never told him about any plan involving a burglary at the couple's house. 'She made up this story to avoid breaking up her family,' Owens said in a statement written after he was sentenced to death in 1998. Gissendaner's defense attorney during trial, Bill Head, claimed she had been the one who killed Doug because she wanted him dead and staged his murder as a cover-up. 'She created this elaborate ruse,' he said at trial. 'The truth is she planned it all along.' But the prosecution argued that Gissendaner's testimony was fabricated in an attempt to shift blame for her husband's murder away from Owen, who they said had been hired to do a robbery that Gissendaner knew would turn violent. 'There is not one scrap of evidence anywhere, other than Kelly Renee Gissendanner's word, which suggests Greg Owens ever intended or attempted to harm Douglas Gissendaner,' the prosecution said in a court document filed ahead of his trial. Doug's brother Tim Gissendaner and their cousin John Sowell also testified at trial about what they knew about the couple and how they thought they would react if their marriage fell apart because of an affair. They both told jurors that Gissendaner had made it clear to them she was afraid Doug would kill her one day, according to court documents. 'She didn't want to be single,' Tim said at trial. 'I don't think she thought she could live without him.' But Gissendaner insisted during her testimony that she never threatened Doug with violence and claimed he was the abusive partner in their marriage. She also said she had no idea how Owen planned to kill Doug, saying they 'weren't even thinking about it until we got there,' according to court documents. Her attorneys at trial said they were surprised when she was convicted of murder and that they didn't expect her to be sentenced to death because she had been an accomplice in the crime. Owens received a life sentence after being found guilty. Both Gissendaner and Owen have now exhausted all of their appeals through state courts, leaving only clemency as an option for them to seek a stay from execution. But Deal said he decided not to intervene because there were no new arguments presented in the request for clemency. 'I cannot find that any extraordinary circumstances exist to warrant further delay,' he wrote in his denial letter. In his petition, Gissendaner argued she was innocent of murder and should be granted a stay from execution based on her claims of actual innocence and false confession. She also said her sentence was disproportionate compared to those convicted for crimes involving drugs or child molestation and that she had already served 15 years in prison while others with similar sentences have only spent five. Her legal team, which included federal public defender Stephen Bright, argued that the case against Gissendaner was tainted by racial bias because of a pre-trial motion made to exclude African Americans from serving on her jury. 'The courtâ€™s exclusion of jurors who might have been more lenient based upon their race deprived her of due process and a fair trial,' the legal team said in their petition filed Monday. Gissendaner's family has long maintained that she did not kill Doug. After Owen testified against his girlfriend, his father, Greg Sr., told Channel 2 Action News: 'He was just telling lies to save himself.' In an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week, he said his son had been trying to do the right thing and help Gissendaner by taking responsibility for her crime. But when she started writing letters from prison confessing that Doug really did kill himself after finding out about her affair, Owen became worried his father might take matters into his own hands if he learned about it, according to the newspaper. He also said he felt 'betrayed' by Gissendaner because she had told him in person that Doug was the one who killed himself and that he knew nothing of the burglary plans. Owen eventually asked an investigator for help and the officer called police after finding a letter written to his son by Gissendaner, according to the newspaper. Deal's office did not respond when contacted
