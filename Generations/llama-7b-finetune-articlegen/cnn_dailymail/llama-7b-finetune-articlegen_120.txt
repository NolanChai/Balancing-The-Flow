The Everton manager has confirmed that Kevin Mirallas will be out of action for a considerable period after suffering ligament damage in his knee during Sunday's win over Chelsea. The 23-year-old Belgium forward was hurt early in the second half at Stamford Bridge, and scans have revealed that he has damaged cartilage in his right knee. Mirallas faces an uncertain future after suffering ligament damage in his right knee during Sunday's win over Chelsea . Everton manager Roberto Martinez said: 'Kevin Mirallas will be out for a long time, it's very unfortunate. The news on Kevin is not as good as we hoped.' The full extent of the problem has not been established but it seems likely that he could be facing eight weeks on the sidelines. Martinez said: 'It looks like ligament damage and the cartilage in his knee. It's unfortunate, he was doing really well. 'He had a strong game against Chelsea as you would expect from Kevin. He had to make an impact and give us that extra edge going forward.' Mirallas, who has scored four times since moving to Goodison Park on deadline day last month, is facing his first significant injury problem while with the Merseysiders. Martinez said: 'It's a big setback for him because he was getting stronger and stronger.' The Belgium international will be out of action until at least early 2014 . The Everton manager (right) admitted that Mirallas is 'devastated' by the injury news . Martinez admits it was always likely that he would suffer an injury sooner rather than later given his hectic schedule. He said: 'It comes from a position where it is very demanding to play regularly at a high level.' Mirallas had already been ruled out of Thursday's Capital One Cup clash with Sunderland, and Martinez admits that he will also be sidelined for the Boxing Day trip to West Ham. He added: 'It is eight weeks until we know exactly how much time he needs.' Mirallas has endured a difficult start at Everton since arriving from Wigan in a Â£3.7million deal, and Martinez admitted that he was devastated by the news of his injury. He said: 'It's not easy when you see players who have come to your club and have been very good players for your rivals, and then you are trying to integrate them in a different way. 'They are going through a period of adaptation - it has always been quite intense at Everton. And I am sure Kevin will be devastated by this.' Martinez refused to speculate over how long Mirallas would miss and admitted that he will not return until the New Year at least. He said: 'I cannot say, we have to wait for the scan. We have a rough idea, but it's more or less going to be eight weeks. It might be 10 weeks.' Martinez has already ruled Mirallas out of Thursday night's Capital One Cup tie against Sunderland . The former Wigan man is also expected to miss Everton's Boxing Day clash with West Ham, which will be his first game back since his arrival in September . 'I think he'll definitely not play on Thursday. He might come back after the new year.' Martinez revealed that Mirallas had been playing through discomfort prior to Sunday's injury and is likely to miss the Christmas period entirely. He added: 'He was probably a bit fatigued by the amount of games he played - he missed two weeks with Belgium and came back, then he went into a different type of training to get ready for Chelsea.' Mirallas was an unused substitute at Stamford Bridge but is expected to return to Everton's squad for Thursday evening's Capital One Cup clash. Martinez admits that the Belgium forward has been playing through discomfort prior to Sunday . The Spaniard refused to blame the hectic schedule for Mirallas' injury and insists he will be out of action until early next year . He said: 'The idea was always to give him a few games before Christmas, so he is in contention to play.' Martinez has made no secret of his desire to sign another attacker during the January transfer window. The Spaniard admits that Mirallas' injury means that he will be unable to play until 2014 as he had planned, and conceded that it could force him into a move for another striker in the New Year. He said: 'I think we need to look at options for January. It is not easy now because of Kevin's situation.' Martinez admits he will have to reassess his plans following Mirallas' injury . Martinez has already stated that he wants another player before January 31, but it remains unclear whether he will pursue a loan deal or look for a permanent signing. He said: 'We can work with the players we have until New Year's Day. We could do some short-term things from January 2nd. We are looking to make the team stronger.' Mirallas joined Everton on deadline day, and Martinez has already hinted that he will not be content with just one attacker during the January transfer window . The 42-year-old confirmed that he wants another attacker before the end of the transfer window in early January. He said: 'We have to look for options because of injuries. We need to bring in a player. We will see whether we can find the right one.' Martinez admits that he is looking for a player who offers the same level of pace and dynamism as Mirallas, but accepts that he may not be able to sign his preferred target before January 31. He said: 'We are looking for a player with good technical quality, great speed and strength.' The Belgium international has scored four times since arriving from Wigan in September . Martinez is understood to favour an attacker with pace and dynamism - but admits it may not be possible before the end of January . He added: 'I know what I want, I need a player that can give us good solutions. I am looking for the right one.' Mirallas scored four goals in his first nine appearances for Everton prior to Sunday's injury. It is believed that Martinez will assess the situation over the Christmas period before deciding on his next move. The Spaniard admits that he could not risk signing another player as soon as possible, and says that it may take longer than January 31 to get a deal done. He said: 'I am looking for the right one.' Martinez has already hinted that he wants more attacking reinforcements in January . The Spaniard also confirmed that he has been working with Everton's scouts ahead of a busy transfer window, and admits that his squad needs strengthening. He said: 'I have spoken to our scouting team about January. We will need new players.' Mirallas had made just nine appearances for Everton before picking up an injury in Sunday's win at Stamford Bridge . Mirallas is likely to be replaced by another striker during the transfer window, with Martinez hoping that he can add pace and dynamism . 'We have had a really busy schedule this month. It will give us some time to think about what we need.' Martinez was also asked whether Everton could do more in terms of signing players on permanent deals rather than loan deals, but he admitted that there are certain risks involved with that approach. He said: 'It is not just a question of finding the right player for January. We can buy now or we can wait until the summer.' The Toffees have already signed five players during the winter transfer window - although it remains to be seen whether they will sign more players on loan before the end of the month. Martinez's side take on Sunderland in the Capital One Cup on Thursday night, and could face Chelsea in the FA Cup third round over the weekend. The Spaniard admits that he is unsure how many of his senior players will play in that match . Martinez also revealed that he has yet to make a decision on who will be in charge at Sunderland following Sam Allardyce's departure this week. He said: 'I haven't met the new manager or anybody else involved.' Mirallas (left) was an unused substitute for the Belgian national team during their friendly against Ghana earlier this month . Martinez has admitted that he is not sure whether he will be able to take part in Thursday night's Capital One Cup clash . The Spaniard also revealed that he does not know if he will be able to use his full squad on Thursday, admitting that several players are still carrying injuries. He said: 'I don't know whether all the players can play.' Martinez confirmed that Marouane Fellaini and Gareth Barry are likely to miss out . Martinez also admitted that he will have to decide which players make it into his squad for Thursday evening's Capital One Cup clash. He said: 'The most important thing is to try and get the right balance.' The Spaniard revealed that midfielders Marouane Fellaini, Gareth Barry and Darron Gibson all missed training on Wednesday afternoon. Martinez admits
