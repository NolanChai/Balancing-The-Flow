The funerals of some of the 123 people killed by a suspected suicide bomber at a mosque near Kumasi, capital of Ghana's Ashanti region, were held on Monday with dancing and singing amid tight security. The attack at the Bani Mosque was claimed by Nigerian Islamist sect Boko Haram. Funerals for 30 people killed in the bombing took place in the nearby town of Domeabra, while 21 more funerals were held in Kumasi itself. The final funeral for a victim is due to take place later this week. Some of the victims' families held dances and sang gospel songs during their loved ones' burials, saying it was important not to let grief get the better of them. "We have nothing to be scared about because God has shown us that He is with us," said a family member at one funeral who gave her name as Comfort. "It is true there is death and there are wars all over the world, but we are not supposed to worry about that."

"It is true there is death and there are wars all over the world, but we are not supposed to worry about that." The attack was claimed by Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamist group. It came almost exactly a week after twin bombings at Abuja airport killed 80 people in the country's capital, which is more than 163 miles away from Kumasi. A statement issued by an extremist group said the attack in Ghana had been carried out to avenge what it called 'the killing of Muslims'. The victims were mainly aged between 50 and 70 but included several children, according to reports. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the airport blasts, which killed at least 15 Nigerian soldiers and several civilians as well as foreign nationals . Boko Haram has been responsible for a number of attacks in northern Nigeria since it launched an uprising in 2009. It is fighting to carve out an Islamist state in the north, but its influence has spread across Nigeria's border into neighbouring countries such as Ghana and Cameroon.

'People were gathered around their mats for morning prayers when they heard a loud explosion,' said one witness in Kumasi who gave his name as Emmanuel. 'The explosives had been placed under the mosque. They killed people immediately outside and those inside were also hit by the flying shrapnel.' Some victims of the attack were being buried on Monday after having been taken to a hospital morgue in the Ashanti region, which has a population of more than 20million, according to local news reports . 'The bomb had exploded inside one room but there was no panic because everybody thought it was an accident. 'But when people ran out they found others who were dead and many injured.' Ghana's Interior Minister James Agalga told the BBC that the country would 'not be intimidated by this action'. He said: 'We will not stop the mosques, we will continue to live our normal lives. We are going to pray on Friday as usual in our various mosques.'

'But when people ran out they found others who were dead and many injured' Ghana has been relatively stable since gaining independence from Britain in 1957, with strong democratic traditions and institutions. But the country is still recovering from a bloody civil war between 1983 and 2003 that left up to 40,000 people dead. It is also a major transit route for cocaine traffickers smuggling drugs northwards towards Europe via West Africa.

Ghanaian security officials and troops from Nigeria, Togo and Benin were already in the area on Friday as part of an anti-drug operation called Ecowas Counter Narcotic Operation. The aim is to help the Gulf of Guinea become a narco-free zone by 2015. It also plans to build new road networks linking ports and other trading centres in order to try to boost local economies and cut the supply route for drugs. But some critics say that the region's governments are not doing enough to help stem the flow of cocaine into West Africa, which is being increasingly targeted by Colombian cartels as a transit point because of its lack of security forces. The country's Interior Minister James Agalga told the BBC that Ghana would 'not be intimidated' by the attack . 'There has been a lot of progress in recent years and there is also good co-operation between our intelligence agencies, but we need to do much more,' said David Emmanuel Kotei, executive director at the West Africa Network for Peacebuilding. He added that Ghana still had a long way to go before it could be considered fully safe from attacks such as those seen on Friday. 'We are trying to fight organised crime and we know that in order to do that you need to work together.'
