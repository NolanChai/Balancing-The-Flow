The figures revealed that despite the club making an operating profit in the last financial year – after taxes were paid on their turnover – the biggest single item in their income statement was ‘Other Income’, which at £81m was £95m more than Arsenal’s wage bill for the season.
The £30m shortfall between that figure and Arsenal’s net debt of £67m (excluding transfer fees) indicates that this income is coming from TV and sponsorship deals, not player sales.

### Question:
Q1: Does it mean we have money to spend on players?
Q2: How much do you think they’re spending on transfers each season? (approx £30m)

### Answer:
Yes, that is the point of the question. It was the question asked by Arsene Wenger, which he then answered himself with the words “no”, at least not for transfers in January and more likely in the summer.
“What is very strange,” said Wenger last week, “is there is a lot of money available to spend but only if you are willing to go into debt”. The question mark after the word ‘only’ was to remind us that it wasn’t always this way – that at one point there was no such thing as transfer money.
Wenger explained: “For years we didn’t have any money. In 2001 when I came back from Japan, the first two seasons were very difficult because we had no money and in the end we built a team which won the double – it all went the right way”. That was Wenger’s point. Arsenal should be able to win the title with the players they have (“they’re good enough”, he said), but he needs better players, not only for the team to compete for trophies in May but also so that his current squad can improve.
So how much money does Wenger want? It would depend on who is available and what value the manager places on them; for example, it wouldn’t be necessary if Arsenal were able to buy a £20m striker with a reputation and a CV as strong as Luis Suarez, whose services Liverpool are desperate not to lose.
Wenger said he had not been involved in negotiations for such a player. But that doesn’t mean there is no money available if the club want it; what it means is they have other priorities. A player of £20m-plus value will probably take up 45 per cent or more of Arsenal’s total budget for the season, and even then only if he can play in every league match (not the same as being first choice) - and that excludes paying him a salary.
The only other players who might command similar fees are Gonzalo Higuaín (Napoli), Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid) and Edinson Cavani (Paris St Germain). All of them would be able to make an immediate impact at the club, though not all would have a free role like Suarez; indeed, with so many young players in the squad, Arsenal’s team would not benefit from having another attacker who would dominate as the main striker.
So where is this money going? Wenger was adamant that he didn’t know “because it hasn’t happened yet”; he would only say that there are “big demands for investment in other areas”. What those demands might be, he wouldn’t say (“It doesn’t mean we will spend the money”). However, a couple of things were clear. Firstly, Wenger insists that Arsenal can afford to buy players – it is not an issue of available funds. Secondly, even if there was enough money in the bank for a player or two, he doesn’t want to pay for them with debt. “When I have debts,” said Wenger, “it is because I need it for wages.” That would explain why the club have been so hesitant to spend more on transfers this month, even when it has become clear that their top four rivals are prepared to pay anything.
Wenger is a pragmatist. He said he wouldn’t buy a player “just because there will be money available”. If an opportunity arises, he will look at the deal – but not with his heart. And the same goes for any new signings in the summer. Wenger made clear that when he has been able to spend on players in recent seasons it was only because Arsenal’s financial situation had changed and there were no other demands on funds (“investment”) – it wasn’t an issue of choice. In particular, Arsenal will not go into debt for a player when they could use the money to make improvements in other areas of their business – such as improving their commercial dealings and/or getting out of their current stadium lease (“We need to be in control of our future,” said Wenger).
It is not surprising that Arsenal’s biggest expense each season is players’ wages; they employ more people than any other club. That should mean the club can afford a big-name signing or two - but only if the manager wants them (and wants to play them) and the chairman agrees. “I need the money for wages,” said Wenger, “to compete with top players.”
So while Arsenal’s financial results for 2013-14 are a cause for celebration, they have little impact on Arsenal’s transfer policy this month – unless it is to prove that there isn’t enough money to spend. But if the club’s finances were in such great shape, why would Wenger be spending so much time talking about his current squad? The answer is simple: because he wants more players. It was the manager who asked if Arsenal had money – and that means they don’t have enough quality to compete with Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool or even Tottenham this season.
So what is Wenger doing about it? Nothing yet - “I haven’t done anything” – but he will look at deals when the time is right and when his targets are available. He might want a big-name signing; more likely he needs to buy someone who can play in one of four key areas where Arsenal have weaknesses. In particular, Wenger wants two new players with experience in Europe – ideally a player at centre back and another at right back - as well as another creative midfielder and another striker.
It is a long list and the transfer window will be over by the time they are all available (though Arsenal might still get a player who can fill one of those roles, like Danny Welbeck). But that doesn’t mean Wenger won’t spend on players in January; it just depends what else he needs to spend money on. “It’s not only about buying the best players,” said Wenger last week. He added: “If I can buy someone who is better than what we have and who fits with our style of football, it will happen.”
