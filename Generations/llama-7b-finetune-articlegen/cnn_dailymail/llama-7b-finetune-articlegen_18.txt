New York Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda has been suspended for 10 games after being caught using pine tar to help grip his baseball bat. Pineda was caught by Tampa Bay Rays manager Joe Maddon when he reached into the right field wall and touched the cap on the rookie's head before the two teams played in New York. The 23-year-old Dominican, who denied any wrongdoing after being confronted, later admitted that pine tar was indeed used for 'grip purposes'. The right-hander, who has a career record of 6–5, issued an apology and said: 'I wanted to apologise to the Rays organisation. I did not mean to do anything wrong. It's been an unfortunate situation that happened.' Pineda was penalised under rule 8.02 (B), which bans pitchers from having foreign substances on their person or clothing, including gloves and shoes. The suspension will take effect immediately and the ban carries over to all games in post-season play as well as any other future games that would have been missed because of a minor injury. The fine was $10,000 (£6,240). Pineda is the fourth pitcher to be punished for using pine tar on his person this season. It comes after Rays star David Price and Texas Rangers reliever Neftali Feliz were suspended last month for having the foreign substance. Yankees' closer Mariano Rivera was also given a five-game ban in 2011 when he had a banned substance on his glove. Pineda, who has been with New York since being acquired from the Seattle Mariners last year, is 6–5 with a 3.74 ERA this season.
