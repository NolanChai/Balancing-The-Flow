Sony have released the PlayStation 4 on November 15th 2013. The first game I purchased was Battlefield 4 which is a war game developed by EA DICE and published by Electronic Arts (EA). It has been out for a while now since its release in October 2013, but it has proven to be an extremely successful title, having sold over $250 million on the first day of launch. The main reason I bought this game was because of how amazing the graphics looked in comparison with previous consoles, such as the PS4. It was one of the main reasons why I purchased the console. The game itself is a first-person shooter (FPS) set in modern times and the campaign follows U.S Marine Sgt. Preston Marino’s journey through war torn Shanghai China. However the best part about this game, which most people seem to love it for, is the multiplayer. With up to 64 players battling on a single map (a lot of maps can hold over 100 players in each mode) this was the first FPS title that I truly enjoyed playing. I felt as if I could have a huge impact on any battle by taking out one or two key players which ultimately changes the flow of the game and makes it more enjoyable. The next game I bought, along with my brother, for the PS4 was Watch Dogs. This was mainly because I had read about how amazing its graphics looked and how fun it could be to explore a huge open-world city. It was not long after playing this title that I realised its major flaw, which in turn ruined the game for me; hacking. I was extremely excited to begin my journey into the virtual world of Chicago but once again found myself in an FPS title with no ability to take down enemies or affect any kind of change. The only way you can attack another player is through a car (which was not included with the original PS4 version, as it was added in a later patch) or by hacking into their device and causing mayhem, which takes so long that they’re most likely dead already before it happens. It could be a great game, if only they didn't ruin it for me with poor decisions. The next title I played was Destiny. This was the first time I had seen this franchise in action and I can honestly say it is one of my favourite games to play at the moment. The story follows humanity’s last stand as they fight against an evil race known as the ‘Fallen.’ These are a race of aliens who want nothing more than to exterminate mankind, so that they may be the only race left. Players can join one of three factions: The Hunters, Warlocks or Titans and take on quests given by NPC’s (non-playable characters). These missions consist of players going from point A to B, killing enemies along the way and completing various other objectives. Once you have completed a mission it is rewarded with ‘loot,’ which can be weapons or armour that you need to get stronger in order to take on the next stage. This title is also an FPS but there are certain differences compared to the previous games I bought, such as the ability to jump and glide across large areas, along with a wider range of weapons. The only main problem is how long it takes for your character to heal (this can be affected by the game mode you’re playing in) which means if you die, then that is pretty much it unless you restart from scratch at an earlier point in the game or pay real money to respawn. Overall this game is amazing and I would definitely recommend purchasing this title for any PS4 user, along with the PS3 version of course. The last title I bought on my console was Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. This game took me by surprise as it has been a long time since I had played an AC game. The reason being that most of them are on PC and I only have one. In this game you play as Edward Kenway, the grandfather of the assassins in the franchise. He is a pirate who washes up on a Caribbean island and ends up joining the crew of Blackbeard and becoming his right-hand man (I believe he's also his son). This title has a massive open world map to explore, along with amazing graphics. It gives you the chance to climb anywhere in order to get a better view on your surroundings. You can also steal any kind of vessel that is around the area and use it for your own gain. The main reason I bought this title was because it’s based during the age of sailing ships, which I found extremely interesting considering its a game that has been created through modern times. The only downside to this game is that there are certain glitches such as the character getting stuck in walls or on other objects and having to restart the mission. Apart from this one major problem it’s an amazing game to play and I would recommend anyone who enjoys gaming, especially FPS games, to purchase this title. As you can see above I have purchased a few titles since acquiring my PS4 console but most of them are still in the process of downloading at the time of writing this article, so I may get back to some reviews on them soon enough.
