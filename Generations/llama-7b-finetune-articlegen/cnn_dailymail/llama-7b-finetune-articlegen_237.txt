The Football Association (FA) has been given an extra £10million to pay off debts owed by its 72 member clubs and invest in facilities for youngsters. The injection of cash comes as a result of a change in the way that Premier League TV money is distributed, which will increase the amount going to the FA from 95 per cent to 100 per cent until 2016-17. It is hoped that this will enable the FA to pay off the debt owed to clubs by 30 June of next year and also invest in the grass roots game, including a new national football centre at St George’s Park. The £10m will be paid out from the Premier League’s solidarity fund which distributes TV money to all other leagues via the Football League. This payment was set up after the 1992 Bosman ruling where players could leave their clubs without compensation or transfer fees, but have not been used until now. The extra £10m is in addition to the original £38.5m that has been made available from this fund and which will be paid out over four years. The FA announced the decision following a meeting at St George's Park with representatives of all 72 member clubs. It is understood that it was proposed by the Professional Footballers’ Association and supported by the Football League, whose chairman Greg Clarke said: ‘This funding will have a real impact on grass roots football and also enable us to clear our debt with the FA.’ Hereford United are currently facing the possibility of liquidation.
