<blockquote><p>A couple of days ago my best friend, and roommate for over two years, informed me he was going back home with his parents to Hong Kong.</p></blockquote><p>I found out later that a hotel in their neighborhood was quarantined because 200 guests had all been stricken by some horrible virus. Luckily none of them died, and after being confined for one week the guests were set free. I asked my best friend what it was like to be stuck there with all those people and he said that it was really weird.</p></blockquote>
