#### Step 1. Begin with a single quote mark (') in your answer box, followed by a capital letter and space: "The . . .". Do not include the final punctuation mark when you do this. You may use an ellipsis (. . .) for this purpose if it will help you remember what to put next.
#### Step 2. Begin with another quote mark (') and a space, followed by your first word(s): "The . . ." .

### Hints:
* The second article sentence contains an em-dash ('---'). The article title begins with this word. The third article sentence does not contain any punctuation other than commas (, ). If you need to refer back to the first article sentence and do not want to include it in your answer, just write '---'.
* You will have at least two sentences to fill in for this question - some articles may be longer.
