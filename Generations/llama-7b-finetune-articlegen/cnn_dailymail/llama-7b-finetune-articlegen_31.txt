Jeremy Hunt is in talks with Tory leadership hopeful Theresa May about how they can work together after she invited him to a birthday celebration at his office next week. The Health Secretary said he hoped the event would help to ‘build bridges’ as he confirmed that he had been approached by Mrs May for a get-together on June 23. In her capacity as Home Secretary, Mrs May is in charge of the Prison Service, which is also funded out of the NHS budget. The move has sparked speculation that she may try to use it as a pretext to launch a leadership challenge against David Cameron following his decision to quit after next week’s EU referendum. Mr Hunt said: ‘It will be a great way for me to build bridges with the Home Office and work together to make sure we keep our borders secure, but also that we don’t have overcrowded prisons.’ Theresa May has invited Jeremy Hunt to a birthday party at his office on June 23 . The Health Secretary said he hoped it would help ‘build bridges’ after the pair fell out over NHS reforms . Mrs May, who is one of two favourites with the bookies to replace Mr Cameron as Tory leader and Prime Minister, has been criticised for refusing to publicly endorse him or his Government. She declined an invitation from Mr Hunt’s predecessor Andrew Lansley to a launch party for a £5billion funding package announced yesterday. The Home Secretary is understood to have told her colleagues that she would not attend until she had decided whether Mr Hunt was the right person to lead the NHS, a role which will become hers when Mr Cameron leaves Downing Street in September. Mrs May also refused an invitation from George Osborne on Wednesday to take part in a ‘Leave’ campaign event at 10 Downing Street after saying it would be ‘unacceptable for me as Home Secretary to comment’, although she has backed the UK staying in the EU. However, Mr Hunt revealed that he had been approached by Mrs May about her birthday party and said that he was considering attending because of their shared interest in tackling immigration. He added: ‘She is someone who shares my commitment to public service.’ The event on June 23 is being held at Mr Hunt’s office in Whitehall but it is not clear if the party will be a formal affair or an informal gathering of Tory MPs and other senior figures from his department. Mr Cameron has made no secret of his desire to see Mrs May succeed him as Prime Minister, although he has said that she should only stand for leader if she is ready. He told The Sunday Telegraph last week: ‘I think Theresa will have a big role in the next five years of this Government and maybe more than that.’ The Health Secretary confirmed yesterday that he was considering standing at the next election but would not confirm whether he would be standing alongside Mrs May, or another leadership candidate. Mr Hunt added: 'When you see so many talented people within our party then it’s always very flattering to be approached for things like this.’ He has clashed with Home Secretary Theresa May over NHS reforms . Mrs May refused an invitation from George Osborne on Wednesday to take part in a 'Leave' campaign event at 10 Downing Street . He said that he had not been asked by any Tory MPs yet, adding: ‘I’ve got enough people wanting to have dinner with me as it is.’ Mr Cameron has repeatedly warned his colleagues against staging a leadership contest before the referendum on June 23, which he believes could damage Conservative chances of winning if they are seen as divided. The PM said: ‘I’m very clear that I don’t want another party in this country thinking for one moment that it can break up our Union and get away with it.’ He added: ‘My job is to make sure we win the referendum, win it clearly, then win the general election and deliver on those things that people voted us back into office to do. That’s what I am absolutely focused on.’ Mr Cameron has repeatedly warned his colleagues against staging a leadership contest before the EU referendum . The PM said: 'My job is to make sure we win the referendum, win it clearly, then win the general election' . Mrs May and Mrs Leadsom have been tipped as potential contenders for Tory leader if Mr Cameron quits. Mrs May has previously told colleagues that she would not stand again at the next election but said last week: ‘I’m thinking about whether or not I can do it. I will make a decision in due course.’ The Home Secretary also suggested that she could quit if Mr Cameron is ousted by his own MPs, adding: 'It's important to have leadership elections when they are needed and not before.' Mrs Leadsom, the junior Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has said that she wants to run her department properly first and will then assess whether to stand for the leadership. She told The Sunday Telegraph last week: ‘I'm in favour of being open-minded.’ Mrs May is one of two front runners to replace David Cameron as Tory leader . Conservative Party chairman and Leave campaigner Michael Gove said yesterday that he was considering standing, although he will not make a final decision until after the referendum. The former Education Secretary told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ‘I think we need a very different sort of leadership to what has gone before. A kind of leadership which can build and rebuild Britain. And in order for us to do that, it’s going to be necessary for our party to come together again, and the best way we will come together is if we win this referendum.’ Mr Gove said he would not stand unless it was clear that a Brexit vote would pass . The Home Office did not respond to requests from the Sunday Telegraph to comment on Mrs May’s birthday party plans. She is understood to have told her colleagues that she would not attend until she had decided whether Mr Hunt was the right person to lead the NHS, a role which will become hers when Mr Cameron leaves Downing Street in September . However, a spokesman for the Health Secretary said: ‘We are very supportive of the Home Office and Theresa May. She is doing an excellent job as Home Secretary.’ Mrs May has previously said that she would not run if Mr Cameron was ousted by his own MPs . Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, a prominent Remain campaigner who is also standing to be Tory leader, said: ‘There will be other events and things going on. I have no doubt that there are other parties that will be taking place at the Home Office.’ The Health Secretary has had a turbulent first two weeks as a Cabinet minister, having been reprimanded by Downing Street after he claimed to have taken a ‘back of a fag packet’ calculation for how much money it would take to fund seven-day NHS services. Mr Hunt said that the £8billion deal, announced this week by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Chancellor George Osborne, represented 20 per cent more than his original proposal but later admitted he had got the figures wrong because of an ‘inadvertent mistake’. He also suggested that NHS workers were too old to be effective and told them not to work beyond 65 or risk losing their jobs in a speech to doctors last month which was dubbed ‘disgraceful’ by trade unions. Mr Hunt has had a turbulent two weeks since becoming Health Secretary . Mrs May, who is one of two front runners to replace David Cameron as Tory leader, also declined an invitation from George Osborne on Wednesday to take part in a 'Leave' campaign event at 10 Downing Street . The Health Secretary and Chancellor revealed the deal yesterday - but it was criticised as too little by leading doctors . A spokesman for the Home Office did not respond to requests from the Sunday Telegraph to comment on Mrs May’s birthday party plans. Mr Hunt said: 'She is someone who shares my commitment to public service.' Jeremy Corbyn, Labour leader, said yesterday that he would step down if his party lost the EU referendum but denied he was going to quit in the event of a victory for Brexit. He told ITV’s Peston on Sunday: ‘It’s about leading the Labour Party out of opposition into government.’ Mr Corbyn added: ‘There’s no question I will be stepping down as leader if we lose, but that’s not to say I don’t want to win. The only reason we are having a referendum is because of my intervention in the Labour Party leadership election and the fact that so many people signed up for membership.’ He also told MPs during Prime Minister's Questions that he had ‘no plans whatsoever’ to stand down as leader if his party won on June 23. Mr Corbyn added: 'I have no plans whatsoever other than to work in order to make sure we win this referendum.' However, Labour MP Chris Leslie said he would not seek a second ballot for the leadership after Mr Corbyn was elected earlier this year. He told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ‘The whole point of what
