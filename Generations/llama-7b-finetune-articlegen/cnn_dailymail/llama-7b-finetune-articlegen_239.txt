A view of the Eiffel Tower against the Paris skyline is breathtaking on an ordinary day, but the French capital was recently bathed in a rainbow that was so rare it actually had the shape of a rainbow upside down! The stunning natural phenomenon was seen over Place de la Concorde last month and delighted locals and tourists alike. It was caused by a combination of an upright cloud sitting over Paris, sunlight passing through it and raindrops in the air which acted like prisms. 
The phenomenon is known as an upside down rainbow or circumzenithal arc - which literally means 'around zenith'. These are rare sights because they only appear when the sun shines at a high angle, meaning that the raindrops act as a mirror in the sky and can cause this unusual shape. It is caused by light reflected from water droplets in a cloud. The phenomenon was last seen in Paris during 2013 . Last year, an upside down rainbow also appeared over Manchester's Salford Quays - which resulted in people rushing to the quay in order to see it for themselves!
