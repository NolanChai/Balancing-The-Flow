Talktalk has finally shaken its title as the most complained-about broadband provider, having received nearly 40% more grievances than any other. The company’s bosses have now pledged to address the poor service by installing more staff to deal with customers' problems and improving the way it handles complaints. Talktalk, which serves around four million UK households and is Britain's second largest broadband provider, received 380 complaints per 100,000 customers in September - a rate of nearly one every hour, according to regulator Ofcom. That compares with just 242 for BT’s retail arm and less than half the 793 per 100,000 complaints it received last year .

Its competitor Virgin Media has also seen complaints fall by around a third to 86 per 100,000 customers, from 125 in September 2011. The research does not cover other internet service providers but shows that the overall picture is improving . It comes despite the company's bosses pledging last year to invest £40million into improving customer services and satisfaction. In January, it launched a 'customer first' initiative which included recruiting 500 new call centre staff for its technical support helplines. Talktalk said that the latest improvements will see an extra 130 people hired by September, bringing total numbers to 680. The company has also changed the way it handles complaints, with more senior staff members trained as mediators and given a greater say in how problems are resolved. It comes despite the company's bosses pledging last year to invest £40million into improving customer services . A Talktalk spokesman said: 'The number of complaints we received from our customers is falling and continues to be well below industry average. 'We are constantly looking at new ways of improving the service that we provide.' Ofcom figures show a marked fall in complaints over the past 12 months, with an average rate of 135 per 100,000 customers in September compared with 154 a year earlier. The research does not cover other internet service providers but shows that the overall picture is improving. Internet giant Google has been criticised for poor customer services . It is thought to be down to increased competition from online providers such as TalkTalk and Virgin Media, which have spent more on customer service. BT said it was ‘well below industry average’ in complaints but added that it had recently launched a new initiative aimed at improving its telephone helpline . There are also signs of an increasingly competitive internet market as more firms begin to provide broadband services.

BT said it was ‘well below industry average’ in complaints but added that it had recently launched a new initiative aimed at improving its telephone helpline. It has also introduced a free web-based tool which allows customers to see their local broadband speed and compare it with other providers' services, as well as to sign up for better speeds if available in their area. In September, BT announced that it was taking on another 400 customer service advisers after being overwhelmed by a surge of calls from customers who wanted to switch broadband provider . The figures will be welcomed by consumers, who have been bombarded with TV ads in recent months promoting the benefits of switching.

Ofcom’s latest figures also show an increase in complaints about landline and mobile phone services as consumers become more aware of their rights under the Consumer Rights Bill, which was introduced in October. Mobile operator O2 received 136 complaints per 100,000 customers - a rate of 96 - while Vodafone had 74. The biggest rise was at Tesco Mobile, which saw complaints rocket from eight to 53 after it announced in September that all of its tariffs would be scrapped and replaced with cheaper plans. Talktalk's bosses pledged last year to invest £40million into improving customer services . O2 said the complaint rate was still below the average for mobile providers while Vodafone said it had received a 17% increase in complaints after launching new deals. The Consumer Rights Bill gives customers the right to switch their contract with just one month's notice and receive compensation if a deal does not live up to its promises. It also gives people the option of leaving without penalty from the moment they take out an initial contract.

It follows news that the company's profits fell sharply in the first nine months of this year, with net income plummeting 26% to £1.8billion compared with last time. Its shares fell as low as 196p today before recovering and closing at 204p - down 7.3p on the day. The company's profits have been under pressure for some months, due partly to a slowdown in the growth of its broadband business. It is also struggling to deal with the demands of regulator Ofcom, which has demanded that it cut prices and improve its customer service. BT said: 'BT is one of the best performing major UK companies when it comes to complaints... The number of complaints we receive from our customers is falling.'

It said the job cuts would affect less than one per cent of its 91,000 workforce. It added that the restructuring was a necessary ‘one-off cost saving’ designed to put it on track to achieve its target of £500million of cost savings by 2014/15. It also said that while BT Retail had seen a decline in customer numbers, these were offset by the growth of its Openreach arm, which supplies services to rival companies such as TalkTalk. The company's shares fell sharply after news of the job cuts and closure of centres . As well as axing 380 jobs, BT will close five call centres in Reading (pictured), Leeds, Basildon, Manchester and Slough . BT also announced a £15million investment in its Openreach business to boost fibre broadband connections and improve mobile coverage. It said the extra cash was needed for ‘operational costs’ and would not have any impact on profitability. However, City analysts warned that it could be a sign of increased competition from rival companies as they develop their own network infrastructure. BT has already lost 2million customers to rivals since launching its new price structure in August . It comes after the company revealed last week that profits had plummeted in recent months, forcing it into a major restructuring programme which could see up to 380 jobs being axed.
