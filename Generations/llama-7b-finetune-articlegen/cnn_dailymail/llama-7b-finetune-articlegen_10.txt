WASHINGTON (AP) â€” A man who was stabbed by a fellow street performer on the Mall after refusing to move for a concert says he will return to his normal routine soon and hopes to use the experience to inspire others. 23-year-old Timothy Chu suffered a punctured lung from the attack Saturday afternoon, just before a performance of the National Symphony Orchestra began on the west end of the mall. The symphony's concert director had asked Chu to move back several feet so that concertgoers could see the show. He refused and was stabbed in the chest by 20-year-old David Fowler, police say. Fowler then tried to run away but was caught and charged with attempted murder and assault. "It's very much a miracle," Chu said Wednesday during a news conference. He credited his fellow street performers for helping him survive the attack. Chu said he feels lucky that his injuries were not more severe. The man says he has received a lot of support from friends and family since the incident, which was caught on video and posted online. "This is definitely something that I hope will inspire people to be more tolerant," Chu said. He says he hopes to return to performing soon but hasn't yet decided exactly when. The concert Saturday night honored the 50th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's inaugural speech and the orchestra played music from JFK movies, including "Dreamers" from Steven Spielberg's "Lincoln." "This was not a political statement in any way," said Chu, who is studying history at American University. The attack happened as people were arriving for the concert and there was an unusually large crowd of about 60,000 on the mall that day due to cold temperatures. Police say they are still searching for a motive for the attack but believe it had nothing to do with the concert. Fowler is being held without bond in D.C. jail and is scheduled to appear in court next month.
