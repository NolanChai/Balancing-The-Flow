Tory leader David Cameron will pledge to scrap the human rights act if he wins next year’s election, Sir Bob Russell said yesterday. The independent MP for Ipswich revealed that Mr Cameron had told him last week that he would seek to replace it with a Bill of Rights. In a letter to constituents, Sir Bob also revealed that he had been offered a free two-hour tour around Colchester by Tory leadership contender Chris Grayling in an attempt to lure voters back to the party after the Coalition lost their 50th seat last week. He said: 'I recently received a letter from Chris Grayling offering me a free two-hour tour around Colchester (sic) to discuss local issues with him and his team of campaign volunteers.' In a separate letter to constituents, Sir Bob said Mr Cameron had told him that he would seek to replace the act with a Bill of Rights. 'I was asked if I thought it [the Human Rights Act] could be reformed rather than scrapped,’ wrote Sir Bob. ‘The reply was "not in my view and it will only be replaced by a British Bill of Rights”.' The Liberal Democrats yesterday attacked Mr Cameron’s comments as ‘ill-thought out.’ A spokesman said: 'No one knows what a bill of rights would look like but the chances are that if you are an MP in this Parliament, your job is on the line. It’s all very well talking about it at election time – it doesn’t do anything for the people who are struggling with their mortgages or struggling to pay their bills.’ The Act was enacted after Britain signed up to the European Convention on Human Rights in 1953 and includes a 'right' to family life. It also covers Article eight, which protects against unlawful arrest or detention and prohibits interference with privacy of correspondence. In recent weeks senior Tories have called for scrapping it as well as reforming Britain’s immigration laws. In a letter published in The Times on Saturday, Mr Grayling wrote: 'The Human Rights Act is an accidental and unintended creation which has over-reached its remit. It is undemocratic because it binds the hands of our own Parliament.' Last month Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced that the Government would seek to curb the European Court’s ability to strike down British laws on human rights grounds. He said judges must be ‘sensitive to the way in which decisions are taken by Parliament, rather than imposing an interpretation upon them.’ The Government is seeking a new ruling from the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights that would restrict its powers under Article 8, which protects against unlawful arrest or detention and prohibits interference with privacy of correspondence. It comes amid claims that the court has been used to block laws on terrorism and immigration controls as well as a ban on hunting with dogs in England and Wales. Mr Cameron is also seeking reform of Article 8, which he described last year as ‘one of those European human rights conventions that causes most concern in Britain’. The Conservative leader has said it should be replaced by a 'British Bill of Rights'. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government declined to comment on Mr Cameron's claims that he will scrap the Human Rights Act if re-elected next year.
