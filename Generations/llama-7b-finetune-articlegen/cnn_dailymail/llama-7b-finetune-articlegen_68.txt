The dreamcatcher is an interesting new invention developed by scientists at . and is claimed to be able to interpret up to 60% of a person's dreams, but how accurate is this figure? What percentage can it really accurately detect? A study was conducted on 84 volunteers who were asked to describe their dreams after waking up in the morning. The scientists then input the information into a computer and tested whether or not they could identify any patterns in these dreams. They discovered that for 60% of people, they were able to pick out certain key phrases that would indicate what type of mood they were feeling (for example: 'I felt angry' or 'I felt lonely'). The machine was only able to successfully read a person's dream when they had experienced both positive and negative emotions in it. It could not tell if someone was having an angry dream or a happy one, as the emotion seemed to be too similar between these two categories - so it did not pick up on any clues that might indicate what type of mood they were feeling at that time. In addition, when asked about their sleep quality after being given such information by scientists using this device, 65% reported having had a better night's rest than usual and felt more refreshed upon waking up in the morning - which may suggest there are some benefits associated with understanding one's dreams. Overall though, it appears that even though this technology is able to detect certain key phrases from people's dreams when asked about them at waking moments after sleeping, its accuracy rate of 60% does not seem high enough for practical application - especially considering how often people might forget what they were dreaming about during night time!
