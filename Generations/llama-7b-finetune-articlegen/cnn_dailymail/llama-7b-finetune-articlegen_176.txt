The company is already under fire after it announced a 25% increase in prices . Now an online petition has been launched urging J.Crew to abandon plans for more price hikes and improve the quality of its products. The website change.org was set up by Jennifer Brown who claims she has bought a number of items from the retailer only to be left disappointed as they did not fit properly or looked cheaply made. She wrote: 'As a consumer I would like J Crew to go back to what they do best - make high quality, timeless products at affordable prices.' So far more than 900 people have signed the petition . It comes after the brand revealed it was to increase prices by 25% this year. A spokeswoman for J.Crew said: 'We appreciate our customers' comments and will be happy to respond if they are sent directly to us.' But some shoppers defended J.Crew, saying they were simply being forced to charge more due to the rising cost of labour. One wrote: 'There is no reason why we should continue to pay the same for an item that has gone up in price while we have not. They are making a product and having it delivered to our doorstep.' A J.Crew spokesman said last year that it was aiming to cut 100 million from its manufacturing costs by next spring. The company is also trying to increase sales overseas and is planning new stores in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. It recently opened its first UK store on London's Regent Street but many shoppers have been disappointed by prices which are higher than those offered by rivals such as Zara. J Crew was founded in 1983 by Tom and Libby Mellors who bought a small warehouse in New Hampshire with an initial investment of Â£40,000. It began as a mail order catalogue company which sold men's clothing but now also offers women's fashion, shoes and accessories. J Crew has over 375 stores across the US and Canada.
