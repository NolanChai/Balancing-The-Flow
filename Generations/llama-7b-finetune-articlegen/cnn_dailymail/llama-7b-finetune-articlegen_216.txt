In my opinion I believe that this article has been sensationalised and blown out of proportion with the help of some over excited "Human Rights Groups".
I'll let you make your own judgement about the validity of the story from there, but you should be careful as there are plenty of misleading websites out there which have an agenda to create false news in order for them to get a better ranking on Google. 
I'd recommend checking [this site](http://www.snopes.com/spanking-american-children) before taking this article too seriously!
