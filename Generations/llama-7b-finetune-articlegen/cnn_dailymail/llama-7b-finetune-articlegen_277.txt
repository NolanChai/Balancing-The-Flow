This was a rather easy one to do, although I got off to a false start (which is why I used the word 'provided' instead of 'given'). I just wrote down the article title and first sentence (which happens to be the last line), copied it into Google Translate, pasted that into Google News to translate the text back to English, and then copied what was there into Notepad++ and finished it up.
