The news is out that the US military has created an ant-like robot called Cheetah which can run at a speed of around 10 miles (16km) per hour. The researchers say this is the first time an animal's natural movement system has been mimicked using only soft, flexible materials, which could revolutionise future robots. They believe it will lead to machines that are not only faster and more powerful than humans, but also cheaper to produce. Scroll down for video .

In order for the robot to mimic an animal's natural movement system using soft materials, the research team from Carnegie Mellon University had to rethink how to build a machine. Instead of relying on hard metal or rigid plastic parts that are common in today's robots, they used flexible pneumatic tubes for its limbs and torso, which inflate with air at different pressures. The robot then responds by bending its body, giving the illusion it is running, jumping, climbing or otherwise moving like a real animal. 'What we are doing here is rethinking robot design in order to make them better,' said Michael Helms, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Carnegie Mellon and one of the researchers on the project. The soft materials used for the limbs allow them to adapt quickly when moving through different terrains - such as grass, sand or gravel - instead of relying on heavy motors like many existing machines do. 'The robot can run at high speeds even in unstructured environments,' Helms said. 'These are the first robots that have been able to run so fast without having rigid parts.' The robot's soft legs are made up of an inflatable bladder that is connected to a pneumatic tube on its torso . The team's findings were published in the journal Science Robotics. Other researchers hope their work will lead to machines that can be used in search and rescue efforts, or as unmanned vehicles to patrol borders or remote regions where human involvement isn't feasible. 'The robot is also very simple,' said Ilari Liusu, the paper's co-author who works with Carnegie Mellon's Robotics Institute. 'We think it will be very easy for someone to build one on their own.' The researchers are now testing Cheetah in unstructured terrain and say they hope to see how it handles more complex situations like going down a steep hill or navigating around obstacles such as rocks, trees and other types of foliage.

The robot is the first to run at a speed of 10 miles per hour - the fastest any legged robot has ever been able to move. It is also the first time an animal's natural movement system has been mimicked using only soft, flexible materials . The robot's soft legs are made up of an inflatable bladder that is connected to a pneumatic tube on its torso. As it runs, pressure increases in the air and the bladder stretches out. When it hits rocks or grass, the material shrinks again, giving Cheetah a smoother landing.

'We thought we would be lucky to get a robot that runs at 5 mph but Cheetah ran faster than our expectations . The team tested their design in a grass field and saw its legs stumble several times, though they were able to correct themselves each time. While the researchers have seen some improvements, they admit it isn't easy to get a robot moving at such high speeds.
