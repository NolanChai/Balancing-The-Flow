A. A publisher has said libraries should pay the same price for ebooks as consumers and give them the option to buy books with 'simultaneous access'. The Publishers Association (PA) is calling for a system whereby libraries can rent e-books in much the same way they would loan paperbacks or hardbacks. It suggests publishers should offer libraries 20 per cent less than the price they charge consumers, plus a rental fee for each book. The PA argues that this will provide authors with 'an income stream' and ensure books continue to be written by writers. It added: ‘Authors, publishers, librarians and readers all benefit from libraries.’ In its submission to the Government’s consultation on ebooks it argued that authors should receive 50 per cent of a book’s retail price when an e-book is lent out by libraries. Libraries would then be required to buy the rights to the books they borrow so there is no danger of them being left with unsellable stock after a certain period. It would also mean libraries could rent out a greater number of titles as they would have no obligation to hold onto books for long periods of time. The PA wants to see an e-book lending system similar to the one in place for physical book loans, where readers are only allowed to borrow a single copy at any one time. But it argued that this is not necessary with digital copies because there will never be more than one reader simultaneously using a book. It also suggested libraries could buy multiple licenses and share them between each other’s users or make titles available for unlimited loans. The PA’s director general Richard Mollett said: 'We are making these proposals to ensure that authors continue to get paid for their work, as well as to give librarians a solution which is affordable but also gives them the best possible service for users of their library.' Meanwhile the UK's largest union representing librarians and information workers said it would oppose any new system where libraries were required to pay publishers directly. General secretary Chris Mullin added: ‘The PA’s proposal will mean less money going into authors’ pockets, more costly e-book lending and, ultimately, fewer titles for library users.’ The UK has 61 million registered borrowers from local libraries and they take out around a billion books every year. About 30 per cent of those are ebooks. The Government is considering how to overhaul the copyright licensing system that governs ebook lending in public libraries across England, Scotland and Wales. It has announced plans for a new framework to allow libraries to share titles with one another – but it will not have direct control over what terms they must agree on. Ministers are also looking at the possibility of allowing consumers to buy an unlimited number of licenses for books through libraries as well as the suggestion that publishers should receive more money from loans than they do currently. The consultation is due to close later this month, before a final decision is made in the autumn.
