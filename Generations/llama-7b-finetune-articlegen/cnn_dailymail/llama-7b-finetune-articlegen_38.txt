How is it possible for a single, 23-year-old man to have killed at least four people and raped three others?

### Explanation:
The young man in question was convicted of serial killings spree in the summer of 2017. The FBI has named him one of its "most wanted" offenders, even though he is still alive. Authorities are seeking information from any citizens who may have seen or heard something about him. If you know anything, please contact your local law enforcement agency.
