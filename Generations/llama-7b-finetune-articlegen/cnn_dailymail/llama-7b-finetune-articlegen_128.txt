Frank Lampard is still not happy with his new contract, Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has admitted. The midfielder returned to pre-season training without signing a deal and Mourinho says he will try again to get the England man to stay put. He also warned the Blues squad that they needed to 'adapt' themselves to life under his management - and even appeared to tell John Terry and Ashley Cole to think about their futures too.

'We are trying hard to get the best out of everyone,' Mourinho told reporters. 'The adaptation of players, young and old, it’s very important. 'I know how difficult it is to leave a team that you like but sometimes it's better for footballers because they feel more comfortable in one club than another.' The 51-year-old also said he hoped the club could persuade Lampard to stay at Stamford Bridge, even though he is keen to join New York Red Bull. 'We know how much he wants to play and we want him to stay here because he's a fantastic player for us,' Mourinho added. 'But also I think it’s his dream to go there (to Major League Soccer).

The pair have long been close friends, although Lampard admitted in recent weeks he is ready to leave Chelsea following an argument with Mourinho after last season's Champions League final defeat by Bayern Munich. But Terry has insisted that Lampard will return as a player before the start of next campaign. 'Frank's one of my best mates,' said Terry.

'I've known him since I was 14 and I know how good he is,' added Terry. 'He's one of the best players in England. He's played a lot of football - more than I have - but if you can get Frank Lampard fit then we can be a good team.'

'I think we all know how important I am to the team and want me to stay at this football club,' said Terry. 'For me it's not about money, it's about winning trophies. The manager has been clear - he needs players who are hungry for success.' But Mourinho insists that he is more concerned with getting the best out of his squad than offering them big pay-packets.
