KABUL, Afghanistan -- An Afghan soldier opened fire on U.S. forces at an American base in eastern Afghanistan Thursday and killed three Americans before he was killed himself in a shootout, officials said. The shooting occurred inside the coalition's main combat outpost at Sharan, capital of Paktika province in the country's east. An Afghan soldier killed by NATO forces has been identified as Mohammed Nabi. He was one of three who died Friday when he shot and killed a U.S. Air Force pilot with an M-4 rifle inside Forward Operating Base Sharona, the base commander told CNN. The incident took place at around 1 p.m. local time, said Maj. Mark Schomaker, public affairs officer for Combined Joint Task Force 82. An American soldier was also wounded in the shooting and remains in serious condition at a medical treatment facility, Schomaker said. "An Afghan national opened fire on U.S. troops inside an office," he said. "When our forces returned fire they killed that individual." The shooter's body has been taken to the morgue of Paktika province's main hospital in Sharan for identification and investigation, Schomaker told CNN. Also Friday, a NATO service member was injured when an Afghan soldier opened fire on allied troops near the town of Kandahar. The incident occurred at 2 p.m., said Gen. Sher Mohammed Zazai, chief spokesman for the Afghan National Army. He could not give further details and CNN was not able to immediately get more information from NATO officials. Also Friday, a bomb struck a bus in southern Kandahar province, killing two people -- including a child -- and injuring 14 others. The attack took place about 8:30 p.m., said Zazai. He didn't say who was behind the attack, but said that there are several insurgent groups operating in southern Afghanistan. Friday's death toll for the Afghan soldiers brings to at least six the number of NATO personnel killed by their Afghan counterparts since March 23 -- including an international service member and two American civilians. The shootings come as President Obama is set to unveil a new strategy in Afghanistan on Tuesday aimed at ending nearly nine years of war in that country. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, he said the United States will have some troops in Afghanistan after 2014 and may continue to provide logistical support there for a while afterward. But Obama also made it clear that the United States won't remain there forever if Afghanistan is unable to stand on its own feet. "The goal has always been an Afghani-led reconciliation process," he said, with some Taliban members able to come back into Afghan society without fear of retribution. But Obama stressed that the United States won't accept a peace deal that would allow the Taliban -- or any group for that matter -- to establish safe havens inside Afghanistan and use it as a base from which to plot attacks against the United States and its allies. The U.S. president said that will never happen. "The Afghans themselves have to make these decisions," Obama told Amanpour, according to an excerpt of the interview that CNN is broadcasting on Sunday morning's edition of "State of the Union." "We're going to help them make those decisions and then ultimately we want to see Afghans own their country and take responsibility for what they need to do in terms of security, in terms of rebuilding their economy. We will be there as a partner." In the interview with Amanpour, Obama said that he believes the war against terrorism "will never come to an end," even if the U.S.-led coalition pulls out of Afghanistan. He cited Al Qaeda's ability to regroup in Yemen and Somalia as evidence that al Qaeda won't go away just because a lot of Americans think it should. "They have to continue to be hunted down, dismantled and eliminated," Obama said. The president also defended his decision not to put U.S. military advisers inside Afghan government ministries and instead rely on American troops operating with their Afghan counterparts in the field. "We are going to be working very closely with our partners, both militarily but also diplomatically ... to make sure we have a coherent approach that is as effective as possible," he said. Obama's interview with Amanpour will air Sunday on CNN and CNN.com. It is part of the network's "American Journey" series of interviews and reports in which Amanpour has been traveling around America to talk with voters, policy makers and community leaders about Obama's first term in office.
