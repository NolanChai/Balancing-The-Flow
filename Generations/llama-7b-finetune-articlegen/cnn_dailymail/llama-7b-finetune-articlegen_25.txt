William Henry Welch, 53, escaped punishment for driving without licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car.
The motorist was caught behind the wheel during a routine police patrol in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire on February 14 last year when he gave officers false details. However, magistrates said his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car and she could not be blamed for the incident as Welch was 'adult enough to know that what he had done was wrong'. Sheffield Magistrates Court heard how officers pulled over Welch's black BMW after spotting it driving in excess of 35mph. He told police his wife, Nicola, gave him permission to use her car as she was 'always letting people borrow the vehicle'. But when asked for Nicola's insurance details, he realised he had left it at home and did not have a valid licence. In his defence Welch said: 'I was driving without having any idea of what I would do if pulled over by police. I felt that my wife was always letting people borrow the vehicle so I didn't think anything else of it.' He added: 'My wife had previously told me when borrowing someone else's car to make sure I had the insurance details on me or just use her car as she always let people borrow it. I did not understand what she meant by this and therefore drove without a licence, driving document or any other form of identification.' The court heard Welch has since passed his test and paid £705 for his actions. A spokesman from the Road Safety Trust said: 'Drivers must make sure they have all the relevant paperwork in their car at all times to avoid falling foul of the law, otherwise you could end up with a fine, points on your licence or worse still, invalidate your insurance.' Welch was given eight penalty points and ordered to pay £50 costs. The case has been reported by local newspaper The Star . By . Lizzie Edmonds .
