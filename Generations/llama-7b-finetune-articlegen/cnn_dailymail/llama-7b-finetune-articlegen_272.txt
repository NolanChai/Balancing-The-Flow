The court heard that 62-year old John Williamson, had been drinking heavily and taking painkillers for back pains at the time of the incident in which his wife Pamela, received more than 100 stab wounds. Mr Williamson who was found guilty of attempted murder on Thursday told the court he could not remember what happened but said he had never intended to kill Mrs Williamson, who he had been married to for almost four decades. He has now been jailed for nine years after being convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey on Thursday following a trial which was described as 'grotesque and disturbing'. The court heard that in May last year Mr Williamson, from Barnet, north London had been drinking heavily and taking painkillers for back pains. He also told the court he had taken three tranquilisers on the day of the attack before stabbing his wife, who was 61 years old at the time of the assault in their home in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire. Prosecutors said Mrs Williamson, had been slashed, sliced and stabbed with knives and a pair of scissors before she tried to crawl to safety under her kitchen table after being attacked on May 19 last year by Mr Williamson . After he left her for dead in the bathroom of their home in High Wycombe Mrs Williamson was discovered by neighbours who were concerned that they hadn’t seen her or heard from her since the previous day. Mrs Williamsons life was saved thanks to an off duty police officer, who happened to be at the hospital where she was taken after being stabbed. The court heard that Pamela had been left with multiple puncture wounds and a 'severed' hand following the attack which she told police had been carried out by Mr Williamson - her husband of 39 years. She also described seeing her ex-husband wearing a pig mask. Police arrived at their home later that day after being called to reports of a man with a knife and Mrs Williamsons badly injured hand was found in the bathroom. The court heard that Mr Williamson, had left a note on his bed saying ‘it's over’ and telling police he had not killed her deliberately but 'would have done so if he could'. Police also found a scissor underneath their bed which had Mrs Williamsons blood stains on it. When the officer asked Mr Williamson why he was there, he replied: ‘I’m here to finish what I started’. He also told police that he was 'just getting rid of her'. Prosecutors described his behaviour as 'grotesque and disturbing'. In a statement read out in court Mrs Williamsons son, Lee said the attack on his mother had been 'vicious' adding: 'She has suffered many puncture wounds and scars throughout her body, she lost most of her fingers on one hand, there is a severed finger which was left behind and we were told she may never recover fully. She now has limited use of her right arm.' Mr Williamsons barrister, John Bates said he had accepted responsibility for his actions but that it would be 'inappropriate' to apologise at this time because Mrs Williamson was still in hospital receiving treatment and may not want to hear an apology. He told the court: 'I accept the jury have reached a decision on Mr Williamsons guilt. 'His client accepts responsibility but I must say I do not agree with the verdict.' The judge, Mr Justice Saunders sentenced him to nine years in prison and banned him from contacting his wife or her family for ten years. He also ordered that he be handed over for psychiatric assessment at Broadmoor Hospital - a high security psychiatric unit, after the trial. At the time of the attack Mr Williamsons' daughter said: 'My dad attacked my mother because she wouldn’t allow him to move back in.' She added: 'He didn’t want her to go out and have fun without him – he wanted her under his control. My mum was a strong woman who loved life and that is why she did so much for the community, including charity work for youngsters with disabilities. She just wanted to get on with her life but dad’s controlling nature made it impossible. 'This whole ordeal has had such a big impact on my mum that we don’t know if she will be able to cope. 'She is still in hospital and the doctors are not sure when she can come home because of her injuries but they say she could need round-the-clock care for many years.' At the time of the attack Mr Williamsons' ex-wife said: 'He always told me I was useless, he used to hit me and he even locked me in a cupboard when I was pregnant. He used to make my life hell – but I have managed to put him behind bars so that’s all that matters.' After being found guilty Mr Williamsons' ex-wife said: 'I am shocked at the verdict, I always thought he would get away with it because of his age and how it was going to affect my life. 'But I hope this is a warning to others who think they can do what ever they want without facing any consequences.' Mr Williamsons' barrister told the court that he had been suffering from severe back pains in the months leading up to the attack and was taking painkillers, as well as alcohol. He said: 'He is a very nice man who has lived an exemplary life but this incident came out of the blue.' The defence barrister added that Mr Williamson was ‘not sorry’ for what he had done saying: ‘He is not going to say sorry because in his mind there wasn’t anything wrong with what he did.’ He also said he believed his client would never commit an offence like this again. After sentencing the judge told him he could expect to serve at least eight years behind bars before being released on licence for another one year. 'I am very surprised that you are not apologetic for your actions,' he said. 'The injuries caused were extensive, life threatening and they have left Mrs Williamsons with permanent scars.' He also said the fact that Mr Williamson had left a note in his bed telling police that he was there to finish what he started 'made it more likely than not' he would kill her if given the chance. The court heard that Mr Williamsons daughter, Claire who was 13 at the time of the attack did not want to give evidence and did not attend the trial as she had been suffering from depression since the incident occurred. She said in a statement read out by prosecutors: 'This has had such an impact on my mum that we don’t know if she will be able to cope, she is still in hospital and the doctors are not sure when she can come home but they say she could need round-the-clock care for many years.' She also said she believed her father was capable of committing a similar offence again. Her sister Kirstie, who was 15 at the time said she thought he would try and kill their mother again in the future saying: 'He has always been controlling and this is his way of telling me what to do.' She also told the court how Mr Williamson had made her feel worthless during her childhood. 'I am so thankful that my mum had the strength to fight for us,' she said, 'It was such a horrible thing to have happen but I know now that we will not let him get away with it.' When she first saw him in court her sister Claire burst into tears adding: ‘I thought he would be sorry but instead he just sat there and smiled.’ During the trial it emerged that Mr Williamson had been married twice before to Mrs Williamsons, and was once arrested after his second wife, Tracey accused him of attempting to kill her. He was arrested in 2008 after police found him wearing a balaclava at his home in North London. The court heard he told officers that he wanted to kill her because he did not want to be married anymore but they could not find any evidence linking him to the attack. At the time Mrs Williamson described how she was 'lucky to have survived' the incident adding: ‘When he comes out of jail I am going to put a curse on him – if I had my way he would never come back.’ She also told the court that her husband had previously abused her as well, saying: ‘He always used to tell me I was useless. He used to hit me and he even locked me in a cupboard when I was pregnant. ‘I have been married twice but with him it was an absolute nightmare. He made my life hell – but I’ve managed to put him behind bars so that's all that matters.’ The court also heard from Mr Williamson's son Lee, who said his father had always wanted 'to control everything in the house'. He added: ‘He always used to tell me mum was useless and I think he loved it when she was in hospital. It gave him more control over things. 'The only time my dad would be nice to us as kids is if we were on our best behaviour but when we weren’t he would lock us in a room, take away all of our clothes or send us upstairs.' He added that his father had once threatened to kill him by smashing a bottle
