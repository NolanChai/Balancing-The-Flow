Albert Buitenhuius, a retired accountant who emigrated to Britain in 1960 at the age of 27 from South Africa where he had been born . He lives with his wife Marti, 36, and their son and daughter in this £650,000 home on the edge of an estate which boasts a clubhouse and private lake. They were forced to move house last year when they discovered mould was growing behind the skirting board where there was a leak from the neighbouring property. But now after having the problem fixed up by his father-in-law, Albert says it is time for them to stay put as their home has just been rated as one of Britain's best houses in a survey that compares the average asking price of a home with its value according to RightMove, a property website. He said: 'We are absolutely delighted. We were completely surprised when we got the call from Rightmove. 'It was great news and really good timing as there has been quite a lot going on in our lives recently.' Albert and Marti, who have been married for 11 years, originally moved into their home after they spotted it online three years ago while searching for property in Hertfordshire where they had decided to settle. Albert said: 'I was looking at properties with my wife because we were house hunting around the time that she went into hospital having her son. 'It came up on the internet and I thought 'that's a nice place'. Then when Marti got out of hospital after giving birth to our daughter, we went for a look. We took it from there.' Albert said his home had been given a good rating by Rightmove because its value was high relative to how much it is on the market for. He said: 'It's good news and very happy that our house has been rated as one of Britain's best houses. 'I think we scored quite highly because we paid £650,000 which compared with what is going in the local area makes us seem like a bargain.' Albert said the survey had given his home a good publicity boost, adding that it was probably too late to benefit from the exposure but he hoped potential buyers would be interested. 'It's certainly made some people look at our house. I think we might get more interest now as a result of this but it is probably a little bit late because we have had viewings going on for a while,' Albert said. The average asking price in his area is £436,018 and the average value on RightMove's index is £592,177. Meanwhile, the national average house price was £205,198 last month. The highest rated home belonged to an architectural historian in Yorkshire who lives in a Grade II-listed property with his wife and two sons which Rightmove said was 'one of Britain's best houses'. Albert said he is also proud that their house had been included as it showed it was good quality. He added: 'I am absolutely delighted to be part of this survey.' Albert said their home had only become available for sale after they were forced out last year when mould began growing on the skirting board and they realised there was a leak in the wall coming from their neighbour's house. Rightmove said it analysed 2.3 million homes sold between 2006 and 2015 to compile its list, with 87 per cent of the properties being worth more than the asking price - but just one per cent was valued at double what people are willing to pay for a home. It said this figure had risen from an average of 29 per cent in 2006 and 23 per cent last year as home buyers have become more savvy about how much they will spend on homes - often due to the rise in stamp duty. The highest-ranked house was a Grade II listed property which belonged to an architectural historian who lives with his wife and two sons . 'We all want our homes to be well worth their asking price, but as buyer confidence has returned to the market following a long period of stagnation, it seems that home hunters are becoming more demanding in their search for properties which offer value for money,' Rightmove director Miles Shipside said. 'Amid the strong competition for the best homes, buyers need to be prepared to work out the true value of a property by carrying out an in-depth analysis of what it is worth - both above and below its asking price.'

The highest rated property was in Yorkshire where an architectural historian lives with his wife and two sons (pictured) in this Grade II-listed house which is worth £561,924 more than the asking price . In Scotland, the most expensive home cost £838,010, 97 per cent more than its asking price. The cheapest property on the index was a three bedroom semi-detached bungalow in north London which sold for £64,500 - making it worth £27,501 (45 per cent) above what buyers were prepared to pay. Mr Shipside said: 'Whether buying a starter home, a family pad or a luxury mansion, the price paid by buyers today is often significantly higher than the asking price - indicating that a number of factors have been taken into account. 'These include the cost of stamp duty and other fees as well as the ability to finance such high prices.' He said this figure could be set to increase after research from property website Zoopla revealed that almost half of all home buyers believe they will need to borrow more than they can afford on a new property. Meanwhile, Rightmove's index found that houses which cost £100,000 or less were worth 39 per cent over the asking price while those priced between £250,000 and £400,000 had an average premium of 29 per cent. The national average house price in Britain was £205,198 last month . Rightmove said a lack of supply was driving prices up and as more buyers sought homes with extra features such as double garages or gardens that were big enough for swimming pools and play areas.

'The shortage of available property is creating a buoyant market which means sellers can set asking prices at levels which will attract the greatest number of buyers,' he said. The Rightmove survey comes after official figures showed that the value of homes in England and Wales increased by 9.5 per cent to £1,386billion last year. The average house price across Britain was £205,198 in January, according to Nationwide. This means a typical property costs 7.3 times more than it did at the beginning of 2001 when it took an average income of two and half years to pay for it. The housing market has seen a steady improvement since the economic downturn which pushed prices down by almost a third, although house price growth is currently slower than many would like. Nationwide said last week that the value of homes in Britain grew by 9.5 per cent to £1.386trillion in the final three months of last year as demand for homes continued to strengthen. It said this was the strongest quarterly house price growth since November 2014 and meant prices were up by 6.7 per cent across the year - which was also the best annual rate since late 2014. Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said: 'The recovery in housing market activity has gathered pace over recent months, as robust employment growth, low mortgage rates and increasing consumer confidence have all contributed to strengthening demand. 'Rising prices in turn appear to be encouraging more buyers to bring forward their purchase plans.' Scroll down for video . Rightmove said 87 per cent of properties on its index were worth above the asking price - with this figure rising from an average of 29 per cent in 2015 . Mr Gardner added that the increase in prices had been broad-based, with a 'marked' improvement seen outside London. He said: 'In terms of regional trends, house price growth was strongest in the north east where prices rose by just over 14 per cent.' Meanwhile, in London house prices grew by around six per cent over the year while the pace of increase was slowing across the rest of the UK. Nationwide said it expected this moderation to continue but added that a 'small acceleration' could not be ruled out as the economy continued to grow strongly. Rightmove director Miles Shipside said: ‘The shortage of available property is creating a buoyant market which means sellers can set asking prices at levels which will attract the greatest number of buyers’ . It comes after official figures showed that the value of homes in England and Wales increased by 9.
