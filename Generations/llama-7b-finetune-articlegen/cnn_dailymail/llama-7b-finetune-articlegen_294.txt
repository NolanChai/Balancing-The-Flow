**Mogadishu (CNN) -- Militants loyal to Somalia's Islamic insurgents seized two small towns on Sunday and killed the head of an African Union military mission. The militants attacked a town 75 kilometers from Baidoa, the capital of southern Bay region, killing the deputy commander of the AU force known as AMISOM. He was identified as Kenya's Brig. Gen. Julius Karangi.** **"The rebels overran the town and took it over completely," a Somali military official said on condition of anonymity. The attack happened Sunday morning, he added. "We are currently trying to establish what is happening in that area," he said. Two other AMISOM officials confirmed the town was taken by Islamic militants. The two officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media about the situation. A spokesman for AMISOM could not immediately be reached. Somali government troops have been battling al-Shabaab in recent months in the southern town of Afmadow, a key supply route for African Union forces in Mogadishu. On October 8, al-Shabaab attacked Afmadow and killed two AMISOM soldiers while also wounding two other soldiers, said Somali government troops who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media. "The insurgents took the town and fought us for a few hours but we pushed them out," one soldier told CNN at the time. Al-Shabaab spokesman Ali Mohamud Rage said Sunday that his group controls Afmadow, 425 kilometers south of Mogadishu. "We are in full control of the area and have taken over the town completely. We are now working hard to consolidate our position," he told CNN by telephone. He said AMISOM forces retreated when al-Shabaab took over Afmadow, but did not explain how many militants were involved in the attack. The 5,000-strong AU force has been trying for more than a year to stabilize Somalia after decades of instability and civil war. Al-Shabaab controls most of southern and central Somalia and imposes its strict interpretation of Islam on all. In recent months, it has stepped up attacks in Mogadishu, with bombings that have killed hundreds, including civilians. The group, which is part of the radical al Qaeda network, also has been behind many deadly guerrilla-style assaults against AMISOM and Somali government forces. Al-Shabaab's leaders have said they would withdraw from Mogadishu if the African Union mission leaves the country or if the United Nations ends its arms embargo on Somalia so the group can buy weapons to fight against the "infidel" AMISOM troops. However, U.N. special representative for Somalia Ahmedou Ould-Abdallah said on Saturday that the group's leaders are not serious about this offer. "Their ultimate goal is still to take over Mogadishu," he told reporters in New York. "We know it very well and we also have information that they are planning some attacks." U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Saturday that al Qaeda's regional wing, the Al-Qaida Organization in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), is aiding Somalia's al Shabaab militants by providing them with weapons and training, according to an AU statement. The group is active in Mali and Mauritania, where it has been blamed for kidnappings and other attacks targeting Western interests. It also has links to al-Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the U.N.'s Special Representative said. On Friday, Somalia's president declared that his country was free of pirates, even though a maritime blockade is still in effect off the coastal nation. The Somali government has been battling with al-Shabaab militants for control of the country since 2006. President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed said Friday that his forces have regained full control of Somalia's territorial waters and airspace, thanks to AMISOM support, according to an African Union statement. He told reporters in Kenya that "the pirate attacks will be completely eradicated." But pirates were not at sea on Friday -- just offshore in the Indian Ocean. A U.S. warship fired warning shots and deployed a helicopter to deter a Somali fishing boat from approaching an American warship, the USS Sterett, on Saturday morning, according to a statement from U.S. Central Command. The incident occurred about 125 nautical miles (148 miles) southwest of the port city of Hobyo in eastern Somalia at around 9:30 a.m. local time, officials said. "The USS Sterett was approached by three small fishing skiffs with an estimated 27 persons on board," Cmdr. Bill Urban, a Central Command spokesman, told CNN by e-mail. The boat, which appeared to be under the control of pirates, turned around after the U.S. ship fired warning shots and launched its helicopter, he said. There was no immediate report about any injuries or arrests made. The Sterett, an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer, is part of a group of ships in the area that are conducting counter-piracy operations, according to the Navy. On Thursday morning, the USS Bainbridge and two French warships repelled pirates who had attacked a merchant ship about 370 nautical miles off the Somali coast, officials said. The three vessels were escorting the freighter Maersk Alabama, which was hijacked by Somali pirates in April 2009 and later rescued by U.S. Navy commandos after its crew members fired warning shots and hurled grenades at the attacking pirates. The crew of that ship and the French ship are now working with American forces to try to capture suspected pirate Abduwali Muse, who is accused in the 2009 hijacking of the Alabama, according to a U.S. Navy official. The Maersk Alabama was attacked Thursday by another group of Somalis armed with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, a U.S. military spokesman said. "The two French ships fired warning shots at the skiffs that were approaching and the pirates turned back," Navy Capt. John Kirby told CNN, adding that there was no indication of who owned the boats. The Maersk Alabama crew did not fire their weapons because they had been told to avoid doing so until a suspected pirate boarded the ship and fired a rocket-propelled grenade at it on April 8, 2009. When that happened, the crew members shot back, and two of the attackers were killed by a bullet through the head and another died from an explosion, according to a U.S. military report. Muse was arrested along with other pirates, but he was released in September, after a judge ruled that the case against him had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt. He has since been accused of two more hijackings, one successful and one thwarted by his own crew members. "We still have 13 suspects in custody," Kirby said. "They are now undergoing trial."
