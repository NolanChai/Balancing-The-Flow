It’s called a hydrothermal vent and it’s a miniature version of what is found all over the solar system. The strange lifeform has been dubbed 'Little Darwin' by researchers who studied its unique ecology for an entire year on the seafloor off Central America, in what is known as the 'White Smoker'. Hydrothermal vent tubeworms (the blue ones) living at a depth of about 780ft below sea level. Scroll down for video . Researchers from the University of Washington found the hydrothermal vent in the waters off Central America and dubbed it Little Darwin because it has some of the strangest and most unique ecosystems on Earth. The tiny worms are some of the smallest found, with some only growing to be as thick as a pencil lead. They live on the chimneys spewing out hot water from deep beneath the sea floor.

Hydrothermal vents are miniature versions of the geologic structures found all over the solar system - they form when magma, hot water or super-heated steam seeps through cracks in rock and comes into contact with sea water. The extreme heat and cold temperatures create an environment that is hostile to most lifeforms on Earth, but not for these bizarre creatures. They use the chemicals from hydrothermal vents for food and shelter - creating a unique ecology that is unlike any other found on our planet. The researchers, led by Dr Daniel Wagner at University of Washington, collected data from the vent over an entire year. They studied the tubeworms, known as Riftia pachyptila, as well as other marine organisms living in the deep sea ecosystem. A new study has found that these hydrothermal vents on Earth are just like their counterparts across our solar system - they contain the closest thing to alien lifeforms here on planet earth. Dr Wagner said: 'We studied this for about a year, collecting data and taking samples. It was a great adventure and the study turned out amazingly well.' Scroll down for video .

These tubeworms (the blue ones) are some of the smallest found on earth - they live on the chimneys spewing out hot water from deep beneath the sea floor . The study has been published in Science magazine and shows that hydrothermal vents on Earth have a very similar ecosystem to their counterparts elsewhere across our solar system. In 1977, the first known hydrothermal vent was found at the bottom of the ocean near the Galapagos Islands. It was later discovered that they form throughout the world - from the Black Sea in Europe and even on the floor of Antarctica. The researchers who studied this particular vent found that it contains a microbial community very similar to those found in hydrothermal vents elsewhere, including the one near the Galapagos Islands. It also has similar communities as those found on Europa, Jupiter’s frozen moon, and Enceladus - another of Saturn's moons with an icy surface. Scroll down for video .

Dr Wagner said: 'It turns out that this vent is very similar to what we find elsewhere in the solar system, so it’s kind of a mini-galaxy.' He added that this particular vent is also unlike any other because of its small size and unique geology. The researchers who studied Little Darwin hope that their work will help scientists better understand how these hydrothermal vents came to be and what makes them so special .
