By . Daily Mail Reported . PUBLISHED: . 05:01 EST, 21 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:45 EST, 21 October 2012 . The UK's unseasonably warm spell is set to continue as the mercury hits new highs . Met Office meteorologists are forecasting temperatures of up to 21C from next week and said there could even be some sunshine. The average daytime temperature for this time of year in England is a lowly 13C, with an average night-time figure of 9C. But the warm spell has seen temperatures consistently reach highs of up to 20C this month - and some people have even enjoyed sunbathing on the beach. The unseasonably warm weather is thought to be caused by the jet stream remaining in a northerly position, which allows more mild air from Spain and southern Europe to get into the country. Met Office spokesman Martin Young said: ‘The warm conditions are likely to continue for a while yet with temperatures potentially reaching 21C in the south early next week.’ The mercury hit new heights at 1pm today when it reached 20.3C (68.5F) in Kew, west London, and the UK has broken its all-time record for October of 20.2C - set last year. As temperatures continue to soar, some are taking advantage of the good weather by enjoying a spot of sunbathing on beaches across England.
