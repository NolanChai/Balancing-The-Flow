* This article title is incorrect as it implies the article continues in this direction but does not. In fact, the article goes on to claim that these denials are actually 'damage control'.
* The first sentence should read "Washington (CNN) -- U.S. officials at the Pentagon and State Department denied Friday..." etc etc
