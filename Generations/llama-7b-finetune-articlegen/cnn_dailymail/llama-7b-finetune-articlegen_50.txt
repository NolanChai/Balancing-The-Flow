Even in these straitened times we should not think it is only the rich who can afford to enjoy the open seas. Whether you are seeking a relaxing day on the lake or planning an epic voyage, there are ways for everyone to have a good time this summer. Here's how...
### 1. Enjoy some water sporting action on dry land:
If your bank account has been affected by the current economic downturn, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy a splash of excitement in the outdoors. At many locations around Britain there are now facilities where you can try activities such as kayaking and stand-up paddleboarding without having to invest in your own equipment. These are often open to both adults and children, with the former able to take part alongside their families or friends. A great way to have fun together, it is a more cost effective alternative to traditional water sports such as sailing, which require a significant upfront investment. 
### 2. Have your own water experience:
Even if you can't afford a boat or other equipment, there are still ways of enjoying the water at sea with your own vessel. With so many rivers and lakes across Britain, you're never far from an accessible stretch where you can enjoy an activity such as windsurfing, paddling, canoeing or kayaking. If you have never tried any of these before then it is best to do a bit of research on your chosen area first so that you are well prepared for the experience. The same goes if you've never been there before: make sure you know what facilities will be available and what the conditions are likely to be like, so that you can plan accordingly.
### 3. Choose a boat that suits your budget:
If buying a new craft for the summer is out of your reach then don't despair! There are still plenty of options when it comes to getting afloat, including chartered yachts and motorboats which can be booked at reasonable rates. Alternatively you could consider renting something that requires very little upkeep such as a rowing boat or canoe so that the initial cost isn't too high. Many lakeside locations will also allow you to hire a sailboat for an hourly fee, with the option of having someone else on board who knows how to operate it should you not have any experience.
### 4. Make use of existing facilities:
Whether or not you can afford your own watercraft this summer there are plenty of places where people go swimming that don't require boats at all! From pools and lidos (outdoor public bathing areas) to open water ponds, lakes and reservoirs in parks across Britain there will always be somewhere nearby which you can enjoy a refreshing dip. Just make sure you check what regulations are in place before jumping in so that you don't get into any trouble!
### 5. Go sailing:
Sailing is often seen as one of the most expensive sports around but it doesn't have to be that way - especially if you know where to look for good deals on boats and equipment. There are plenty of charter companies who will rent out vessels for reasonable prices and some even provide training sessions which can help beginners get started without spending too much cash initially. Alternatively, why not join an established group so that there is less pressure on finding your own transport or equipment?
### 6. Rent a paddleboard:
Stand-up paddleboards have become increasingly popular over recent years and it's easy to see why! With just a basic understanding of how they work you can spend hours floating around lakes, rivers or even oceans without having to worry about getting wet from the wind or waves. Renting one is relatively inexpensive compared with buying your own so this could be an ideal way for those on tight budgets to enjoy some water time during summer 2015.
### 7. Learn how to surf:
If you've never tried surfing before then why not give it a go? Surfing can be enjoyed anywhere there are waves but if you don't fancy going somewhere far away from home then there may still be options available close by. Many lakes around Britain now offer lessons in bodyboarding which is similar to traditional surfing though done on smaller boards instead of larger ones so it's suitable even for those with limited experience. Just make sure you check out any conditions beforehand as some lakes may not have enough waves!
### 8. Go kayaking:
Kayaking is another fun activity which can be enjoyed by both adults and children alike, although younger paddlers will probably need to stay on shallow waters or at least supervised by someone who knows what they're doing! Kayaks come in a variety of styles depending on where you plan to use them so make sure you choose something that suits your needs as well as being within your budget. Some people prefer sit-on-top models for convenience while others prefer inflatable versions due to their lightness and portability - there's no right or wrong choice here!
### 9. Get involved with dinghy sailing:
If you're feeling adventurous then why not try your hand at dinghy sailing this summer? Although this is traditionally seen as an expensive sport it doesn't have to be - especially if you know where to look for good deals on equipment and boats. Many lakes around Britain offer hire packages which include everything needed, including the boat itself so there's no need to worry about buying your own gear beforehand either! Just make sure that safety comes first when out on open waters as accidents do happen even with experienced sailors...
### 10. Go kayaking:
Kayaks are small boats designed for use in shallow water and they come in a range of shapes and sizes depending on the type of activity you want to do. They're ideal if you don't have much experience as they won't sink if you fall out! There are lots of places across Britain where kayak hire is available so why not try it out this summer?
### 11. Get involved with windsurfing:
Windsurfing may look like an extreme sport but in reality most people find it surprisingly easy once they've got used to the basics - especially if you go somewhere where there is lots of open water nearby so that you don't get bored waiting for conditions to improve! Windsurfers come in all shapes and sizes depending on what type of boarding you want to do but make sure you choose something which fits comfortably before hitting the waves.
### 12. Try wakeboarding:
Wakeboards are small boards designed specifically for riding behind motorboats and other types of craft, so if this sounds like your kind of thing then it might be worth giving it a go this summer! It can be tricky getting started at first but once you've learnt the basics there is plenty to enjoy including tricks such as 360 degrees spins or jumps over obstacles. You'll need access to an appropriate boat though, so make sure that someone who knows what they are doing will be around while you try this out!
### 13. Join a sailing club:
There are lots of sailing clubs across Britain where people go regularly so if joining one sounds like something that might interest you then now is the time to get involved! Most places require memberships which usually cost around £40-£50 per year and some even provide training sessions for those who want to learn more about how to control different types of craft. This could be a great way for beginners without much experience yet to start out - although remember that safety should always come first!

### 15. Learn about water safety:
When it comes to water-based activities there is nothing more important than being prepared and safe - so if this sounds like something that might interest you then now is the time to learn more about what precautions need taken before jumping into any body of water! There are lots of different organisations across Britain who offer courses in first aid, lifeguarding and other related subjects. Make sure you look for one which has been accredited by Ofqual so that your qualifications will be recognised wherever you go - it could save lives if something does go wrong during a trip!
