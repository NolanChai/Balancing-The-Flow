You're not supposed to talk about your private life - so Premier League players are cagey when asked about it by journalists. But it is rare that a star turns his back on the game and walks away from it altogether, which is what Arsenal's Mesut Ozil has done . The £42million midfielder announced his retirement on Tuesday night after less than five years at the Emirates. He is still under contract until 2018 but will receive a large payment in compensation from the club and, it seems, will not take up the chance to return to play in Germany . Ozil played just 64 games for Arsenal despite costing £42m when he arrived from Real Madrid in September 2013. He made a poor start and was dropped at the end of last season. His retirement comes after manager Arsene Wenger, who signed him to great fanfare, admitted he may never play for the Frenchman again . The German international retired just weeks before his birthday on January 15 and said it had been an 'honour' to play in England but now wants to spend more time with his family. But why has Ozil quit football so early? And what might have influenced his decision to walk away? Here, Sportsmail reveals how the midfielder's form on the pitch and off-field issues could have contributed . Scroll down for video . Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil announced his retirement from football at just 28 after five years in England . The German international revealed that he was retiring from the game to spend time with his family and friends back home. He said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to announce my early retirement from professional football. I will never forget all of my experiences as a player and all of you who have accompanied me during this beautiful adventure, which started in Gelsenkirchen nearly 17 years ago and came to an end today.' Ozil, who joined Arsenal from Real Madrid for £42m in September 2013, said he had 'the honour' to play for Arsene Wenger. He added: 'My family means everything to me and I have always tried my best to be a good role model for them. However, the past few months have been difficult for me and my focus was not where it should have been.' The midfielder made a total of just 64 appearances in all competitions during his five years at Arsenal . Ozil (left) started out as a youth player at Schalke before moving to Werder Bremen aged 17 in 2005. He then joined Madrid in 2010 for £13m, and joined the Gunners three years later . The midfielder admitted he was not sure what the future held for him but said he wanted to stay involved with football in some capacity. Ozil (right) is a popular figure at Arsenal, having won two FA Cups during his time at the club and earned 38 caps for Germany . He added: 'I'm not sure yet about what my future holds. I don't want to go into too much detail because I know you are all interested in this and rightfully so. But I'll say this, that football will remain a part of my life whatever the next steps might be.' Ozil also thanked Wenger for the opportunity he gave him when he joined Arsenal, adding: 'I want to thank Arsene Wenger, who gave me my first chance in England and helped me settle into life here. I'd like to extend a special thanks to our amazing fans as well - you guys are simply the best!' Ozil (left) has won 38 caps for Germany but was not included in Joachim Low's World Cup squad . Arsenal boss Wenger said: 'He is one of the greatest players of all time. He made history in his national team and he will have a great future in front of him, I am sure.' Ozil revealed he had already informed Arsenal that he would not play for the club again, adding: 'I told the club on November 14 that this was my last game for them. Since then we have been negotiating with their legal department and they were always very understanding in our discussions.' The German (left) will reportedly receive around £30million in compensation from Arsenal . Ozil's decision to quit the game is surprising given that he was still under contract at Arsenal until 2018. His departure could cost Arsenal a significant amount of money, with the midfielder reportedly receiving around £30m in compensation. The former Germany international (centre) joined the club from Real Madrid for £42m and made just 64 appearances . Ozil has played for his country on 38 occasions but was not included in Joachim Low's World Cup squad, which instead consisted of players like Toni Kroos (left), Mesut Ozil (right) and Mario Goetze (centre). He was linked with a move to Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the past but it seems that his time at Arsenal was not successful for him . However, there is no doubt about what will be the main talking point from this bizarre situation. Ozil's reasons for leaving football early are unclear and have only been given by Wenger so far - and they do not add up. The Frenchman said: 'He is a guy who is still 28, has had some ups and downs but he will continue his life in another direction.' It would be easy to assume that Ozil was unhappy with the way things were going at Arsenal but Wenger said on November 14 - before the midfielder's departure was announced - that there were no issues. The Frenchman said: 'He is very professional, and I have not had any problem.' The manager added: 'There are always stories [about players], especially after a bad game but it doesn’t worry me at all because if you have problems with your player that means you have a serious team issue.' Ozil joined Arsenal from Real Madrid in the summer of 2013 for £42million - making him one of the most expensive signings in the Premier League . The German midfielder was under contract until 2018 but decided to walk away from football early. He has now retired at just 28 years old . Ozil joined Arsenal with a big reputation but struggled to make his mark on English football, making only 64 appearances during five years at the club . This leaves the door open for speculation that Wenger's decision not to include him in any of his future plans was part of why he quit. In his final game for Arsenal - a 2-0 defeat against West Brom on December 31 - Ozil gave away an unnecessary penalty and then threw his shirt at Wenger, who had been on the touchline celebrating Jack Wilshere's goal. The midfielder (left) made only one Premier League start under the Frenchman following his arrival in England . This suggests that he was angry with Wenger for not having played him enough - although it is unclear why this would be. Ozil is still young and could play on for many more years, but instead has decided to walk away from football completely after just five years at Arsenal. The German made only 64 appearances in all competitions during his time at the club, starting 38 of those games - including eight this season. He was not even guaranteed a place on the bench in many matches and his contract did not include a release clause that would allow him to leave earlier if he wanted. Ozil started his career with Schalke in Germany before joining Werder Bremen aged just 17 years old . The German has enjoyed a very good career so far, winning two Bundesliga titles, the DFB-Pokal twice and the DFL Supercup once during his time at Bremen . He was signed by Real Madrid for £13m in July 2010 and played over 150 times for the La Liga giants before moving to Arsenal three years later. Ozil is one of the most talented players in world football but has not always managed to show that during his time at Arsenal, despite the fact he won two FA Cups with the Gunners and earned 38 caps for Germany, scoring five goals in those matches. The midfielder has been linked with a move away from the Emirates Stadium many times and had previously been linked with both Real Madrid and Bayern Munich, although Arsene Wenger said recently that he would not want to take the player back . There are other reasons why Ozil could be thinking of leaving football behind. His mother is sick and needs looking after so the midfielder will want to spend more time with her than he has been able to do in the past. In an interview with the Arsenal Player earlier this month, Ozil admitted that it was a difficult time for him . He said: 'I think about my mum every day - what she's going through - and I just have to be there for her.' It is not known exactly how ill his mother is but Ozil has spoken openly in the past about how important family means to him. The midfielder has a wife and two children, having married Turkish-German model Am
