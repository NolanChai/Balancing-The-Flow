Snails, usually shelled and boiled in a garlicky butter sauce and served with frites (or chips), are not only popular throughout France, but also across many European countries. The traditionally French delicacy is now becoming increasingly popular in the UK as well, where they can be found on menus at Michelin-starred restaurants, as well as street food stalls and at the country's annual snail-eating competitions. So much so that a 2016 report by market research group Mintel predicted that "snails will be the next big thing". The company said sales of British snails had increased fourfold between 2008 and 2014 - which may have been helped by their use in Jamie Oliver's 30-minute meals. Above: Snail eating contests are common in France, but the practice is now becoming increasingly popular in the UK. While the traditional French delicacy can be found on menus at Michelin-starred restaurants and street food stalls across Britain, there are few signs of a British snail invasion in France . The report said that 18 per cent of people surveyed had eaten them during the past six months - up from just five per cent four years earlier. It added that half of those questioned were under 35 and the 'invasion' is predicted to grow in popularity as they become more widely available and affordable for everyone, rather than being seen only as a luxury dish or something consumed at festivals . So far, it seems Britain has yet to catch up with its neighbour. Although snails - or escargot - are still largely associated with France (as evidenced by the many French words for types of snail), there is no equivalent term for them in the UK and they have not been as popular here since the Victorian era when they were eaten at garden parties and high society dinner tables. However, that may soon be changing. According to a spokesman from the National Escargot Association (NEA) - which represents around 350 snail growers in Britain who produce more than eight million pounds worth of snails each year - sales are increasing and restaurants across the country have reported a rise in demand for snails. 'Snail eating is not as popular here as it is in France, but we are starting to see people try them,' he added. 'They're a little bit different to what people might be used to, so you do get a little bit of trepidation when they first try them, but the fact that they can be cooked in a variety of ways means it makes snail eating much easier.'

It added that half of those surveyed had eaten snails during the past six months - up from just five per cent four years earlier . Eating snails can also offer an alternative to meat, and a healthier option as they are high in protein and calcium. They have no fat content or cholesterol and contain no additives, and a typical portion contains about 100 calories. Snail farming has seen the rise of food festivals, such as this one in Oxfordshire, where visitors can learn to prepare snails . Above: Food blogger Anna Jones prepares snails for her recipe 'Snail porridge' - a dish which features in Jamie Oliver's 30-minute meal book. She said that the shelling is one of the most challenging parts of cooking with them . Snail farming has also led to food festivals, where people can learn how to prepare snails and buy products made from them - such as snail gelatine (sold for £12 a tube at SnailFarmUK.com) - as well as eat them in a variety of ways. 'When you cook with snails, they have a very meaty texture that's different to what we normally find,' says food blogger Anna Jones who has written about cooking with snails for her website A Girl Called Jack and the BBC Good Food Channel. 'They also absorb flavours really well so it's important when you cook them with garlic, butter, oil or wine that they don't get too dry.' She added: 'The shelling is definitely one of the most challenging parts - it takes a bit of practice and patience.' Easy ways to cook snails include stewing in olive oil with rosemary and garlic or making them into a ragout. But if you're looking for something new, try Anna Jones' recipe 'Snail porridge'. Above: Snails are high in protein and calcium and can be served in a variety of ways - including as part of this snail porridge (top left) . The blogger said that the shelling is one of the most challenging parts of cooking with them, so she advises boiling the snails before shelling to make it easier . 'Snail porridge' recipe: Ingredients 1kg escargot (snails), live or pre-cooked 80ml olive oil 5 garlic cloves, chopped finely 40g shallots, peeled and sliced 30g parsley, roughly chopped . Instructions Put the snails in a large pan of water. Bring to the boil then remove from the heat, drain off the water and repeat three times - this will get rid of any sand that they may have ingested (if using pre-cooked ones). Place back into the pan with the oil, garlic and shallots. Cover with a lid and cook for 15 minutes over a low heat until tender. Add the parsley and season to taste then serve warm. Anna Jones' blog is at www.agirlcalledjack.com . 'There are so many ways of cooking them,' she added, including this recipe, which calls for stewing snails in olive oil with rosemary and garlic. 'The texture of the snail is also really interesting - it's soft yet a little crunchy, and quite slippery to eat so it's very different from other meats.' However, although Anna believes that more British people are becoming interested in eating them, she admits they can still be seen as 'a bit weird' by some. 'In France, snails are eaten all the time and not really thought about,' she said. 'I think there is a bit of a stigma attached to snail eating here.' Above: Jamie Oliver included instructions on how to cook with snails in his book 30-Minute Meals . The chef recommends steaming them over a bed of garlic and butter and then adding cream - although he also suggests using them as an ingredient for pesto . Other recipes include 'Snail tagliatelle' (above) which involves boiling snails, cutting the shells in half to remove the meat and cooking it with pasta . He recommends steaming them over a bed of garlic and butter then adding cream. But he also suggests using them as an ingredient for pesto or chowder, adding that you can make snail sauce by mixing up 250g of escargot butter with 60ml of white wine. Meanwhile, Jamie Oliver's book 30-Minute Meals includes instructions on how to cook with snails - recommending boiling the snails for about four minutes before shelling them, then steaming them over a bed of garlic and butter (he adds that you can use this as sauce or add it to pasta), or making snail tagliatelle.

'It's definitely an acquired taste, which is a shame because they are such a great source of protein,' he told The Telegraph . Snails can be eaten raw as well as steamed and served in a variety of ways - from soups to pasta dishes . Above: This picture shows the snail-eating competitions that are held at the annual Fête des Escargots festival, which takes place every year in Gimont, France. The event is now held over three days rather than one, and attracts around 10,000 visitors . 'Food fads come and go - but this is a real treat for our senses. They are delicious.' He added that the annual snail-eating competition at Gimont in France was now held over three days rather than one, and attracted around 10,000 visitors each year to watch people from around the world eat up to ten pounds of snails - which is about two kilos. 'The festival itself lasts a day but we have the whole weekend booked,' he added. 'Snail-eating is not as popular here as it is in France, but we are starting to see people try them. They're a little bit different to what people might be used to, so you do get a little bit of trepidation when they first try them.' While snails have long been associated with French cuisine and eating competitions - such as the annual F
