1. The workers were excavating in a subterranean chamber when they found something unexpected that was at least three stories down, but experts say it could be much deeper than originally believed. 2. When you build a new hotel, you expect to find plenty of things underneath the foundation: pipes, wires, and maybe some old cash from forgotten coins and bills left by previous residents. But when workers digging an underground garage for a new hotel struck something big about 30 feet below the surface, it took them a while to figure out just what they had discovered. The object was three stories deep, but experts say it could be much deeper than originally believed. In 1832, when workers were digging for the foundation of an old hotel in New York City, they uncovered a chamber filled with human remains—some 40 people crammed into a space about the size of two casket-size coffins. They had been buried alive in what was then known as the 'vault,' which also contained wine bottles and barrels from the hotel's bar, as well as some cash that was later donated to the city's poorhouse. The bodies were so well preserved that it appeared that they died within a few years of one another in 1824. No one knows for sure who they are, but archaeologists and historians have tried to reconstruct their story using clues from the site: their height and weight, clothes and other belongings left behind. One of them was even wearing his original underwear when he died . It turns out that the men's wardrobe provided a clue as to their occupation—one wore an expensive watch with a chain made of gold wire; another wore pants with silk suspenders, and several others had shirts made from silk or linen. 4. Some were buried in their own clothes while others were dressed in the uniforms of their trades: one was wearing leather shoes that showed signs of wear on his soles; another wore a pair of white canvas shoes with an iron sole and two metal straps running up from each heel; still another wore what appeared to be a uniform for the Navy. All but two had been shot through their skulls, while several others were stabbed multiple times in the chest or neck area before being buried alive . 6. The men were all around 30 years old when they died—but some of them looked older than that because of illness and other factors such as alcohol abuse and poor nutrition, according to archaeologists who studied their remains after digging up the bodies in 2017. One was even wearing his original underwear when he died, which had a hole in it where someone pulled out part of it with pliers or some other sharp object before burying him . 8. In addition to these men who were buried alive together in New York City's subterranean chamber about three stories below the surface of the city's streets, there are many more unmarked graves that lie undisturbed beneath our feet—and most people don't even know they exist until something like this happens. In recent years alone, workers have found bodies in New Jersey and Ohio buried under parking lots; another group was discovered at an abandoned house near Philadelphia; still another set of remains was uncovered at a construction site on Long Island . 10. It is estimated that there could be thousands more corpses below ground level—some even as far down as 60 feet or more! What we know: In September, New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission granted the developer an extension to complete its excavation of a subterranean chamber (pictured) that was found last month during construction. The structure was built in 1832 as part of one of Manhattan's most historic hotels . What we don't know yet: The bodies are thought to be from the late 1800s, but it could take years for scientists to confirm this theory and identify them . 12. In September, New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission granted the developer an extension to complete its excavation of a subterranean chamber that was found last month during construction at 75 Bedford Street in Manhattan. The structure was built in 1832 as part of one of Manhattan's most historic hotels, the Astor House (pictured below). It is believed to have been used for storage or a workshop but experts have yet to confirm how long it has been abandoned and when exactly these human remains were buried there. 14. The bodies are thought to be from the late 1800s, but it could take years for scientists to confirm this theory and identify them using DNA tests on their skeletal remains . In recent months, a number of other New York City construction projects have unearthed human remains, including more than two dozen skeletons at an abandoned building in Harlem that was being renovated into luxury housing units for seniors; another set of bones were found during repairs to the Long Island Rail Road tunnel under Manhattan's East Side (pictured). 16. The excavation is ongoing, but officials say they are working as quickly as possible in order to preserve whatever remains might be buried there . 18. 'The preservation of this important resource will take time and careful attention,' said Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation (GVSHP), which fought against demolition plans by the developer . What we don't know: How long they have been there? Who they are? Why were they buried alive in a chamber that was built into one of Manhattan's most famous hotels? 20. A recent article on DNAinfo.com speculates that these bodies may be part of an unsolved mystery surrounding a group of Irish immigrants who died at sea and were buried en masse after being discovered floating in New York Harbor . 22.

According to the article: 'There were 10 coffins in all, stacked six deep with about 40 bodies inside' . 'It is believed that they were buried alive because it took them longer than normal for their lungs and hearts to stop beating,' he said . The men who built the hotel had been warned by health officials at the time to take precautions against infection during construction, but there was no such thing as hand-washing stations back then . 28.
