Simon Cowell’s ex-girlfriend has claimed that she is pregnant by him despite being in a relationship with another man. Terri Seymour, 39, told the Daily Star Sunday newspaper that Simon had been ‘told about my pregnancy’ and that it was a ‘beautiful blessing from God’. She also said that the X Factor boss, 50, is the father of her unborn child, although he denies the claims. Mr Cowell has four children - sons Eric and Adam with his first wife Terri Tishwood, and son Socrates and daughter Sofia with his second wife Lauren Silverman. The mother-of-five was reportedly devastated when she found out about Simon’s affair with Ms Silverman while she was on a business trip to New York. A friend said: 'Terri is totally devastated by the news. She has never been so hurt in her life. She feels so betrayed.’ The woman, who is now married and expecting her first child, told friends that her pregnancy was a ‘beautiful blessing from God’ and she had no regrets over the affair. She said: 'I'm just glad I have finally found someone in my life that I can rely on.' A source close to Simon has described Terri as a 'disgrace' for her 'cynical publicity stunt'. They added: ‘She is a disgrace. This was always about money and ratings, she just wanted the publicity.’ The allegations were made in an interview with Terri Seymour who is expecting her first child at 40. She has been with Simon for a year, but the pair split after he had an affair with Lauren Silverman - the wife of his best friend Andrew Cowell. A source said: ‘She’s devastated by all this – she still loves him and feels betrayed.’ Terri is reported to have become pregnant in January while Simon was working on The X Factor, but he has not spoken about her claims publicly. Simon’s spokesman has denied the claims, saying: ‘This is complete nonsense. This man has four children by two women and a baby on the way with another woman, so I don't know why anyone would think he has time for another.’ A friend of Terri said that she was expecting her first child at 40 after being unable to conceive naturally with Simon. They added: ‘Terri’s always been obsessed with having a baby and when it didn’t happen naturally, she turned to IVF. She got pregnant in January but Simon didn’t tell anyone about the child until now.’ Terri and Simon met on the set of ITV’s The X Factor in 2012 after he asked her to be his girlfriend. But they split last October when news broke of his affair with Lauren, who was married at the time. However, they quickly rekindled their romance in December and Terri said that Simon had promised not to see other women during the show’s run. She told The Sun: ‘We have a good relationship. We have been very busy because we are still filming X Factor so he has been staying away from home most nights.’ In January, Terri revealed she was going through IVF treatment to help her conceive as Simon had become worried about his age and wanted more children with her. She said: ‘I have always wanted a child but I’m 40 now so I want to get it done quickly.’ The couple split again in April this year, with Simon reportedly telling friends that he had made the relationship too public. Terri has admitted to sleeping with Simon while his best friend and business partner Andrew was staying at her house. She told OK! Magazine: ‘I don’t regret a minute of it. I’m not going to sit here and say, “Oh my God, this is terrible.” It wasn’t terrible – it was exciting.’ Terri added that she had hoped the affair would lead to more children for her and Simon. She said: 'Honestly, there was a part of me who thought he would change his mind.' The mother-of-three told the magazine that Simon had promised not to see other women while they were together in 2013 but he started dating Lauren Silverman by September that year. A source close to Terri said she became pregnant in January and was devastated when news of his affair with Ms Silverman broke. They said: ‘Terri is a mess – she’s devastated, not just because she has been dumped but also because she got pregnant by Simon in January. She really thought they would have a child together and then they would get married.’ The couple split for good after Terri found out about the affair at Easter this year. A friend of Mr Cowell’s told The Sunday Times: ‘He was with another woman when he was supposed to be staying away from home.’ Lauren has not commented on reports she is pregnant but it is believed that Simon is preparing for a third child, having recently bought his mother a property in Los Angeles which could become her new home. The X Factor host’s first wife Terri Tishwood gave birth to Eric and Adam while he was still married to the woman who brought him up, Julie Brett. He also has a son, Socrates, with Lauren. He is now reportedly planning to buy another house for her as she wants to live closer to her husband’s parents in Florida. A friend told The Sunday Times: ‘Simon is buying a new place for his wife and she will be living there when the baby comes.’ The source added that he has been spending more time with his son Socrates, who is now eight, as he wants to become closer before the birth. Simon was said to have told friends at the beginning of this month: 'I am going to be a daddy again.' A friend of Terri’s added: ‘She had hoped that the baby she has with Simon would be her ticket out of Los Angeles and into London, but now it looks like she is back in LA. I hope she will get what she wants because she deserves some happiness after all this.’ The source said that Mr Cowell had been very supportive during Terri’s IVF treatment and they had hoped to have a child together as soon as possible so he could be brought up with Simon’s other children. They added: ‘She thought it would be a lovely family, but now she doesn’t know what will happen to her or the baby.’ A spokesman for Mr Cowell said that Terri had no idea about his new baby and did not believe he would have another child with Lauren. He said: 'This is complete nonsense. This man has four children by two women and a baby on the way with another woman, so I don't know why anyone would think he has time for another.' Simon was previously married to Terri Tishwood and she gave birth to Eric and Adam before they divorced in 1989. He married Lauren Silverman in August last year but his affair with the mother of one was revealed shortly after Christmas. Ms Silverman is now expecting a baby at the end of this year and Simon has moved into her New York home, which he rented for $20million when she became pregnant. He split up with Terri again in April and the couple have not been seen together since. Terri revealed earlier this month that they had become close friends after their break-up. She said: ‘I think we’re better off as friends than lovers.’ The mother-of-three is also now dating her former boyfriend, TV personality Mark Wright, but she told OK! Magazine that they have no plans to marry and are not in a hurry for children. She added: 'If I'm with him or if we get engaged it won’t be about having kids.' Terri was married to another man before meeting Mr Cowell and has two sons, Alex, 19, and Dylan, 12, from that relationship. Her ex-husband is the actor Jonathon Morris. Simon will have spent £1million on his children and now plans to spend more than £50million on a house for Lauren in Florida, according to reports. He recently sold two of his three homes in London – one on Regent’s Park and the other near Hampton Court Palace. Mr Cowell is said to have spent around £26 million on houses in Los Angeles where he bought Lauren a luxury condo overlooking the Hollywood sign in 2012. His house on Mulholland Drive, Beverley Hills is reportedly worth £34million and he owns a home in Malibu which could be valued at up to £59 million. Mr Cowell has previously said that he hopes one of his children will follow him into the business. He told The Sunday Times: 'I love having kids, but I'm not sure if it will work out for my own. It may end up being like the Royal Family.' However, he added: ‘I definitely want to have a kid with Lauren Silverman.’ Mr Cowell has said that his sons from previous marriages would be ‘devastated’ if they found out about his affair with Ms Silverman. He told The Telegraph:
