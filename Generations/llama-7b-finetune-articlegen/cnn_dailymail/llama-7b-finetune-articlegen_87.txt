Samuel Dyment, a two year-old boy from Walsall, has been diagnosed with cancer for the second time in his short life. The brave toddler has already endured chemotherapy and radiotherapy after being given the all-clear only months ago - and now doctors have found a tumour on the left side of his skull. Samuel's parents are devastated but say he is not affected by his illness as he continues to giggle at jokes and play with his toys. His mother, Samantha, 26, said: 'It's just so upsetting to watch him go through this again. He's very young for cancer. We just want to make sure that if there is anything wrong we can fix it. It will be a long fight but we are staying positive.' The toddler was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in July 2010 and after two years of chemotherapy was given the all-clear earlier this year. But on January 25 he fell ill again, vomiting blood before passing out at home. Samantha said: 'We rushed him to hospital thinking it might be an ear infection but they found a large tumour behind his left ear. It's so sad that when he was given the all-clear earlier this year we thought it would mean getting back to normal life. I just want to make sure if there is anything wrong, it can be fixed.' The couple are now waiting on results of scans and tests, including a spinal tap, in an effort to find out how much chemotherapy their son will need. But Samantha said: 'He's so young - he doesn't really know what's happening. He giggles at jokes and still loves his cars.'
