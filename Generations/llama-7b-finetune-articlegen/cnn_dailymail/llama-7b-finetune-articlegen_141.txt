Times Square bomber Najibullah Zazi, 25, who is awaiting trial on terrorism charges, said yesterday he planned to seek the Democratic nomination for a congressional seat in his home state of Colorado.

"I am running as an Independent," Mr Zazi told CNN's Wolf Blitzer from his cell in a New York jail where he is serving time after being convicted on weapons and drug charges.

The Afghan-born Mr Zazi, who was living with his wife and children in Aurora, Colorado, said he had been planning to run for some time - and would have done so anyway even if police hadn't caught him trying to detonate a car bomb on October 16 last year.
"I thought about running before the terrorist attack but it was after that I got more interest in politics," Mr Zazi said.
Asked why he had decided to run, the alleged al Qaeda operative told CNN: 'Because I believe our country needs a lot of change." He did not elaborate on what changes he would like to see made. Mr Zazi added that he planned to campaign against both Republicans and Democrats in the state's 7th Congressional District, which is being vacated by outgoing Republican Rep. Marilyn Musgrave.
Mr Blitzer asked: "So you're going to be a maverick?" Mr Zazi replied with a chuckle, "Yes." He said he had been encouraged to run for office by his mother and other people in the U.S., saying that he had "gotten some calls from friends" telling him they supported him. When asked who those friends were, Mr Zazi laughed nervously and declined to elaborate. Mr Zazi also made a reference to al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden when he told CNN: 'I know my country needs change . . . I'm not afraid of anybody.' He has pleaded guilty in the bombing attempt - which he said was orchestrated by his father-in-law. In a federal court in New York last month, Mr Zazi admitted that he had planned to drive a car packed with explosives into the heart of Times Square and detonate it on October 16 last year. He also pleaded guilty to charges including receiving instructions from al Qaeda operatives abroad to carry out a bombing plot in Denver, Colorado. Prosecutors said that Mr Zazi was an al Qaeda agent who had been trained to make and detonate explosives at the hands of senior terrorist leaders - and had planned his own suicide attack on Times Square for September 10 this year. He changed the date of his plan after his father-in-law, Mohammed Wali Zazi, told him that police were closing in on him, according to prosecutors . Mr Blitzer asked Mr Zazi if he had been an al Qaeda terrorist since he was a teenager, and whether he would be willing to admit that. "Yes, I'm a Muslim but that doesn't make me part of any terrorist group," he said. Asked about his relationship with his father-in-law Mohammed Wali Zazi - who is serving 10 years in prison for sending $5,600 to two men Mr Zazi met online whom he believed were al Qaeda agents - Mr Zazi said: 'My father-in-law was not part of any terrorist group.' He added: "I'm not going to talk about the case." But asked whether his father-in-law knew what he planned to do, Mr Zazi replied: 'Yes. If it were my decision, I would have never gotten involved with this [terror] cell . . . It was always up to me if I wanted to continue and become a terrorist or not.' He added that he had initially been given the opportunity by al Qaeda operatives to travel overseas for training as an extremist. But Mr Zazi said: 'It wasn't something I wanted to do, so I refused.' During the interview with CNN yesterday, Mr Zazi was asked about his views on homosexuality and abortion. He replied that he thought it was wrong to have gay sex and described himself as a social conservative who believes in traditional values - but said he does not believe that gay people should be 'harassed.' Asked whether he would vote for President Barack Obama if the election were held today, Mr Zazi smiled and responded: 'No. I'm going to vote for Ron Paul,' referring to Rep. Ron Paul (R-TX), who has expressed strong libertarian views on social issues and is a frequent critic of U.S. foreign policy. Asked whether he would campaign against Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter, who is a Democrat, Mr Zazi replied: 'I'm not going to say I will be against any candidate . . . The voters can decide if they want me or not.' Mr Zazi said that he planned to spend the coming year raising money for his campaign and learning how to run for office - and that he would announce whether or not he was running in 2010. Mr Zazi has been living with his wife and children at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a jail in New York City where most high-profile terrorism defendants are held before trial. He said that he would stay there until he was transferred to a federal prison for the duration of his sentence, which could last years. Asked whether he had any regrets about his failed attempt to bomb Times Square last year, Mr Zazi replied: 'I'm not going to talk about this case.' But he added: "I know it's my mistake, I shouldn't have done that." When asked why he did it - and what would prevent him from doing the same thing again if released - Mr Zazi said: "It wasn't about hurting people or killing them . . . It was more of a show of force to al Qaeda. My family back home in Afghanistan, they believe we should have some control over our country and I think that's what this was all about." He added: 'If my government wants me to be part of the U.S. Army or something like that - I would do it.' When asked if he was thinking about suicide attacks again when he got out of prison, Mr Zazi said: 'I will not commit a crime. If anything, I am going to try to help my community because they were so good to me.' He added: "If the government wants me to be part of this country I would do it." Asked whether he had any plans for after his release from prison, Mr Zazi said that he planned to spend time with his family in Colorado - but did not mention his campaign plans. His attorney, Arthur Aidala, told CNN that 'it's a bit premature' for the accused terrorist to discuss running for office because he still has pending criminal charges against him. Mr Zazi was born in Afghanistan and lived in Pakistan with his family before coming to the United States as an immigrant. He moved to Aurora, Colorado, where he met his wife and began working at a gas station there - and was later recruited by al Qaeda operatives to become a terrorist. He said that when he was 19 years old he began communicating with members of the militant group via online chat rooms . Mr Zazi's brother-in-law, Danny Pearl, was beheaded in Pakistan by al Qaeda in February 2002 and his mother, Basila Zazi, was killed at a U.S. Air Force base in Afghanistan shortly after the September 11 attacks. The father of three young children said that he had tried to contact Mr Pearl while living in Pakistan - but had been unsuccessful. He also said that he did not know how his mother died until recently, when he found out through an Internet search engine. 'I was shocked,' Mr Zazi told Blitzer. 'I didn't realize she was a victim of the September 11 attacks.' Mr Zazi's father-in-law, Mohammed Wali Zazi, pleaded guilty in January to charges related to his role in a terrorism plot last year and received a sentence of ten years in prison . Federal prosecutors alleged that Mr Zazi was trained by al Qaeda operatives overseas on how to build bombs. He had also traveled to Pakistan - where he took photographs with men who were planning a major terrorist attack, according to a federal indictment filed earlier this year. A month after he returned from his trip to Afghanistan and Pakistan in July 2008, Mr Zazi was arrested while on an airplane about to take off for Denver . After his arrest, authorities found 500 grams of PETN - a highly explosive chemical commonly used in the construction of homemade bombs. Authorities said that Mr Zazi had planned to drive the explosives-laden car into Times Square on October 16 last year and detonate it at rush hour with the intent of killing as many people as possible. He had also been planning to bomb a New York subway station - but decided against it when his father-in-law alerted him that police were closing in on him, according to prosecutors. 'There's not one thing I could have done differently,' Mr Zazi told Blitzer yesterday
