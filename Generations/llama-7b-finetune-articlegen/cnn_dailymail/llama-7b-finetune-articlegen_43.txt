The book is a revelation and it gives a great insight to what it means being a top international sportsman, especially for a cricketer who has been at the very top for so many years. 
Kevin Pieterson is one of the greatest ever batsmen in England’s history, but he shows us that despite having everything you want to become rich and famous; fame, fortune and power, being an international sportsman is not all it seems. In fact, it can be quite a lonely existence, as it was for Kevin Pieterson who has suffered from depression and anxiety in the past. The book also tells us how he coped with being dropped from the England team and even though he didn’t want to write this book originally; it is good that he did. It gives an insight to his mindset at the time, which was very low indeed. 
The book reveals many things about the life of a professional cricketer, including the secrets behind how Kevin Pieterson managed to maintain such fitness levels. The book also tells us what happens when you are injured or ill and cannot play, which is often quite frustrating for some players who have been working hard all their lives just to be told they can’t do what they love anymore due to injury or illness. This could lead them into depression if it happened regularly over long periods of time like with Kevin Pieterson when he was injured after the 2010 World Cup final against Australia, which led him to think about quitting cricket altogether.
