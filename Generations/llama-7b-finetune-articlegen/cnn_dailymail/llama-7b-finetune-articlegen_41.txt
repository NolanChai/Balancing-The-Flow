John Yates, 59, pictured outside court today, met Ukrainian Marina Ivleva, 49, online but their marriage ended acrimoniously. The former head of the Serious Organised Crime Agency and a former senior officer of Scotland Yard's Specialist Operations unit was accused in the Westminster Magistrates Court today of misconduct in public office. He allegedly conspired with Ms Ivleva to sell false information about the wife of ex-Tory MP Andrew MacKay, who had been married to her for 13 years and is now married to another woman. Mr Yates allegedly gave the Ukrainian 'false information' about former Tory minister Lord Warner in order to help Ms Ivleva sell a story to News International. He was arrested after allegations were made by a journalist working for the Sunday Times and freelance investigator, Nick Kochan, that Mr Yates had been paid £20,000 for information about Lord Warner's affair with Ms Ivleva in 2011. The case comes amid claims of press intrusion after the murder of publicist Rebekah Wade and is likely to reignite tensions over police links to tabloid newspapers. Mr Yates, from south-east London, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court today on two counts of misconduct in a public office. He spoke only to confirm his name when asked by the magistrate and sat expressionless throughout as his charges were read out. His barrister Jonathan Laidlaw said Mr Yates would plead not guilty and was due to stand trial at Southwark Crown Court on October 13 next year, after a pre-trial hearing in May. Mr Laidlaw told the court: 'This case has arisen from the fact that the defendant is accused of having had a relationship with Ms Ivleva and assisting her to make some false allegations about an individual and it so happened those false allegations were made in a newspaper article.'
