**The parents of a baby who died while she was under the care of a childcare worker have called on the industry to introduce written guidelines on sleep and rest, which they say would have helped prevent their daughter's death.**

Judy and Tim Sharkey said their 18-month-old daughter Catelynn died in September last year at an in-home care centre in Sydney. The parents had been informed by the staff that their baby was asleep during her visit, but found her lifeless body when they arrived to pick her up later that afternoon. A coronial inquiry into Ms Sharkey's death has heard she was placed face down on a bed mattress in an undisclosed position of restraint and was left alone for more than half an hour with no supervision. The baby suffered two broken ribs, a fractured spine and several bruises to her body as well as extensive brain damage, the inquest heard. Mr Sharkey told Daily Mail Australia he felt confident Ms Sharkey would have survived had she been placed on a firm bed with one adult looking over her every minute. He said there was no reason why an 18-month old toddler should be put to sleep for an extended period of time and called on the childcare industry to introduce written guidelines on resting children that could potentially save other babies from dying. 'The sadness is if they had been taught what they needed to do, my little girl would probably still be alive today,' Mr Sharkey said. Scroll down for video .

Baby Catelynn died last year while she was under the care of an in-home daycare centre. Mr Sharkey said the baby should not be asleep for an extended period of time and called on the childcare industry to introduce written guidelines on sleeping children that could potentially save other babies . 'That's what we are asking them - that they do something so if this ever happens again, there is a guideline, someone can refer to it and say: "Well actually no, you shouldn't be doing that". 'We don't need a coronial inquiry. We have a solution here.' Mr Sharkey said the family would like a public inquiry into childcare centres in Australia so the guidelines could be implemented across the country. The baby died while she was under the care of an unregistered centre in Sydney, which has been operating for at least 10 years without any government supervision, according to Mr Sharkey. A NSW Coroner is expected to hand down a finding on whether Catelynn's death was accidental or the result of abuse following the conclusion of the coronial inquiry today. 'If it wasn't for these people in here - they have been our rock,' Ms Sharkey said, referring to members of staff at childcare centres who took part in the inquest.
