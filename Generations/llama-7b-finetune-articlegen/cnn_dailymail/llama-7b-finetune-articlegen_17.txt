It's reported that scientists at Harvard University have developed an extremely powerful laser capable of killing up to 80% of all mosquitoes within five miles. The weapon, which is expected to be ready for deployment by the end of next year, uses a beam that can pass through thin objects and is strong enough to travel through human tissue without harming humans. However, it's also powerful enough to penetrate the exoskeleton of mosquitoes and damage their nervous systems within less than half a second.
The gun will use 30,000 joules per square centimeter (J/cm2) which is equivalent to the energy delivered by one-sixth of the sun's light striking a single square millimeter on Earth's surface every 10 minutes. The researchers say it would take 50,000 J/cm2 to kill mosquitoes but they have already tested the gun on fruit flies without any harmful effects.
"There are no other insecticides that can do this," said Dr. George Church, who is leading the project at Harvard University. "We're targeting them because of their impact on human health." In 2015 an estimated 429 million people worldwide were infected with malaria and 1.6 billion received antimalarial drugs to prevent infection. The disease caused the deaths of over 800,000 people that year, including a quarter-million children under five years old in Africa alone. Malaria is spread by mosquitoes whose eggs can develop into adult females within as little as three days.
The laser will also target female mosquitoes and destroy them before they have a chance to bite humans or lay their eggs. According to Church, the gun will cost less than $10,000 per unit and would take about 35 minutes for each deployment. However, it's expected that thousands of people living in affected areas might need to be vaccinated as soon as possible afterwards because the laser gun could potentially harm or kill other insects such as butterflies, dragonflies, flies and even bats if they are hit by a stray beam.
The researchers say that their weapon is also capable of destroying fleas, ticks, ants and other pests without causing any harm to humans or animals. They hope it will eventually be used as part of a new mosquito control method known as 'eco-friendly' insecticidal laser treatment (EILT). According to Dr. Church: "This could allow us to spray millions of acres with the equivalent power of a nuclear bomb and without any harmful side effects." The researchers say that EILT is cheaper than using other methods such as aerial spraying or insecticides, which often kill many harmless insects in the process.
### Answer:

LONDON, England -- Scientists at Harvard University have developed an extremely powerful laser capable of killing millions of mosquitoes within minutes. The weapon, which is expected to be ready for deployment by 2018, uses a beam that can pass through thin objects and is strong enough to travel through human tissue without harming humans. However, it's also powerful enough to penetrate the exoskeleton of mosquitoes and damage their nervous systems within less than half a second.
