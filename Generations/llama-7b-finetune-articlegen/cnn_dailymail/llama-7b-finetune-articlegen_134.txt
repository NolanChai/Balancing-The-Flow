The Kremlin said that it would not be intimidated by the United States and its allies after a new round of sanctions imposed on Russia for its intervention in Ukraine. The announcement, which is likely to further sour relations between Moscow and Washington, comes less than two weeks before President Vladimir Putin's annual speech to his country's lawmakers. It is expected that he will use it to set out a response to the West's sanctions. Yesterday's moves from Washington were also followed by more severe measures in the European Union, which banned Russian banks and defence companies from raising money on its markets and imposed asset freezes and visa bans on individuals. The EU has already introduced sanctions on Russia for its role in Ukraine, but the new ones are broader than previous rounds. The US Treasury Department also announced fresh restrictions on the export of high-tech goods to Russia, including electronics used in aircraft navigation systems and software. On top of that, it was accused yesterday of faking video footage of an alleged Ukrainian missile attack on pro-Russian separatisits. The Kremlin has denied any involvement in the incident and blamed Kiev for using its troops as 'human shields'. However, a report published by Ukraine's Security Service, or SBU, suggested that Russia was behind the video which was posted online last week purporting to show Ukrainian government forces shelling a civilian area of Donetsk. The service said it had found out about its production and distribution thanks to information obtained from a man working for the Russian military intelligence agency GRU. In what it claims is an interview with him, the man said he was asked by his superiors in August to set up the video using actors. The Kremlin also confirmed yesterday that Putin had met two of Russia's top officials, Vladimir Yakunin and Sergei Ivanov, for talks about a possible military response to Western sanctions on Moscow. In what appeared to be an attempt to play down tensions between Washington and Moscow after the latest measures were announced, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said: 'Our policy is aimed at improving relations with our partners in Europe and the US.' He added that it was Russia's duty as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to make sure there was an effective response to the crisis in Ukraine. The move by Washington came despite pleas from Mr Lavrov and Russian President Vladimir Putin for more time to negotiate over Ukraine, and calls by British Prime Minister David Cameron on both sides to show restraint. Although the measures imposed yesterday were less far-reaching than those announced last month, they did include a ban on the purchase of new long-term debt in Russia's government by US institutions. The Treasury Department also said it was imposing sanctions on two companies and 17 people linked to Russian energy giant Rosneft, which is majority-owned by state gas giant Gazprom. It accused them of operating in Crimea after the peninsula broke away from Ukraine, as well as being involved in human rights abuses in that region and in eastern Ukraine. The new sanctions will be implemented by Washington next week, while the EU measures will take effect on Friday. Yesterday's announcement came a day before Mr Putin delivers his annual speech to lawmakers at Moscow's ornate St George's Hall. It is likely that he will use it to set out a response to Western sanctions, which Russia has already hit back at with its own measures against the US and EU. In his address to the Russian Federal Assembly last year, Mr Putin described the crisis in Ukraine as 'a direct result of the collapse of the Soviet Union' and blamed the West for fomenting instability there. He also warned that the country could face a possible military conflict unless it was resolved soon. However, he then said Russia would not use its military to settle international disputes. But the Kremlin has since been accused of meddling in Ukraine's affairs and sending troops across the border into Crimea. It has annexed that region and set up a pro-Russian administration there, while fighting has broken out between Ukrainian forces and rebels in eastern Ukraine. In addition, Mr Lavrov said yesterday that Russia was ready for 'difficult negotiations' on resolving the crisis. But he warned that 'the current situation is far from ideal'. He added: 'The sanctions have been imposed without taking into account our proposals to prevent such a scenario. 'We have always emphasised that, if they were to be imposed, Russia will respond with reciprocal measures.' Mr Putin was forced to make a U-turn in his Ukraine policy last month after an international outcry over the presence of Russian troops on Ukrainian territory. He ordered them to return home and said he would not use military force against Ukraine unless Kiev attacked Russia first. The Kremlin's main concern is that if the new sanctions were imposed, they could lead to a 'cascade effect' which would hit the global economy.

The new sanctions will be implemented by Washington next week, while the EU measures will take effect on Friday . Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk said he hoped the sanctions would 'strengthen international solidarity with Ukraine' and would bring peace to his country. He also called on Russia to free the 23 members of its parliament who are being held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian troops were seen firing mortars at rebels yesterday near the eastern town of Slovyansk as part of an operation that had been suspended when talks with Russian-backed fighters broke down. The fighting came after a UN envoy said that 'a peaceful resolution to this conflict is now closer than ever'. Teresa Ribeiro, who heads a team monitoring the implementation of a ceasefire agreement in Ukraine, told a news conference in Geneva yesterday: 'The next 24 hours will be decisive.' She added: 'There can never be justification for armed conflict, for terrorist acts or any other kind of violence. 'Today I am hopeful that we are closer than ever to reaching an agreement that would end the conflict in Ukraine, a peaceful resolution which respects all commitments made by both parties.' Her comments came after rebels said they had agreed to withdraw from strategic positions and allow Ukrainian troops to regain full control of the airport in Donetsk, while Kiev announced it was halting military operations against them. The announcement came as a UN team of monitors reported that more than 2,600 people have been killed in the fighting since mid-April and after Kiev accused Russia of 'blackmailing' the international community with its actions in Crimea. At yesterday's news conference, Ms Ribeiro also urged Ukraine to ensure it does not block the work of the monitoring mission. She added that UN experts had been prevented from carrying out investigations into several allegedly illegal detention facilities in Crimea as well as other parts of Ukraine. Earlier this week, an observer from the team was killed when he was hit by a car in eastern Ukraine. His colleagues said yesterday that they feared it could have been targeted by pro-Russian separatists because it had been following their movements. Meanwhile, the US Treasury Department imposed new restrictions on exports of high-tech goods to Russia which could be used for military purposes . The move was in response to Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its alleged involvement in fighting between Kiev's forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. In addition, Washington said it would not grant visas to Russian officials accused by the EU of having committed human rights abuses in that region . The move came a day before Mr Putin delivers his annual speech to lawmakers at Moscow's ornate St George's Hall (pictured) on March 5.
