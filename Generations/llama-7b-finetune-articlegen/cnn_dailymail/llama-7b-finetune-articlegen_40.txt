This year's show at 19 Eversfield Street in Kew, Victoria, beat all previous Guinness World Record holder the Pixel Pyramid (2015) by having over 683,147 individual lights (and counting).

The Christmas light display of the world record-holding Pixel Pyramid at Lake Forest, California. The 2016 version has more than doubled in size with over 1.1 million lights. The 19 Eversfield Street display is claimed as being 'the most festive house on earth'.
The light show is the creation of the De Ritis family who were given the go-ahead from Guinness World Records to promote their home's festive displays in October this year after they broke last year's record with 381,964. They are hoping that this year will also see a Guinness Book of World Records entry for most people on the one Christmas light-themed street at one time (50,000). 'This has been our dream since we were kids - to be world record holders,' said Daniel De Ritis who founded the display with his wife Melissa. The couple have a 21-year-old daughter called Kassie and son Luca, aged five, both of whom have helped install the lights.

They broke the record for most Christmas lights on one residential home with 381,964 . The 2016 display has more than doubled that number to over 750,000 (and counting). The De Ritis family have been making their house into a light-show every year since 2009. 'We are very proud of our achievement,' added Daniel, whose parents, Frank and Angela, first decorated the front of their home with festive lights back in 1978. The De Rits family stand on Christmas Day last year (right) next to a certificate which they were given by Guinness World Records after breaking the record for most Christmas lights on one residential house. The couple have set out to double that number this year . The lights were made possible thanks to the help of more than 120 volunteers over two days, who helped the family install their display. The couple had a team of volunteer elves last year and will be holding Christmas workshops at their home during the season again in 2016. 'It's a lot of work but it's something that we can do with our children,' said Daniel, who also owns a construction company. 'We just love doing it and if we are going to have this much work to do why not make it fun and get people involved.' The family have been getting help from volunteers for the last three years. In 2015 they helped the couple install over 380,000 lights on their home in Melbourne . The De Rits family were given a certificate after breaking the Guinness World Record for most Christmas lights on one residential house - and they have set out to double that number this year. The Australian family's house has more than 750,000 (and counting). In 2016 they also hope to get into a book of world records by having the most people on one street at one time for Christmas lights . 'We've had some great help from local families,' said Daniel. 'It gives us an opportunity to give back and we are very happy with that.' The family also have an annual charity night where they donate all proceeds to a good cause in the community. In 2014, the event raised $40,000 for charities such as St Vincent de Paul's Society of Australia Victoria - a religious order which works with families in need. 'We also try and give people an opportunity to do something different during the festive season,' added Daniel. The family (pictured left-right: Kassie, Luca, Melissa and Daniel) set up their 2015 display of lights on October 24 - with over 380,000 individual bulbs .

This year's 19 Eversfield Street display was put up in just two days with 120 volunteers - all of whom will be helping the couple break their own world record again. 'We were given permission to do a showcase from Guinness World Records, but it took us three years to get that,' said Daniel. The couple first got into the Christmas light game in 2009 with just over 35,000 lights. Since then they have steadily increased their numbers year-on-year, breaking this year's record on October 24th. 'We did it again because we thought it was too good to be true,' said Daniel. 'When I got the email from Guinness World Records and it came through - saying that our house was officially recognised as having over half a million lights in 2016, we were speechless.' The De Rits family had help from more than 120 volunteers to install this year's display. In total they put up over 750,000 individual bulbs (and counting) on their home . Last year the couple held an annual charity night where all proceeds raised went towards St Vincent de Paul's Society of Australia Victoria and other local charities such as Starlight Children's Foundation. The family have been doing this every year since 2014 to give back to the community . This year, Daniel hopes that the De Rits family will break their own record once again - and they are hoping to see a Guinness World Record for most people on one Christmas light-themed street at one time (50,000). The 2016 display was officially recognised as the 'most festive house on earth' by Guinness World Records in October this year. This is the De Rits family's second time being given a Guinness Book of World Records certificate - they received one for most Christmas lights on one residential home in 2015 . The 381,964-light display last year saw them beating their previous record which was set at the house next door. Last month (left), the family celebrated their achievement and will hope to break it again this December with over 750,000 lights . 'We are aiming for double in number and we are going to put all our energy into that,' said Daniel. 'It's a really big push but I think it would be awesome.' The family is also hoping to break a Guinness World Records title for most people on one street at one time during the festive season (50,000). 'We are going to get a good crowd this year and I hope we can break our own record,' added Daniel. 'It's all about being part of something special and helping out local charities.'

The De Rits family hope that they can also receive the 'most festive house on earth' certificate once again this year. The title was given to them by Guinness in 2015 but they want to make sure their display is bigger and better than last year, with a team of volunteers helping out. 'We love it and we think it will be good for the kids too,' said Daniel. 'Everyone loves coming down here - there's a lot of people who just come because they can see all the lights from the freeway.' The family has also been getting help from the local community with volunteer elves during the festive season . The De Rits have been putting on this show every year since 2009. This year's display will officially be recognised as the 'most festive house on earth', by Guinness World Records, in October .

They are setting up their display again tonight and have invited 46,000 people to come down to see it . 'It's not easy putting it together but we like being part of something big,' added Daniel. 'We are just two people who decided that we wanted to do it - if someone else can then everyone should be able to.' Last year they helped the couple install over 380,000 lights on their home in Melbourne .
