A . 73-year-old man is suing his employer for age discrimination after a manager allegedly told him to 'quit acting like you're 50.' Paul Hollis says he was forced out of the Wendy's restaurant where he worked part time in New York City because of comments made by one of the chain's managers. 'He told me that I should quit acting like I am 50 or else,' said Mr. Hollis, a resident of Bronxville, N.Y., according to WABC-TV. 'I didn't know what he meant but it seemed very strange.' After Mr. Hollis spoke with his supervisor, the restaurant manager came up and told him that the general manager had complained about his age. That night, he was fired from his job of four years as a sandwich maker at a Wendy's location in New Rochelle, N.Y., said Mr. Hollis' attorney, David Oppenheim. 'Paul has no intention of quitting,' Mr. Oppenheim told the station. 'He is going to fight this.' The restaurant chain was unavailable for comment on Thursday afternoon. Wendy's spokesman Bob Bertini said earlier that they were investigating the claim. 'Wendy's takes issues of discrimination very seriously,' he said in a statement. 'We are looking into it and will take appropriate steps when more facts are known.' Mr. Hollis is suing Wendy's for $5 million, according to WABC-TV. He says the fast food chain violated anti-discrimination laws by terminating his employment because of his age. The lawsuit also alleges that Mr. Hollis was the victim of retaliation and wrongful termination.
