(BBC) -- In what is being described as an extraordinary row, one of Britain’s most senior civil servants has asked a government minister in charge of immigration policy to put up or shut up over allegations he was "not doing enough" to tackle illegal immigrants. In the latest sign of deep tensions between David Cameron's coalition Government and its Lib Dem partners, Ken Clark, a senior Liberal Democrat MP who is also shadow home secretary, called for Steve Smith, permanent secretary at the Home Office, to give him "specific evidence" about what more his department was doing on illegal immigration. The exchange comes after Mr Clark accused ministers of "being scared of taking on the tabloids" over the issue. In a letter to Steve Smith, Ken Clarke demanded answers from the permanent secretary on whether the government had done enough to tackle illegal immigrants. (Picture posed by models) And it follows claims that ministers were being urged to "prioritise" deportation of illegal immigrants so they could avoid controversial deportations after being given leave to remain in Britain under the 'human rights' laws introduced by Labour. Mr Smith replied on Monday night by asking Mr Clarke: ‘Can you give me some specific evidence for your assertion that “the Home Office is not doing enough”?’ Mr Clark responded yesterday by saying he had "no wish" to see Mr Smith sacked but insisted that his department was failing to tackle the issue. He also accused the department of 'trivialising' the problem and added: ‘I do think it would be better for the Home Office to do more rather than trying to hide behind me.’ The dispute has been rumbling on since last month when Mr Clarke told the Observer newspaper that ministers were 'afraid of taking on the tabloids'. He said a fear of the public mood was blocking government action, including possible changes to human rights law. Conservative sources have accused him of ‘deliberately sabotaging' the coalition's policy on immigration and of trying to damage the Lib Dem reputation as an independent party. The dispute is likely to increase tensions between the parties with the Liberal Democrats expected to perform strongly in next month’s local elections. The row came as it emerged that Mr Smith had been forced out of a planned public lecture because of fears he would be disruptive to business. A Conservative MP said the Home Office was 'in crisis' following the departure of its director general for operations, Rob Whiteman, last week. In his resignation letter, Mr Whiteman said there was no longer a ‘coherent and credible policy’ in place at the Home Office. He added that he would have to quit because he could not continue to lead the department as it was being 'increasingly damaged by political interference'. The row over deportations has already forced Theresa May, the Home Secretary, into a humiliating climbdown after she admitted last month that an ‘error’ had led to a foreign criminal being allowed to stay in Britain. Mr Clarke is also facing pressure from some of his colleagues within the Lib Dems as well as Tory critics who are demanding he quit as shadow home secretary over what they believe have been his anti-Tory comments and actions. He was accused of 'sabotaging' Conservative policies after an attack on David Cameron’s plans to impose tougher benefits rules for migrants. The Mail also revealed how Mr Clarke was under investigation by the party whips office for claiming in a newspaper interview that he had been told his ‘job would be made very difficult if not impossible’ when he criticised Tory immigration policies. Conservative MP Philip Davies said: ‘There is a real sense of crisis at the Home Office and it looks like there are real problems with senior officials.' The Home Secretary, Theresa May, who has had to apologise for an 'error' over deportation decisions, may be called before Parliament tomorrow when she faces questions about whether ministers have been tinkering with their immigration policy as a result of political concerns. MPs on the Commons home affairs committee will ask her if the Government is taking its ‘eye off the ball’ in tackling illegal immigrants and overstayers, and if it has been forced to make decisions that contradict what ministers have said about how they are reducing numbers. The row is likely to be a cause of some embarrassment for Nick Clegg as he prepares for his first major Commons speech since becoming Deputy Prime Minister at the head of the Lib Dems after last year’s election. Yesterday the Conservatives accused Mr Clarke of 'deliberately sabotaging' coalition policy on immigration to damage the Liberal Democrat reputation as an independent party. A source said: ‘Ken Clarke has been extremely disloyal to his own party and is now trying to make political capital out of it. If this was a private member’s bill he would be in trouble with his own party but, because it is an official coalition policy, he feels able to abuse the position and damage the credibility of the party.’ Mr Smith's letter has been seen by the Mail as an attempt to reassure Tory critics that there has been no change in Lib Dem views on immigration. But the response from Mr Clark makes clear that he remains unconvinced and will continue his campaign for greater action against illegal immigrants. The dispute between Mr Clarke and Mr Smith began after a briefing in December by an 'official' who told journalists: ‘The Liberal Democrats have been deliberately sabotaging the coalition’s immigration policy to try and improve their electoral position.’ A source close to the Lib Dems said yesterday that this was a ‘complete nonsense’. Mr Clarke insisted last night he would not be resigning as shadow home secretary, adding: ‘I have no intention of leaving the post at this stage, but I think it would be better if Home Office officials did more.’ The row is expected to deepen tensions between Lib Dems and Tories after Clegg's party performed strongly in last year’s local elections. Mr Clarke has also been accused by some colleagues of being ‘too critical of his own leadership’. He is said to have told senior colleagues he believed the Lib Dem conference speech which was intended as a major policy statement had been a mistake because it failed to spell out how the party would deal with the economy and other issues. But he has also been accused by some within the party of 'not being on message' over immigration in order to try to damage the Tory brand. A senior Lib Dem source said last night: ‘Ken Clarke is a great friend but we believe that he is deliberately trying to undermine coalition policy and damaging the Liberal Democrats’ reputation for independence.’ But one Tory MP accused Mr Clarke of 'sabotaging' government policies. The MP, who wished not to be named, said: ‘Ken Clarke has been extremely disloyal to his own party. If this was a private member’s bill he would be in trouble with his own party but because it is an official coalition policy he feels able to abuse the position and damage the credibility of the party.’ The Tory MP added: ‘There will be no return for Lib Dems in next year’s local elections unless they get behind this government. He [Clarke] needs to consider whether his job as shadow home secretary is compatible with that.’ In his interview last month Mr Clarke was asked about the ‘postcode lottery’ which can lead to a different outcome from one area of the country to another. He said: ‘I think we have been afraid of confronting the tabloids and that has meant not challenging them in areas such as immigration.’ A spokesman for Mr Clarke insisted last night that he would not resign over his comments but said he had no intention of leaving his job at the moment. He added: ‘I have no wish to see Steve Smith sacked, but I do think it would be better if Home Office officials did more rather than trying to hide behind me.’ Mr Clarke also pointed out that a Commons committee last week urged ministers to look again at human rights laws in order to tackle illegal immigrants. The Liberal Democrat spokesman added: ‘It’s not just Ken who has said this, it was the all-party Joint Committee on Human Rights.’ Last month Mr Cameron and Mrs May were forced to admit they had made a 'human error' which allowed a foreign criminal to remain in Britain. Ahmad Farooqui, from Afghanistan, had been ordered to leave but had failed to do so. After the case came to light, Home Office officials admitted that their failure to deport him was because of an administrative error. Mr Whiteman has said his decision not to remain as director general for operations was taken in part due to the ongoing 'damage' caused by the immigration issue at the department. He said: ‘I am sure it is not going to get any easier and I think now is a good time to move on.’ Mr Clarke also made comments about Tory benefits policy which have been criticised as undermining the government’s commitment to cutting spending. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: 'I have never said that we don’t need welfare reform, what I have always said is that there are two problems with this particular aspect of the government's policy on benefit reform: one
