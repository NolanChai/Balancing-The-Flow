The poster that has appeared around Cambridge offers students “easy cash” for information. It promises a sum of £150 for information about the university’s lecturers and professors. The poster states in bold, capital letters: "Need extra money? EASY CASH! For info on lecturers / professors. 2-3 hours work.” It continues to say that the student “could make a lot of money”. It promises cash for information about how they behave in social situations as well as information about their personal lives. The poster ends by saying: "Send an email to: (email address redacted).” However, there is no phone number to call or details of who has posted the advertisement. Cambridge students have taken to Facebook and Twitter to discuss the advertisement, with many taking pictures of it around university buildings. One student tweeted: “What are these posters for?!” Another added: “No way! Someone must have a lot of time on their hands.” The poster has been put up across Cambridge in places such as the Senate House. It is thought that the advertisement was posted by an undercover journalist to expose information about lecturers and professors at the university. In 2014, another student had attempted to take pictures of a professor with their smartphone during an exam. The student was found guilty of disrupting a public meeting but not convicted on assault charges for his actions. It is not known how many people have responded to the advertisement by email or whether any money has been paid out. Cambridge University said: “The university does not comment on individual students’ personal matters.” Last year, an Oxford student was forced to apologise after she was caught eavesdropping and taking pictures of a lecture at his college.
