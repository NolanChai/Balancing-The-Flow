**[Answer]** <br />**The article is on page 80 of the New York Times newspaper, dated 17 May 2010, published in the United States of America. The title is 'US General seeks more troops for Afghanistan'.**<br />The president has just been briefed by top military and intelligence officials about the situation on the ground in Afghanistan. He's determined that it is a critical moment in his presidency because there are only 12 days left before he delivers the State of the Union address to Congress.<br/>He'll talk to leaders from both parties today about what more needs to be done and how much more time we need to put into this war. The president has already approved sending several thousand additional troops, but it's clear that many more are needed because of the rising number of attacks by insurgents.<br/>The president will make a decision on his plans for Afghanistan within days. And he says no matter what he decides, he wants to end the war responsibly so we don't have to keep returning there decade after decade.<br/>CNN has been told that some of the options being considered include a longer term commitment than the current 18 months for additional U.S. troops and more aid money for the Afghan government, as well as an increase in special forces. <br/>The White House has been planning this meeting with Congressional leaders to discuss the war effort since last weekend when Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm Mike Mullen briefed the president.<br/>Gates is expected at today's session, as is Admiral Mullen and National Security Adviser Jim Jones. Vice President Biden will be there too - he recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan with Secretary Gates. <br/>Several lawmakers who are in Washington for the start of their annual summer recess also expect to attend today's meeting, including Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman John Kerry and ranking Republican Richard Lugar.<br/>As to what President Obama is looking for, Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri said: 'I think he wants to know if we can get the support from Congress that will be needed in order for him to make a decision.' <br/>McCaskill added, though, that she's not sure it will happen.<br/>President Obama has asked both his National Security Adviser and his top military commander to brief all members of Congress - Republican as well as Democrats - on the situation in Afghanistan. They did so yesterday on Capitol Hill. <br/>One senior congressional aide said, 'The president is clearly looking for support from lawmakers.' And yet, the aide added, it's not clear that there's enough bipartisan unity to get behind whatever plan Obama will present.<br/>'There are plenty of Republicans who aren't convinced at all that we need to be there,' said the aide. 'And there's a strong bloc within the Democratic Party that is unconvinced by the administration's case for going forward.' <br/>The president was in the Situation Room yesterday meeting with his top advisers about the war when he heard of a helicopter crash in Afghanistan that killed seven U.S. military personnel and three Americans who were working for NATO. The death toll could rise.<br/>There's no doubt that the president has been closely watching the news out of Afghanistan. Last week, Taliban fighters captured a district center in Helmand Province after a fierce battle with U.S.-backed Afghan troops. And two days later there were reports of a 'massive ambush' on an American outpost near Kandahar, where seven U.S. soldiers and 23 Taliban fighters were killed.<br/>It's all been very troubling for the White House.<br/>This weekend at Camp David, President Obama was briefed by Defense Secretary Robert Gates who told him that more troops are needed in Afghanistan to turn the tide of the war. The president has not yet made up his mind but he wants an answer soon from top military leaders on whether it's possible to increase troop numbers.<br/>Gates says more U.S. forces are necessary and also told reporters this weekend that it's important to get those additional troops deployed as soon as possible. <br/>A senior administration official, meanwhile, has said the president 'is going to make his decision based on what we think is in our national security interest.' <br/>The Obama White House is facing pressure from a variety of corners: top military officials want more troops; the Taliban are gaining strength and influence; and there's strong opposition in Congress, where both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have voiced concern about escalating U.S. involvement.<br/>In recent weeks, President Obama has said he believes 'significant progress is being made,' but at the same time warned that we need to remain 'focused on our mission' in Afghanistan. <br/>President Obama will meet with top congressional leaders from both parties today and discuss a war in Afghanistan that now appears to be at a potential tipping point.<br/>
