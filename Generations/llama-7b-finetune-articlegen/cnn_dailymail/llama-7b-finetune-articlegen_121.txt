BBC1's coverage of England's defeat by Uruguay in the quarter-finals of the World Cup was watched by more than 90 per cent of viewers on a Saturday night . They would have heard the roars across the entire United Kingdom even if ITV had switched off the sound. BBC1’s coverage of England’s defeat by Uruguay in the quarter-finals of the World Cup was watched by more than 90 per cent of viewers on a Saturday night. But those watching at home and in bars were not the only ones who witnessed that glorious failure when Luis Suarez scored twice for a Uruguayan side which had been expected to be eliminated before the final group game. On the streets outside Wembley, 75,000 fans sang their hearts out through an emotionally charged evening and beyond, with roars heard across London and then the UK on Saturday night and Sunday morning. Even though it was only a friendly between England and Brazil at Old Trafford in Manchester, where Wayne Rooney scored his first international goal for 13 months in the 2-2 draw on Tuesday night. But it would have been more if they hadn’t switched off the sound and let England fans do most of the talking . BBC's World Cup coverage was watched by 90 per cent of viewers compared with ITV's average audience share of just over 5 million . This is the first time in history that two major tournaments – football's European Championship, which takes place in Poland and Ukraine from June 8-July 1, 2012 and next year’s World Cup finals in Brazil – have been held at the same time. But even though it was only a friendly between England and Brazil on Tuesday night, where Wayne Rooney scored his first international goal for 13 months . The TV schedules will be packed with football as well as other sports like tennis. And while FIFA is making a concerted effort to avoid clashes between the major teams – the biggest in world sport – there are bound to be occasions when two games start at roughly the same time and people have to make a choice between them. England were playing Uruguay on Saturday night . The game finished 4-1 to Uruguay, with Suarez scoring twice before the hour mark . 'We’ve got so much of it now - there are so many more games than ever before,' says Sky Sports executive producer James Crosby. 'It makes life difficult and we have to think about what games people want to watch and when. 'There is only a finite number of hours in the day, so if you’ve got a game on one channel you can’t also put it on another at the same time.' He adds: 'I don’t think the football has suffered too much from this, but I do understand people who find it frustrating when they want to watch a big match and there isn’t enough space on their TV.' It is also worth pointing out that the English Football Association was partly responsible for England's clash with Uruguay. They were asked by FIFA to play the game on Saturday night so as not to interfere with any other fixtures, including matches between countries who are in different groups at next year’s World Cup finals and therefore have a greater chance of qualifying. There will be plenty of football on television over the next couple of months . England fans may miss some big games because they clash with other matches on TV . So far the FA has been very willing to co-operate, although in future we can expect to see them putting their own interests first. That means the FA will want more fixtures at a time that suits them – and therefore there will be less scope for friendly internationals in June 2013 and beyond. But it is important to remember that England have played friendlies on a Saturday evening before . The most famous one was the game against Brazil at Wembley in November, 1966 when the hosts beat their great rivals 4-3 with Geoff Hurst scoring the winner – three of his goals were scored from headers. And it is noteworthy that England played a friendly against Portugal at Old Trafford on Saturday evening just five months before they won Euro 96 by beating Germany in the final on July 30, 1996. 'You’ve got to pick your battles,' says Crosby. 'Sometimes you don’t want the game on, but sometimes there is a case for it being on and I think it is better to have those games played than not.' England will play another friendly against Brazil in August when the two teams meet at Wembley in the final of the Olympic football tournament. The match will be staged in front of more than 90,000 people – a far greater number than any other stadium in the world – and it will be shown live on BBC1, although Sky Sports have the rights for England's friendly against Belgium at Wembley in November.
