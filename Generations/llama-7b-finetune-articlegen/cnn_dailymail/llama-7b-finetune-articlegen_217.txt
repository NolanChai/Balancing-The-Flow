Woodman Allen is an acclaimed director, actor and comedian but also a monster. His sexual exploits with women and young girls are well documented as far back as the 1960s when he started out in comedy. He was a regular at Andy Kaufman's club Catch-A-Rising Star. Allen has made many films since then, including Annie Hall which won him an Academy Award for best director in 1978, and the comedies Sleeper (1973), Zelig (1983) and Bullets Over Broadway (1994). But now the spotlight has turned on Allen's relationships with women. In February this year his daughter Dylan Farrow released a letter alleging that he molested her when she was seven years old. This week Keaton told ABC news: “I know Woody and I know Yale [Allen’s son from another relationship, Moses Farrow]. They are my children's godfather and brother - it would be impossible for me to write them out of my life." She added that Allen was not a monster. "You have to start by saying the man I knew . who was a brother to me and so supportive ... is he perfect? He’s not. Does he deserve what he’s got? No.” Her comments come after Allen, 78, was honoured with a lifetime achievement award at this year's Golden Globes ceremony in Beverly Hills, California on Sunday night . Actor Alec Baldwin, who is friends with Allen and Keaton, said that the director was not guilty of his daughter’s allegations. “I believe Woody and I love him as a brother, so obviously it's very upsetting," he told ABC. "We don't want to believe it." In response to Baldwin’s comments Allen, who is married to actress Soon-Yi Previn, said that the accusations were not true: “If I thought for one moment . that Dylan had been molested, I would have taken out a gun and killed him myself.” He went on to say that Farrow was attempting to use his daughter as part of a custody battle. His son Moses Farrow later wrote an open letter in support of Allen. It said: "I am writing this because it's become impossible to maintain the illusion that everything is OK and I'm doing what I can to expose the emperor's nakedness." In an earlier statement he claimed his mother was “a monster who has harassed me for my entire life.” . Allen and Keaton, 68, met on the set of Play It Again Sam in 1970. He asked her out while shooting A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy in 1982 - and they have been together ever since. They share a daughter, Dylan, who is now 30 years old.

Allen has been married three times; his third wife Soon-Yi Previn is the adopted daughter of his former lover, actress Mia Farrow. Farrow claims that he is the father of Soon Yi's child - a claim denied by both Allen and Soon Yi. The couple have two children together: daughter Bechet Dumaine (b . 1987) and son Ronan (born in December 2000). Farrow has adopted three other children from a previous relationship, as well as her own two children. In 1993 she discovered that Allen was having an affair with Soon-Yi - at the time she was only 21 years old and he was 57. She confronted him and . Allen moved out of their family home in Connecticut where he had lived for more than 20 years. They divorced after a long court battle, which was settled in 2000 when Farrow relinquished her parental rights to the children they adopted together. Soon Yi became his wife three years later in . 1997 - and Allen has since described the relationship as being "like any marriage". Mia Farrow, who is now remarried, had custody of all their children until 2012 when the two eldest children decided to live with her father. In 2013 Soon-Yi gave birth to their second child - Ronan has since been adopted by Allen and Previn as well. A film version of Farrow’s memoir, What Falls Away, is scheduled for release this summer.
