The Citizens are desperate to replace 31-year old Edin Dzeko as Sergio Aguero, Mario Balotelli and Alvaro Negredo have been unable to provide the required goals after City spent nearly £20million last summer on those strikers. However, Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o has rejected a move to Eastlands and instead has decided he will stay with the Catalan giants for next season. Despite being one of the most sought-after players in Europe this past summer, City manager Manuel Pellegrini failed to secure his signature on a three year deal and now it seems Eto'o has chosen the Nou Camp over England, but is yet to decide whether he will stay at the club for another season. 'I want to spend the best moments of my career here, I can't leave because they have not bought me,' said the 32-year old Cameroon international. Eto'o was a transfer target for Pellegrini in this past summer after he signed for Barcelona last season from Chelsea on a free transfer and he managed to score an impressive 29 goals in 46 appearances, but the Citizens have now ended their interest as they are looking to sign up a new striker who is younger than Eto'o. The club had also been linked with moves for Robert Lewandowski, Edinson Cavani, Sergio Aguero and Mario Balotelli, while Arsenal are reportedly considering a bid worth £40million for Atletico Madrid forward Diego Costa. However, Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu has now revealed that Eto'o is not interested in leaving the Nou Camp and he will remain with them next season. 'Samuel Eto'o told me two months ago that he would like to stay another year,' said Bartomeu. 'He said it was a good option because his family lives here, which is important for him.' The Citizens have now turned their attentions away from Eto'o and they will be looking to sign a younger striker who can fit in with their attacking style of football. Pellegrini also needs to find replacements for the injured Vincent Kompany, while he also has a number of young players who need first team experience under their belt at Eastlands, but now it is unlikely they will sign up Eto'o. The 32-year old Cameroon international joined Barcelona last season from Chelsea on a free transfer and he managed to score an impressive 29 goals in 46 appearances for the Catalan giants, who are one of the most sought after teams in Europe this past summer. However, despite being one of the most wanted players in Europe this past summer, City manager Manuel Pellegrini failed to secure his signature on a three-year deal and now it seems Eto'o has chosen the Nou Camp over England, but is yet to decide whether he will stay at the club for another season. 'I want to spend my best moments here,' said Eto'o after Barca confirmed that he would not be leaving this summer. 'I can't leave because they have not bought me.' He added: 'We are working very hard and I hope we can keep it up till the end of the season. I am always in good spirits, I will continue to work, and if things go well then we could finish on a high note.' Despite being linked with moves for Robert Lewandowski, Edinson Cavani, Sergio Aguero and Mario Balotelli, City have now ended their interest as they are looking to sign up a new striker who is younger than Eto'o. The Citizens were reportedly considering a bid worth £40million for Atletico Madrid forward Diego Costa this summer after he impressed in last season's Champions League, but Bartomeu has now revealed that the Brazilian-born Spain international will not be leaving the Vicente Calderon. 'He said it was a good option because his family lives here [Barcelona], which is important for him,' added Bartomeu, who also revealed that 21-year old striker Munir El Haddadi had also decided to stay with Barcelona after rejecting an offer from Inter Milan. 'He has already made up his mind and will be back in the squad on Wednesday.' Meanwhile, Eto'o was linked with a return to Chelsea this summer as former Blues boss Jose Mourinho attempted to sign him up at Stamford Bridge, but Bartomeu claimed that it would have been impossible for City to sell their striker to a club from the same league. 'I don't know why he (Eto'o) is linked with Chelsea,' said the 48-year old president. 'It's not possible as per league rules.' Barcelona will host Bayern Munich at the Nou Camp this Wednesday in their final Champions League Group Stage match after they won all three of their previous games, but Eto'o is yet to decide whether he will stay with the Catalan giants for next season. 'It depends on a number of things,' added Bartomeu. 'I can assure you that Samuel would like to stay here. I do not know if the club can offer him a new contract or if other clubs could be interested.' Pellegrini will be looking to secure a couple more players in this summer transfer window as he attempts to replace the injured Vincent Kompany, while he also has a number of young players who need first team experience under their belts at Eastlands. City have already signed up 19-year old defender Eliaquim Mangala for £32million from Porto and he will be joining the Citizens after he impressed at this summer's Under-20 World Cup, but Pellegrini still has a lot of work to do if he wants to challenge for the Premier League title next season. City have also been linked with a £30million move for Sporting Lisbon left-back Fabio Coentrao as they look to replace the injured Gael Clichy, while they are reportedly considering a bid worth £40million for Atletico Madrid forward Diego Costa. Pellegrini also has to sign up a new striker this summer after Sergio Aguero and Mario Balotelli failed to find the back of the net in 12 games last season, but it seems City will not be signing Eto'o as he wants to remain with Barcelona for another year.
