The German Club is an organisation run at the University of Nottingham, which organises various events to celebrate German culture. It has about 50 members . A spokesman for Friends of Holocaust Memorial Day in Nottingham added: 'We are extremely disappointed that this use of a Nazi SS lightning bolt symbol was deemed appropriate by those who decided it should appear on the poster advertising a German club night. 'Their actions were disrespectful and upsetting, particularly as these symbols have long been associated with antisemitism. 'While they may not realise this at present, they are not only causing hurt but also damaging relations between different groups within society.' Scroll down for video .
