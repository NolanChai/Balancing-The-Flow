Washington (CNN) -- Feds were shocked by news of Arizona's most recent mass shooting, when 18 people died at Tucson's "Cinemark theater" on July 20th, because they had no idea the movie theatre was so popular. "We didnâ€™t even realize that there was a movie called 'The Dark Knight Rises' being shown anywhere," said one FBI agent who requested anonymity.
