Wednesday's demolition was part of an $8.5 million renovation to the former hotel where JFK, Jackie Kennedy Onassis and other luminaries once stayed . Six people were killed when a building being demolished collapsed Wednesday and nearly obliterated a historic hotel that once hosted President John F. Kennedy and his glamorous wife Jacqueline, along with other world leaders. The collapse, which occurred just after 8:30 am at the former Hotel Theresa on Lenox Avenue near 125th Street in Harlem, was heard several blocks away, according to police and witnesses . Rescuers scoured the rubble for victims as the sun rose over the city. Workers who were inside when the building collapsed escaped through a second-floor window, but six people died: three men, ages 64, 78 and 25; two women, ages 53 and 54; and another woman who was only described as 'elderly.' Police said it appeared that a number of the workers may have been in an office on the second floor. A witness told NBC New York that at least five people were buried by debris when the building collapsed Wednesday morning . The four-story building, which was built in 1913 and closed for business in 2011, had a facade of red brick and white trim. Demolition began this month to make way for an $8.5 million renovation that will convert the building into 70 residential units as well as commercial spaces. The 48-room hotel opened on Christmas Day in 1913. In its heyday, the Harlem Renaissance and jazz stars such as Duke Ellington were regular visitors to the hotel . It was once a home away from home for many African Americans who visited New York City during the Harlem Renaissance of the 20th century. Many other notables passed through the doors including Josephine Baker, Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson and Langston Hughes. In 1938, Jackie Kennedy lived there while studying at Columbia University. The hotel's heyday came to an end in the late 1950s as the city became more racially segregated, but it remained open until 2011. Demolition began this month to make way for an $8.5 million renovation that will convert the building into 70 residential units . A former tenant, who was interviewed by NBC News, said he stayed at the hotel as a college student and remembered it being full of life.

The city has said it will take two months to demolish the building, but officials are not sure if they will be able to salvage anything from inside. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission declined to comment on why the historic building was not designated a landmark, as it had been discussed for years.
