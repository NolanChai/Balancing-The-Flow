A police force has raked in over £270,000 in the past year by selling confiscated goods on the online action website ebay. The force, which covers Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, received 1435 items that were considered for sale last year - up from 1070 the previous 12 months. Police forces across England and Wales have raised £6.8million in just two years through selling seized goods on ebay. The site was chosen by police to auction off more than £350,000 of items seized over the past year that were not needed for investigation or evidence purposes. A total of 7166 items have been sold since 2011, including bikes, phones and other electronics - with the force making a profit of more than £690,000 in the two years since it was introduced. In Cambridgeshire, 234 items were put up for sale last year including a pair of 50-inch Sony Bravia TVs that fetched £780 and a PlayStation 3 sold for £175. More than half of the items confiscated by the force in 2012 - 46 per cent to be precise - were mobile phones, which police said made up about one-third of the total value of goods sold. A force spokeswoman said: 'The site enables us to dispose quickly and efficiently of property that is not required for investigation or evidence purposes.' She added: 'It is also a useful source of income for the force which can be put back into frontline services.' Other items were bikes, including a Kawasaki ZX750 and a KTM 1290 Super Duke R. A total of £198 was raised from selling a pair of Dyson hand dryers that cost more than £460 to buy brand new. The police force said it had 'recently' disposed of a computer that was used for online chats with child sex abusers in the UK and abroad. It added: 'This system is very secure, protecting both the officer and victim whilst still ensuring appropriate communication takes place.' Another item to be auctioned off by the force last year included a 'very rare' 1942 BSA Motorbike and sidecar that was seized for no insurance.
