[http://www.cnnstudentnews.com/2011-04-13/livewire.html](http://www.cnnstudentnews.com/2011-04-13/livewire.html) - CNNSI.com . 11:57 a.m. ET, April 13, 2011 . (CNN) -- The world's largest cruise ship is on its way to North America for the first time in a decade. Royal Caribbean International's new "Allure of the Seas" arrived early Wednesday at its home port in Port Everglades, Florida. The 225,000-ton behemoth sails from Fort Lauderdale and is twice the size of the Titanic. The ship features a 10-deck high water park with more than two dozen slides; an ice rink where guests can play hockey or take skating lessons; and Royal Caribbean's first virtual balcony staterooms -- with real views of the sea thanks to a high definition screen that sits behind every balcony window. The 2,700-foot cruise ship has a capacity for more than 5,400 passengers. "It is so big you could probably fit a lot of other ships inside it," said Royal Caribbean's public relations director, Cynthia Martinez. The Allure of the Seas is scheduled to have its maiden voyage on December 16 -- sailing from Fort Lauderdale for Jamaica and Cozumel. Passengers will also be able to book two additional Caribbean itineraries starting in March 2012: a seven-night eastern and western Caribbean sailing as well as an eight night western Caribbean trip.
