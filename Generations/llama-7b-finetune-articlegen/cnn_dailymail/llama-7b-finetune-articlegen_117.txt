> Brían Byrnes was out on bail in December when he crashed his relative’s car into an 80-year-old man.
> A court heard yesterday that Byrnes made up a story about the accident to cover up for his drunken driving, then fled before police arrived at the scene.
> Prosecutor Kyle Dwyer told Judge Joseph Fagan: ‘He was on bail in relation to another matter. He crashed into an 80-year-old man. 'He made it look like there were black ice patches but there weren't.’ > > Police had stopped Byrnes, aged 19 and of no fixed address, on a charge of assaulting his father at the time of the December crash, but he gave them the wrong phone number for his defence solicitor. They found him driving in another relative’s car shortly afterwards.
> He was charged with criminal damage, failing to report an accident involving injury and three counts of dangerous driving on New Year's Day last year. He told Gardaí at the time that he had been driving over 150 miles per hour (241 km/h) when a patch of black ice caused him to lose control of his relative’s car and strike an elderly man in Ballinasloe, Co Galway.
> The judge said Byrnes had told Gardaí: ‘There was no black ice and I would not be driving over 100 miles per hour.’ > > He added that a patch of black ice had been found near the scene where the crash occurred but that it wasn't wide enough to have caused the crash. > Dwyer said Byrnes drove off after Gardaí arrived at the scene and he has since admitted to failing to report an accident involving injury, dangerous driving and criminal damage. He was also convicted for drink-driving last December. > Judge Fagan said that the 80-year-old victim was taken into hospital with a broken hip after Byrnes crashed his car into him. > Byrnes, who has more than 30 previous convictions, pleaded guilty at Galway District Court to dangerous driving and failing to report an accident involving injury on December 28 last year. > He also admitted criminal damage over a series of incidents between July 15 and October 29 last year in Oranmore, Co Galway, which resulted in damage valued at €3,047. Byrnes had previously pleaded guilty to three counts of dangerous driving on January 1 this year for the Ballinasloe crash and was given a six-month suspended jail term and a two-year ban from driving. > Judge Fagan said that Byrnes would be sentenced next month, having been convicted in December last year over an assault charge against his father. Byrnes was also found guilty of criminal damage in relation to an incident at Oranmore in Co Galway on October 29. The judge adjourned the case for sentence at a later date. > Prosecutor Kyle Dwyer said: ‘He has made admissions about that (the December crash). He was charged with assaulting his father but he got away.’ > Garda Inspector Pat Finnerty said there were no convictions against Byrnes for any of the 30 offences. > ‘He was in possession of a vehicle which is subject to an order banning him from driving,’ the inspector added. > He asked Judge Fagan to sentence Byrnes immediately on all charges, saying he had no previous record of good behaviour and that this incident was more serious than anything else previously on his record. 'I am very concerned about the fact there is a vehicle in possession,' he said. . The judge remanded Byrnes in custody until August 23 to allow for a probation report. He will be sentenced at that date, but not before Gardaí have had the chance to testify against him in relation to a separate incident whereby a woman was seriously injured as a result of being assaulted by him in May this year.
