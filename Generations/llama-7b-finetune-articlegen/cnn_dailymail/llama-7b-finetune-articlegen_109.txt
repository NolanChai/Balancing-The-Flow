Los Angeles (CNN) -- California officials said Tuesday they won't arbitrarily free 33,000 inmates and they will submit plans to the federal courts in two weeks specifying ways to remedy prison overcrowding under a U.S. Supreme Court order this week. "There is no magic bullet," state Corrections Secretary James Tilton told reporters during a conference call, but added that "we'll do what we can." The high court on Monday ordered the state to reduce its prison population by more than 30,000 inmates or face fines of nearly $1 million per day until it does. It gave California officials two weeks to come up with a plan for how they will comply with the order. "We'll give you our best effort," Tilton said. "I cannot tell you what I don't know." He added that there is no timetable for the state to release inmates because it depends on how many can be safely let out of prison, and how quickly they can get into rehabilitation programs or supervised release. The state will also have to figure out where the inmates will go while they're released. "This is a very difficult process," said Tilton. "It has not been easy." He said that he did not think the ruling would jeopardize public safety, but conceded there would be some risk involved, as was seen during the riots at Folsom state prison last month in which 23 inmates were killed and 100 more injured. California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said his department will submit a plan to reduce the prison population within two weeks. "The plan is going to have to be done with care," Lockyer told reporters Tuesday, saying there are some violent inmates that could be released who would pose a public safety risk if they were let out of prison before finishing their sentences. He added that his department will work on the plan "in the best interest of the state" and not with an eye toward reducing costs or saving money. The Supreme Court said it will order California to pay fines every day after 120 days, for a total penalty of $80 million if the state does not meet its obligations under a court-ordered settlement. The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by inmates who contended conditions at some prisons violate their Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment. Prison officials said they are worried that letting out more than 30,000 prisoners will lead to an increase in crime -- especially property crimes such as burglaries because the state is releasing parole violators who have been locked up for low-level crimes. But Tilton stressed that many of those being released were already on probation and they will be closely monitored. The prison population in California now stands at 163,000 inmates -- the largest number in the country by far. California also has the highest incarceration rate among all states at 542 per 100,000 people, according to data from the Corrections Department. The court order said California will need to reduce its population within a year to a level that does not exceed 137 percent of prison capacity -- the maximum allowed under the U.S. Constitution. A state official told reporters last week that if the prison population were reduced to 137 percent, it could save the state $400 million per year, and more than $5 billion over five years. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Lockyer said Monday's ruling will have "a significant impact" on California's budget and could lead to major cutbacks in state spending or a tax increase for Californians. He added that the court order should also be seen as a wake-up call by officials in other states, where prison populations are soaring even higher than they are in California. "I hope this ruling will be a warning to everyone," he said. "If we don't get our act together, we're going to have a situation like no one has ever seen before." The state is expected to spend more than $9 billion on prisons next fiscal year -- nearly 10 percent of its total budget and higher than any other expenditure except education. The state may need to tap into some of those funds to cover the fines ordered by the court, although it's not clear how much money will have to be paid. California's prisons are under a federal consent decree mandating improvements in mental health treatment and other services for prisoners. A report last month found that state prison conditions have improved significantly since 1995 because of a series of reforms, but still fail to meet the constitutional standards. Prisoner rights advocates said Monday they were pleased with the ruling, which will bring relief to the thousands of California inmates who are locked up for low-level offenses and could be released if they complete their sentences or finish drug treatment programs. "We've been waiting a very long time," said John Boston, an attorney for prisoners who brought the lawsuit against the state. "It gives us hope." In 2001, California began reducing its prison population by releasing nearly 43,000 inmates as part of a court-ordered settlement with prisoner advocacy groups and to avoid federal sanctions under the decree. Those releases resulted in fewer incidents at some prisons and fewer deaths -- particularly at San Quentin, where 17 prisoners were killed in riots during 2001-2003. But state prison officials said they have been unable to continue releasing large numbers of inmates because the courts ordered them to increase prison security. A spokeswoman for the Corrections Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. Last month, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called for 5,000 new guards and a plan to build a series of new prisons because he said the state is running out of space in its aging facilities that are plagued by overcrowding, riots and violence. The U.S. Supreme Court first ruled in the case in 1972, saying California's prison conditions violated the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment. But officials at the time argued it was too expensive to build new prisons and they were already under court orders to make improvements for prisoners who had been sentenced to death or life terms in solitary confinement. The high court agreed to hear arguments about what constituted "cruel" prison conditions last year, but the justices never heard from California officials because of a settlement agreement between state and prisoner groups. The new ruling means California will have to figure out how to reduce the prison population without simply releasing dangerous inmates who could commit crimes upon release. Officials will also have to work on plans for keeping people on parole under closer supervision, which has been difficult to do in the past because of budget cuts that have reduced state services available for monitoring released prisoners. "You don't want to be releasing a prisoner back into the community who is likely to commit another crime," said Tilton. "I don't think we need to put our heads in the sand and say, 'We're going to let anybody out.'" The ruling came one day after California lawmakers approved an $87 billion state budget for next fiscal year that includes $16 million more for prisons than Schwarzenegger proposed. But Tilton said he does not think the extra funding will be enough and officials will still have to come up with new ways to save money on prison costs. The state has already announced plans to close two of its oldest prisons, which are located in rural areas far from the rest of California's inmates. But that plan has been met with criticism by local officials who say the facilities will be expensive to relocate and it could cost them thousands of jobs if they lose businesses that have grown around the prison towns. Corrections officials also say it will be difficult to find alternative places for more than 2,000 inmates at those prisons. The two prisons are located near Fresno in central California and near Susanville in northern California. They house about 13 percent of all state prisoners. The other prison slated for closure is San Quentin, where about 47 percent of the state's inmate population is currently held. State officials have said they will come up with alternative plans to house those inmates in the future but did not offer any specifics Monday on how that could be done. The budget approved last week by lawmakers includes $105 million to relocate state prisoners who are being housed at county jails because there isn't enough space in California prisons. That's part of a broader effort under way to cut down on prison costs by getting local authorities to take back some of the prisoners they are currently housing for free. Schwarzenegger said he plans to release 15,000 more low-level felons this year and next in an attempt to reduce his budget deficit by about $3 billion. He has also proposed a plan to close up to four state prisons that would save $84 million over the next three years. The plan was
