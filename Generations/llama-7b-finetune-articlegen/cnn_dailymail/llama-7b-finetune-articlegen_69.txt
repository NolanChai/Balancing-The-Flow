But they cared for him in his final days at the Saba Rescue Centre in Saba. The young dog has died and his body is being embalmed to preserve it, after he was found as an emaciated stray on a remote volcanic island off Venezuela's coast. Ol Boy was cared for by rescuers who treated him with the same love they would give their own dogs at the centre in the Caribbean island. 'Ol Boy is so skinny that when you pick him up, you can actually see his ribcage,' said Saba Rescue Centre volunteer Lilian Gonzalez. Scroll down for video . Ol Boy, a stray dog found on a remote volcanic island off Venezuela's coast has died and now will be preserved in embalming fluid to preserve it . A caretaker at the centre holds a bag of medication that was used to treat Ol Boy before his death. The 12-month old puppy weighed only five pounds when he arrived on Saba . 'We knew from day one that there was something wrong with him,' Ms Gonzalez said, adding that she was worried the pup's organs may have been shutting down because of his weak state. The 12-month old puppy weighed only five pounds when he arrived on Saba, an island of just over 1,000 people, from a nearby island of similar size called Maria Chiquita. 'We could tell he was going to be OK,' said volunteer Melanie Schroeter-Koelewijn. She said that the pup's body had become so thin that when she and her husband held him in their arms they could see his rib cage, but they felt there was hope for Ol Boy after seeing that his eyes were shiny and he seemed to have a healthy appetite . But within days, Ms Schroeter-Koelewijn said that Ol Boy began showing signs of illness. The dog's body became bloated as a result of the infection from where one of his legs had been injured or cut, and he was unable to eat for several days. After being treated with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs at an animal hospital in neighbouring St Maarten, the young dog's condition improved. But a few days later, his breathing became shallow, said Ms Gonzalez. 'He was panting hard,' she said. 'The veterinarians thought he might have a heart murmur.' The pup was given more medication for his lungs and then hospitalised in St Maarten, where it was discovered that his organs were shutting down . Ol Boy rests at the Saba Rescue Centre on Sunday after recovering from an injury to one of his paws. He died several days later as a result of organ failure . But he soon developed a fever and died during the night. The pup's body was embalmed overnight so that his organs could be examined, said Ms Schroeter-Koelewijn. An autopsy found that Ol Boy had an ulcer in one of his lungs as well as other abnormalities affecting his liver and kidneys. 'Their bodies just shut down,' she said. She said that the pup's body had become so thin that when she and her husband held him in their arms they could see his rib cage, but they felt there was hope for Ol Boy after seeing that his eyes were shiny and he seemed to have a healthy appetite. 'He loved getting petted,' Ms Schroeter-Koelewijn said. He'll be preserved in embalming fluid so doctors can study what caused the death of this poor pup . The Saba Rescue Centre was founded by two Dutch sisters, who now live on St Maarten and help local volunteers care for stray dogs on Saba, an island that is known for its rugged volcanic landscape. Ms Schroeter-Koelewijn said the centre does not have money to pay for Ol Boy's autopsy but hopes doctors will accept it as a donation in exchange for their services and that of the animal hospital in St Maarten. 'We were all heartbroken,' said Ms Gonzalez, who added that they would continue caring for animals on Saba until there are none left to save.

The centre has treated several sick or injured dogs over the years, including one that needed surgery after getting caught in an electrical wire and another that had been badly burned by acid. Both those animals are doing well. The rescue centre has also sent strays to be adopted on nearby islands, such as Aruba and Curaçao, said Ms Schroeter-Koelewijn. 'We just love them,' she said of the dogs they care for at Saba Rescue Centre. Ol Boy's body was embalmed so that doctors could study what caused the death of this poor pup .
