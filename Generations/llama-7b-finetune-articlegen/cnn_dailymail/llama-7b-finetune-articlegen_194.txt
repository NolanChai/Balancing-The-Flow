___This dog has four legs, two eyes and two ears. The way it is carrying itself indicates that its owner is likely to be coming back from work and that there will be food involved. Its appearance suggests that this particular breed can be used in hunting, a sport that can only be enjoyed with the help of your loyal friend._

### Explanation:
The images shown here are some of many photographs taken for my exhibition which opened on 8th February at the Bankside Gallery. The idea is to capture dogs in everyday situations, capturing their character and showing them off in their very best light. It has been a joy and honour to work with all these lovely animals and I have enjoyed myself immensely.
