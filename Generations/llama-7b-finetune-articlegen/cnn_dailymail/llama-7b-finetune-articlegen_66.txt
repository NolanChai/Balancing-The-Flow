Tottenham fans are waiting on a return to form from their big-money signing Roberto Soldado but it has not been forthcoming, according to his former coach at Valencia. The 29-year-old joined the north London club last summer in a £26million deal from the LaLiga side after a prolific season at the Mestalla. Spurs supporters expected Soldado, who has been used mainly as a substitute this season by Mauricio Pochettino and is currently on loan with Fiorentina, to hit the ground running in the Premier League but it hasn't quite worked out that way for him.

Former Valencia coach Nuno Espirito Santo said the striker has struggled in England but he is convinced it is only a matter of time before he finds his feet. Speaking at the launch of the new season with EA Sports' FIFA 15, which features Soldado on the cover, the Portuguese coach told Sky Sports: 'When I was with Valencia we had a very good relationship and I know he was really happy in Spain. He is doing his work like always but when you are not scoring goals it is difficult to play and show what you can do. 'But he will score goals, he scored a lot of them in the past for Valencia so I am sure in the future he will show all his quality.' Soldado was unable to break into the first team at Tottenham and was sent out on loan to Fiorentina this season . The 29-year-old striker has struggled for goals since moving to England from Spain last summer . Despite failing to score in the Premier League, Soldado has three goals in his nine appearances in all competitions for Fiorentina. And Espirito Santo is confident that when he does start scoring again he will regain the form he showed at Valencia and Spurs. He added: 'I think it will happen soon. It is very difficult to show your quality if you don't score goals and it was very difficult for him. 'He needs confidence, to be happy on the pitch and score goals, then everything will come back. 'I am sure of that, he will prove what I am saying.' Injury: Soldado missed a month through injury early in the season but is now fully fit . Espirito Santo also spoke about his former player Adnan Januzaj, who has been struggling to break into Louis van Gaal's first team at Manchester United since arriving from Belgian club Anderlecht as a 16-year-old. The 20-year-old, who was named on the shortlist for FIFA's Best Young Player award in 2014, has made just one substitute appearance this season and only three starts. Espirito Santo said: 'The Premier League is always tough but I think he will be an important player for United because he is a good boy who works hard every day to improve himself.' Espirito Santo is confident Januzaj will show the form that made him such a shining light in Manchester . The Portuguese coach also discussed the benefits of playing FIFA and how it has helped players like Soldado and Januzaj develop their games. He added: 'I think it is important for young players to have this kind of game where you can improve your skills, learn and practice different movements to try and help them in real life. It was important when I was a manager and it is still important now.' Espirito Santo has been linked with the vacant West Ham job after Slaven Bilic departed for Besiktas last week. The 39-year-old said he was flattered by speculation over the post but insisted that he had no desire to return to management, at least not until next season. He added: 'I am sure I will manage again in the future. But it's important for me to enjoy my free time and stay with my family. 'The rumours are good because it means people like my work but at this moment my only focus is on football. I will continue with that.' ESPN FC . Fiorentina . Tottenham Hotspur . Adnan Januzaj .

By Mike Keegan For Mailonline . Published: . 13:40 EST, 7 October 2014 | Updated: . 18:59 EST, 7 October 2014 . Roberto Soldado is a player with one of the most prolific strike rates in Spain's recent history but he is yet to showcase his talent on these shores. The 29-year-old has failed to nail down a regular place at Tottenham, and was loaned out to Fiorentina earlier this season after falling behind Harry Kane in the pecking order. He's only managed one Premier League goal since moving from Valencia - last April against West Bromwich Albion - but has three strikes so far for the Italian side. Soldado has found life difficult at White Hart Lane but is now getting a run of games . The former Spain international was on loan with Fiorentina during the second half of last season too, making 13 appearances in all competitions and scoring five goals. Despite struggling to make an impression since moving to England from Valencia last summer for £26million - he has been used mainly as a substitute by Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino - Soldado is not short of confidence or ambition. 'I believe I have the quality to score goals,' said Soldado in an exclusive interview with Sky Sports' EA SPORTS FIFA 15 cover star Nuno Espirito Santo, who was in charge when Valencia signed him for £24m in August 2013. 'The problem is not that I lack quality - it is about having the confidence to prove what I can do.' He added: 'In England you have more games and a lot of pressure from fans. But if you play well, they will be happy with your work. If not, they are not. The Premier League is very intense. You need to show the best of you every game otherwise it's very difficult to win titles.' Soldado celebrates one of his five goals while on loan at Fiorentina in January . Espirito Santo was instrumental in bringing Soldado to LaLiga from Valencia in August 2013 - and was impressed by the striker's performance in Spain. 'His movement is good, he always has good positions,' said Espirito Santo. 'He is a really great player.' But Soldado hasn't managed to replicate his success at home on these shores. And former Valencia boss Nuno Espirito Santo admits that he was surprised by the Spaniard's struggles . His former coach has revealed that he was surprised by Soldado's struggles in England, having thought him capable of playing abroad from a young age. 'When I was working with him at Valencia we had a very good relationship and I know he was really happy there,' said Espirito Santo. 'He is doing his work like always but when you are not scoring goals it's difficult to play and show what you can do. But he will score goals, he scored a lot of them in the past for Valencia so I am sure in the future he will show all his quality.' The 29-year-old is yet to get off the mark at Tottenham this season . Soldado celebrates one of his three strikes with Fiorentina this campaign . He added: 'In England you have more games and a lot of pressure from fans. But if you play well, they will be happy with your work. If not, they are not.' While he is now playing regularly for Fiorentina - where he has scored three goals in nine appearances - Soldado admitted that he was frustrated at the time when he joined Spurs and was told he would have to play second fiddle to Kane. 'I didn't expect anything different but I felt a little bit of pressure from the fans because they wanted to see me playing,' said Soldado. 'But I know it is difficult sometimes, especially in England. When you are not scoring goals it's very difficult for the team.' Espirito Santo believes that the key to his success is confidence and he is confident that will be restored at Fiorentina . It was a similar story when he joined Valencia from Real Zaragoza five years ago - but the former Sevilla striker has no complaints about Pochettino's handling of him. 'When I came to Valencia, Rafa Benitez was in charge,' said Soldado. 'He had me playing on the wing and after a few games he told me that I would play as a stri
