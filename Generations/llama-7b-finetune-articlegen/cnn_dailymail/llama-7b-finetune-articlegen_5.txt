I don’t see why we should be bothered about how a footballer is feeling – I would think any football fan would want to know that their team are 100% committed and at the peak of their fitness, so that they have every chance of winning on match day. This article makes me question whether England have given up on this game already, as Sterling’s comment suggests a lack of commitment from the whole squad.
