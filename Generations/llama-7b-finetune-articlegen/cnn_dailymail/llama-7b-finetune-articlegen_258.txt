The president said he takes "full responsibility" for the problems with the website and insisted that fixing it is his job. However, he also pointed a finger at some of his Cabinet members when asked about his inability to keep Congress informed about the problems. "I think they should have been able to anticipate the fact that the website wasn't going to work," he said. "The website itself wasn't working and so it wasn't giving us the full set of numbers, but we could see anecdotally people having difficulty." Obama said that he was told repeatedly by his team at Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius that they were making progress fixing problems with the website. "When I found out about the website not working," he said, "I thought it would be fixed within a day or two . . . [but] I was wrong." Obama also insisted that he had no idea who at HHS was responsible for the rollout of the site. When asked why Sebelius wasn't fired immediately, the president said she should not have been blamed for not knowing the details about the website herself. "If you ask Kathleen . . . to describe in a nutshell what went on with this rollout," he said, "she wouldn't be able to give that description." He said his team had made mistakes and would continue making them. "I take responsibility for it," Obama said, "and we're going to fix it." Asked about his credibility with the American public, Obama said: "Obviously, I think everybody would like for me to be able to wave a magic wand and say, 'It will all get fixed,' . . . But what I can promise is that the problems are being rectified. We're going to go ahead and make sure it works as soon as possible." But he also said: "What we cannot do is simply ignore problems because they don't recast themselves every two years." The president took questions for more than an hour, but made no mention of the latest Obamacare controversy – that insurance companies are discriminating against older Americans. Instead, the president focused his attention on a range of other topics including the threat posed by Syria to Israel and Iran's nuclear program. "I think we can be confident," he said when asked if Israel could take out Syria's chemical weapons stockpile without American help. The president also reaffirmed that, should Assad use those weapons against his own people or a neighboring country such as Israel, the U.S. would respond militarily. "As long as I am president," he said, "the United States will do what we must to prevent this from happening." On Iran's nuclear program, Obama made clear that sanctions against Tehran are not off the table as part of negotiations for a deal – and he insisted the U.S. is prepared to walk away if they don't like what it gets in return. "I don't want to put the pressure on Iran to get them back to the table, just because I think we need to have that discussion," he said of potential talks with Tehran. "If, in fact, sanctions are not effective or Iran is unwilling to take a reasonable deal and give up its nuclear weapons, then my administration will be the first to say so." The president also had an answer for critics who've said he has failed to achieve many of his 2008 campaign promises. "I think that we're seeing the gains that I spoke about four years ago," he said when asked by a reporter if he was a one-term president. But, the president admitted that the recent rollout problems have damaged the trust Americans have in him and his administration. "My No. 1 job is to make sure that the American people feel like their government works for them again," Obama said. "And there are going to be times where we mess up or don't get it right." He added: "But I think what the American people understand is that in this country, we can fix our problems."
