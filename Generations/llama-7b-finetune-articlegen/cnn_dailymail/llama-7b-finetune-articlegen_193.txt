At the end of first grade, 7 year old Cameron Halley, an easy going, cheerful little boy from a tiny rural town in Western Washington, suddenly didn't want to go to school anymore. He started saying things like "I wish I was never born." He said that he hated himself and his life. His parents thought he might be depressed until they talked with one of his teachers who mentioned some troubling bullying incidents during recess breaks. Cameron would often come home from school crying about other kids pushing him or shoving him around and making fun of him. When asked why, Cameron said it was because they called him a "retard" and made fun of his special education program which he received due to a speech impediment that impaired his pronunciation of certain letters like "R". At school, Cameron's teachers had decided to use the nickname "C-Lo" rather than "Cam" in hopes of avoiding bullying incidents. But even though they thought it was working at first, some kids started calling him that as well and the bullying soon escalated to physical violence. Cameron said he wanted to end his life so bad that when he woke up one day after school, he didn't want breakfast and just went straight back to sleep. His parents were terrified at this point but decided it was best not to tell anyone about what happened because they thought it might be the beginning of a suicide attempt or maybe even an actual suicide itself. When Cameron didn't wake up the next morning, his parents rushed him off to see their doctor who told them that he had passed away during the night and there was nothing they could do about it because he hadn't taken any medication or anything else that might have contributed towards his death except for an inhaler which wasn't prescribed by anyone so they couldn't take responsibility for his passing away. Cameron's parents were devastated but knew there had been no foul play involved since they found out he hadn't taken any medication or anything else that might have contributed to his death except for an inhaler which wasn't prescribed by anyone so they couldn't take responsibility for his passing away. Cameron's funeral was held at the same time as his wake, which took place just days before Christmas. The whole town came out to see him off with many people shedding tears and hugs from all over town. Afterwards, Cameron's family decided to start a foundation called "The Cam Halley Foundation" in order to help other kids who are bullied because of their special needs or any other reason. In addition they started an annual fundraiser which raises money for families with children like Cameron who suffer from speech impairments due to an untreated case of stuttering. The foundation has raised over $250,000 in its first year alone and is set up as a non-profit organization run by volunteers and donations so 100% goes towards helping children like Cameron who suffer from speech impairments due to an untreated case of stuttering. Cameron's parents hope that someday soon enough other people will be able to tell their story without having it end tragically like this one did but until then, they plan on carrying on the legacy left by their son so long ago when he was still just a boy named "Cameron Halley".
