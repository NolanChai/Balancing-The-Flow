The Internet, it seems, may soon reach its limit and cause major problems to many people who use it everyday. The problem that comes with this is that there will be no more free space left for other users to store their data online. So if you are an internet user then this information is very important. The reason why the Internet is running out of space is that there are more and more devices that people are using to browse the World Wide Web. It has been estimated that in 2016 alone, 75 exabytes of data have already been created and 24 billion gigabytes of this were video traffic. This information was obtained by Cisco, a leading company in technology. According to them, they have calculated that the amount of traffic on the internet will double every three years and in the next 10 years there would be a need for at least four times more space than what is available now.

### Conclusion:
This information has been very important as it has shown us the problems that could occur if we don't do anything about this matter. The experts are suggesting that one of the ways to prevent these problems from happening would be through increasing bandwidth. They have also suggested other solutions such as reducing traffic and increasing efficiency. If nothing is done, there could soon be a shortage of space on the internet which could cause technical problems for many people.
