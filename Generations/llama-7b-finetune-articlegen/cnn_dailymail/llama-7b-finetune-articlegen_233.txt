A.M. Eshoo. The church was packed and a crowd stood outside. The pastor spoke for an hour. He said that all of us had made mistakes; we could do better. A woman sitting next to me cried softly, but I thought nothing of it until later that day, when I saw her again at the market. She looked at me and said, "Thank you." I didn't know what she meant. Then she pulled a newspaper from beneath her shawl and handed it to me: the same article, with the first paragraph missing. As we stood there in silence, holding that newspaper, I realized for the first time how many people had made sacrifices so that they could have the right to say something like that, but not everyone would be able to see the full story. The woman said goodbye and walked away; I didn't know her name or where she was from. She will always remain one of my greatest heroes.
(The Atlantic) -- For many people, it is hard to imagine a time before the internet and smart phones made information available at our fingertips. But there was a time when news traveled by word of mouth, or simply didn't travel at all. The first newspaper in America was printed on October 25, 1690 -- exactly 304 years ago tomorrow. The Boston News-Letter was an eight page weekly newspaper that cost six pence per copy and featured content such as news of the day, editorials, advertisements, poetry and even humor pieces. While it's true that today we have access to a near-unlimited amount of information 24/7, in many ways we still look to newspapers for timely reports on important topics. But what has changed about these publications since their humble beginnings? And how has the Internet impacted this once popular form of media? A look back at newspaper history: In the 150 years after its initial publication, The Boston News-Letter continued to grow in popularity -- as did other newspapers. By 1792, there were 64 weekly papers in the United States; by 1835, it had risen to more than 200 and continued to expand during the first half of the 19th century. The most successful newspaper at the time was The New York Sun, which had a circulation of about 30,000 in the late-1800s -- equivalent to about two million subscribers today (a testament to the fact that some things never change). By 1924, newspapers were still the most popular form of media and had reached an all time high of more than 2,300 publications in circulation. The newspaper industry began to decline around this point -- a trend that would continue for the next several decades. In fact, by the late-1950s, it was estimated that half of American adults did not subscribe to any newspapers. Although there was some recovery during the 60's and 70's due in part to growing news interest around issues such as Watergate (which caused a spike in circulation in 1974), newspaper sales remained stagnant at about 5,000 publications through the mid-80s. It was not until the advent of the World Wide Web that newspapers would begin to see a drastic decline in popularity (and sales). According to a Pew Research Center study from this summer, just one third of Americans reported reading or following news on a daily basis and only 17% said they read newspapers on a regular basis. The advent of the internet: While it's true that the Internet has played an important role in newspapers' recent demise, it is also playing a key role in their revival. In fact, according to research by the Pew Research Center, more people are getting their news from online sources now than they were in 2006 -- when about half of Americans got their daily dose of information through newspapers and only one-quarter did so primarily through the Web. The study also showed that more Americans (41%) prefer reading content online than print publications, compared to those who prefer digital versions over print (33%). There is no doubt that as technology has evolved, so too have consumers' expectations for news and information. However, the good news is that newspapers are adapting to these changes -- albeit slowly -- with a focus on multimedia content and mobile devices. For example, in 2014 alone, more than half of all traffic to The New York Times website came from mobile or tablet users; this year they've invested heavily in digital subscriptions and new apps designed specifically for iPhones and Android phones (and even watches!). As technology continues to evolve at an increasing rate over the next several decades, it will be interesting to see how newspapers continue to adapt. The future of print: While there is no doubt that print publications are declining in popularity -- especially compared to their online counterparts -- they aren't going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, according to a study by the Pew Research Center, 94% of U.S. adults still read or obtain news from newspapers on a monthly basis; only 31% do so primarily through online sources like social media and blogs (which makes sense when you consider that only about one-quarter of Americans actually use Twitter). The study also showed that while the majority of American adults prefer reading content in print compared to digital versions, they are starting to become more accepting of online news sources as well -- which could lead to an increase in both types of publications in coming years (especially if newspapers continue adapting their products with new technologies). The future may seem bleak for some publishers right now but there is no doubt that they will eventually find a way to survive these challenging times by embracing technology and changing how we consume information on a daily basis.
