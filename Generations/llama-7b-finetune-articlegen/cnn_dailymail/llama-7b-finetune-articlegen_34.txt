The Dandie's style is in a league of its own, and one that could never be emulated by anyone outside the country of their birth - and even then only if they had spent enough years living there to learn about it. It's true, the Dandies are always impeccably dressed from head to toe - all 184 inches of them - and they always wear outfits that have been painstakingly matched according to a strict code of fashion etiquette that was set by the nation’s elders thousands of years ago. The Dandies were the only people in their homeland who had access to such exquisite clothing, which was often made from the hides of rare animals. They would spend long periods of time hunting in order to ensure they always had enough supplies to make sure that no matter what season it was, they were never wearing less than three outfits at a time. But now that the Dandie’s homeland has been invaded by another culture - one which is much more interested in spending its spare time watching sport rather than hunting and making clothes - the Dandies have been forced to spend many years trying to adapt their traditional ways of dressing so that they can fit into the new society. With a population that has risen from 13,000 to nearly 6 million in the past two decades, there are now an estimated 700 Dandies living in this country of which very few actually belong there - and even those who do, only speak about half the languages that the invaders speak. It has become a common occurrence for these people to be mistaken for being from another culture entirely simply because of how they choose to dress. They often find themselves in situations where they are unable to communicate with others around them due to their unfamiliarity with the language, and they will also end up getting into arguments with people who assume that they're not actually Dandies at all - which is usually a case of mistaken identity based on appearance alone. The result? These poor misunderstood individuals will spend years in self-imposed isolation before finally giving up on their culture and returning to the only thing that they know how to do well: make clothes from the hides of rare animals.
