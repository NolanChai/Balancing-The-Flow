By . Sophie Jones Evans . She has worked in farming for almost four decades - and is patron of nearly 50 organisation's in the British countryside.

The royal opened up at a reception held for staff working on NT-owned farms and the charity's agricultural committee. Scroll down for video . Happy: Princess Anne was speaking at a reception last night in Cheshire . Ahead of the event, the 62-year-old told the crowd how she was 'embarrassed' by her lack of experience with animals, as she prepared to meet them at NT farm Gawsworth Hall near Macclesfield. She said: 'I was actually asked recently, I had a lecture on agriculture in which we had a question and answer session afterwards, and someone asked me - what is the one thing you can't do on a farm? And my answer was that I couldn't milk a cow or muck out a stable. The problem with that of course is I'm patron of nearly 50 organisations.' The Princess Royal (pictured right) is patron of almost 50 different groups, including the National Trust . A keen rider, she took on the role as honorary president of the British Horse Society in 1987 and has since visited many equestrian centres . She also admitted her own 'embarrassment' at not being able to help with farm animals when she was called upon to do so. The princess, who is also patron of the National Trust itself, was speaking after meeting some of its tenants involved in farming and agriculture and visiting the 18th century Cheshire property which was bought by the Trust in 2012. She said: 'I'm sure there are other people here who have been asked to do something and they're not sure how to go about it - I know I have. It's embarrassing, but that is one of the problems with being a patron.' The Princess Royal has visited Gawsworth Hall several times over the years as she supports the National Trust . 'It was my father who inspired me': She said her love for horses came from an early age, when she accompanied the Queen on holiday in 1957 and rode along the beach with her father . The princess is also patron of many other charities, including the Countryside Alliance and the Royal Show Society. During a visit to Cheshire Farm Business Club's farm at Gawsworth Hall near Macclesfield yesterday she said: 'I was actually asked recently, I had a lecture on agriculture in which we had a question and answer session afterwards, and someone asked me - what is the one thing you can't do on a farm? And my answer was that I couldn't milk a cow or muck out a stable. The problem with that of course is I'm patron of nearly 50 organisations.' 'It's embarrassing, but that is one of the problems with being a patron,' she added. In her first visit to Gawsworth Hall since it was taken over by the Trust, the princess also saw demonstrations of traditional farming skills and met staff involved in activities such as bee keeping. The princess has been working as a royal patron for almost 30 years . She is pictured above with her daughter Zara Philips (right) in 1983 when she was just three months old . In another visit, the princess toured the farm's kitchen garden to see the Trust's efforts to promote and restore historic varieties of fruit and vegetables. She also met some of its tenant farmers at a reception before leaving Gawsworth Hall for London last night where she was due to attend another event celebrating her 60th birthday yesterday evening. The princess, who has been a royal patron for almost 30 years, said it was the National Trust's support of British farming which drew her to the charity in the first place. 'It was my father who inspired me,' she told the BBC. She continued: 'I used to go on holiday with him when I was little and we went round the country - and he would always make a point of stopping off at various farmhouses, and then going for long rides in the countryside.' A keen horsewoman, she took on the role as honorary president of the British Horse Society in 1987. She has also visited many equestrian centres over the years - including one near Gawsworth Hall which she opened in 2004 with the Duchess of Cornwall and The Queen . Her visits to farms and stables have often been met by protests from animal rights groups who say the royal family should not support farming. In November 2013, the National Trust was accused of 'hypocrisy' for inviting Princess Anne to open a horse training centre which uses riding as a form of therapy for autistic children in the grounds of its Gloucestershire estate - while continuing to run its own dairy herd. The NT was criticised by animal rights group PETA for still running its own herds at various properties including Gawsworth Hall . The National Trust has said it will reduce its reliance on beef production in the future as demand declines and prices increase, but added that it would keep a few herds of cattle to maintain historic farming traditions.

The 62-year-old was speaking after visiting one of the Trust's tenants, Cheshire Farm Business Club, which runs its farm at Gawsworth Hall near Macclesfield and also uses part of it to hold events for businesses and schools. She said she had been impressed by the work done there in promoting 'good husbandry skills'. The princess has often faced protests over her association with the National Trust as an animal rights group claimed the charity should not support farming at all . During her visit to Gawsworth Hall yesterday, the princess also met staff involved in bee keeping and traditional farming . She said: 'It's quite impressive what they do. They take young people up here - from schools or colleges - and they show them how to handle animals properly. 'They get them used to handling cattle and sheep and cows, and then they give them some advice about different careers that might be possible in agriculture.' The princess also met with the Trust's tenants involved in farming and agriculture and visited Gawsworth Hall's 18th century farmhouse . Last year, she was among those criticised for attending a reception at Battersea Park in London which raised money for an eventing charity whose riders competed using horses from a trusted breeder who has been found guilty of animal cruelty. The princess was pictured here with a horse which she helped to name during the visit . The National Trust is among several organisations including the RSPB, WWF and Badger Watch UK who have drawn criticism for accepting money or support from the farming industry - despite promoting themselves as campaigners against cruelty to animals. It was also criticised in 2012 after it emerged that its tenants were using an animal feed which included fishmeal sourced from a plant in China where animals are crushed alive before being used to make fish feed . Last year, the Trust defended its decision to hold the event at Battersea Park last October despite one of the charity's riders being found guilty of animal cruelty. The charity which raises money for competitors in equestrian sport had been criticised before for receiving financial support from a trusted breeder who was found to be supplying horses with serious welfare issues . In 2013, the National Trust also came under fire after it emerged that its tenants were using an animal feed which included fishmeal sourced from a plant in China where animals are crushed alive before being used to make fish feed. The Trust had previously said that it was considering taking steps to cut out this source of protein - but by the end of 2013, it still had not done so . In October last year, PETA criticised the National Trust for holding a fundraising event in London despite its tenants being involved with an animal charity which included one of their riders who was found guilty of animal cruelty. It said: 'PETA is calling on the National Trust to think twice before it associates itself with groups that are involved in or supportive of animal exploitation.' The charity's tenants had been criticised for using an animal feed which included fishmeal from a plant where animals were crushed alive . And last year, PETA also highlighted the Trust's continued association with a breeder who was found guilty of cruelty to horses. It said: 'The fact that the National Trust has not severed ties with this breeder is particularly disturbing since it holds itself out as an animal welfare charity.' The charity added that in 2012, one of the breeder's horses was found to have been trained using a 'bullhook',
