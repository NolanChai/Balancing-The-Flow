The plane was allowed to take off after the woman claimed the baby wasn't hers and her husband showed up at the gate with the real mother. (CNN) -- A Beijining-bound United Airlines flight returned to Washington's Dulles International Airport Thursday evening because of a child custody investigation. "The passenger said that the baby is not her baby," United spokeswoman Christen David told Cnn. "We've had to delay this plane until we have proof that she was indeed the mother of that child, and the authorities could confirm it." The woman on board, identified as Diana Lovejoy, was arrested in the Newark Liberty International Airport after trying to claim the 2-month-old boy as her own. A short time later, Lovejoy's husband showed up at the gate with the baby's real mother and had the child taken away by Child Protective Services. "The woman on that plane has been arrested for parental kidnapping," said Tom Davis, a spokesperson for the Newark Police Department in New Jersey. The airline would not comment on whether Lovejoy was detained as well. David said the incident occurred after the flight crew announced it had to return because of a "security issue." When they landed again in Dulles, all passengers disembarked and were reassigned to other flights. Airport officials say they're still working on rescheduling those people's trips. The plane is now being searched by police, according to the airline. Lovejoy was arrested Thursday evening in New Jersey and was later released. She was not allowed to re-board her flight after she was taken into custody, United Airlines said. "We don't know if we're going to be able to get this plane back," David added. Copyright 2012 CNN.
