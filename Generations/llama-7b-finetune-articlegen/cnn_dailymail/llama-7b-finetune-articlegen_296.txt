As the club prepares to play in front of an expected bumper crowd at Coventry's Ricoh Arena tonight, the new neighbours have already complained about the noise coming from the ground. Coventry City Council confirmed that it had received three complaints since the start of the season - which began on August 24 with a 2-1 defeat by Exeter City. The first came at half time during Wasps' 3-0 win over Bristol Rovers in their opening home game, with the second on Tuesday night after their 3-1 loss to Swindon Town and the third last weekend when they beat Cheltenham. A spokeswoman for the council said: 'Coventry City Council has received complaints about noise levels at Wasps matches so far this season, three in total. 'These have all been dealt with by our officers on duty. The club is aware of the issues and is taking steps to deal with them.' Wasps' general manager for rugby Tim Ryan said: 'The club has a good working relationship with Coventry City Council and we have put procedures into place to address any problems. We want to ensure that every supporter enjoys their experience at a Wasps game, and the Ricoh Arena provides the perfect atmosphere for Wasps matches.' The council said noise levels from games had been monitored in recent years but no formal complaints were made this time last year until fans became more vocal about the issue. Coventry City Council's assistant director of community services Mark Cockerill added: 'There are strict rules in place about noise and we always encourage supporters to follow them.'
