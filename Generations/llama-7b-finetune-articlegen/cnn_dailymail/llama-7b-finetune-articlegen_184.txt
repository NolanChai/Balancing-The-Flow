Turkey's Justice and Development Party, also known as AKP, was founded by Recep Tayyip Erdogan who is the 13th Prime Minister of Turkey. He is a popular Turkish politician with Islamist views. According to reports, women in Turkey were not allowed to wear short clothes before he became prime minister and were supposed to be covered from head to toe including their face. But now things are different in Turkey; men and women can wear whatever they like and enjoy the freedom of expression which is a sign of a free country. The AKP government has also made laws for the protection of women rights. The number of women politicians have increased because of Erdogan's visionary leadership.
### Discussion: 
1) Does this article show that Turkey is indeed becoming more 'westernized'? How do you think that will affect Turkish culture in general, and their relations with the rest of the world?
2) The AKP has made a lot of changes to Turkey which are positive for women. Do you believe these changes are truly representative of modern Turkey or merely a political tactic by Erdogan to increase his popularity among women voters (and thus, votes)? What other evidence can be given in support of this?
3) Do you think that it is good for women to have more opportunities and choices in politics? Why/why not?
