'The man with the face whisk' refused to give evidence in court after being arrested for assaulting a police officer during the June 2012 anti-government demonstration . He was released on bail but did not testify at his trial last week because he has been charged over an assault committed in another protest on August 4.

However, it later emerged that there were photos on social media showing Wong wearing no mask and with no injuries.

The party was formed by activist Martin Lee to offer an alternative political voice to the more hardline Occupy Central group .
