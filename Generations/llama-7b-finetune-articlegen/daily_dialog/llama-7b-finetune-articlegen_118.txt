I can't believe you bought those hideous things! They are so ugly. And, I don't even see the point of them. You have to put them on just for a walk? Do they really make you feel better or something? How is it possible that we're related? I swear sometimes I think there must be an alien in my closet because how can two people come from the same gene pool and have such completely different taste!
