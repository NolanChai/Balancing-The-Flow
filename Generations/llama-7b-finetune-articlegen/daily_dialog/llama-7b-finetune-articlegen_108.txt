The man is staring at me.I guess he doesn't know who I am. I smile, not expecting him to recognize me, and say:

"Well, well, well." He smiles back.

"Don't I know you?" 

"Not sure, do I look familiar?" 

"Yes!" 

"Oh! You're Mr. Stevenson, right? I remember you," he says and turns around to point to a woman sitting beside him. "And you are Miss Jones." She nods with her eyes closed.
