- "I hope the food is good." - "It was, but the service could use some work." - "How are things with the kids?" - "The same as always, lots of fighting and whining. And I still don't understand why they need so much toys." - "They just like them. They get attached to them. Don't you remember when you used to play with your little bear? Or that doll that got lost somewhere in the house?" - "I did, but I don't want my kids to grow up and start playing with stuffed animals and such." - "It doesn't hurt to be nice to them. It would make life easier for both of you." - "Like I said, it doesn't bother me as long as they play by themselves in their room or when they go out somewhere." - "I do the same thing with my kids and you can see that they are well behaved." - "They were only kids once. You should enjoy this time because things will never be like this again." - "I know, I just need to relax a bit more." - "Well, when your wife comes back from work, try not to worry too much about the little things and just let her do whatever she wants with the children. Maybe that would help you get some peace of mind." - "That's good advice."
