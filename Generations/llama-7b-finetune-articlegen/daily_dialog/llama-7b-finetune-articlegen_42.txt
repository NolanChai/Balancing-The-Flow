It's hard to imagine anything but a cat being worried about being left alone in a brick oven. But hey, maybe your son's boyfriend has been doing it for years and he thinks this time will be different? Or is this about something else entirely? What does 'grown up' mean here? It means that we are in the middle of a story where a 9-year old girl talks like a 40 year old woman. But how did she get there? (And what do you think about that?) You don’t need to explain why he hasn’t been back for an hour. The dialog is all about your concerns and his lack of concern. (Unless this was supposed to be about the boyfriend.)
