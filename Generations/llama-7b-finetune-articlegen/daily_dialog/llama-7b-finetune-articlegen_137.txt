I don’t like watching anything where the characters are trying to get famous. The show I want to watch is American Idol, but that show already has enough people who can sing and dance. I want someone on there that knows how to play an instrument and not be a complete idiot.

I guess I’ll have to watch Ally McNeal, then.

"What ’ s on TV tonight ? Not much, that new reality-TV show Ally McNeal, oooo, Dark Angel."
"Wait a second. I want to watch Ally Mcneal."
"Oh, come on. That's such a girl's show." 
"No it's not. It's just funny."
"Yeah, if you're a girl." 
"Well, you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl." 
"That's not true. Dark Angel is a good show." 
"It's story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits."
