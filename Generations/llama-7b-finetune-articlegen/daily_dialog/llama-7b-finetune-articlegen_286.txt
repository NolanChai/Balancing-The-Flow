I hope the instructions are clear. Let me know if there is anything unclear about them or what I missed.

1. I think you can rephrase this sentence, "What would you like to know, Mr. Green?", as something like,"Tell me how you wish for me to continue with my dialogue."
2. I think you should separate the sentences. First, you have a description of his previous work experience and then you ask him about it. You should change the question order or at least have the sentence "In 2004, I got a job in the sales department..." as a new paragraph.
3. I think the last sentence would sound better if you added an _ing_ verb to describe what he is doing. Also, don't forget that you should capitalize names.
