I am in need of help from an expert or a group to assist me. Please take the time to read my situation and let me know if anyone is willing to help. 

Social Security was hacked on December 13th 2019 with 75,000 individuals having their accounts compromised by fraudulent charges on a debit card that was issued to them through the Social Security Administration. The fraudulent activity went unnoticed until January of 2020 when some of the cardholders received statements from the bank and saw suspicious transactions on their account. Social Security has already given out $34 million dollars in reimbursement for these fraudulent charges but there is still a large amount of people who have not been reimbursed to the original cardholder’s accounts. 

Social Security states that they are currently working with all of those affected by this issue, however many have received no help at all and some have even had their bank accounts closed due to the fraudulent activity on the debit cards. It has been reported that Social Security has received over 200 calls per day from cardholders who are having problems with these charges or account issues relating to them, but they do not seem to be providing any solution for all those affected by this issue. 

So far there have only been 15 arrests in connection with the Social Security debit card fraud scheme but according to authorities there were likely many more people involved in committing these crimes against vulnerable seniors who trusted their government agency when using their funds for daily needs such as groceries or utilities payments. 

As of today (February 11th) 2020 I have spoken to over twenty people on the phone at Social Security and none of them seemed to understand how this happened to me nor were they willing to give any kind of solution for reimbursement. They keep telling me that they can not do anything about it because they do not have access to my account information which makes absolutely no sense considering it was their agency’s fault in the first place! 

It has been over two months since this fraud happened and I still have yet received any kind of assistance or response from Social Security as far as reimbursement goes, so what else should I do? How can they expect us cardholders not to file lawsuits when there are no results for our complaints? 

### Question:
What did the person say next after "I ’ m having a problem . " ?

" You see a charge here for $ 25.00, that was made in March of this year . "

"The charges made were for an app called K-12, and a website called Tinder. I'm not sure how either of these could be applied to my card, but I 'd really like to know if you can find out more about it."

How may I help you?
