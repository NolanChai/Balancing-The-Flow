" Sure . Why not ? "

" Great . Then let's go there and pick out some ice cream . Let's try that new brand of ice cream they just started making . It has all kinds of different flavors . I think it's the best ice cream in the world . "

"We could have a big dinner tonight at that place . "

" That would be nice . We should order early though , so we don't wait too long to get our food . I'm not sure they can seat large groups very fast . "

" Let me go and reserve us some tables right now . Maybe when we have the resturant all to ourselves, we can sit back, relax and watch a movie on TV while we eat . We could rent something from Blockbuster or Video Ezy today . It would be fun ! "

" Sounds great , but let's wait until after dinner before we get our movies . I don't want to have to rush back here tonight with our food still in the car if it isn't ready yet when we leave . "
