Henry checked a small suitcase, opened it and took out some clothes for his wife to see how they would look on her body. The young boy was quite excited. The women put on one of them, and felt that she looked like a fashion model when she was wearing the new dress. The boy seemed pleased with his gift. "What ' s your name ? " asked the woman. Henry replied: " My name is Henry Smith ."

The woman said: "Oh my dear Henry Smith ! What an exciting day it's been for me! First you were a custom official, and now I am dressed like a fashion model!" The boy smiled and nodded with satisfaction."
