He just turned 6 last weekend !    
It was his birthday . He had a great time playing with friends. 
Who is looking after him ? My mother-in-law . She retired last year and moved here to stay with us .  
My mom moved into our home when she retired so I could keep her active .   
My parents have been looking after my son since he was born . They love doing things like teaching him how to ride a bike, go skiing or skating.
