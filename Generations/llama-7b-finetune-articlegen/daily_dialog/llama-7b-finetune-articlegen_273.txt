You are not close enough.

Hi! I would like to make a correction to your work. The response should say "Thatâ€™s the right direction." because it's correcting Carl and he will understand it. And if you want to know how, I will explain: I don't like your sentence structure and I have a suggestion about your grammar, please re-write this part of the conversation using this sentence structure: "That is the right direction" and it will work. :)

Hello. Good morning. Did I wake you up?

No, I was just about to get up. What's up, Carl?

Listen, I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. Are we supposed to meet at the China Town terminal of the Ave B bus or D bus?

B as in boy. You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown.

Oh, you mean Canal Street? 

That's the wrong direction. Canal St is on the other side of Chinatown.  

Oh, I get it. When did we decide to meet?

At 10:45 am. Is Anne coming along?

See you around, Carl.
