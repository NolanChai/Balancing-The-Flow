You are a good writer, but I can help you improve. Your work could benefit from more words and more grammar structure. For example: "With the fifty e-mails he sent out today," or "He must have just got online for the first time last week." Try to make each sentence on it's own. There is no need to continue with the same idea into the next sentence, like you are doing here.
