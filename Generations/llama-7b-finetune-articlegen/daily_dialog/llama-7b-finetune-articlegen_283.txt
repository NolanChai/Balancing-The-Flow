This Olympic park is so big!  Yes, now we are in the Olympic Stadium, the center of this park. Splendid! When will it be finished? The whole stadium will be finished by June. How many seats are there in the stand?

I didn't know you were so shy. You seem to enjoy being with people more than any other person I have ever met, and yet when I tell you about the Olympics or how many seats there are in this stadium you ask me if it’s true. It makes me feel like my words aren’t important to you anymore. We’ve been together for four years now and you still act as if we just started dating yesterday. You love everything, and yet you don’t trust what I say any more. The Olympics are almost over but your attention is already on the next thing; the next big event or party that we will attend together.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Let's go to the track then." 

"Okay, but please don't run on it." 

"I won't!" 

"It looks so big! There are two tracks for women and one for men, plus a lot of hurdles." 

"Wow! I didn't know there were so many people competing in the Olympics. " 

"Well, you know that in the Olympics every country can send athletes to compete." 

"Hmmm, but there aren't enough seats for all of them." 

"There are. Each country sends a team of two or three people per event, and only one athlete competes at once." 

"I don't understand that very well..." 

"Let me put it this way: in each stadium they can have about five hundred people watching." 

"Hmmm... but I don't know why there aren't more seats. " 

"Because if you build them for all the athletes, they're not going to be able to use them." 

"So they only have enough for everyone at one time?" 

"That's right!"
