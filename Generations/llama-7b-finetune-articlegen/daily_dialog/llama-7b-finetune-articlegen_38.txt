The washer and dryer are located in the laundry room downstairs. The door is right next to the back staircase. You will need quarters in order to run them but I can give you some if necessary. Do you have quarters?

"Put it in this slot over here."

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"I need help using the washer and dryer."

"Tell me what the problem is."

"I can't figure out how to turn them on."

"Do you have some quarter?"

"I didn't know I needed change."

"The washer costs 50 cent and the dryer costs a dollar."

"Where do I put the change?"

"The quarters go into the slot. You have to push the slot in, and the machine will turn on."

"Is that everything that I have to do? "
