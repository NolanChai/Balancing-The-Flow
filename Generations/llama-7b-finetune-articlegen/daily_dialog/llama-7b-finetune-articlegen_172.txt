You can make a guess! The last question is, "Who is sponsoring your trip?" It should be clear that she will need some proof from you about why and where. This would be the place to do it.

"Well . my sister in law has agreed to meet us at the airport when we get there."

You need to fill out the dialogue with the information provided. 

*What ’ s the purpose of your trip to the United States ?*
*I ’ m going to visit my brother . he ’ s just had a baby . He lives in Minnneapolis .*
*And how long do you plan to remain in the United States ?*
*I ’ ll be here for approximately three weeks . See , here ’ s my return ticket for the twentysixth of March .*
*And who is sponsoring your trip ? *
*My brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . I will stay with him and his family in their home.*

I just need a little bit of help . I know i am probably making it too complicated , but this is for a school project and if we get into the 5th or 6th interview ( and they are long) i dont want to make my case even harder. I think there should be an instruction for how to word the answers without using any other words . I tried writing things out in different ways and it just gets more complicated because some things you have to write as questions but others you dont . The interview is long enough , so i am not sure why they wouldnt provide instructions on how to answer the questions. It doesnt seem like much to ask, but i guess its asking too much. I also cant really find anywhere that provides examples of people who actually got B-2 visas without any issues . Im just stuck. Thanks for your help , it will be greatly appreciated!
