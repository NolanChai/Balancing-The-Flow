The response would be based on the current dialogue. The only thing we have to do is continue with what he said before in this dialogue, which is, "How do you do?", "Please be seated," and "How is your trip here?".  
We will write "How do you do? Please sit down." in this dialogue because that's the format.

You may start at any point in the dialog, and you should write one sentence (one turn) per instruction, without explanation or format changes.
