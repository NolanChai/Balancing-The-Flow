I need help writing the next turn in this dialog.  It should be formatted exactly as the original.   The new dialog should have one question per line with no spaces or extra punctuation (only a period at the end).  A period and a space are needed at the end of each line.   There is no need to indent, capitalize, or use any formatting other than this.   

"Hi . Do you like classical music ? "

You should have written "I do like it though. It's great." The sentence structure should be like this, "Do you like Mozart?" "Yes, but...." Then your next line would say what you liked about him. I don't know the correct grammar or phrasing for that question, sorry. You could try "Are you still listening to classical music?" and then it would sound more natural if she responded with her favorite kind of music instead of just saying yes. But since there is no way of knowing what type of music they were talking about before, I'm not sure how accurate this answer should be.

Hey, Blake! Are you still listening to Mozart?

Yes. Do you like it?

It's great and I've heard that listening to Mozart can make you more intelligent. 

Realley? I've never heard that before. I just like it. 

Is classical music your favorite? 

Yeah, that's why I can enjoy myself in it. 

Did you always like pop music? 

I think so, since I was in primary school. How long have you been interested in classical music? 

I didn't like it at all until I started to learn violin when I was eight. From then on, classicial music has been an important part of my life.

Oh, I didn't know you can play the violin! Do you still play?
