Sorry. We have had many people looking at the apartment this week and our agent will be out of office until Friday . But if you are willing to wait for him, he should be in his office on Tuesday next week , around 9am . Is that time okay?

"I understand, please give me the number. Thank you."

```python 
instruction.text == 'I ’ m sorry , but you won ’ t be able to view it today.' and 'Can I do that right now?' or not
instruction.text == 'You have to make an appointment first.' and 'Is this Friday okay ?' or not
```

You have scheduled a tour for a possible future renter. You don ’ t know if she will show up, but it doesn ’ t hurt to hope and make the appointment .
