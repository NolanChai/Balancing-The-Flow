You're welcome! I hope you enjoyed my first try at a project. I had so much fun doing it, and I loved the challenge of making sure that each sentence was grammatically correct and had proper punctuation. I am also very proud of myself for taking initiative to learn more about English grammar - I never would have done this on my own! This was a great first experience with Codecademy; if you're interested in trying it out too, please let me know by clicking the button below.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Grand Theft Auto Three is awesome ! "

" It's more violent than TV news ! "

" Oh, my God, three hours already! I have to get the chores done!"

"No time! That's their headlights in the window!"

"OK. Emergency measures: Let's throw the dishes in the trash! Two birds with one stone . . ."
