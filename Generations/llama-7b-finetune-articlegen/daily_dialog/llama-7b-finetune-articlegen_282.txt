This dialog is designed to exchange the currency of an existing banknote. The customer would have already identified him or herself by providing a name, telephone number, and possibly some other identifying information like ID card number and passport details. There are many variants to the above dialog but they all follow the same basic flow: 

1) Asking for the currency that is being exchanged.
2) Asking how much of it the customer wants in total. 
3) Asking which bills/coins to give back and which ones are wanted. 
4) Giving back the requested notes, signing them over, receiving change (if any), and thanking the customer for their business.
5) Asking if there's anything else that can be done for the customer at this time.
