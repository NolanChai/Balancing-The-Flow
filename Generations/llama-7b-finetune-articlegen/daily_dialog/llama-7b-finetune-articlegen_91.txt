> I thought the color was great ! And I really liked your hair too.

I also wanted to mention that you got a deal! Your dress is cheaper than mine - I paid $150 for mine, and this one looks almost identical.

You may think it's crazy of me, but I love to see people in the same style or brand clothing as me. I guess because when we get dressed up, we tend to want to look like each other - or so I find.
