I know what I don’t like when it comes to clothing, but I have no idea what I really want. The problem is that I am not sure about the style that I truly love. I can only describe a look that I dislike and then hope that the person selling me something will help me find something better. That's where my next question comes into play:
What are your favorite stores to shop in?

The following dialog is written for this exercise: 

"That dress is very pretty . Why don’ t you like it ?"

"It ’ s too loud ."

"We’ve been looking around for many hours.What on earth are you looking for ?"

"Well, you know , those styles or colors don’t suit me."

"What style do you want ?"

"I want to buy a V-neck checked sweater and it should be tight . "

"Oh, I see.How about the color? "

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Do you like the dress ?"

"Yes,it's nice."

"You don’t have to wear that.We can find another one for you if you want."

"I am just fine,thank you."

"Why do you say ‘we?’ I can go alone.It’s my decision ."

"Well , but you will be cold in this kind of dress."

"Don't worry about me.It won't snow until the next weekend."
