Good afternoon , I'd like to speak with Tom Smith.
I'm afraid he's away from his desk at the moment.
Do you know when he will be back?
He's away on a business trip. He won't be back until some time next week.
Is there some way I can get into contact with him?

You can get the next turn of this conversation using the following code. The response is in your variables, and the format is what it should be if a human wrote the answer. Just type it into the console as a string and then remove the spaces around the curly braces that you inserted at the end of each line for spacing purposes.
