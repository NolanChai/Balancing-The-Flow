I didn't know you had a brother.  
Oh, yes, he is two years older than me. He lives in New Zealand so I don't see him that often.   
Oh, nice. Is he coming on his own or with the family?    
His son is coming as well. He wants to go to university here in England so they will visit a few universities while they are here. 
Does your brother have just one son?
