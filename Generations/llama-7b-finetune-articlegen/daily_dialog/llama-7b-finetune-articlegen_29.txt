I like your answer, but it doesn't really tell me much.  
Do you mean that Robert has never missed a party before?  Or did he miss one party once or twice?

" Yes . "

" Which ones ? "

" The first two . "

### Response:
Oh, so he missed the first two parties and then attended them afterward.  Do you know what happened between that first party and the second one to make him miss those two?

" Nope ! "

### Response:
So you don't have any idea why Robert might not come to a party for two years, but then suddenly showed up again later on without any explanation.  Well, it sounds like there must be a lot of reasons he wouldn't attend in the past.  Have you ever tried talking to him about it?

" Nope ! "

### Response:
I see, so even though you don't have any idea what happened during those two years, I suppose that he had no reason not to come at all.  That means there must be some reason for his sudden appearance after having been away from the parties for a couple of years... What is it?

" He was in prison . "

### Response:
Oh wow! That's quite something! Was he involved in illegal activities and now has served time to pay for them?  Or did you know him before this happened?

" I didn't really get the chance to speak with Robert much when we were at school together . "

### Response:
So it seems that the only thing you could do is hope he shows up again and wants to talk about what made him miss out on those parties for so many years.  Unfortunately, if I had a party coming up soon, I would have to cancel it since there wouldn't be anyone attending at all!
