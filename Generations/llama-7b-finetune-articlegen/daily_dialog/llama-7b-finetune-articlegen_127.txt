### Explanation:
- In the first turn, we should use "How come", not just "Why". (The dialog may be used for other purposes and we do not know what reason it is.)
- The word "boss" is unnatural. It may be better to say something like this: My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to the office...
- In the second turn, we should use the subject "I". (We usually don't mention a third person unless it is necessary.) 
- There are many unnatural expressions. For example: "...to deal with . I work five days a week." Instead of "I work five days a week.", we may say something like this: "That means I have to work on Saturdays and Sundays once in two weeks."

### Questions:
1. What is the most natural way to say "My boss sent me here..."? 
2. Why should we use "I" in the second turn? 
3. What kind of expressions are unnatural in this dialogue?

I found this dialog very interesting and informative, thanks for sharing!  

1. This is my first time meeting you here. How come you dropped into this company today? 2. My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office. I didn't know you were working here. What a surprise. How long have you been doing this? 3. Two years or so. That is great. Do you have to work the night shift? 4. No, in most cases I don't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with. I work five days a week. 5. Do you enjoy working here? It is hard to say. But Iâ€™ve got to start by working as a trainee before I really become an experienced marketing assistant. Sometimes, I am really under great pressure when it gets busy.

1. In my opinion, this is a bit confusing. This dialog may be a continuation of a previous conversation or even several conversations, but it's difficult to tell because the tone isn't carried over from one paragraph to another. It would make more sense if the speaker and his/her audience had already been introduced. 2. The sentence "My boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office" has an awkward construction. I would suggest using, instead: My boss sent me to take these documents back to his office. 3. "Do you have to work the night shift?" could be reworded as "Will you be working at night?" or "Will you be working a night shift?" 4. The sentence "I work five days a week" has an odd structure, in that it's not clear who is doing the speaking until halfway through the sentence: I...work...five...days...a....week. It would make more sense if you used commas to separate the parts of the sentence and wrote it as follows: I work five days a week. 5. The sentence "Do you enjoy working here?" seems like an awkward way of asking how much the speaker likes his/her job. I think, instead, you could ask directly whether the speaker enjoys working at this company or not by using a more direct question such as "I assume it's your first time working at this company." 6. The sentence "Take it easy" seems awkward. It might be better to use some other phrase that means roughly the same thing, or you could just omit it altogether. I don't think anyone would say something like "Take it easy" when speaking in a professional setting. In fact, I don't know if this expression is appropriate in any kind of job interview situation. 7. The sentence "Luckily not..." seems to be a bit abrupt and the word "luckily" might not make sense depending on how you interpret it. My guess is that the speaker means, "I haven't been given much trouble at my new job." If this is what he/she meant to say then I would change the sentence as follows: It's lucky so far. I haven't had too many problems with coworkers or a difficult boss yet. 8. The word "silent" seems out of place in this context. It sounds like an error, but if you intended to use it then my guess is that what you meant was the phrase "I have not encountered any difficulties..." or something similar. 9. I'm sure you don't want your readers to think that you write sentences with words spelled incorrectly and punctuation mistakes in them! You should probably go over this paragraph again before posting it on your blog because, while this dialog is a good example of what your readers will experience, the way you wrote this portion of the text does not give us confidence that all your written material is free of errors.
