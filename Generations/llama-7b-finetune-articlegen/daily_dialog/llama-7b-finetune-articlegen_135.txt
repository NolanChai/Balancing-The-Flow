This is an example of a conversation between two people. The dialog should be written as if the first person were talking in response to the second person, using the second person's name and not saying any "I" statements. For instance, you shouldn't write things like "...because I want to help..." or "...and that would mean something to me." Instead, write "Because you want to help..." or "That would mean something to me."
