I put the remote control in my pocket and walked out of the house without saying a word to anyone. I was going to change the channel anyway, so there wasn't any point in arguing with them.

I know nothing about TV, but if I had to guess what channel they were on, it would be Channel 2. The reason for that is the word "cha" in English sounds like "two." So I think the program they're watching is probably on Channel 2.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Is that all there is to do in the afternoon ?"

"Well, I think it's going to be a good one !"

"Let's go and watch it then."

"I hope we don't get lost . "

"It should not be too difficult. Just follow the road signs and you will find your way there soon."

"How do I know which is Channel 5?"

"Look for the red button on the remote control, it means that the channel has been changed to Channel 5. "

"Oh . I think I have a hangover. My head aches ."

"Have you been drinking last night ?"

"No , I didn't drink at all."

"You shouldn't drink too much then ."

"Do you really like watching basketball match ?"

"Yeah ! Basketball is my favourite sport and it's the best time to watch a match with friends. "
