The office party would be more enjoyable if there was an element of surprise.

I suggest that you split up the responsibilities and focus on the food and entertainment separately, but that we coordinate our efforts so they can work together as one. It sounds like you are ready to take responsibility for the entertainment aspect of the party. Would you be able to start looking into ideas? I don't know what sort of entertainment would appeal to everyone in my department, so please keep it formal and casual options at the same time.

I have a few questions about our meeting tomorrow morning. Do we want a formal or informal gathering? Letâ€™s make sure we are on the same page.

Hey! The first time you use my name in conversation, please use my full name. I know it's long but it's really important to me that people say my name correctly. It's an important part of who I am and how people perceive me as a person.

Also , try not to repeat yourself so much . " Let's make sure we are on the same page ." That doesn't add anything to your conversation or the story line in any way . Just cut it out !

I can't help but agree with your choices for the office party.
