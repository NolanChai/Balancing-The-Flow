You are being told the story of a child who has begun saying cruel things. 

Your first response should be to ask for clarification. You don ’ t know what to tell him because you do n’t understand him , so that must be your first question : “What words does he say?” If this seems strange, it will become clear when we finish. 

Once you have the information you need, you should try to reason with him about it . You do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason , so now would be a good time to use that skill . Don ’ t scold him or make a big deal of it . Simply explain what he said , explain why it is hurtful and give him some alternatives. 

If you don ’ t understand him, ask again for clarification .

You are right ! When children grow up, they have the ability to understand and judge. They can be their own personality and become a human being. 

When you want them to do something , first let him know that it is necessary to make clear what he need to do . And then show him how to get done . If his behaviour is not suitable, we should guide and help him with patience . We should treat them the way they need, not just like ourselves.
