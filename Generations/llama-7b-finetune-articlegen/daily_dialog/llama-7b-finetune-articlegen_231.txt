Sorry I won't be able to make it. I have to work late tonight for Miss King. We’re having a get together at Carl’s Karaoke Club after the meeting to celebrate our success with the budget.  It would be great if you could join us later! I understand, and wish you a happy anniversary. Happy anniversary Leo! Sorry you won’t be there. Maybe some other time?
