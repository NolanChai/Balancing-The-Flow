> " Oh yes ! I can sing . But I don ’ t know if my singing is good enough for a band. It would probably be better if one of the guys in the band could sing and we just play for fun . What do you think ? "

Help me rewrite this dialog so it sounds as if the boy has just told his mother he is going to form a band. No format changes or explanations are allowed, and you must write the entire thing in one message! 

" I’ m forming a music band . "

" Do you already know how to play an instrument ? "

" Uh ... Yeah ! I ’ ve told you a thousand times that I ’ m learning to play the drums . Now that I know how to play well , I would like to form a rock band . "

" Aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? "

" We have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . Altoungh we still haven ’ t found anyone to be our singer . You told me that you had some musical talent, right ? "
