This is a great example of an instruction that makes it very easy for the student to write the next turn in the conversation. The student has no choice but to continue the dialog with their own words and no explanation or format changes are required. 

"What date would you like to depart, sir?"

"Do you have any seats for September 16th?"

"Let's see ... I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked . But I have seats for the 17th."

"The 17th will be fine."

"And what date will you be returning ?"

I'm afraid the 16th is fully booked. But I have seats for the 17th. The 17th will be fine. And what date will you be returning? Hmm, I guess on the 28th. Okay, you're booked on American Airlines flight 710, departing JFK at 6:50PM. Thank you for flying United.
