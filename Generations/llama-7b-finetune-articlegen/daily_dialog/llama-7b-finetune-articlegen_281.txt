```
Joe : How are you doing ? 
Mary : Doing great. Thanks for asking Joe! 
Joe : I was wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me tonight? 
Mary : Sorry, no time tonight, maybe later in the week.

I think there is a typo in your question, but otherwise it's well written. I added a space after the colon in the last sentence and a period in front of the quote at the end. Here is my response:
"Hi Joe , how are you doing?", Mary asks. "Great ! How about you, Mary ? How are you?" "I am great! Thank you for asking.", Mary responds with a smile. "I was wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me tonight," Joe says. "I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper." "Okay, what about going to the movies on Friday night?" "What were you planning on seeing?", Mary asks.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Joey, how are you doing?!"

"I'm great! How about you Mary? How are you?"

"Great thanks for asking joe."

"I was wondering if you wanna go see a movie with me tonight?!"

"I need to stay home and finish my term paper." 

"Okay what about going to the movies on Friday night?"

"What were you planning on seeing?" 

"I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer."

"How about The Secret Life of Bees?"
