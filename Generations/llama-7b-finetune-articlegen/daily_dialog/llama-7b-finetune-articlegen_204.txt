I've heard that many people have trouble getting started when writing their responses. For this reason, it is better to make a list of things to include rather than trying to write right away.

Write out a complete answer for each question in the response section below and then use your notes to help you expand them into full-length answers that follow the correct format.

Help me write a good response in this dialog with no format changes. 

" I usually start off by writing down the deadline that has been given , then break it into smaller sub-deadlines so I know what needs to be done at each step of the process . "

" I remember a time several years ago ,when we were preparing for a trade show in California.The production manager who was in charge of our display told me that he couldn't get the panels assembled and mounted by the deadline . He said the shop was backed up and there wasn't any way to complete it on time.It was very upsetting , because I had spent months planning this show and it was one of my best ideas yet !I called him every morning until he came in with an answer , but we were still stuck . Then, the manager suggested that a coworker from another department help us out.That person worked through lunch to help put together our display.It turned out fine in the end . "

### Response:
  " I can't really think of any specific examples .But , in general , my best experiences have involved being trusted with important responsibilities and then delivering beyond expectations . I don't like to feel that I am just a cog in the wheel or that others are monitoring everything I do . In order to feel completely committed,I need to feel a sense of ownership and responsibility for my work. "
### Response:
  " I think the most important thing is that my coworkers respect me . It's hard to explain , but when people feel like they have no chance at making a mistake or being judged unfairly, it takes a lot off their shoulders and allows them to focus more on producing quality work.I don't mind constructive criticism because I know that if someone takes the time to tell me what needs improvement, I can get better . "

The answer to these questions should be in paragraph form, not one long sentence, or one short answer. 

1. "What type of people do you work with most effectively?"
	I like working with people who are decisive and have confidence. It makes it easier for me to focus on my duties when I know the person I'm working with is confident in their decisions and able to delegate tasks accordingly.
2. "What things impress you in your colleagues?"
	Confidence, enthusiasm, and the ability to take charge and own an assignment are all qualities that impress me about my co-workers.
3. "What are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ?"
	When I receive feedback in front of others, it can be difficult for me to respond. I prefer to have private conversations so that I have time to think and react to the issue without distractions from other people. I believe this is fair and will improve my learning or change future behavior. 
4. "How do you organize and plan for major projects ?"
	I like to brain storm a best, worst, and most likely scenario before I begin planning. Once these scenarios are visualized, I set a realistic schedule. What usually happens is that some combination of my schedule fits well with what's occurring because I've already visualized the possible outcomes. 
5. "Describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure."
	When I worked as a financial advisor, I traveled for two weeks consecutively. Although this was challenging on many levels, my secretary and logical filling system made it easier to locate everything I needed for the end of quarter reports. 
6. "How do you manage your time in a typical day ?"
	I usually begin each morning by reviewing what is due that week. This helps me to set a realistic schedule, prioritize my daily tasks, and plan accordingly. I am able to manage my time well because I know the goals of what's expected for the week so I can plan ahead for the unexpected or rushed work day.

> "I really think it depends on the situation and the person.I 've found that in general, people who are confident and straightforward have great insight into what is going on and what should happen next.If they feel strongly about something , I tend to trust them more because their opinion has proven itself ." 

> "The only things I really like about my supervisor are his good character and integrity . The rest of the time, he gets in my way . If you 're working for someone who doesn't have your best interest at heart , then you may need to find a new job . I believe that it 's the fair thing to do for both yourself and for your colleagues . " 

> "I love to brainstorrm a best , worst , and most likely scenario.Then , I set a time table that's realistic.What I usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because I 've already visualized what could happen and how I would react ." 

> "I had to complete an end of quarter report once while I was on the road for two consecutive weeks.The amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because I couldn't bring my office files with me.Lukevily I had a great secretary and a logical filling system so we located everything we needed ." 

> "I 've always given priority to work with established clients because they offer better risk / return value.The last thing I do is general correspodence , especially internal correspodence, which I take care of at the end of the day or week."
