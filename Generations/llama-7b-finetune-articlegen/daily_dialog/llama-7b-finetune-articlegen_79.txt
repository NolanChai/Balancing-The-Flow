> Hey, what’s wrong? Are you ok? Take it easy. Let's go out and have some fun. It will be great! 

> What are we doing, exactly? Counting? And why do we count every day? I think counting is boring as well. I need a break. How about that? 

> Yeah, I know what you mean. Sometimes I feel the same way. But I don’t want to change my job because it’s too stable and reliable for me. I can’t do something else because it’s not my passion. So, I just work with my professional knowledge to get through everyday.

I don’t think you can blame all your problems on your boss. It is better you take a day off and relax than worry about this too much.

The speaker of this dialog is a man named Paul. It's obvious by his response that he is more concerned with the company's interests than those of his employees, and that he isn't very interested in them as people (he doesn't even know what their names are). He just wants to get rid of the problem worker before it becomes a bigger issue.
