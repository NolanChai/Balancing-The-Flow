Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

> This dialog is an example of a simple, yet powerful technique for building natural-sounding dialog. 

A person might ask, "Do you have something to read?" and then you can say yes or no without thinking about it too much, but if she asked, "Could you lend me one?", now that's a different matter altogether! You are being asked to do something with the thing. And when she asks for the news, she has already assumed that you have some information to share with her. You have to be ready, or it will sound stilted and unnatural.

```
" Do you have something to read ? " 

" Yes , I do . " 

" Could you len d me one ? " 

" OK . Here you are . " 

" Thanks . It's rather cold this morning , wouldn't you say ? " 

" You're right . " 

" Do you know the news ? " 

" Which one ? " 

" Brazil wins the World Cup . "
