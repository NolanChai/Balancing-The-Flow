Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

"OK, well then what kind of Chinese? Should it be traditional Cantonese food, or something like PF Chang's?"

*I want to make sure you understand that this is not an exercise in formal dialog writing. Your job is to write as though you are responding to your partner's question, and have them reply again with the next turn of dialog.* 

### Explanation/Feedback:
This response was lacklustre. It does not demonstrate a real understanding of the original task or of the requirements of good dialog writing. The sentences are too long and contain too many words. They also contain awkward sentence construction, e.g., "Should this party be formal or casual ?" should simply say "Which one do you want? Formal or informal?"
