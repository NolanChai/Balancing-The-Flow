> No thanks! I'm not going to a cafeteria, no matter what you say.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"How long will it take to reach the buffet ?"

" Not long , because people rush for lunch ."

" The line sure does move fast."

" Tell the man behind the counter what you want."

- Yes, please. How do I get there?
- It's easy; just take a bus at the corner of First Street and Third Avenue, and you will arrive in front of the main entrance of the Central Park. If your plan is to spend some time walking around in that area, I suggest you to buy a map from the information booth nearby. You may also visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art or The Cloisters and get back there using public transportation.
- Are tickets still available?
- Yes, but the last ferry is about to leave. So don't waste any more time, take the subway and go over there. There are no trains running at this moment; they will come soon.
