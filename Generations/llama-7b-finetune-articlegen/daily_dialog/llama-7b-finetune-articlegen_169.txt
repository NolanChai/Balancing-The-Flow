"John, I was looking through some magazine for ideas about where we might go on vacation this year."  
"I've already told my buddy Mark that I am going hunting with him in Alaska."  
"You can't be serious!"  
"Hey, I've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation. I am sorry that bothers you."  
"After a year together, I thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together."

Help me write a response to John and the previous statement in no explanation or format changes.
