You are very close, but the professor is speaking to himself.

"Are you sure that you should be giving advanced geology courses again?" he wonders out loud. He then continues his conversation with the student. "Yes, I am applying on it."

The student speaks next and says, "I wonder if I could enroll in it . I know it is a graduate course and I'm a junior, but ..." The professor interrupts him with an enthusiastic "YES! YES!"

Help me fix the dialog to be grammatically correct. 

Professor Donald : Are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester? 

Student : Yes, I am applying on it. 

Donald : I wonder if I could enroll in it. I know it is a graduate course and I'm a junior, but ... 

Student : Aren't you a bit young? I have a lot of qualified senior students to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up with it. 

Donald : Well, if you think you are ready, I'll let you enroll.
