```
" So , Paula , where are you from ? I'm from Canada , originally. From Canada? Where were you born? Monterreau. When did you come to Los Angeles?```

I'm not sure how this would work because Paula would have to answer the same questions over again. It might be easier if the first person spoke until they had no more information, then switched places with the next person, and went back to Paula for the next question. However, this isn't how conversation works. It seems like a waste of time to repeat the same information twice in a row when the point is to find out new things about each other.

Help me fix this sentence structure. 
>I knew that she would want to spend some time at the pool and I wanted her to go out with the girls so I let her make the decision on what they wanted to do.

The word "so" does not fit into this sentence grammatically. 

### Response:
I have a question about this sentence: "I knew that she would want to spend some time at the pool and I wanted her to go out with the girls so I let her make the decision on what they wanted to do." The word "so" does not fit into this sentence grammatically. Can you please help me? Thank you!

Help me write the next turn with no explanation or format changes. 
"So, Paula, where are you from? I'm originally from Canada."

"Originally from Canada?"

"Yes! From Montreal. Where were you born?"

"I was born in Toronto. When did you move to Los Angeles? We moved here when I was fourteen."

"Where did you go to school after high school?"

"Well, I went to high school here but went to college in Texas."

"Did you get a job right out of college?" "No, I traveled for awhile in Europe and lived in France. When was that? (I have a question mark at the end.)

What do you want to know? We've been talking for a while and it seems like we have covered the basics, but if you really want more details let me know. You might be interested in what happened after I graduated from college, or perhaps how I ended up moving around so much, especially when you hear that my parents were born and raised here! I guess that makes them more traditional than most people.
