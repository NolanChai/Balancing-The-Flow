Yeah I got some questions about abraham lincoln too. Also there were a lot of questions on how to interpret what was going on in the Civil War from different perspectives and how to use primary source documents. I think I'll be ready for tomorrow.

Did you already take the history exam ? Yes. It was hard. When do you take it? I take it tomorrow morning. There is so much material that I dont know what to emphasize on. What types of questions did you get? Mostly on the civil war. You should also study the impact Martin Luther King Jr had on American society. What about Abraham Lincoln? Did you get any questions about him? I only had 1 question about him. But you might get more. I dont know if he will have the same exam or not. Hopefully he will use the same exam, cause Im going to spend most of my time studying the civil war. It is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class.

If you can’t study everything, then that is probably the best way to go. 

Arigh! Thanks for the info. I gotta go to the librarry now.
