What if the response to the question was “No, I am not going to vote”, how would the following turn be structured?
```
"I'm not voting." 
```
Or what if it was "Well, I guess so . . " or "Sure, but are you?"? What other responses might work?
What would you need in addition to those in the example response above to write a good dialogue based on that response?
### Example:
I asked my sister for advice on how to make a healthy dinner. She asked what kind of meat I wanted and if I had all of the ingredients. Then, she gave me directions.
```
"How's it going ? " 
```
What would be a good way to start a dialog like this? What could you ask next? How about if the first part was different: what if she said, “I’m really busy” instead of “It’s going well“? 
### Response:
Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. The dialog can't end yet because there isn't enough information to make a complete story! How would you add more information if you had to write it yourself, without the example provided above? What kind of response could you give that would keep the story going and allow for another turn?

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"What are the candidates for mayor like ?"

"I don ’ t know them too well, but there is one who lives in my neighborhood and seems pretty friendly."

"Well, I haven’t met her yet. I just heard about her a couple of days ago from a friend of mine who knows the candidates personally. "

"So, you think she would be a good mayor ? "

"It ’ s hard to tell if it’s not an election, but based on what my friend said, yes."

"Are you going to vote?"

"Of course! Are you?"

"I plan to, but what day is the election?"

"You should know that."

"Can you just tell me?"

"The election is this Tuesday."

"Are you serious?"

"I'm not kiddding."

"It's a good thing I asked you."

"That should've been something you knew already."

"I couldn't remember."
