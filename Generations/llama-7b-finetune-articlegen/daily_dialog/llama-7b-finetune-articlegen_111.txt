I was wondering why I didn’t get a reply from my boss yesterday. I thought it might be because he had some problems to deal with, so I waited until today to ask him if everything is alright. My boss looks upset when I asked him, and says “I’m going to quit the job”. He adds, “The task is too hard”. Then my boss tells me that quitting a job is like jumping from fire into water, which I don’t agree with. And he continues with “You’d look before you leap.”
