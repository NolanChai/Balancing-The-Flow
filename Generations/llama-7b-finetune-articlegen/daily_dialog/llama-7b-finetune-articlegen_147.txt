1. You did it ! This is exactly what the response should look like . Well done! 2. In your next attempt, try not to use the word 'good'. It's a very common word. I want you to come up with another way of saying 'I agree'. Remember that good can mean many things: bad or average. 3. The new chef is a woman . You should change "They" to "He". 4. Avoid using the same word twice in one sentence, unless there's no other choice (like you did with the first two lines). It makes your dialog sound choppy and unnatural. 5. We don't have to learn anything. There is no need for an 'if'. If we want something done or happen, it will. Don't add extra words that aren't necessary . Remember: Keep your dialog simple and straight forward. 6. You are correct on the verb tense for the second line of this response. This isn't a promise. It's a statement. We use 'want', not 'would'. 7. I don't know where to place these commas in your second sentence . I'll let you figure it out, but try using a comma after "Chinese" and before "look". You can always use the spacebar if you feel something should be separated from another word (like the name of the restaurant). 8. Don't capitalize 'ChinaTown'. It's not an official name . And don't end your sentence with a preposition like that either . Your last sentence sounds very choppy and unnatural. The final line should have the 'to', which is what makes it sound natural (like my example). 9. Make sure you read through your response to make sure there isn't any errors in grammar or punctuation before sending it . Good luck!
