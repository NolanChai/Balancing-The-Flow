" George ! You are not serious , are you ? I have to use the bathroom all night long and there is nothing I can do about it while we sleep in the van . And what if we get caught by a police officer ? "

Lili and George decided that it was time for them to take a vacation. They had not left their small town in many years and were eager to do so. So, after they saved up some money from the van rentals they were running around town with, they packed their bags, loaded all of their supplies into the van, and began to drive down the road towards their first stop. They had only been driving for about thirty minutes when George realized that he forgot something . It was very important . And it could be in the house . They decided to take a detour to Lili's parent's home to retrieve it before they continued on their way and George drove the van back over there with much haste. Once again, Lili asked him what was so special about this "thing" that he had to go out of his way to get it . He only replied by telling her, "It can wait . We are going on vacation now , Lil's." They continued their journey and arrived at the first stop, which was a small town called Blue. It wasn't anything special but they enjoyed themselves for a few days as they sat in the van during the day eating and watching television and going to bed early so that they could be up and ready to go again by 7:00 am . They spent their last money on gas before moving on to the next town, which was a small farming community called Green. It also wasn't much of anything but at least it was different from Blue and there were some nice views in the area. After staying in Green for another day or two they decided that they had seen everything there was to see so they packed up their things once again and drove back out onto the road where George noticed a sign that said, "Last stop before you get home ." He turned around and headed that direction. They pulled into a little town called Orange which seemed much like Blue did but at least this time it had a real diner instead of a greasy spoon restaurant. The food was fantastic as were the prices , so after filling up on a meal for three they decided to settle in their van and enjoy the last couple of hours before heading back home again . "So where do we go now , George ?" Lili asked him, staring at her watch with anticipation . "We have plenty of money left if you would like us to keep going on vacations ! I know that this trip wasn't much but there are many more places we could visit before heading back home tomorrow night." "You know what , George ? Let ’ s go see one last town on our way home . Just one ." Lili said with a smile as she grabbed her purse and got out of the van, ready to explore whatever might be in this new town called Orange.

I can’t believe George is planning another road trip. Lili, I am sorry that I am going to have to be rude with him this time and say no. George, do you remember when we went camping in the mountains and ended up stuck on a side of a mountain? You wouldn’t let me call my parents or anyone for help, you just kept insisting that we would figure it out ourselves. And then, I got food poisoning from the meat we had to eat because our cooker wasn't working, and you told me that if I didn't eat it, I was going to get sick and not be able to keep up with walking. Now, tell me what do I have in this situation? You know that we can’t afford any more road trips after the last one. It isn't safe either, what if something happens while we are driving and you get hurt? What will happen then? The only thing you haven’t taken into consideration is yourself and how your actions affect me and our relationship. We don’t need a vacation to appreciate each other because I love being with you every day, and the last time that we went on a road trip, all it did was make us argue and made you more demanding and controlling. There is no reason why we can't stay home, have fun, and relax, but you always seem to think that everything has to be planned out to perfection so it’s not really a vacation, and then when things go wrong, which they inevitably do with road trips, your first instinct is to blame me for something. I love spending time with you, and being around you is enough of an adventure, I don't need some crazy excursion to make our relationship more fun or romantic because it already is. We don’t need a vacation.

- George is in charge of the vacation. He is ready, but wants Lili to be more agreeable with him on how they will spend their money and what places they should visit. 
- She agrees that they need a break from work, but she doesn't see this as a "vacation." 
- George is worried about the expenses of taking care of all the other necessities to go on vacation - gas, food, recreation, etc. 
- He explains that these costs are relatively low and he plans for them. But Lili's response questions his judgement as to whether they can afford the trip. She worries about their expenses when they get back from the trip. 
- Lili agrees to the trip, but doesn't know where she wants to go or what restaurants he wants to visit (or if it is really a "vacation" with all the preparations and planning). He is confident that she will enjoy herself once they are away from home.
