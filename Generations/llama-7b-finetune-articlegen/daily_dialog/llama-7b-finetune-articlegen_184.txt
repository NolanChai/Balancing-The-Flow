It might be a good idea to start with, “Hello. My name’s ______. How are you?” Then tell your customer that you will answer her question about applying for jobs. You can say something like this: “You can apply for the job on the Internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company.”

“And wait the feedback of the company?”

“You must have over 2 years' experience first,” you might add at the end.
