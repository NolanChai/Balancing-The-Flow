I’ll go get you some.” After her departure Dick began to think about something else entirely when suddenly he realized how much he did love coffee, not just for taste but for it’s warmth on a cold day.

Then he spoke in a monotonous tone, “I don’t like coffee,” then added with an equally dull tone, “neither do I.”
