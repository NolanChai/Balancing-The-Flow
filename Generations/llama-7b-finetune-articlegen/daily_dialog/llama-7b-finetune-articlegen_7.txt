Yao Lan had brought up two large suitcases from China, but they were nowhere to be seen. It was no wonder that she had been waiting for so long. 

"I'm very sorry," said the bell captain again, this time with a smile. "We have room 406 , not 407 . I will look into it right away."

He went back to his desk and began calling around to check on her bags. While he was gone, Yao Lan took out her cell phone and called her sister. She had been staying at a friend's house and had not realized how late it was when she decided to go shopping with some friends. It would be much later before she got home. She did not want to disturb them by waking them up, but they would be worried about her. 

"I just can't wait any longer!" Yao Lan thought as she sat down on a bench near the reception desk. "My room is upstairs , and it is right now! I will go back to my sister's house when I am done here." She dialed her friend's number again, but no one answered. Maybe they had gone to sleep already. 

After a while, the bell captain returned with news that Yao Lan's bags were found in another hotel and would arrive at any minute. He apologized again for the long wait and asked if she could come back later after her sister had woken up. 

"No problem," replied Yao Lan. "I will call you tomorrow when I return to my room."

The bell captain's desk is in front of me.  The bell captain is sitting at his desk. There are two suitcases on the ground next to him. The suitcases are blue and one has a name tag attached to it . He is leaning back with his hands folded behind his head. His name is Yao Lan (name), he's wearing a red shirt, a pair of dark gray pants, and brown shoes . "This is the Bell Captain's Desk . May I help you ?"  "Yes , I've been waiting for my bags to be sent up for the last half hour . Where are they?"  "I'm very sorry to hear that . May I have your name and room number, please?"  "Yes, it's Yaolan . Room 406"  "And how many pieces did you have?"  "Two suitcases and a handbag. The suitcases are blue and the shoulder bag is red."  "Is there a name tag attached to them?"
