" Well, like yesterday. Tim is always telling me what to do . Like how many hours I should work . How my ideas will fail , so he should take over ... blah blah . You know how Tim is ! "

" Ok, but if you quit, someone else might get your job and then they'll probably do the same thing. If you tell Tim what's on your mind it could change things ."

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Yeah , and he even tries to make me look bad in front of all our clients . "

" Well that's not right ! But it could be worse ... at least you have a job."

You look furious! What's wrong?
I’ve had it with Tim. 
I think I'm going to quit.
But Sandra… you love your job! You spent months trying to get this position. It's perfect for you!
Yeah, but… I’m sick and tired of all the office power struggles! Basically, I think Tim is threatened by me. I'm doing a better job than he is so he’s trying to sabotage my career! 
So he talks about you behind your back?
Yes. He’s all nice and friendly to my face but the second I turn around he stabs me in the back!
I had a worker like that once. She was always taking credit for my ideas.
