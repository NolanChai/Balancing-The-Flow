Weâ€™ve managed to reduce our energy consumption in our factory by about 15 per cent in the last two years. That's excellent; how have you managed that? Mainly because we've invested in a heat recovery system. What does that mean exactly? Well, we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers.
