" That's impossible , isn't it? I mean, those guys seem quite experienced in handling themselves on skis . They wouldn't fall off their skis . And even if they did, there is always a safety rope to catch them and bring them down to earth . "

" Hey, look over there . It seems that there is something interesting going on . Let's go and have a look." 

" Sure. It's probably a skiing show . Adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . "

" Look at that . It's so dangerous . My mom would never allow me to do that . "

" Stop all this fus and enjoy the show." 

" You are right . But what if an avalanche happened ? "

" They are all great skiers and very experienced . So I suppose the chaunc of them to be buried by an avalaunc is sliim . "

" Anyway, the show is breathtaking . By the way , where did they get so much snow here? "

"Heh, it's not very interesting over there."

"Hmm. I guess your mother would never let you go skiing either."

"You can be pretty scared by avalanches when you don't know much about the risks."

"But the chances of being buried by an avalanche is really slim."

"I think these guys are all great skiers and very experienced."

"The snow here isn't real. It's made with artificial snow making machines."

"It should be better for your health than eating fried food and drinking colas, don't you think?"
