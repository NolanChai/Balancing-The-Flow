I'm looking for a room or an apartment near 上海外滩。It must have a bathroom, kitchen, TV, computer network and a balcony. I can pay 800-1,200RMB per month. Could you recommend some places?

### Response:
I know of an empty room in a house on the corner of 外滩中路。It's for rent at 500 yuan per month and has all the facilities. Would this be suitable?
