You don't know where the dialog is going. You can only ask questions that are relevant to what the person might do, or might say next. The person may be asking you the same question you asked them, but they're just doing it in a different way (maybe by changing the order of words). Or maybe your friend isn't interested in what you're talking about and is trying to change the subject!

You can always ask "how are things going today" if someone hasn't said anything relevant yet. And there will always be things to say about a movie that might get your friend to want to see one.
