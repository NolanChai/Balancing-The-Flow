The best response to the prompt is 'No', since that is what the user has asked for.  The answer, though, should be in the form of a question.  'Thank you' and 'That's a nice discount.' are also acceptable answers.  A response of 'Yes,' however, would not be acceptable to this prompt.

> No, thank you.
