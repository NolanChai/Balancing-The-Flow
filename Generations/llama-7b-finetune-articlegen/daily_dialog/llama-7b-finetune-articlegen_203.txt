"Ok , honey, time to take down the Christmas tree."

" Do we have to?"

"Come on, it’s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging ."

" It’s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere . "

" A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart , and it’s messing up the room."

"Oh come on! That tree has been up for 6 weeks and that is plenty long enough!"

"It makes our living room look like a forest, you know."

"How about it? You take it down and I ’ ll put the presents underneath the tree. Deal?"

I see what you mean. The tree is kinda losing needles, and there’s quite a bit of dust on it from all those holiday lights. I think we should take it down while the cat ’ s away. It shouldn’t be any trouble to get it out of here before she gets back .

Ok , honey , time to take down the Christmas tree .

Come on , it ’ s losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . 

Do we have to ? 

It ’ s not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . It gives the room a good atmosphere .

A good atmosphere ? The tree is falling apart, and it ’ s messing up the room . I ’ d really hate to have to take it down . 

But Christmas was two weeks ago! It ’ s been there only because we ’ Ve been too busy to get rid of it . 

I know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . 

But it ’ s falling apart, and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . 

I know , I know. But it reminds me of the great Christmas we just had. All of us were here - - my parents, your parents, the kids, and the cousin's - -the food was good, and everybody got what they wanted . 

Yeah , it was a good Christmas. It won ’ t always be this good, but we can ’ t make it last longer than it should .
