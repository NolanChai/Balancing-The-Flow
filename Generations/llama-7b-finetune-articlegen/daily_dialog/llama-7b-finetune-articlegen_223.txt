Help me write this next dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Do you use an antivirus program to protect your computer?",

"Yes, I do. I also run an anti-spyware program and a firewall.",

"There are so many nasties on the internet, and there's a lot of people trying to use the Internet to hurt other users you have to be very careful ." 

"How often do you run your antivirus program?" 

"I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time."

"Which antivirus program would you recommend ?",

The person is probably using a Windows PC. 

You could ask more detailed questions about what specific anti-virus program he/she uses and why, if you want to help him/her better. 

"Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer ? " 

"Yes . I use Norton Anti-Virus."

"I also have a firewall but it isn't really necessary because my ISP provides me with one for free as part of their service package. "

"Yes . I run my anti-virus program at least once a day and that keeps the virus threat to an acceptable level."

"How often do you run your anti-virus program ? " 

"I usually run it once or twice every week, although this isn't essential. "

"Which anti-virus program would you recommend ? " 

"Have you tried this one ? It ’ s very good and you can download it for free on the internet . You can also download updates for free."

"That sounds very good . Which website should I visit to download it ? " 

"Visit http://www.symantec.com/norton/home.html"

"What would I do if my anti-virus program found a virus and there wasn’t an updated definition file available to remove it ? "

"I would call the company that makes the anti-virus program . They would give me instructions on what to do to fix the problem . There are companies online that will remove viruses from your computer for money but I would check with my antivirus software maker first and then look at other options if they couldn’t help me . "

"Have you ever had a virus on one of your computers ? "

"Yes, several times . The worst time was when we were in the middle of setting up our office network . I thought that I had everything set right but I hadn ’ t updated the anti-virus program since we installed it and as soon as I opened a file to send to someone my screen froze up with a nasty looking message about how I wasn ’t secure because the computer was full of viruses . My network administrator came over immediately and got everything working again but I couldn ’ t send emails or files until he had deleted all of the viruses from our computers . "

"Did you ever get a virus from opening an email attachment ? "

"Several times. They are the worst kind because they come in an email that looks like it is from someone I know but when I open the attachment the virus downloads itself to my computer and then does whatever damage that it was programmed to do . One time it deleted all of our network settings files so that we couldn ’ t connect with each other ! "

"How often should you run your anti-virus software ? "

"Every day is good because new viruses are being released constantly and you don ’ t want to get a virus when you aren ’ t expecting it . If I knew someone who was not running an antivirus program all the time, I wouldn ’ t loan them my computer . It doesn ’ t make sense for me to take that chance and they should be responsible enough to protect their own computer . "

"What would you suggest if a user didn’t want to use paid software ? "

"Well there is some free software available . I like Avast because it runs in the background checking incoming emails and files for viruses before they are opened . It also does a good job of scanning your computer for hidden viruses . You can download a free version online or you can go to www.avast.com for more information . "
