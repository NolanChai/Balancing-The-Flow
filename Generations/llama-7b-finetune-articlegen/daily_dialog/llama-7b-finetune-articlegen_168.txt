I think this is what you wanted :
```
Biill, do you know if the cafe around the corner is open today? 
- Yes. They were opened this morning when i came to work. They must've finished remodeling. Why do you want to know? 
- Well I thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today. That is, if you haven't promised to go with someone else. 
- That would be wonderful Peter. But I hope you are in a better mood than you were this morning. 
- I'm sorry I was such a grouch. It must have been the weather. When it rains, I get depressed. 
```

Comment: That's right ! Thank you for your help . I had forgotten to add that the character "Peter" had also answered .
