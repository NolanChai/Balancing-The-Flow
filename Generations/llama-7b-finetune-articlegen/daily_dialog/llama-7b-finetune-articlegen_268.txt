It was nice to see you, and it seems like a lot happened since we talked. I hope your work is going well, and that things are settling in at your new house! The biggest change for me over the past month has been the addition of our second child, which was so fun! I am looking forward to getting back to some regular routine as he is now old enough to start going on walks.
I have also started to work with a new client who just launched their own consulting business! They are working with individuals and small organizations to help them get the most out of their projects, and they brought me on for web development. I am excited about this opportunity as it has given me some creative freedom that I haven't had in a while!
Anyways, I hope all is well with you and your family! Please let me know if there's anything we can do to help out from the office (or just send us more pictures of your kids :) )
