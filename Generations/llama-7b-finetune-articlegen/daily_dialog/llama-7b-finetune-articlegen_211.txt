This seems a bit overly wordy. Wouldn't "I had fun last night at the movies and wanted to ask if you want to go again on Friday" work? The original seems a little off in that it has both "last night" and "this Friday".

I was having an interesting conversation with Kara about going out , when she asked me if we could meet somewhere other than the movies for a change of pace . I thought that it might be good for us to do something different for once so we can see eachothers lives from a new perspective . I hope that it will help strengthen our bond and deepen our relationship !
