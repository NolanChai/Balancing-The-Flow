Thank you Judy Wang for contacting Trans Pacific Airlines. Please take your time to review our policy concerning ticket changes and cancellations. The fee is $75 per flight segment, plus additional fees if you purchased a flexible economy fare (up to 20% of the base fare). A segment is considered an airline segment as defined by IATA (International Air Transport Association), including flights operated in conjunction with another carrier. Please review our ticket change and cancellation policies carefully prior to making any changes or purchasing a new ticket. You may read about this on www.transpacificairlines.com under the FAQ section titled "Ticket Changes". Thank you for flying Trans Pacific.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

"Good afternoon ! Trans Pacific Airlines, how can I help you ?"

"Iâ€™m calling to cancel my reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on July 19 from Taipei to Memphis. Could you please make it for the same flight on August 2 instead of July 19?"

"What's your name, please?"

"My name is Judy Wang."

"How do you spell your name, please?"

"My first name is J-U-D-Y and my last name is W-A-N-G."

"Please note that this ticket has a penalty of $75 for any change or cancellation. Where should I pay the penalty? At the airport."

"It's okay, where should I pay the penalty?"

"At the airport it is $75. OK Miss Wang, your flight on July 19 from Taipei to Memphis has been cancelled. Your new reservation is Trans Pacific Flight 8 from Taipei to Memphis at 9:30 a.m. on August 2nd."

"That's 1POJ7403."

"That's correct."

This is what happens when the caller reads from a script, or in this case an automated system. 

Thankfully, as I said before, it will be easy to correct and improve.

It's not your fault if English is not your first language. It might even help you learn better if you want to try learning by yourself. It could be easier than taking a class with a teacher in front of the room. I would suggest using something like Rosetta Stone, but there are other programs that offer similar features for cheaper.
