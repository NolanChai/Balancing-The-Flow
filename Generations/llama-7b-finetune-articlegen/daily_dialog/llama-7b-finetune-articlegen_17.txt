### Explanation: 
The two orange juice smoothies would be considered one order, since they are ordered for only one person. It's a good idea to add this to your answer, and also to explain that if it were for multiple people (ie: "Hi , could we have four oranges juice smoothies ? ") then you would need to multiply the number by two, so instead of 4, it would be 8.
