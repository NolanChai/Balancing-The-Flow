Gordon was really happy with the meal and felt like he couldn't eat another bite. It was getting late so Gordon thought it would be a good idea to go home. Gordon was going to have to get up early in the morning to go to work, so he agreed that they should leave right away. "Let's see how much the bill is", said Gordon.

Gordon was an exceptional cook but he was also a generous man.  He would never expect his guests to pay for anything and neither did his friends. As he led his guests from the table , Gordon picked up the check that he had left on the counter by the cash register . The waiter smiled when he saw who it was . "Is that Gordon? We haven't seen you in a long time, sir." Gordon said,  "Hi, Rex. It's been too long!" As they walked toward the door , his friends started to talk about all of the food they had enjoyed . Gordon smiled as he heard them say things like "Gordon, your steak was delicious! I can hardly believe you make such wonderful food at home." Gordon didn't want to admit it but the fact that he was a terrible cook made him feel proud when his friends complimented his meals. He had been working as an accountant for years . He was paid well , but it wasn't enough money . To make ends meet,  he worked at a restaurant on weekends where he learned how to prepare some of the best dishes ever made by human hands . Gordon's friends loved him because they knew that he would never expect them to pay for anything and neither did his friends. They had all been in similar situations before so they understood each other perfectly . The next morning at 6:30 AM, Gordon woke up early and prepared breakfast for everyone who lived in the apartment building above his restaurant . As he placed plates of food on each table , he thought about how much money he had made by working three days this week . He decided that tonight would be the night to finally ask for payment from his friends . When dinner was over , Gordon led his guests into the kitchen and sat down with them at one end of a long wooden table. "How about I get back to you on that?" he said, smiling as he pushed up his glasses .  "I know it sounds strange but I think there's something wrong with my eyes," he continued . His friends laughed out loud when they saw the way Gordon was looking at them through his glasses , which made him look even more nervous than usual . Then, before anyone could speak again , he asked if any of them would like another cup of coffee or tea . "I'd love some more coffee!" said one friend . Another said: "That's just what I need." And so on until everyone had finished their drinks and left the kitchen . After they were gone, Gordon sat down at one end of the table again

Thanks for taking this task, but your answer was incorrect. Please read the following passage to see what the next line of dialogue would be:

"let's see how much the bill is."

The correct response is:

"don't worry about it. Tonight is my treat."

I need someone to continue this dialog with the same tone and format. I do not want any explanation or format change. 

"that was a really good meal, Gordon."

" It sure was . I couldn't eat another bite."

" well , it is getting pretty late . I think we should go home."

" you're right . I have to get up early tomorrow to go to work."

" let's see how much the bill is."

"don't worry about it . Tonight is my treat."

" what are you talking about ? We'll split the bill."

" no , I insist . I kept telling you that I would treat you to dinner but I still haven't."

" no way, Gordon . I know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . There's no need for you to pay for the whole bill."

" alright , if that's the way you are going to be, we'll split the bill."

" that's better . This way we will both have money to take a cab home, otherwise, you would probably have to walk."

Gordon's face lights up. He is pleased that she has agreed to split the bill with him, even though he didn't expect it in the beginning. He takes a moment to think about his choice of words before speaking again. 

" I really appreciate this . "
