. ... so, I said, let’s take a break. And since that night, I haven't heard from him. You don't think he's seeing someone else, do you?
"Come on, don't be so dramatic! I'm sure everything is going to work out just fine."
"You think so?" Oh no! How can he do this to me? I'm sure he's cheating on me. Why else wouldn't he call?
But you two are on a break. Theoretically, he can do whatever he likes.
He's the love of my life! I've really messed this up.

He has the right to be angry . He did nothing wrong . 

"I ... I never meant to make you mad , sweetie . It was just a silly mistake , but that doesn ’ t mean he can treat me like this . No way in hell am I going to take his abuse ! "

" But . That isn ’ t what I said . Look , maybe you are right about him being selfish . But . It seems more like he is angry and frustrated at himself for not being able to contact you . He didn ’ t want to hurt your feelings any more than you wanted to make things worse between the two of you . "

" You don ’ t understand ! I knew I messed up , but I didn ’ T expect him to go so far as to end our relationship completely ! I mean . That s what I deserved for being stupid . But now he is going to treat me like I am nothing at all ? He doesn ’ t even have the courtesy to tell me why we are through ! "

" I can understand how you feel , and if it were me ... I would be really angry too . But this isn ’ T his fault ! He has gone through a lot in the past few months , and he is trying his best to do what is right for all of us . And if you think about it . You two are not together anymore . So maybe he shouldn’t have to put up with your drama at this point . "

" I ’ M just saying ! You can see how ridiculous our relationship was . We were on a break and we couldn ’ t even stay away from each other for that long ! "

" I know it isn’T fair , sweetie , but you have to understand ... he has been through so much this past few months . And he is still trying his best to get over everything that happened at the firehouse . "

" Well , he obviously didn ’ t try hard enough . It ’ S no excuse ! I mean , how could he let all of those people die ? How can he look himself in the mirror every morning ? "

" But this is what happens when you are a firefighter . And as much as we would like to change things ... that is not possible . You just have to accept the fact that there will always be bad days . "

" I don ’ t think so ! He can get over it if he really wants to , and he should want to for all of those poor souls who didn ’ T make it out alive . What about their families ? How are they supposed to live with the fact that their loved ones died because of this man’S mistakes ? "

" But again ... we aren ’ T together anymore ! He doesn ’ t have to worry about anything like that . "

" You don ’ t know what you are talking about . You can ’ T tell me how I feel , or who is right and wrong in a situation ! If you really cared about your sister like you say ... then you would understand why she feels this way . "

" But . I do care ! And I am trying my best to help her through all of this pain that she has put herself through . "

" She is the love of his life , and he needs to be there for her ! If not ... then how can he expect others to trust him ? "

### Response:
We should talk about this sometime. 

" I ’ m sorry you feel that way . But it doesn ’ t change what I just told you . There are rules in place for a reason . He may not want to stay with you now , but he can always come back and ask if everything is alright between you two . "

" Do you really think he will do that ? It seems like the only thing on his mind right now is moving away from all of this ... not trying to find someone to help him deal with it ! "

" Well , I guess we don ’ t have much choice but to wait and see what happens . But if that ’ s how you feel then I guess there isn ’ t anything else I can do for you right now . "

" Can you at least tell me why he doesn ’ T want to talk to me ? What did I ever do to make him hate me so much ? "

" I don ’ T know ... but it seems like the two of us are going in circles with this conversation . All I can say is that he loves you very much , and he won ’ t come back unless you give him a good reason not to . "

" He doesn ’ T love me ! How could he leave his best friend like that ? It’s just like when we first met . I was always there for him whenever he needed it, but now all of the sudden ... he isn ’ t the same person anymore . This is all my fault . He knows I care about him and everything else that has happened ... and still he won ’ T talk to me ! "

" Don ’ t worry . If you give me a good reason not to , then I will see what I can do . But right now there isn ’ T much we can do about the situation at hand . I just have to make sure that you are alright with everything . "

" Please ... don ’ t tell him ! He still doesn ’ T know how badly hurt my feelings were when he left me like this . If it was his girlfriend on the phone , then maybe we could talk about things and try to work something out . But as far as I am concerned ... he is still just a friend of mine . And now that he has turned into an enemy ? I can ’ T have anything else to do with him ! "

" He isn ’ t going to get a chance like that again . If you really care about him then maybe we should talk sometime and clear things up between the both of us ? "

Hey, you're right. This needs a lot of work. The problem here isn't the actual writing itself - it's that there are so many issues with what's already written here that they drown out any potential good in this story. Let me walk you through my issues and you can decide how to best fix them...
