Hey, this is a great start. I’m going to give you some feedback and then you can try again. Remember, there are no mistakes here. Just keep trying. 

“I knew it! How could the economy survive without me?”

“Well, you know how I’ve been working at the Economist as a proof-reader?”

“Yes.”

“Wells, the editor-in-chief heard that I had experience as an editor at another magazine and asked me if I was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him.”

" I'm so happy for you , darling ! You deserve all this success you are getting now. It makes me feel good to see your hard work paying off, especially because it means more money for our little family! "

I was shocked to learn that I could become an assistant editor at this prestigious magadi. This was not only because of the prestige that comes with working for a magazine, but also because of what it means for my career path in general. Although I have been working as a proof-reader, writing is something I enjoy and I am very good at it. I was pleased to learn that I would be able to use both skills during this opportunity. The editor told me that there were other opportunities available but this one seemed perfect for me since my experience in the magazine industry is extensive, and the workload is not overwhelming. The first thing I thought about when hearing this news was how excited I am to be able to share my ideas with others who may benefit from them. I also thought about what kinds of things would happen if there were no limits on creativity or imagination! It sounds like an exciting time ahead for me as an assistant editor at The Economist magazine :)
### Explanation: 
I have been working at the magazine since January and they offered me a position in the editorial department. My role will be to proofread articles, edit them, write my own pieces and contribute to the column. I am really excited about this opportunity because it is one that will allow me to use my writing skills and learn more about editing.

"woh wow that is really great news."

"how often does the magazine come out? Is it a monthly one?"

"yes , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly."

"are you looking forward to doing more editing work ?"

" yes, but I'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! "

I like this question because it is challenging to do without looking at what has been written so far.  This was my first go and I probably won't get it right the first time, but I would be willing to try.
