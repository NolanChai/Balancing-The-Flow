The marketing manager was in his office and saw the phone. He thought that it might be an important call, so he picked up the phone to answer it. When the customer asked for Mr. Smith, the marketing manager answered the phone and said “Hello.” The customer then asked if he could help him. “No,” replied the marketing manager, “I’m afraid I can’t.” The customer was shocked at his response, as he had expected a warm greeting followed by the familiar line of “May I help you?” However, the marketer then went on to explain that Mr. Smith was unavailable and asked if they could call back later or leave a message instead. Unfortunately, this left the customer feeling like their needs were not important enough for them to have access to Mr . Smith immediately. This was not an effective customer service strategy as it showed disregard for their time and made them feel unwanted by the company's staff members who could not be bothered giving adequate help when needed most .

The script is great. Here are some tips to make it even better...
1) Consider adding an emotion tag at the beginning of each line. This will give a clearer sense of what the person on the other end might be thinking/feeling (e.g., surprise, curiosity).
2) Check for proper punctuation throughout the script.
3) Make sure the script flows smoothly and makes sense in English. If you need help with this step, feel free to reach out to us at [support@wit.ai](mailto:support@wit.ai).
