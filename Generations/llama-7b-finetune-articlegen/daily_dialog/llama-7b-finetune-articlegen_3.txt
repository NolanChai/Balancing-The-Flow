* The Mountainering Club is doing a difficult climbing route on Colorado River. *Last week we hiked to the summit of Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa.

The Mountaineeering Club is doing the difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet. How hard is the climb? 

We rappelled down the side of a 300 foot cliff last week that was very exciting. I'm sorry you missed it .
