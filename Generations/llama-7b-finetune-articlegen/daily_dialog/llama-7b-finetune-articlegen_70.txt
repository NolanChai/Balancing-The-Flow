"Well, I'm afraid I must be going now. I have no idea it is so late." 

"Stay for dinner with us!"

"I'm afraid I can't. I have a dinner party at seven tonight. You see, I am going to England the day after tomorrow." 

"Well, I won't keep you then. It was very nice of you to come and see me." 

"It has been a pleasure. Goodbye."
