"What can I do for you , young man?"

"I need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning."

" What sizes do you need ?"

" One pair of 37, and two pairs of 21 . One for me, and the other two for two kid's."

" Here you are , And here are three crash helmets."

" Thanks. Well , those two kid's are beginner's . What should I do about their safety ? "

"Well , there are a lot to do but nothing to worry about. First, make sure they don't go far from the railings. Oh yeah! maybe I should ask them just walk along the railings."

The next turn should have a response from the man about the crash helmets. He would say something like "I thought you were going to rent them". It could be said in any way, but just to help me know what it will be I'll go with a more formal tone. Thank You !
