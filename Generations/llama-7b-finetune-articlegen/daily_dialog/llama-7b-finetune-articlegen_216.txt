"I couldn't do that. I have an important meeting to go to today."

"Do you feel ok?"

"Not really. After a 12-hour flight, I've got jetlag and on top of that, I think I've also got the flu."

"Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now."

You don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work. Do you feel ok?
I couldn't do that. I have an important meeting to go to today. You don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work. Do you feel ok? 

You look terrible . What happened ? Do you feel alright ? Why are you so pale ? Could it be jet lag and a cold ? Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever? You're really hot. Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down. Ok, I'll stay home this morning and rest but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting.

The sentence "You don't look too well" means that the speaker is not satisfied with the way someone else appears. The use of 'look' indicates that it is an appearance issue, and this is further confirmed by the word "well".  
The response "I couldn't do that" means that the person does not agree or cannot do something asked of him/her by the speaker.  This answer implies disagreement with a request as well as uncertainty regarding whether it can be done . The use of 'that' indicates that an action was requested, which is further confirmed by the words 'do' and 'it'.  
The sentence "Do you feel ok?" means that the person asked wants to know how someone else feels. The speaker asks this because he/she suspects that something is not well with the other person. In this case the 'feel' indicates an illness, and 'ok' can mean 'well' or 'good'. 
The response "Not really" means that the person does not feel good. The speaker also states that after a 12 hour flight , he/she has jet lag and thinks they have gotten the flu .  This answer implies the feelings of the other person as well as an action taken by him/her. The use of 'not' indicates disagreement or negation with the statement made, which is further confirmed by 'really', 'feel', 'after a 12-hour flight'.  
The sentence "Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever?" means that the speaker is asking for help regarding their health. The speaker asks this because he/she wants to know if he/she has a fever. In this case 'feel' indicates an illness, and 'my forehead' and 'check to see if i have a fever' further indicate what they want done by the other person. 
The response "You're really hot" means that someone else is feeling warm . The speaker gives this answer because he/she wants to help the other person feel better . The use of 'really' indicates agreement with or a stronger form of the statement, which is further confirmed by 'hot'.  
The sentence "Ok I'll stay home and rest" means that the speaker will stay at his/her home instead of going somewhere else. The response is positive because he/she wants to do what was asked.  In this case 'stay home' indicates an action, which is further confirmed by 'and'.  
The sentence "Zach what's that on your arm" means the speaker asks if something can be seen on Zach's arm. The question asks about something the speaker saw on his/her own arm or someone else's arm, but does not specify this information.  In this case 'on your arm' indicates a location of an object which is further confirmed by 'that'.  
The response "I don't know" means that the speaker doesn't know the answer to a question asked . The words 'don't know' are used in place of 'I don't' and this means that they do not know what was asked.  In this case 'know' indicates awareness, which is further confirmed by 'what's on your arm'.  
The sentence "It looks a bit red" means that something has color . The speaker uses the word 'it' in place of a noun to indicate an object which he/she is not referring to. In this case 'a bit red' indicates a color, and 'it looks' further describe what the person saw.  
The response "But I'm sure it's nothing" means that the speaker disagrees with the information given by the other person . The words 'but i'm sure' are used in place of 'I don't think'. In this case 'it' indicates a noun, which is further confirmed by the sentence "But I'm sure it's nothing".  
The sentence "It looks like you have a red rash all over your body" means that something has color . The speaker uses the word 'it' in place of an object to indicate a location which he/she is not referring to. In this case 'looks like' indicates similarity, and 'you have a red rash' further describe what was seen by the other person.  
The response "Are you allergic to anything?" means that the speaker asks if someone else has an allergy . This question asks for information about a medical condition , not something of the past or future. In this case 'to anything' indicates that they have an allergy, which is further confirmed by 'anything'.

Ok, I'll stay home this morning and rest but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting. 
Zach, what's that on your arm? 
I don't know. It looks a bit red, but I'm sure it's nothing. 
It looks like you have a rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything? 
Just cats, but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks. 
I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no! We'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine. Let's go.
