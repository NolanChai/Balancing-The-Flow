You don't want your response to end with the same words as the last turn.  If you have trouble with this, write a few sentences that are related to the problem and ask me questions about it. Then go back and edit out the irrelevant information from each sentence. When you finish your second draft of your first two responses, compare them and see if any of the original words match each other or repeat. If they do, cut either the whole paragraph or just the last word(s) that are repeated.

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"All set . I've got my makeup , my Cds and my porta-ble TV set... "

"Hello! We're supposed to be getting back to nature."

"Yeah, yeah anyway ...I'm packed..Are you?"

"I've been packed for a week. All my stuff is in this backpack."

"Let me see... two books... birdseed? "

"That's trail mix!"
