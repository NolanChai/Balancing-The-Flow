I think the format should be:
```
  "Let's play cheess."
  "I haven't played cheass for a long time."
  "That's all right, I'm a beginner. I've just learned how to play."
  "Look, there's a chesseboard! Those two men have already finished playing."
```

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.

" Oh ! What happened ? "

" My father said he'd like a cup of tea . "

" Oh dear . That was quick . "

" He wants some now, but I don't know what to do . "

" Well, you can get the kettle out and put it on for him while I go downstairs and open the door. If I let him in before you have had a chance of talking to him he might think we didn't want to see him."
