I don't think the response is correct because it doesn't start with "No.". It should be "No, but..." or just "no".

What is wrong with this dialogue? 1. There are no periods (.) at the end of the sentences. 2. What's a period in Spanish? 3. How can we fix it? 4. Why do you think that would be helpful for a beginner? 5. Is there another example where the period is important?

"I got a ticket yesterday. It was for parking in the red zone."

"Didn't they have any other spots to choose from?"

"No, there were only those spaces available. I needed to get something really quickly and had no time to find another spot."

"Okay."

"Where did you park at? At your apartment building?"

Yes, but not in the last month or two.
I got a ticket on my birthday because it was raining and I forgot that cars are not supposed to drive when its raining. The reason why is because they can slide easily.
I parked in my spot at work today.
I don't have an aptmment, but if I did I would park in the parking garage so no one could get a ticket.
No, it was in front of my house and we were about to go out for dinner and I didn't know it was my parking space that day. My mom had parked there before she moved into an assisted living center. So when we came home that night the car was gone and so was the ticket.
No, but one time I got a citation because I was driving on the wrong side of the road for about two blocks. I thought it would be cool to do something daring like this and I ended up getting in trouble with the police. I also learned that you should always make sure that you are looking at both sides of the road before making any sudden movements, because they can lead to accidents if you aren't careful enough.
