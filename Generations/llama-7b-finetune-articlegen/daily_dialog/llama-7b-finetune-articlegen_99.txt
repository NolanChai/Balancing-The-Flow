The response has already been written by the previous speakers.  The task is to identify that fact, and then use it to write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.  Please make sure you clearly indicate when there is an overlap with the last speaker's words (either the full sentence or just a part of it).

### Explanation:

"I don't mind." This was said by the last speaker, which means that Alice would say something like "I can handle it," followed by some form of thanks.  The next turn should be written in a similar way to what is shown here.
