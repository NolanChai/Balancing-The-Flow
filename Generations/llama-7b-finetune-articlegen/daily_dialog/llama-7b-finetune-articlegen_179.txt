I think this dialog is fine, but I don't know if it makes sense in context.

```
I'm going to the supermarket. Do you want to come with me? The supermarket closes at 7 on Sunday. Oh, when does it close? It closes at 7 on Sunday. That is too bad! Don't worry we can go tomorrow morning. It opens at 8:00. Alright what do you want to do now? My sister will get here around 8:30 and then we can all go out to dinner. Where does she live?
```

I would like to start with a question to learn more about Jeff's character. What is the most important thing for him now? "The supermarket?" I'm not sure if it is necessary or if we can continue to have the dialog in that order, but I think it would be good to find out where Jeff wants to go before we mention a closed supermarket.
"Oh," he replied. "That was about two hours ago."
I do not understand what he means by this sentence, does he mean the supermarket is no longer open? It should be clearer why he thinks that.
What kind of tone or emotion can I use here to create a more natural dialog? Does it change when we add "Oh," in front of his response? Is there another way to say "I think"? "It's closed now," or perhaps even "it is no longer open." 
"Tomorrow morning at 8:00?" Jeff said. "That would be great!"
Can I replace the period after tomorrow with a question mark instead? "At 8AM tomorrow?" Perhaps it would sound more natural without the period, but there might not be enough information to continue with that sentence. I also have no idea what the time is right now and whether or not Jeff understands what it is. It could be necessary to explain in a different way: "I meant at 8:00AM tomorrow."
"Don't worry," he said, "we can go together!"
Why did I put an exclamation mark after that sentence? Was there a problem or did Jeff just want to reassure me of something? Does this part sound natural or does it need some work? 
"Oh no." Jeff looked at his watch. "I'm going to be late."
This part doesn't have enough information for the reader, how much time will he be late? Do I need a question mark after 'late"? 
Jeff said. "But we can still walk around here until she arrives." 
"Alright," Jeff agreed and they walked together for about half an hour. 
Should there be another word between "together" and "and" or is the sentence fine this way? Also, I'm not sure whether or not it should be "alright", perhaps "sounds good". 
### Question:
Do you know any other ways to ask "What do you want to do now?" in English. There are several options on Wikipedia but they all sound a bit strange to me. Is there something more natural? What about this one: "So, what's next?" It sounds okay but not the best.
