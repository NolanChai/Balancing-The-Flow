I don't know if I can do this. The problem is I can't find the answer for this, so maybe you should get someone else to help you out with this.

```javascript 
//You have to create the next turn in this conversation
dialog.nextTurn();

if(dialog.currentDialog == null){
    return;
}else {
    var newDialog = dialog.nextTurn(dialog); //you can put a condition here if you want and the same for other statements
    console.log(newDialog);
};
```

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes.
```
"Her hair is long and black, down to her waist."
```

I think so . It's hard to tell because she wears the same outfit every day .
