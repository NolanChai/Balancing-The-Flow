Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

" Ok , then I guess we can . . . "

" I know ! Let's play a game ! "

" . . . have you meet our newest staff member ? "

" Who is that ? "

The next turn should be something like, "Well if you don't have any amenities left, we can just give you some more. Would that be helpful?" or "I'm not sure what a souvenir is." or something else entirely. :)

"Oh , you are so confused . There is a sign by the shower that reads 'If you feel dirty , please use some of our free amenities to clean up !'. The shampoo and soap are there for your personal hygiene needs only . They're not meant for souvenir purposes."

- "I'm sorry sir, I am not sure what amenities you can buy from me."
- "I've heard of soap. Shampoo is new to me though."
- "Oh, well we have all sorts of soaps and shampoos if that's what you mean!"
- "I see! So you use up your own personal amenities and then you can buy more from us? Oh wait, I got it now! So... what is the problem?"
- "What am I going to do about souvenirs?" 
- "Oh, I get it! You want some souvenir items." 
- "Yes, sir! I've used up my soap and shampoo but I still need some for souvenir purposes!" 
- "Okay. If you don't mind the fact that this is not a hotel but a business establishment, then all our amenities are on sale at the shop downstairs. In addition to that there is an additional discount of 20% if you purchase those items from us."
