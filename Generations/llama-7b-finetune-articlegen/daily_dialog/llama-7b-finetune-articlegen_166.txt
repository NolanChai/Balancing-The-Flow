"Why don't you tell her your feelings for her ? "

" I guess she doesn't know . " 

" But if you think I should say something to her , then why didn't you do it yourself ? "

" Because I knew how she felt about me . "

" And I am sure she feels the same way about me . "

" Well, don't worry , I will tell her. " 

" Are you sure ? "

" Yes . "

It is amazing how some people are. I was always a gentleman , I never had any girl friends and the first time I ever dated anyone , I married her within a couple of months. Now, some years later , she left me . She didn't even tell me until a year after that . All I can say is that we weren't right for each other and I still love my ex-wife even though I am currently dating someone else . I hope you don't mind if I introduce her to you in a few weeks ?
