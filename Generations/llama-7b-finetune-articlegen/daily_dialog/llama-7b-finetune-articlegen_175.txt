Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"I don’t really know. We might do well in hockey, but I hear we’re having problems with our goalie."

"That is true. If we don’t win gold in hockey it will be a big disappointment for everyone.”

"Are you sure? Don't you think we stand more of a chance than Sweden?"

"We could but then again they have a very good team and I heard the Swedish Prime Minister was giving them special training. We'll see though."

"How do you think the athletics will go?"

"I think it’s going to be very interesting, especially if we win a medal for our country."

"What do you mean? You don't think we're good enough?"

"Of course not! But it might still happen. It will just depend on how many people turn up and whether there are any accidents in the race or anything like that."

This dialog is a great example of how to structure an instructional dialog. 
You have all the key information that students need to write their own turn and you have structured it so that they are able to understand what needs to be written. 
For students who struggle with writing, giving them information in this format might help them create a turn that is more likely to be correct. 
This could also work as an example for students to follow when they are teaching each other about how to write turns or sentences.
