Help me write the next turn in this dialog without explanation or format changes. 

" I am not married yet, but it is close to my heart. " 

" of course , just like a parent who loves their children . But tell me about work . What are you doing ? "

" well , it's hard to explain how I came to be working here . It started off with a phone call asking me for help from the president . He wanted my advice on how to get through our latest financial crisis . Then he asked if I'd like to stay on in this position . Of course ! Who wouldn't want to make the kind of money that I'm making ? "

" okay , but is it worth it . Working for a company which has an unstable future ? And the one who you are working under ? "

> Oh, I really hope so. I still remember when we first met in high school. It was love at first sight for me. You were such a sweet girl. I will always treasure the memories of those early days with you. Our relationship grew stronger and stronger, until we finally decided to get married after graduation. I have never felt happier since then.

> Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worse soon afterwards. I started getting into debt because I could not find a decent job in my field. I tried everything to make ends meet but nothing worked out. Finally, when Jenn was pregnant with our son, we were evicted from our home and ended up homeless. We spent many nights at the local shelter until one day we finally got accepted into a low income housing project. Things are not as good now because of that. But I'm sure we will find a way to improve our situation again.

> I know how lucky you were in school, Bob. You always had such an easy time with everything. It seems like nothing has changed since then, even though it should have. Life is not fair sometimes and people need to learn from their mistakes before they can succeed. But don't worry about us too much because we will be fine no matter what happens.
