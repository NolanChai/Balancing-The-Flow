I've come to hear about your offer. 

We have the offer ready for you. Let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box, at 20,000 yuan; 20 boxes with 50 waistband per box, at 30,000 yuan; and 15 boxes with other ornaments per box at 7,500 yuan, for shipment in June. The offer is valid for five days.

I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected.

You know the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years. Our prices compare favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere.

I am afraid I canâ€™t agree with you there. I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies.

But you must take the design and quality into consideration. You know we are superior to others in design and quality. We have various styles, which the other companies cannot catch up with.

I agree that yours are of top quality.
