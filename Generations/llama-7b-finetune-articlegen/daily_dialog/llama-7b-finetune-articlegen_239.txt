A. History is about being in the present, not about what happened yesterday or even last year! I do not want to be lectured by a professor who tells me how he/she was taught, which is probably different from my experience. A student has to learn to understand and critically think about the past, and history will never repeat itself unless we let it happen!
B. History repeats because of human nature, and that can be bad or good depending on your outlook. The professor may not have been a great teacher in terms of memorization but was probably good at helping students to understand the past by learning from what happened rather than just reciting names and dates. I would like to learn more about how he/she taught so I could use his/her techniques in my own teaching.
C. History will never repeat itself because it is not possible for human nature to change! Every person makes their own choices and has different perspectives on what happened, so everyone's life turns out differently than the last time this was all said before (and every other time). We are who we were, but also very different from our parents or grandparents. This is a great opportunity to learn more about myself by reflecting on my experiences in comparison with someone elseâ€™s!
D. History repeats because people have not learned enough lessons from the past and will continue making similar mistakes over and over again. The professor might be teaching you some very important things that will help prevent this from happening again, but it's up to us as individuals to listen closely if we want history to change.
E. History repeats because people do not learn enough lessons from the past and continue making similar mistakes over and over again. The professor is trying to teach you some very important things that will help prevent this from happening again, but it's up to us as individuals to listen closely if we want history to change!

Help me write the next turn in this dialog with no explanation or format changes. 

"Are you interested in history? Yes, I am. I enjoyed studying it at school, though I had trouble remembering all the dates, so my teacher never gave me good marks."

"I love history, but I've always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened." 

"I wish you had been my history teacher! I might have got better marks!"

"Some people say that history repeats itself."

"What does that mean? The same events never happen twice, do they?"

"The idea is that the people and dates change, but the reason why things happen stay the same."
