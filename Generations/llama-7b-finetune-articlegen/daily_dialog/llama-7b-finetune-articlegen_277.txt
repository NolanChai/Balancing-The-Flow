I’ll look at the open house list and pick one or two for us to see. Weekends are good because people have more time. I’ll make sure we get there early so you can be back before 6pm if needed. The Sunday open houses are more crowded though, so that’s another thing to consider. Let me know what works best for you.

"Can you do that in the morning, or would after noons be best?" 

"Either way is good for me." 

"There are a number of open houses this weekend in your area. Would that okay with you?" 

"I can take a little time off from work, or I could go on the weekends also." 

"We could meet at the real estate office, or you could pick me up at my home." 

"I am leaving from work, so maybe I could just meet you at the first house that we will look at."

1. Can we choose a time to look at houses together ?
