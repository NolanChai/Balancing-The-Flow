Hello everybody, I would like to welcome Monica to our company. She has a wealth of experience in finance and we are glad that she chose to work for us. I’m sure that everyone here will learn from her professionalism. And as for Monica, you don’t need to be so formal. Call me Bob. Everybody calls me Bob, and it makes things much easier on my end!
