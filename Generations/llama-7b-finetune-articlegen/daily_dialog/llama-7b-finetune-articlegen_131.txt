I am not sure if this will help at all but here goes. 

> "He's probably talking about buying health insurance."  

"Health insurance?" asked his son.  

> "...and the conversation went on in a similar fashion from there, but without the benefit of knowing what kind of health insurance he was considering and why, or which parts were optional for him to buy, etc.. " 

> I will try another line: "I guess you want it because you are worried about your mother's life."  

"Yeah , she is getting old . We have been married for 40 years and she has done everything for me . I will take care of her in my last days too . "

> "...but that's a lot longer than the average insurance policy would cover. And, without knowing his income or any other details, I can only assume he was looking at some kind of long-term coverage (like an annuity?) and not a term policy."  

I do agree with you about the policy being to long for what he is saying. 

> "I think we're talking about a whole different type of insurance here, like life insurance. He doesn't want to buy it because his dad just bought one (the son, not the father), but maybe there isn't enough money in their family for them both to have life insurance." 

The two words that are throwing me off are "not yet" and "thinking about".  I think you are right that it is life insurance.  

> "And, without knowing his income or any other details, I can only assume he was looking at some kind of long-term coverage (like an annuity?) and not a term policy."  

I have never heard this type of insurance mentioned before so I would just add that to the conversation.  But I guess it is possible . 

> "Maybe he wants a 'whole' life insurance, which pays out at some point in time?"  

That could be an option too , but why would you take this type of policy out for someone else if they are already covered?  

I think we should have this conversation.  Maybe I will learn something new from it and maybe a moderator will help us figure this one out.  

> "He may want to take it out for her as a precaution, but he doesn't actually plan on doing so." 

Good point , but why would he not do this?  

I know I am asking alot of questions but I have never seen anything like this before. 

> "I think we should get out of here quickly . I feel like a character in a Stephen King novel!"

- "You should at least think about it . Your mom is a strong woman but we'd be lost without you."  
- "I know and I also need life insurance for my wife. It will take care of our kids in case anything happens to me or her"
