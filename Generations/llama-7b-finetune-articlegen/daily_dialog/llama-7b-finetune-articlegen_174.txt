" Well, don't feel down ! We'll get used to each other in no time! "

" Good luck with your new job ! "

" Yes, you will like it here . "

" You are the second person who started work today . "

" Oh my god, there is a lot of new comers . "

I believe that it would look like this 

"Good morning! I am a new comer in our office." 

"Good morning! Welcome to our office!" 

"Nice to meet you! My name is Grace Williams." 

"Nice to meet you too. I am Peter Smith." 

"Today is my first day at work." 

"Well, hope you will enjoy your first day! Just ask me if you need any help." 

"Thank you, it's very kind of you."
