I know more about your company now than before, so I can understand better what your company is trying to accomplish. It sounds like the company has already gotten some good news on how things are going with the new product and it’s a positive sign that the project has been doing well. If I do get the job, will there be any training or orientation program before getting started?

I am writing the response of the next turn. Please give your suggestions or comments on my draft. 

" That's all the general information of our company I think you already have good knowledge about our company."

" Yes, I have an overall understanding."

"When we have the final results we will call you."

"Then when will I get a reply at the latest?"

"If you pass the interview, the personnel department will inform you within two weeks."

"But if I don't pass will you call me?"

"I'm sorry we won't. You can wait for two weeks. If you don't get a telephone call it means that you weren't successful."

That's all the general information of our company . I think you already have good knowledge about our company . 

Yes, I have an overall understanding.  

When we have the final results, we will call you.   

Then when will I get a reply at the latest?  

If you pass the interview, the personnel department will inform you within two weeks.  

But if I don't pass, will you call me?   

I'm sorry we won't . You can wait for two weeks . If you don't get a telephone call, it means that you were not successful.    

Then do I have the chance to get this job?  

I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself, and I have to discuss it with other interviewers.
