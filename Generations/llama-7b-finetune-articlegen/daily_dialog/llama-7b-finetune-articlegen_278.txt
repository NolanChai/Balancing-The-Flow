"well, I was thinking about having the tikka masala , but I think I'd like the lamb vindaloo instead . What are you going to have ? "

The restaurant was nearly full.

We found the last available table, but there was no reservation.

I'm starving!

Let's take a look at the menu so we can order.

Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share?

I heard that one of their specialties is the samosa.

What are you going to have for your main course?

I would love for there to be an option to skip this exercise. I've never had a turn like this before and I think it's really unnecessary. I think the user could have easily understood that "let's take a look at the menu so we can order" means something is going on here but no, you're just asking what he wants to eat...

We really were lucky . We got the last available table for two—and we didn’t even have a reservation! Did you see the long lines behind us?
Yes, I saw them. But it was worth waiting. Now, let me order food for us. Do you want to share an appetizer?
I heard that one of their specialties is samosa . So I think we should try that first. What are you going to have as your main course?
I think I might have a daal . It’s got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice. Sounds nice! Do you want to share some keebabs too?
Okay, how about some lamb keebab? That’s my favorite! How about drinking wine or beer?
