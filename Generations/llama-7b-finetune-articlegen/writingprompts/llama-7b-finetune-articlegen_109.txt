`` Hang on, you are going to follow the M4 as far as Bristol, then take the A38 and go right?'' My friend exclaims in disbelief. I check my map once more. 
 Right, yes, the A38. 
 Follow it all the way down to Plymouth, ok I say. Then turn left onto the M5 and drive towards Bristol?'' I am beginning to think that this might be some elaborate prank. My friend has been known to do stuff like this in the past . . . 
 But you don't need to go all the way to Bristol, my friend explains. The A38 only goes as far as Exeter. After that you just keep following the M5, but it will take a long time because it is an enormous road! You could just stay on the M4 and follow it south to Swansea and then turn right onto the M40 . . . 
 Hmmm, ok . . . I say, before printing out my directions again. When I check them this time, all seems clear: the M4 is the simplest route. Then, a few minutes later: 
 You've printed out the wrong instructions!' I am confused; did I print the right ones? But then, there it was in black and white: 
 Go to London . . . and follow the M25 anti-clockwise! 
 This can't be right. The directions are obviously a mistake, so I call my friend on his mobile phone (just for confirmation) to ask him where he is going next . . . 
 Bristol, yes! But you don't need to go all the way there: just take the A38 as far as Exeter and then follow the M5. It will be much quicker than following the M4 all the way down to Swansea and back up again!' I can feel myself getting flustered. 
 Well, it doesn't say that in my instructions!'' I insist, but I am beginning to lose patience with my friend's stubbornness. So, he emails me his instructions again: 
 From London, take the M25 anticlockwise and follow it until you see signs for the A38 towards Exeter. Turn right onto this road and keep following it until you get into Exeter. Then turn left onto the M5 South and just keep going on that . . . '' 
 But I've got to go all the way down to Bristol first?'' I ask, almost shouting now. My friend is getting annoyed with me too: 
 No, you can skip most of it! Just follow this road until you get into Exeter and then turn left on to the M5 . . . '' 
 So I print out his new instructions, check them over and look at my map again. They all seem fine; surely he wouldn't give me wrong directions? Then my friend calls back: 
 Just a second, can you tell me where you are now?' He asks. 
 Yeah, I'm just coming down the M25 towards London . . . '' I say excitedly. Surely this must be a mistake; surely there is no way that he wants me to go all the way back to London? I think for a moment: what if I take his instructions anyway and see how far they get me? It's got to be quicker than going round London in circles . . . 
 Uh-huh, I say. So you are still on the M25?'' My friend asks. Yes! ''I say before printing out the new set of instructions again: 
 Go to London . . . and follow the M25 anticlockwise! Follow it until you get past Exeter and then take the A38 towards Bristol. You will need to go all the way down the A38 until you can turn onto the M4 at Gloucester, which is near Swansea.' He explains. 
 Wow, that's a lot of road . . . I say, before printing out my new instructions. As soon as they are printed, I quickly check them over to make sure there isn't any mistake this time: 
 Go to London and follow the M25 anticlockwise! Follow it until you get past Exeter and then take the A38 towards Bristol . . . '' 
 Yeah, that is what he said, my friend says. 
 But I can't do that!' I say loudly in protest. My friend sounds annoyed too: 
 Why not? That is the quickest way!'' He asks. The thing is, I explain, I haven't got enough fuel to go all the way down to Swansea on the M4 . . . '' 
 Oh! Well you can get fuel in Exeter, he says. You just need to turn left onto this road and keep following it until you get into Exeter. Then take a left and you are good to go!' He exclaims. I am still confused: 
 But I've got to get all the way down to Swansea . . . '' I say, before realising what my friend has just said: You mean the M4? Yes! I'm on it now!'' He explains. So, I decide to listen to him for once and follow his instructions. I put my foot down on the accelerator, speeding towards London at an alarming pace. Then I think of what might happen if I don't get petrol . . . 
 Oh no, I say to myself as I arrive back in Exeter, this is it! I've got to go all the way down now?'' My friend doesn't understand why I am getting so worked up. He just tells me that he will email a map of how far I have come and then get on with his journey himself: 
 Here you are . . . let me know how it goes! I say, before printing out my directions again: 
 Go to London and follow the M25 anticlockwise. Follow it until you get past Exeter and turn left onto this road towards Bristol.' 
 Yeah, that's right,' he says cheerily on the phone. I look at my map for one more time . . . and then print out the next set of instructions: 
 Go to London . . . and follow the M25 anticlockwise! Follow it until you get past Exeter and turn left onto this road towards Bristol.' And so, I begin to make my way down the M4. There is a slight problem though: I can't see the A38 from where I am driving, and if I don't find it soon, there won't be anywhere to get petrol! 
 AAAAAAAAAAARRGGHHH!!'' I scream in frustration as I stare at my map. This must be some sort of joke: surely I can't be this far away from the M4? I have gone for miles and yet still no sign of it . . . 
 Okay, so what now?' My friend says on the phone when I call him back. You need to get off the A38 onto the A30, which will take you over into Cornwall,' he explains. Well, that's good news! At least I can find my way there; and if I do run out of petrol again, there is bound to be a garage around somewhere . . . 
 So far so good!' He says before printing out his next set of instructions: 
 Go to London and follow the M25 anticlockwise. Follow it until you get past Exeter and turn left onto this road towards Bristol.' Then, when you see signs for the A30, take that and keep following it . . . '' He explains. This is it! I can't go any further down the M4; at least with these instructions, there is no danger of me getting lost again. My friend sounds pleased on the phone: 
 That should get you to Swansea in plenty of time!' He says before hanging up the phone. But still, something about this situation doesn't feel quite right . . . 
 The thing is, I say aloud, my friend gave me the wrong instructions in the first place! Surely he wouldn't have wanted me to get all the way down to Swansea and back again? He must be messing with me somehow! 
 No, no!' My friend says. You don't understand . . . it is faster to go this way because of traffic on the M5.' Okay, I say, before printing out his instructions for one last time: 
 Go to London and follow the M25 anticlockwise. Follow it until you get past Exeter and turn left onto this road towards Bristol.' Then, when you see signs for the A30, take that and keep following it . . . '' I say, before checking my map once more. 
 That should get me to Swansea in plenty of time!' I say aloud as I stare at my map. My friend sounds pleased on the phone: 
 Okay, I'm going now!' He says, before hanging up the phone. But still, something about this situation doesn't feel quite right . . . 
 You see, it is just that last bit of the A30 which you are worried about?' My friend asks. Well, yes, but what if he has given me
