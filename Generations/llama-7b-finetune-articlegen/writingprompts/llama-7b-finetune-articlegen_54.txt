* In 20XX a new spacecraft was built on top of NASA's latest technology. Two astronauts, Jim and Sam were put into cold sleep and launched into space towards planet earth in search of alien life and an advanced civilization. They reached the destination within 6 months. But upon their arrival they saw nothing but barren land. They were both disappointed because according to legends this planet should be inhabited by a highly evolved species of intelligent humanoids. The only thing that made them happy was that this was an actual blue marble, unlike any other planet in the solar system. They decided to start a journey around earth and find some kind of sign that life existed on it. The first stop they arrived at was the Sahara desert. They saw that there were no human beings or even animals for miles but a small herd of camels were grazing along the edge of the horizon in the distance. Jim had an idea so he took out his trusty gun from its holster and shot a bullet at the ground. The camel sensed danger and quickly ran off. A couple of minutes later two men appeared with guns pointing at Sam and Jim. They were robbers. But Jim quickly pulled out his gun and started firing in all directions; the thugs soon ran away after they realised that their weapons could do nothing against Jim's guns. The astronauts had successfully taken down two humans on earth, a feat only accomplished by alien invaders. They were getting excited about their new found powers but they needed to find some more humanoids so they could test them out on them too. So they went off in the direction of the camel herd and they soon arrived at an oasis where two beautiful women came to greet them. Jim wanted to take a closer look at one of them and so he took out his gun and aimed it at the woman's chest, but suddenly something strange happened. The bullet was deflected by the woman; she then turned around and started shooting back with her own gun. She shot Jim in the arm before they both ran away. Sam realised that these humans were much more advanced than he thought. He was beginning to like this planet already. The next stop on their journey took them into a dark, cave-like structure filled with skeletons and bones of long extinct animals. They saw something that looked like a dead body in the corner and so Jim shot it; but after taking a closer look he realised that it was only a sculpture made out of stone. The next stop on their journey took them to a mountainous region where they found some tribesmen with primitive weapons, making war on each other. Sam shot one of them while he was not looking and the rest all started chasing after them; fortunately for them an ancient volcano erupted just in time to save them from getting caught by the tribesmen. After escaping the lava-filled valley they arrived at a city called 'Cairo' which had many skyscrapers, cars and people living normal lives. They were now on the brink of realising their dreams; that of finding advanced humans on earth who could possibly be able to answer all of their questions about life on this planet. They found some men at a bus stop but they didn't have guns or any other weapons with them which surprised Sam. So he went up to one of the men and tried talking to him, but the man did not respond and so Jim shot him in the head; he then went up to another guy and repeated the process only for that person too to be shot in the head. Then a woman came up behind them with a gun and pointed it at their backs; Sam realised that she was the one who had been talking to Jim earlier, which confused him since she was human but Jim spoke an alien language so how did he understand her? Then suddenly everything became clear; humans could evolve too! The woman shot Jim in his shoulder before running away. She was a police officer who had come to investigate why a man and a woman were shooting people on the bus stop. Sam managed to get away since nobody was chasing after him, so he took out his gun again and fired at the nearest building; a large explosion occurred soon after which covered everything in smoke and debris. The two astronauts survived but now they had to escape because there were many police cars racing towards them with sirens blaring. Sam quickly realised that his spaceship was parked nearby so he ran towards it, climbed inside, started the engine and began taking off into space. He left earth in a hurry and managed to reach the safety of the star ship 40 seconds after launching, but Jim didn't make it; he was caught by the police just as they were about to enter his spaceship which had been parked on top of one of their buildings. The police then locked him up in jail where he remained until humanity was able to take him back with them to earth's moon base station which had been abandoned after its last exploration mission ended with disaster. Jim was taken there by Sam who brought along a robot named 'Bruce' which he used to transfer all of the information about his experiences on planet earth into an audio recording so that humanity would know everything when they got back home and studied these recordings. But unfortunately for both astronauts, humans did not make it off this world before their sun went supernova; destroying every living thing within its proximity including earth itself!
