I agree. I think it'd be great if they could wrap up the story lines for everyone without making it a total clip show. In fact, I would much rather they not go over everything in detail than have them just cut to commercials every few minutes and make me miss stuff. They can do so many things with the ending episodes that will tie up all loose ends and leave us with warm fuzzies for the rest of our lives.
