The bartender at The Tipsy Goose was looking over his shoulder while he wiped a pint glass when suddenly he saw a man stopwatch in hand. "Is that your watch?" asked the bartender. The man replied, "It is not quite finished yet." The bartender continued to watch as the man took out his phone and quickly put it away. "I do apologize," said the man. He flipped over the gate and briskly walked to the door. The bartender looked up to see the man standing at the door. "Would you like a drink?" asked the bartender. The man replied, "Yes please."
