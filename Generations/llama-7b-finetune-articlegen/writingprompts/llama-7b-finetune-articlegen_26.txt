It is quite interesting that you have been writing for so long. Thatâ€™s dedication to the craft of writing. I hope one day to be as dedicated. However, at your age you should have a lot more life experience to draw from in order to write. You should try reading some poetry that has been published or stories that have been written by adults. This could help you with your poetry. Good luck and keep on writing.
