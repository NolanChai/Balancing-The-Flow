`` Are you sure this is what the instructor wanted us to do? '' 
 
 He shrugs his shoulders and says: `` Yeah, I guess so. I mean he didn't seem all that happy but...'' 
 
 They turn to leave, when suddenly the door flies open and an angry voice bellows at them, saying they should put everything away. 
 
 They stare back at him, bewildered: `` We were n't doing anything! '' 
 
 He turns red with embarrassment. 
 
 She says: `` Oh... yeah! Sorry!'' And runs off to put things back in their places. 
 
 He follows her and stops her outside the classroom, saying she must be mistaken about putting things away because there's nothing wrong with what they were doing. 
 
 She shrugs her shoulders and goes inside the room anyway. 
 
 He remains outside for a while and thinks of asking her out to dinner later that night... 
 
 He thinks he has seen her somewhere before...
