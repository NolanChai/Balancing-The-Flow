Jessica's cheeks reddened and her eyes looked down at the floor.  
 'I-I, umm, I just got mad.' She mumbled in a low tone of voice.
 
 `` Umm, okay... well what did you want?' Mark asked with a grin. 
 
 `I don't know...' She shook her head and sighed. 'I... uh, I just wanted to see if it would hurt.'
 
 `` Okay, that's fair...' He replied in his usual monotone voice. 'What do you wanna see next?'  
  `I don't know!' Jessica yelled at him. Her voice was a little high pitched, but she did her best to keep it down. 
 
 Mark rolled his eyes, and then leaned on the wall behind him. He looked over his shoulder at her again, but this time with a smile.   `Well, there's a few things we can do. You could come sit up here,' he suggested pointing towards the ledge of the roof where she had been sitting before they started fighting. She hesitated for only a moment, and then walked over to him. As Mark turned around so she could sit on his lap, he looked at her with curiosity. He wasn't sure how to feel about this new development. He had never had a girlfriend or even really liked girls all that much before... but now it seemed like there was an opportunity for more than friendship between the two of them. 
 Marks hands held onto Jessica's shoulders gently and he began moving them around, looking at her from every possible angle. His eyes lingered on certain areas where she had a bit of a softness to them or where his hand brushed against a bit of flesh peaking out from underneath her clothing. He could feel himself getting excited by all this and his heart began beating faster as he stared at her chest for several seconds before turning away suddenly. 
 `` Sorry...' Mark mumbled, blushing in embarrassment. 'I'll stop doing that now.'  `Oh...' Jessica replied meekly. She had been a little uncomfortable with it at first but as the minutes passed and he continued to stare her body felt less and less like it was on display for all to see, even though she knew full well it was. She reached out and grabbed his hand that was holding onto her shoulders and squeezed it lightly before putting it back down again. 
 Marks face turned red once more when he realized what had happened with Jessica's hand... but then quickly recovered as she went on speaking. `Well, there's also some other things I want to do,' she said with a smile of her own now that she felt less self-conscious about it. 
 `What?' Mark asked curiously, his eyes scanning over every part of her body once again. `Like what?' He stared at the ground for a moment as he thought about what might be on her list. 'Well... I want to feel your chest, see if it's soft and warm like mine.' She replied while smiling with anticipation at him.  
  `Okay,' Mark said slowly. His thoughts were racing at an alarming pace now as he tried to figure out what she might do next. He didn't know if he had time for more than one thing though, and even if they got through everything quickly enough there was always the possibility that someone would walk past them or see their movements from down below on the street outside of this building where they were currently sitting.  `You can start with me,' Mark said finally after a few moments passed by without either of them saying anything else. He held out his hand to her again but this time he used it as an invitation for her to touch him instead, rather than just looking at her body like before. Jessica reached out and took hold of Mark's wrist with one hand while he let go of hers with the other; she felt like she was being pulled in closer by some invisible force when they made contact but then quickly regained control over herself as their palms met firmly together on top of each other. 
 Mark turned his head away slightly from her and closed his eyes, trying to get rid of any thoughts that were running through his mind about what might happen next; he didn't want Jessica feeling uncomfortable or embarrassed because she had done something wrong while they were touching each others hands. But then... a few seconds later he felt her hand slowly move upwards towards where they were facing away from each other, until it reached just below his collarbone which caused him to open his eyes again and look back down at hers with a small smile on his face as if she had done something right in some way instead of wrong. 
 `You like that?' Mark asked casually but also with excitement written all over his face at the same time because he wanted her to say yes.  `Yes' was all that Jessica could muster out before taking a deep breath and then quickly moving her hand higher up towards where their faces were now positioned so close together that he felt like he could almost kiss her right there if they both leaned in slightly more than what they already had been doing before. 
 The next thing either of them knew Mark's lips found hers but without warning, which left him a little surprised at first until he realized how much he liked this feeling and then decided to continue pushing his luck by placing another kiss on her neck too; although he was careful not to bite down hard or anything like that because there was no telling what might happen if she didn't like being touched there. 
 As Mark began moving back up towards the area around their faces, Jessica had a feeling that something else might be about to occur before long and so she held him tightly against her own body with both hands while giving him an enthusiastic kiss on his lips again for good measure just in case he wasn't quite sure what was going to happen next either. 
 The pair continued their kissing session for a little bit longer than Jessica expected before Mark pulled back slightly and looked at her with that same smile still on his face, although this time it had grown even more as if he were about to say something funny or maybe ask her out on a date or something else completely different but exciting nonetheless. 
 `So...' was all Jessica could muster up after realizing how far they had come in such a short amount of time and then she quickly added, 'I want you too,' as she turned back around so that their bodies were facing each other again with her hands still holding onto his own. Mark smiled widely at this point and he leaned forward slightly before kissing her once more before pulling away from the kissing session completely because they had been in close contact long enough for him to feel like something else might be about to happen next, which was exactly what happened when she reached out her hand and touched his face with the tip of one finger. 
 He looked at her as if he were about to say something but then stopped himself before turning back around and putting both his hands on top of hers so that they were now intertwined together in a way that made it feel like they had always been meant to be held by each other's hands from the very beginning. 
 As Jessica looked down at them holding each others hands, Mark smiled again because he felt like she was looking up at him with such a beautiful expression on her face right now and it gave him goosebumps all over his body as well; so much so that he couldn't help but lean in for another kiss before pulling away again just long enough to say something else which caused the next thing either of them knew they were back to making out with each other once more. 
 The pair continued their make-out session until they heard a loud knocking sound coming from below that seemed like it might be coming from someone who was trying to get into this building but wasn't quite sure how or where exactly he should be going first because of all the doors that were closed off here. As soon as Mark heard this sound he quickly turned around towards Jessica, causing her body to fall backwards slightly before she caught herself on top of his and held him tightly against her once again; it didn't take long for either one of them to realize what was happening next however which meant that they were both leaning in close enough for another kiss even though neither one wanted this part over with just yet because there was still so much more love between these two people than they had ever felt before.
