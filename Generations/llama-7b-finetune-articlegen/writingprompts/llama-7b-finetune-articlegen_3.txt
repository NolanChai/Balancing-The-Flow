I took a step forwards, but Wealthy pushed me away and struggled to stand up on his own. Biters people grabbed my arm and held me back. I couldn't tell if she was angry or concerned.

 `` Why would you do that?'' she said. Her voice was shaking. 
 
 I shrugged and pointed at Wealthy's leg. ``. . . he fell on it.''.  
 She took a step away, but I didn't let go of her arm.
``You're right. It was my fault,'' she said softly, and walked back to him.
 
 ``I'll take care of you, Wealthy. Just stay still for now.''.  
 Biters People touched his leg again. I took that as a sign to leave.

 I looked at Biters People's shoulder as she bent over Wealthy. It was a mess of scars, old and new, but none were fresh or bleeding. She could have handled herself in battle, even against me. And yet, she wouldn't raise her hand to defend Wealthy, even though he wasn't being very considerate at all.
 
 ``I know you don't want a big group of people around. Just . . .'' I paused, and pointed my finger at Wealthy, ``just ask me for help next time.''.  
 She smiled at that, but not in an angry way this time. Her voice was gentle when she spoke again: ``And if it's a choice between me or him, he gets first pick?''. 
 
 I shrugged, and she nodded as Wealthy stood up. He waved to us. 
 ``I'm fine,'' he said. Biters People helped him on to his feet, and I stepped aside to let them go. 
 ``Thanks for the help,''. She glanced at me with a smile. I shrugged again, and followed my sisters home.
