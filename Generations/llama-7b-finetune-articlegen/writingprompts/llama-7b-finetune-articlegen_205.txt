The most impressive thing about his visit to me is that he is not only very strong but also intelligent.
 
 I have been wondering why someone would want to tell the CIA what they were doing in my house for months now. That would be a stupid move to make, because they could easily track your every move from here on out. What if you had to travel or something? You'd never know where they are until it was too late. 
 
 It is good that he has visited me as well as the other person who came over today. They were both nice enough people and very pleasant company, even though their intentions may have been suspicious at first glance (but not for long). I hope my journal entries will help keep me safe from any further attacks by those two individuals or anyone else! 
 
 It's a shame that someone who seems to be such an amazing person could become so easily misled. I guess this just goes to show you what kind of person he really is--a little bit scary sometimes but ultimately very charming and likable at heart! 
 
I am happy with the way this journal entry turned out; it makes me feel like I'm being taken care of by somebody who cares about my well-being, which can only be good for me in terms of morale. Thanks again for visiting us today; we really appreciate everything you do!
