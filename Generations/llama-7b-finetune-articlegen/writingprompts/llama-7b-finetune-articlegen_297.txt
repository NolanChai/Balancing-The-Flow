`` Well, you can get up if you like but I wouldn't advise it. You might see one of them and die. We have plenty of room down here. And food too! I'm not going to be the one that gets eaten by a zombie because you just had to leave my arms to go watch the sunset or whatever it was that got us into this mess in the first place. So just stay down here. You will die anyway eventually, but for now we have some nice food and water and I think a few bottles of whiskey left. I'm sure we can figure something out!
