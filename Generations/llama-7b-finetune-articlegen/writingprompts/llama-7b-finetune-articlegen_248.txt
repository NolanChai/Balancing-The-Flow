When i saw the shops I just wanted to get out. I walked away from them all. I closed my eyes and imagined a world without these terrible places. 
 But then one caught me! It was the most evil shop ever, with a big sign saying 'Sale!' A great idea came to me. This was a good thing right? The best thing that would have happened.
