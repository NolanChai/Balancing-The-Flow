The plauge hit the town of Gullmarr one day and left it with only five people; Sarah and the children from the orphanage. They were the strongest, healthiest in the area, and the most resourceful. It had been over two months since anyone had seen or heard from outside towns and villages and they were starting to get restless. The children wanted more than anything else to go out into the world, but Sarah knew it wasn't safe yet.
 
 In her mind she'd written a list of items needed to be safe: food, water, shelter, clothes, weapons, medicine (if there was any left), and a map.
