The goal is to implement a class that contains a "head" property with the default value 0 (the value was changed from zero in v0.1) which indicates how far the player has progressed through the level and an "eyeFloatersGliding" property which controls the number of eye floaters moving across the screen at any given time. The class will be implemented as a module but must also have a constructor so that a new instance can be created with default values.
