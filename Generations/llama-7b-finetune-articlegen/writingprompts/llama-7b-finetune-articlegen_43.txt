`` Gentlemens!'', a dozen voices repeated.

Faither Richardo continued.

```
`` As you know, we have been tasked with the building of a new church to replace that of Saint Marys, which was tragically burnt down during last year's riots. We have all worked tirelessly in the design and construction stages of this project - and I would like to congratulate you on your efforts so far.'
```
Faither Richardo paused for a moment.

`` And now, with only four months until the new church is to be dedicated to God, it is time we started planning the interior design. There are many beautiful stain glass windows in the local area that could be used in our church and I want us to start thinking about which ones would suit best.' 
Faither Richardo smiled as he began to walk through the room, pausing at each window to describe its beauty before moving onto the next. `` This one is particularly beautiful,' he said. 'The colours remind me of Saint Mary's choir robes. I think this would be a perfect addition to our church.' 
Faither Richardo pointed to another window. ``. . . but this one here, has too many bright colours for my liking and, while beautiful in their own right, I feel that it may distract from the beauty of the rest of the church.'' Faither Richardo walked back into the middle of the room and raised his hands above his head to silence the chorus of opinions. 
```
 `` Thank you everyone for your time,' he said. 'I will meet with each of you over the next week to discuss your choices in more detail.' With that, Faither Richardo turned and left the room. 
```
 Faither Richardo spent a few minutes on his way home thinking about the stain glass windows. He had been happy with how much he had managed to get out of all the gentlemen at the meeting but was worried about one man in particular - Father Michael. Father Michael, as well as being an important member of the congregation, was also Faither Richardo's brother-in-law and his best friend. It would be awkward if he didn't support the window that Faither had chosen for the church but . . . it was just so beautiful! 
```
Faithers Richardo arrived home to find Father Michael waiting for him in his living room. Faither Richardo sighed, hoping he wouldn't have to tell him about what had happened at the meeting. `` Well? How did it go?' asked Father Michael. ``. . . well,' replied Faither Richardo. `. . . I think we will need to talk more in detail later but I am worried that you do not support my choice of window.' 
```
`` I have always supported your choices,' said Father Michael. 'You are a great leader and I would never doubt you''. `` It's not as simple as that!' Faither Richardo responded, frustrated by his brother-in-law's insistence on supporting him. `` Come into my study,' he said. ``. . . we can talk there.' 
Faither Richardo and Father Michael walked through the house to a small room at the back of the building that doubled up as Faither Richardo's office and a place to store old furniture. The two men sat down in Faither Richardo's desk chair and started to talk about the meeting, the window and all the other details associated with it. When they had finished their discussion, Father Michael stood up. `` I am sorry,' he said. `'. . . I will support your choice of window.' `` Thank you!' replied Faither Richardo as he also got to his feet. The two men walked back to the living room and Faither Richardo sat down next to Father Michael on one of the sofas, placing his arm around him. They both turned over at the same time and looked out of the window. The sun was just beginning to set behind a nearby forest but they didn't need it to see that the stain glass window they had been talking about would be perfect for their church. 
```
As Faither Richardo and Father Michael sat back on the sofa, they couldn't help smiling at each other. They had come up with a plan! ``. . . we should go for a walk,' said Father Michael. `. . . I think it would do you some good.' The two men walked down to the end of the road and started heading into the forest that surrounded the house on three sides. After walking through the trees for about twenty minutes, they found themselves at the edge of a small clearing with nothing but tall grass all around them. ``. . . we can sit here,' said Father Michael, patting down the grass where they were standing and then lying back onto it himself. Faither Richardo followed suit and after a few moments of relaxation in the sunlight, both men sat up again and started talking about what they had been discussing for the last two hours. 
```Faithers Richardo and Father Michael spent the next ten minutes walking through different options of how to get Father Michael's support for the window without him having to actually say he agreed with it. The conversation continued for another thirty minutes before Faither Richardo thought they had found an idea that would work - ``. . . I have a friend who knows one of the people in charge of the glass works,' said Faither Richardo, walking through his idea with Father Michael as they walked back along their trail to get home. `` And?' asked Father Michael when he finished talking. `. . . and we can convince them that this window is the one you want - because it's so beautiful!' 
```Faithers Richardo and Father Michael smiled at each other again as Faither Richardo started walking down their trail towards home, leading the way for his brother-in-law. They had just come up with a plan to get rid of Father Michael's objection without him realising - or saying that he was against it! And all they needed now was to talk to someone at the glass works who would agree with them . . .
