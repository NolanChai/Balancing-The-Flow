A: A man and woman are on a date, they get to a crossroads and the man says "I'm hungry, do you want to go eat?" The lady says "No". They get to another intersection and the man asks again, "You wanna go eat now?", she said no again. As soon as they reach their destination, he turns to her, looks in her eyes and kisses her passionately on the lips. She is shocked at how unexpected this was, but then she realizes what happened.

### Explanation:
This story follows a theme of "it's always the woman's fault," so the first question would be "Why does it have to be the man who wants to eat?" It could just as easily be a female asking the male, and there is no reason for why men should get to eat before women do. The second thing that needs to be addressed is the fact that a woman can say no to anything without consequence. If a woman says she's not hungry, she is not required to give an explanation or even eat if she doesn't want to. And in this scenario, there is still no reason why a man should have to take his date out of their desired location and find somewhere else that serves food for them both. If the woman says no again at these other locations, it would be reasonable to assume the date is over. The third thing is when he turns around, looks in her eyes, and kisses her on the lips - why would he do this? He clearly did not want to eat at any of those places that she had indicated were okay for him to take her to (as she said no), so why does he change his mind after they reach their destination and kiss her out of nowhere? Why didn't he just ask again if she wanted to go eat, instead of turning around and kissing her?
