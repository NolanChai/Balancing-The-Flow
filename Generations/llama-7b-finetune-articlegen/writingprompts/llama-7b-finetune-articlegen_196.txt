The next morning the sea was choppy and he couldn't find the rock.  
He tried again, and again, but as the weeks passed, he found it more difficult to locate. He felt a strong urge to tell his fellow mermen about this, but when they asked him where in the ocean he had been playing, he hesitated for too long before telling them that he'd been in a secret place far away from theirs.
 
 He was sure it wasn't a lie, and if only he could find the rock again, he would tell them about his adventure. In fact, he felt certain that one of these days they would be able to see for themselves where he had been. It was a wonderful place!  
In truth though, he knew there were no such things as hidden oceans, and no such thing as a secret rock in the ocean. He did not tell his friends about the sea's most mysterious creature - the mermaid, who lived somewhere in the ocean, but nowhere near any known rock or reef, in a place that no one had ever seen or even heard of.
