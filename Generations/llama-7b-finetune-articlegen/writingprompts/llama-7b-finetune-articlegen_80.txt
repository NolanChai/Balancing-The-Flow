I'm sorry my friend went away, but we didn't have any milk. Maybe he can come back later? I hope you get to see him soon! It would be nice if you could meet a new friend while he is gone. Do you like cats and dogs too? I think they are both good pets. Please don't let your mom tell you that you should just eat meat for dinner; we don't need as much food to survive without milk.

I know the milk is not enough for me anymore, but there was no way I could get any more of it before you went away! My dad gave me some food after school, so everything will be OK again soon. Please come home and visit us whenever you can. We all love you very much!

I'm sorry that your friend isn't around anymore. I know it was hard for him to leave without saying goodbye to everyone in the house, but sometimes that happens when people are away from home too long! It will be nice if he comes back soon though because then maybe we can have another sleepover together sometime soon too! We'll miss having fun together while I'm gone; especially when it gets cold outside (which is going on right now). The snow piles up so quickly in this weather, which means that we don't get to play with our sled anymore!
