You think this is a joke? What kind of game are you playing with me?  
 
 I was on my way to visit my grandma when I saw something shining brightly from the corner of my eye. I quickly pulled over and as I looked around, I spotted a small box in the middle of the road. The box seemed to be glowing from inside! As soon as I went for it, I was hit by a car.
