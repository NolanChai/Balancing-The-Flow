I guess I was right after all, she thought. The tall man escorted me silent down the long empty corridor. The florescent lights evenly illuminate the stark white walls periodically broken by the frame of a closed door. As we near the end of this long walk, I could feel my heart pounding in my chest and my palms begin to sweat. In all honesty, I never thought it would come to this. I never expected it, not after all those years. But here she was, just as they predicted. Her dark hair wove around her face as if it were her own personal prison. Her eyes glazed over and a sad smile crept on her lips. She had been waiting for this moment for so long. The door opened to reveal the room in which I've never seen before. It was an interrogation room, plain and simple. There wasn't anything special about it except for one thing - it was the perfect size. All that could fit in there were a small table with two chairs on each side and nothing else. She sat down as if she had always been there, waiting for me. As I stared at her, I couldn't help but feel the power radiating from her presence. I knew it was only a matter of time before they would come to get me, but now that I saw her again after all these years...I didn't want them taking away this moment with me anymore than any other day. When we were children, we played together in an abandoned playground near our house; now we are adults and have been separated by distance for so long until finally finding each other again under the same roof as prisoners on death row awaiting execution for crimes committed against society when we were kids ourselves years ago...
