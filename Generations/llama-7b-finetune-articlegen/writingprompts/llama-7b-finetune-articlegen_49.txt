`` Christ, what a niht,'' Petey mumbled to himself as he splashed water on his face in the bar's bathroom. Shelley, his best friend's girlfriend, was having her 21st birthday party outside, and he was feeling a little out of place. She was a nice enough gal, but she never really showed much interest in him -- not that way anyhow . . . . He looked at himself in the mirror for a moment, then ran a comb through his sandy brown hair and started back down to join the party. 
### Explanation:
``Christ what a night'' is an idiomatic expression which means something like 'what a terrible mess'. The original meaning was that Christ (the Son of God) had suffered such horrors, this was how he felt about a bad night out. The meaning changed over time to the more secular 'horrible, shocking or disastrous' which is used in this example.
