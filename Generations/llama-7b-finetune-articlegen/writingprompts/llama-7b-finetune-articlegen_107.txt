I don't like that guy....
```
I felt his eyes upon me as he ate, no doubt he was sizing me up. He seemed a little too interested in my every move and it made me uncomfortable.  I tried not to notice but when I looked at him again he was gone. I started walking fast, but I didn't have any food left so I slowed down. There he was, right behind me, his hand gently touching my shoulder. 
`I don't like that guy...`
We walked on together and talked about our families, nothing too personal but it gave the guy enough to work with. He was a nice guy, friendly even. But I never really warmed up to him or forgot how uncomfortable he made me.  He told me of his family and how they were so far away that they'd never meet again, 
I thought that might be the case for our friendship too....
`I don't like that guy...`
He seemed to know something though, 
he knew all my secrets. Whenever I would talk about my family he'd start to tear up and when I told him of my struggles in school he'd tell me how much I deserved to be there with them. He made it seem as if our friendship was forever but it didn't last too long after that.  It seemed as if he had his own problems, I could hear him crying at night sometimes, but I never said anything, I didn't want to pry.
`I don't like that guy...`
One day though, the whole thing came crashing down on me. He asked if we could meet somewhere else because he felt too guilty eating here after all his problems. He made it seem as if there was no choice but to go with him or risk getting caught up in my troubles. I didn't want that so I agreed, without another word. 
`I don't like that guy...`
So we met up at the beach and he told me of his plans for us. He said it was time for me to become someone else, to move on from who i used to be.  We walked together in silence as I tried to figure out what exactly he wanted.  I thought maybe this could work out after all, if only to get away from the school and friends that didn't understand my problems.
`I don't like that guy...`
So we moved in with him and his family at first it was fine but slowly I started noticing things about them that just didn't add up. It took me a while to see it, he was keeping something from me but then again so were they. They never did anything overly mean but there was always this sense of... 
`I don't like that guy....`
A couple weeks ago I couldn't take it any more and ran away from the house in the middle of the night. I tried to tell them what i had seen but they just didn't believe me, not after everything we shared together. They told me to be happy that there were people who cared about my well being even though I knew nothing could be further from the truth. 
`I don't like that guy...`
So here I am now trying to put it all behind me and move on, but no matter what i do they come back. They remind me of everything i want to forget and sometimes I wonder if it would just be easier to end it all....

I can't believe that guy is still following me...

It was so long ago, I thought I had gotten away from him. Everyone else has too but they always seemed to come back somehow or another. They would tell me of their problems and how i deserved it all.  But I never really listened when they tried to get a word in because i was too busy thinking about my own issues. 
`I can't believe that guy is still following me...`
Their words still stung even though they were long gone, as if they were just waiting for the perfect time to attack again. It happened over and over again until finally I had enough of their harassment and started telling them to get away from me forever.  They would tell me of all these things that i did wrong but i knew it was a lie, something to keep me here at least. 
`I can't believe that guy is still following me...`
Whenever I try to move on though they always come back, it seems like no matter how far away from them i go they just won't leave me alone....

It was a bad choice but at least i tried.

I knew that guy wasn't right for me from the start and I was glad when he left, maybe he was the one to blame for all those years of misery. He always seemed so happy to see me even though he didn't really know what was going on in my head most days.  It almost felt as if he wanted more than just a friendship with me and that scared me, I wasn't ready for that.... 
`It was a bad choice but at least i tried...`
He would ask about everything from my past to the smallest details of my life. He even made it seem like all our secrets were shared now, when in reality he didn't know half of what he thought he knew about me. The way he treated me always seemed wrong and I was glad that I found him out before it went any further than it already did. 
`It was a bad choice but at least i tried...`
He moved on as well, trying to forget the whole incident ever happened. It seems like i'm the only one left holding onto those memories and when he started telling me of all his problems I didn't want to hear it anymore....
