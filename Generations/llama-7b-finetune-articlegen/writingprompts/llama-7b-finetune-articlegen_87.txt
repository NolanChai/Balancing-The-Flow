This is my first codepen project so please be nice. I had no idea where to start and then I found the "Javascript: Learn by making things" book that my brother-in-law gave me last Christmas and it took me two days of googling and learning before I was able to write the code for this project.

### Future Development
I would like to make this a game or something so you can keep your time and try to improve but I have no idea how to do that.
