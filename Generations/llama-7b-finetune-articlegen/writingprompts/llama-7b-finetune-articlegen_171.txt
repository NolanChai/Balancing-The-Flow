My initial instinct is to say it's a trick question but maybe not as you would have seen this in your own work before and not recalled. The second option for the answer is that you were using an eraser which, although it may not be what we think of when we consider the tool, has changed the appearance of the pen and hence the colour. I'm still curious how you knew though!
