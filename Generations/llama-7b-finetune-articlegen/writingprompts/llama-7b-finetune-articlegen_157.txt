<table><tr><td> <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Today</strong> was my third date with Hannah. I made reservations at a fairly pricey restaurant and comb through my hair for the occasion. We walked down the side walk, close enough to show people we were together, but not close enough to kiss in public.<br/><br/>I picked her up, and as soon as she got into the car she started complaining about how it smelled like stinky sweaty man.<br/><br/>“It’s a new leather interior,” I told her. “It should have an odor.”<br/><br/>Hannah seemed annoyed, but not as much as when we got to the restaurant and she realized that we were going out for Italian. Her face was long as the waiter seated us.<br/><br/>“I can’t eat this,” she said. “I’m allergic to gluten.” She tapped her lips with her fork, and then started crying.<br/><br/>I tried to console her and we talked about things that I should have never told her in the first place. After dinner Hannah insisted on a walk in Central Park, where she complained even more about how hard it was for her to see me because of all this light pollution.<br/><br/>“It’s just so bright,” she whined. “I wish we could be out at night.”<br/><br/>I knew I had been wrong, but that didn’t mean I wasn’t going to make her pay for it.<br/><br/>When the date ended, Hannah told me to drive her home instead of walking with her. It was a long way, but she seemed tired so I thought it would be nice to take care of her.<br/><br/>I started driving and it wasn’t until we were well out of Manhattan that Hannah asked why we had driven all the way out here.<br/><br/>“Well,” I said. “I’m going on a date with my friend.”<br/><br/>Hannah got angry, but she didn’t say much for about an hour. Then her face went stiff and she looked straight ahead of us.<br/><br/>“So do you want to get some coffee or something?” I asked.<br/><br/>She looked back at me, eyes narrowed. “You shouldn’t have done this,” she said. “This is a real bitch move.”<br/><br/>I shrugged. “It wasn’t really anything personal.” <br/><br/>“That’s what you think,” she whispered. Then she threw up all over the floor.<br/><br/>I pulled off to the side of the road and Hannah crawled out, leaving a trail behind her in a pathetic attempt to hide the evidence that I had made my move on her best friend.<br/><br/>It was only when I got home did I realize how wrong this had been. She really is a bitch.<br/></td><td> <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Today</strong> was my third date with Hannah.
