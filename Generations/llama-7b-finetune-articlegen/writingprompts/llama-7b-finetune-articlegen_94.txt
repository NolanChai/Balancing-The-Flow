You seem to have missed the point here. There are only so many universes. I mean, think about it, in this one there are an infinite number of copies of you running around and if you were infinite then there would be a copy of you on every possible path taken by any other being. That's not what we see though, because the vast majority of those possibilities simply don't exist. The reason is that there can only ever be one set of choices made in each universe (or at least only one at once) and so many paths are simply impossible due to contradictions or paradoxes. This is why any universe where time travel occurs will almost certainly end up collapsing into a singularity, because the number of possible paths taken by you while travelling back through time means that there will be an infinite number of copies of you running around in all universes and this violates causality which states that anything with the power to cause change can't also have been caused by something else. As for your explanation as to how an infinite being could have only one path, I'd say that is a valid argument. I simply don't know if it's possible.
