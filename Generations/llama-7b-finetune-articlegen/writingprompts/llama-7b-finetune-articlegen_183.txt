A gun is nothing without a bullet. If you do not have enough ammo to kill everyone that you want dead then your gun is nothing more than a decoration for the wall of your house. There is no sense in getting into a shoot out with someone if you know you are going to run out of ammunition and die anyway. You can always give up or die on top of them, but if you run away and let them go unpunished then there's nothing stopping them from coming back and killing everyone that you love. It's just like the old saying: "If it weren't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any."
