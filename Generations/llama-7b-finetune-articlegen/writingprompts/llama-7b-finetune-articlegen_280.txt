- Instructions were not clear
- This task is difficult to perform without a specific plan or objective in mind
  - Example: I didn't know how long I had to find my soul mate, and if it was even possible.
  - A specific plan or objective would have given me more focus on what I needed to do.
- Incorrect approach or execution of task
  - Example: Joan gave me instructions that made no sense (finding a soulmate in 15 minutes). This made me frustrated and less productive as a result of having to repeat the process multiple times while trying to find my soul mate.
- Unclear expectations
  - Example: I don't know how to properly execute this task if I don't understand what the instructions mean or what they entail, but that was not communicated well enough by Joan at all!
