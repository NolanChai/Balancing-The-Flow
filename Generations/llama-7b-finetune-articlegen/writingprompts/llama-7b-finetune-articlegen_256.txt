In 2016 the average U.S. household expended $75,000 in total income, and $18,000 on healthcare costs, leaving a median of around $57,000 to spend on all other necessities and discretionary spending combined. The most recent CBO report suggests that the U.S. budget deficit for 2016 was around $438 billion, with projected deficits increasing to $546 billion in 2017 and $984 billion in 2018. With so many people relying on government assistance, it's easy to see why some people would prefer that their taxes go toward programs like health insurance or food stamps rather than paying for military spending that may not have as much of a direct benefit to the individual. However, in 2017 alone over half a trillion dollars will be spent on defense - nearly twice what was allocated for discretionary spending such as education and infrastructure combined (the second highest amount). And while this does mean that there's more money being put toward national security overall, it also means less available funds for other important issues facing our country today like poverty rates which remain near record highs despite recent improvements due in part to government assistance programs such as food stamps and Medicaid/Medicare coverage provided by Congress over the last several years.
