I think that the correct answer is "it's a metaphor." The author compares their past as being like an elevator ride; he starts in the bottom floor, then goes all of the way to the top, and ends at the bottom again. It's not quite so clear-cut when it comes to the "How," though. As I read through this sentence, there are a lot of possible meanings: how did we both end up on the same elevator, what was our relationship beforehand, what was the setting and sequence of events in which this happened? The last possibility seems more likely -- that the author has some sort of past connection with whomever is riding in the elevator with him. He doesn't mention this person by name or give any other clues as to his identity; it could be anybody from the elevator ride, really. I would say that the best answer here is "I don't know what that means," but the author has provided enough information for a reasonable guess.
