My son opened it for me and I immediately put it on my computer. It is a very nice game with 3D graphics and sounds. The graphics are in 3d, but there is only one player. I wonder why the makers did this? I love playing this game! The first level was easy, so I started on level two. After an hour of play time, I beat the game! I didn't want to stop, so I played again and beat it again. What a great Christmas gift!
