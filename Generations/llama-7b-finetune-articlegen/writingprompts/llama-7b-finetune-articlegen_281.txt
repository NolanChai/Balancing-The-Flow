Well I guess you should get your own room and stuff. 

 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Well I wanted to. But I had no money. So we shared a bedroom with my mom. Mike, he has a room all his own. And it's huge! 
 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah. He was like seven then. It's pretty big for one person. He sleeps in the same room as his dad and brother. I guess his room is too small. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

I guess you were really young when you had me. 

 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah. I didn't even know how to drive yet! So I couldn't take a job and move out. And my mom was still a little bit drunk all the time back then so... 
 
 You kno

### Response:

I think you should get your own room as soon as possible, Arie. You're going to be sixteen next month. I mean if you were a boy, I'd make it happen right now but... 
 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Well Mike was seven then! He should have got his room first. And we still lived in a two bedroom house so there wasn't really any place for me to go. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

I don't think he minded sharing a room with you. But I did. When I was seven. It was my own room, just for me alone. And now it's his brother and him... 
 
 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah well then what about when Mike was five? You were still in there with us! I slept on the floor and you had your whole bedroom all to yourself. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Yeah, but... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 But what? He's seven now and he still gets his own room! He doesn't even know how to drive yet and you make me sleep on the floor. It's not fair, Mike should have had to share a room with us too! 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Okay, okay. I promise, Arie. I'll get you a place as soon as possible. 

 **Ariel** 
 
 No but seriously, he gets his whole room and I have to share with my mom! That's not fair! We can't afford the rent for two places so we might have to move again before the end of this month. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Oh don't worry, sweetie. It will be fine. We'll find somewhere really nice. 

 **Ariel** 
 
 I told you we needed to get an apartment or something. Look what happened last time! 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Well I thought we would be okay this time, but... Yeah maybe it's for the best that we move again. 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh come on Mike! Don't you want a room to yourself? This is not fair at all and I don't even get my own bed! You know how annoying that is, right? 
 
 You kno

### Response:

No I never realized. I guess... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah it is! And you have to share a room with your brother and dad! How come you get so much more than me? Mike, move in with me right now or we're going to have to move again! 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Okay, okay. I'm moving in with you. 

 **Ariel** 
 
 And don't worry about your brother either. He can stay over here too if he wants. It will be fun, right Mike? We'll have to make him sleep on the floor. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Oh no! No! I don't want to sleep with Arie. But we'll see what happens. 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah well it will be fun when we have our own room and stuff, right? I'm gonna get my mom some new furniture for us because that old crap is too gross. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Uh-oh! Now she's going to try and make the whole place new again. 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Yeah, well maybe we can have a sleep over on your birthday, Mike! I bet you want that now? You never get a sleep over at my house so... 
 
 You kno

### Response:

I guess we'll see what happens. 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh come on Mike! Get excited about this stuff because we are finally going to have our own room together like a real family! 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Okay, I am excited. But... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 It's gonna be so fun having our own place where no one else can bother us! And we can do whatever we want when the landlord isn't home! 
 
 You kno

### Response:

We don't have a lot of money. So I think it's best if... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 But you promised me an awesome birthday party this year, Mike! And we can totally throw one in our new room so no one else will be bothering us and they won't even know where to find us. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Well I was just thinking it might be better if... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 What? Do you want me to tell my mom about the party we were going to have this year or what? Mike, you said you would help me get everything! You can't just not do that now. It's my birthday soon and I told everyone already. And they all think it will be at your house. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Well maybe we could... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 But you have to help me, Mike! My mom never even lets me have a birthday party so I really wanted this one to be the best ever and now it's ruined. We were going to have balloons everywhere and food that didn't make my stomach hurt too much and there was gonna be presents for everyone. And you said it would happen in your room! Mike? 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Okay, okay. I will help you with the party, Arie. But... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh thank goodness! Thank you so much, Mike. Please just forget what we were talking about before. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

I don't know if I can. 

 **Ariel** 
 
 So what did you want to talk about? Maybe you and I could do something special for my birthday instead? We could go get pizza or ice cream or something. That would be fun! 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Yeah, okay... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh awesome! So we'll do that for my birthday instead of the party? I don't mind either way so long as I know you want to help me. And Mike, please don't be mad at me about this but could we invite Ariel too? She's been really nice to us and she deserves a chance to have some fun like everyone else too. 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Well maybe... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 But I think it would be nice if we could invite her, don't you? Because that way we can get pizza and ice cream for everyone! Mike, please say yes! It will make me so happy. I already invited Ariel to the party but now she probably thinks it won't happen because of what you said earlier... 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Yeah well maybe we can just tell her that we changed our minds and we don't have enough money for a party anymore. I mean, if we just have to share with her then... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Well how about this? You come over tomorrow morning at around eight o'clock and we can all go get pizza together. And you guys can take Ariel with you too because I know she won't mind that much! Right, Mike? 
 
 You kno

### Response:

Yeah well... 

 **Ariel** 
 
 Oh come on now, it will be fun to go
