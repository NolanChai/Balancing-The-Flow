There was a big, dishevelled bed and I could not remember anything for a moment but after realizing where I was, the events of last night came back in full force. It had been a blur of drinks, dancing and sex, the kind that I rarely find myself involved with.
 
 He remembered one particularly attractive woman he'd met during the evening:
 
 "I can't remember her name but she was pretty and we were together all night long." 

 
 "Pretty?" She giggled. "Well, you don't really need to know my name for it to mean anything to me. I've heard all about your exploits last night from everyone in the hotel." The girl paused for a moment and smiled as she watched Don squirm under her gaze. "I can only imagine what you did to them," she added. 
 
 He thought he'd misheard: 
 "Huh?" 
 
 She giggled again. "Don't pretend it's not true. I heard about all the things that you were doing. That little game of yours, right? The one where you see how many girls you can get into bed with in one night." 
 
 He nodded. "Yeah," he said sheepishly. "I guess it's a bit of a... habit." 
 
 She leaned forward and whispered into Don's ear: 
 "I think I could give you the biggest score so far tonight." Her voice was seductive, and her words were sincere. 
 
 He blushed. "You know how to get me going," he replied with a smile as she reached out and took his hand in hers. 
 
 She smiled back at him before gently pushing him down onto the bed, her fingers tracing the line of his body until they found their way between his legs. He could feel himself growing hard underneath her touch as she began to unbuckle his trousers and slide them slowly down his hips... 
 
### Question:
What's the best response?
1. "Hey! I'm still a bit drunk, so it might be best if we wait until later to start that..." 2. "Oh my god, you know what you make me do?" 3."Come on!"
4. "Wow... this is really hot." 5. "Yes please!"
