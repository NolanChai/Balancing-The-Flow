**Earthquakes ravaged cities, tsunamis flooded coastal towns, famine swept the globe; it was the worst disaster in human history. God had set things into motion to rid the world of its evils. All that remained were the animals that God had left behind for testing, so he could judge the planet for his creation. The final test of the animals came as they began to run down the race track. At the starting line stood the Lion and the Gazelle; they both readied themselves for the race. As the gun fired, off they ran. The gazelle took a large lead on the lion but was soon passed by the lion in the distance**
### Reason:
- The Gazelle was fastest of all animals on Earth and would win 9 out 10 races against it's counterparts, however God needed to test their speed for his creation. The Lion is the King of the Jungle so it was deemed worthy to be put in the same race as the gazelle.
