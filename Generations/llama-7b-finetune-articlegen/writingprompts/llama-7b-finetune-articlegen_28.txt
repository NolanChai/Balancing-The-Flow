I'm sure it's not. If you are here, then there must be a reason why. We all die eventually and when we do it isn't because of the other side of life, but the end of our journey in this world. Thinking that you will go mad is what made you lose control of your body, your mind, your soul; the connection between yourself and your surroundings. You lost your connection to everything else. I think I might have died then... or maybe it was my consciousness that escaped the real world to seek answers in another one. Either way, here you are now, but you're not alone anymore.
