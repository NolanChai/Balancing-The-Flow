I woke up to the sound of a door opening, and the last thing I remember was smelling smoke. I heard someone say, '' I think he needs more clean up'', and then I felt a rush of calmness, as if something bad had been taken care of. My next memory is waking up in the emergency room at the hospital. The first thing that struck me was how empty it was. There were no other patients in sight or in any of the rooms nearby. In fact, I could see through the glass doors leading to another section of the building. It felt as though they had cleared the place out for me alone. My parents and grandparents were there with me but they weren't speaking much. My mother looked up at me when she heard my voice and her face was white. She walked over, took me in her arms and started to cry. I don't know why but it made me feel good that I could make my mother cry again after all this time had passed since the fire. After a while we sat down on some chairs near where they were working on me, still with no other patients around us. We spoke quietly until one of the doctors came out to tell us what had happened. He said it was hard to explain but that he could tell something bad had just happened in our house and that my parents should try not to worry about anything else for now because there were still more things they needed to take care of before we left here together as a family again later tonight or tomorrow morning.
