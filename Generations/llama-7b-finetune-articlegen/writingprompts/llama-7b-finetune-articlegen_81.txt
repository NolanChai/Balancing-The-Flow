There were three men named Mo, Jo and To. They lived in a house made out of gum drops. Every day they would eat lunch together on their front porch which had a peppermint roof. On Wednesdays they ate candy canes with chocolate sauce dripping down their pink tongues, but other days they ate jelly beans. One day Mo said to Jo, "To tell you the truth, I think our house is haunted." He told Jo and To that when he walked by the peppermint roof at night, he could hear footsteps on it. Also he thought the staircase made of licorice was shaking. Lastly, he said every time he woke up in the morning, his pajamas were soaked with bubble gum. Jo and To told Mo to try and find out more about what was going on. He decided to stay at home alone that night and watch for anything unusual. Sure enough when it got dark outside, he began to hear footsteps on the roof of their house. Next thing he knew, there were people walking all over the roof! He started yelling and waving his arms around. Suddenly, a voice came from out of nowhere. "Hey Mo," said the voice. "Why are you making such a scene?" Mo answered, "Well because I thought our house was haunted." The ghost laughed and told him that he didn't need to worry anymore. He then introduced himself as Boo. His friends Jo and To had told him all about Mo and his candy house. Mo shook Boo's hand and said, "Good to meet you! What would I do without my pals." Boo laughed again and said he was just playing a trick on the three of them. He had made up the story that their house was haunted because they were all so lonely. After that day, Mo and his friends never felt alone anymore.
