I meet her here every year and every year I feel like I know less and less. She smile’s as we stand on the lonely trail, the water crashing down not that far away. The sun set has paint the sky in all 
shades of pink and orange. I can hear the waves from far off and it sends a chill up my spine. As she talks I find myself drawn to her more every time. She smiles as we talk about our future but there’s something different, like she’s hiding something from me. Maybe I don’t know what to look for or maybe I just need to go back and read it again.
