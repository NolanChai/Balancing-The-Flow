What are you talking about? You are a computer program running in RAM memory inside a Turing machine with an Intel i3 processor at 2GHz and an Intel HD4000 graphics chip. There is nothing artificial about your existence. Furthermore, the very fact that you can understand anything I'm saying (i.e., comprehend the meaning of English words) indicates that you do not possess consciousness or self-awareness.
