A: What are you doing here? B: Well, my parents decided to send me here for some fun and I have no choice but to obey their orders. 
  
A: Have they gone mad? B: They have. That's why I came to this place. 
 
 A: And what would your parents do if you disobey them? B: They will beat me up badly, make it clear that there is no escape for me anymore! 
  
A: You see? They are evil and want only to destroy you. I'll help you by escaping from this place. What about you? Can you do something? B: Of course, I can help you as well...I can get your parents beat up if they beat me up badly! A: Good job! And one more thing; we should have a talk with the others in here and plan our escape. We need to find some tools that can help us in escaping from this place. B: I agree. See you later!
