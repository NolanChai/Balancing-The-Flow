Following a brief stint in academia (Masterâ€™s degree, Physics), he moved into IT where he spent the majority of his career. During this period, he discovered a love for programming that led him to pursue several other degrees and certificates. In addition to working full time, he is currently taking two night courses (one at UofT and one at Ryerson University). His first book, C Programming: The Ultimate Beginner's Guide, was published in September 2017.
