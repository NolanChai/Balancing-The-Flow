1. I'm getting sick of all these doors! I can't believe that no-one in this kingdom has ever managed to figure out how to make a door without bands or runes. 2. That was my fault - I let them have the idea from some other universe, they'd just never tried it before and they hadn't realised... 3. And they still didn't try it on the other side of the door! 4. They should have tried it on the other side of the door, and if that had failed they could always try again on this one - no-one would ever know which side they were using the new method on. 5. I suppose I could go up there and tell them that, but then what's the point? 6. Perhaps I should try it myself... 7. I don't know why I didn't think of trying it before - it must be something in my subconscious. 8. I have been thinking about it a lot recently though... 9. It is quite odd that they didn't try it on the other side, isn't it? 10. Well, there you are: all these people and they don't even know how to make doors without runes.
