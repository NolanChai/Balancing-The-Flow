It was a cold Sunday morning when we buried my grandfather, James Sr. I still have nightmares about the funeral. I can hear that horrible screaming that day as if it was yesterday. Every time I hear screaming coming from another room in the house I think of my grandpa’s funeral and I instantly freak out. Even though I’ve been to 7 weddings, 1 graduation, 2 baptisms, and so many other events that required a funeral, the screaming still makes me feel ill.
