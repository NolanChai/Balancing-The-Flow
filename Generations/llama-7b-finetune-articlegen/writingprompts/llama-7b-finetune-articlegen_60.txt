The room was silent for about three seconds, before DiCaprio let loose with a long cackle.
"Oh, my god," the actor said. "That's funny!" He then went on to recount what happened at the Globes. When his name came up in the nominations, he said he didn't even hear it because he was so busy trying to calm himself down after finding out his close pal and former 'Titanic' co-star Kate Winslet wasn't nominated for a best supporting actress nod for her role in 'Labor Day'. "I kept saying, 'Kate! Oh my god, where is Kate?'" he joked.
