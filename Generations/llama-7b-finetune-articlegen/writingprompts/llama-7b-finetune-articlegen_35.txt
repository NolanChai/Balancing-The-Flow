The explosion is likely due to over-pressure from the mercury vaporizing in the container at high temperatures. Mercury is a heavy metal and will explode if subjected to high pressure, such as those found on Earth's surface. The liquid metal can expand upwards of 20 times its volume at normal ambient pressures - resulting in an explosion. As for your heat-shielded window: it should be able to withstand a great deal of stress and heat before failing. If this were not the case, then all spacecraft would have exploded long ago due to their high temperatures on re-entry through Earth's atmosphere.
