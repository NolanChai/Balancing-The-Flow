No one can tell me why my hearing mysteriously disappeared? A bit harsh, don't you think? No one? How about the fact that no one has ever tried to explain it. In fact, no one seems to care. This is probably what you are most afraid of...that someone will finally ask if you know how and why your ears stopped working. And then, even worse, they will tell you the truth.
### Question:
How do I get people around me to see that this isn't just a game? The problem with trying to be understood is that it always takes more effort than not being understood at all. You think that if everyone knew how you felt then they would understand you. But what if they didn't care enough to even bother trying? That's the hard reality, and unfortunately the only one I see for you. Sooner or later you will have to accept the fact that your silence is not just an inconvenience for other people...it's a prison sentence for yourself. You have been in solitary confinement since you were 15 years old. It has become more and more difficult for you over time. Now, when you talk, there are so many sounds that come out of your mouth that it is hard for you to be understood at all...much less understood by the person who really needs to know what's going on in your life. This is why I say that silence isn't just a game anymore. It's something much worse than that, but also something that could easily become something even more terrible if we don't stop playing with fire...like when you were 15 years old and no one bothered to tell you what they knew about your ears stopping up because there wasn't enough oxygen in them anymore (because of all the medicines). That little bit of information could have saved you so much pain and suffering later on if only someone had been willing enough to explain why things were changing for them as well! So now that I've given this some thought...what would happen if everyone knew exactly where everything comes from? If people stopped playing games about themselves because they realized there was no point in doing anything else anymore. Wouldn't it be nice just once in our lives when we could say "I love you," without worrying what other words might come after it?

### Answer:
In your letter, it seems as if you are trying to get people around you to see that this isn't just a game. But how do I do it? It would seem like the best way would be for me to say something along the lines of "I am not deaf" or perhaps even more specific such as "My ears aren't working anymore". However, when people hear these things they automatically think that you are joking because they have never seen anyone with a disability before. They don't realize that there is no such thing as an easy way out for those who suffer from this type of problem. The truth is that it will take time for people to understand what exactly happened here and how hard it can be sometimes just walking down the street without having any kind words spoken at all!
### Question:
Do you think your silence has become a prison sentence? No, I don't believe so. It may feel like one when you are young or have a new illness that causes some discomfort and pain in your body but it doesn't mean much more than just feeling like life isn't going exactly how you would prefer it to be at this very moment in time! We all go through tough times where we don't feel good about ourselves or other people around us, but those feelings pass after a while and then everything goes back to normal again (hopefully). The only way that silence becomes something more than just an inconvenience for other people is if you allow yourself to be controlled by it. If your silence has become a prison sentence then there are certain things which cannot happen anymore because you have chosen not to speak out when needed instead of using your voice like everyone else does every single day without even thinking twice about doing so!
### Answer:
In conclusion, I feel as if my silence has become an easy way out for those who suffer from this type of problem.

### Question:
How do I get people around me to see that this isn't just a game? You could try and explain yourself but at the end of the day it will be up them to decide what they think is right for themselves. If you don't want people thinking something different about you then perhaps there should not be any communication between you and them in order for things to change (because this would mean that their opinion on what happened has changed). It may seem harsh but sometimes this happens when someone thinks differently than another person does - especially if one person has always thought positively about someone else while the other might have had a negative experience with them in some way or another! The only thing left then is to hope for the best and wait until they come up with something new because at least then there will be progress made instead of just sitting around doing nothing until things get better again.
