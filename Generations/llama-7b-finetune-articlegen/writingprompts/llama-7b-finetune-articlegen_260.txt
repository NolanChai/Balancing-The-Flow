Caissie: Francine?
Francine: You've just gotta come back to the old neighborhood sometime. We missed ya. And bring that boyfriend of yours.
Caissie: Yeah, we should... I guess.
Francine: We can go bowling. You know what else they have at that bowling place? A snack bar! Pizza and stuff. Yum yum.
Caissie: Maybe. When I get back from London, or wherever it was you went. And my mom's still in New York.
Francine: Yeah, I heard she's up there with some fella. And I guess we know what he does for a living now... huh?
Caissie: It's just that-- I don't want to lose you as friends because of my mom and dad.
Francine: That's right, you're just like us! A regular girl from the hood who'd rather hang out at the mall with her best friend than with her rich parents in a fancy hotel room...
Caissie: Oh Francine! I-- You know what? I can't believe you've been spending all this time here, and you haven't seen any of your old friends. I mean it's been so long. Let me take you somewhere to go shopping or something.
Francine: Oh yeah, like you have money for that. And even if you did, wouldn't your mother want to go? She doesn't know how to shop! You would be better off going with Jackie, I guess.
Caissie: Yeah. Well...
Francine: You know what else? That fella of yours is really nice looking. I bet you haven't been out with him at all since we saw y'all on the street that one time! I think it would be great if you got back together and went out again sometime. He seems like he's got good taste in women.
Caissie: Well, okay... Maybe next time. It was just kind of weird, seeing him after so long without him...
Francine: Yeah, yeah. You know what? I think we should do something together when you get back from London! A whole night out-- you and me and Jackie and that fella of yours! We could go dancing or whatever, make sure he's not an old, tired fart like your dad...
Caissie: Ha ha, I'll put in a good word for him.
Francine: You do that! Heh, we could be rich some day if you can get us some money from him...
Caissie: No, not with Jackie-- she doesn't want to get involved at all. She just wants me to have fun on my own. So I guess I will. 
 
 Francine: It's been so long since we've seen you! Won't your mom be mad?
Caissie: Maybe a little... but, if she asks for her money back, I can always say that we just spent it all on food and movies-- right Jackie?
Jackie: Right. Right...
Caissie: Anyway, how come you didn't come by here anymore when you were in town? 
 
 Francine: Well, we thought about it but then decided that a phone call would be enough for now. 
 
 Caissie: A phone call! You know what I think? I think your mom was just jealous because she didn't have as much fun here as you guys did when you were teenagers... 
 
 Francine: Yeah, I guess you're right. But don't forget about me when you're all grown up and famous! Then we can party together again... 
 
 Caissie: Yeah, maybe then. Bye now. Don't be mad at me if my mom won't let me come see you guys anymore. It was just for a little while, I swear...
