Disoriented, I open my eyes. I can smell the gunpowder in the air, and taste the acrid tang as the haze of the gunsshot starts to drift upon the wind. I see the coward celebrating and waiting for his execution. His arms are wide stretched out towards me and he is laughing a maniacal laughter, as if he thinks that it is funny how his enemy lies dead at my feet. The bullet has taken away everything from him but his life. I look down on the ground in disgust of what I have done. He is not worthy enough to be called a soldier; all he did was run for cover and then fire his gun into the air. What happened next? Who knows, I do not remember it clearly as I have been hit with a bullet, but I believe that I heard him screaming in pain, and calling out for help. I am still not sure if there is anyone else around to answer this plea of mercy. I slowly crawl my way over the dead body; I am determined to do it now. His eyes are open wide as if he was looking at his death. He must have been scared, but there will be no mercy in my heart for him, no matter how much pain or suffering this man has gone through during these last few hours.
