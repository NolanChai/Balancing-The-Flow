SARAH: `The program you were talking about was called "Undercover Boss". I have seen that show before, but unfortunately it is not currently being broadcast in this area. However, there are many other
shows similar to it. One of my personal favorites is called the "Apprentice" where a group of business moguls compete for their own companies. You should check out "The Apprentice". I also love watching "Survivor", especially because they have been in Fiji for many seasons.'
