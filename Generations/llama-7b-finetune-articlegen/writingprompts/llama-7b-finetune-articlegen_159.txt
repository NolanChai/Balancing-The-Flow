“ 100? ” the woman asked, with a smirk and another puff of smoke. 
 
 “ Well, I got a deal for you . . . ” a raspy voice spoke up in reply. 
 
 “ What ’ s that? ” the woman interrupted, noting how his voice seemed to change pitches when he talked. 
 
 “ 200? ” the man said. 
 
 “ You can have it for . . .” the woman began, before her words were cut short by another raspy voice in a different tone. 
 
 “ 300! ” she answered. 
 
 “ Then it ’ s settled, let me check my bookmark for your ID number again . . . ” he said as he searched through his thick files, which were so heavy they threatened to fall over on him if he tried to move them any further. 
 
 “ Oh yes, here you go: 400. ” He then continued with a long list of numbers that the woman seemed to know by heart. 
 
 “ No problem, I ’ ll just take your payment . . . ” She then started rummaging through her pocketbook, and pulled out a large wad of bills from inside, counting them as she did so. Finally she slid two hundred dollar bills off the top of the stack to him. He took it in one hand, and stuffed the rest back into his jacket. 
 
 “ Oh, yes, now I remember you ’ ve got a little problem . . . ” he said, turning away from her. She laughed, and then whispered something to herself as she did so. Finally she turned around again, and started laughing uncontrollably. He was now just standing there with his back to her staring at a large bookmark that rested on the file cabinet in front of him. She had completely forgotten what she was going to say, but was laughing hard enough as it was. Finally when her laughter began to die down he spoke up again . . . 
 
 “ And how long is this contract? ” the woman asked, smiling and looking at the clock on the wall behind him. 
 
 “ Well that ’ s a good question . . .” he started to say before she interrupted him. 
 
 “ What do you mean by that? ” she said with an edge of anger in her voice. 
 
 “ Oh, it ’ s just that, we had a little mix up here back in ’62. You know, one of those little things that happens . . .” he replied. She got angry again. This time the man seemed to notice something was wrong and quickly tried to calm her down by offering to pay for dinner if they went out afterward. 
 
 “ That won ’ t be necessary! I have my own transportation, ” she said with a sharp tone. 
 
 “ Then how are you going to get here? The buses don ’ t run this late, and there isn’t much of anything open around here that time of night . . .” he replied. She smiled again. 
 
 “ Oh I have my own transportation as well,” she said smiling even wider than before. And just like that the whole world went dark for him, leaving only a faint memory in his mind. Then a voice spoke up and asked: 
 
 “ How much did you say? ” he said with a slight smile on his face. 
 
 “ Well . . .” she started to reply before stopping herself. She had remembered now what it was that she wanted to ask him. She then took out her list of questions and began to read them off to him one by one, hoping that maybe he would answer a few. When she finished the last question, he finally replied with: 
 
 “ Well I ’ m glad we got all those questions cleared up . . . ” he said with a slight chuckle and a grin on his face. 
 
 “ Now I think that ’ s enough for today, so if you could just come back tomorrow morning . . .” she replied in turn with her own smile on display, the one that made everyone who saw it want to get closer. She then grabbed him by both hands and started dragging him toward the door, not letting go until he was standing outside of his office again. Once there she smiled at him once more before closing the door behind him . . . 
 
 The man opened his eyes, but as soon as he saw that he had been left alone in an empty room all his previous feelings disappeared from sight. He then remembered where he was and why he was there, and so began to put on his coat and leave the building. Once outside he stood in the cool night air for a moment, and just before heading off to meet his next client for the night, he decided to check back into what had been going on in his office that day . . . 
 
 “ What do you mean by that? ” she said with an edge of anger in her voice. He began to recall everything that she had told him when they met again yesterday, and how she ’ d answered each question he asked before saying goodbye for the evening. It seemed like a typical day at work for him, and so he decided to take out his list of questions from his office and re-read them once more in order to confirm what he remembered . . .
