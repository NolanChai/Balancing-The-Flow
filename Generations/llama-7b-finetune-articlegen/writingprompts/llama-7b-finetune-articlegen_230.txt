From a young age, I always enjoyed reading comics wherein the hero or heroin saves the world. I'd spend hours fantasizing about how everyone worshiped them as they saved the world. It became a bit of an obsession, really. One day my parents decided to take me to a shrink and that was when things took a turn for the worst. When the doctor told me "You can't save the world," I started crying uncontrollably. My father became infuriated at this and told him to leave. The doctor agreed, but not before he said these chilling words: "I wouldn't be too surprised if he tried." This sentence haunted me for days on end. And then one night it came true...

### Instruction 2:
My name is Dr. John Smith. I have spent the last few weeks investigating your case with a fellow psychologist, Dr. James L. McCoy (who incidentally has been murdered by this maniac). We were able to piece together clues and we've uncovered what appears to be an obsession with comic book characters who can save the world from evil. We also found evidence of a psychotic break from reality wherein he started believing that he was one of those superheroes, saving the world from evil people. His rants became so violent and bizarre that we had to remove him from society and put him in an asylum. I am writing this letter to you as a warning; if his obsession is left unchecked, he could become dangerous! Please find it within yourself (and your heart) to keep him there.
