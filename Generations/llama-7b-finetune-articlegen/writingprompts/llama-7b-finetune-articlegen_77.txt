I am so excited to be able to show you all my work!  <br /><br />The only thing that I regret is not being able to finish this course, but life happens sometimes and I had to put aside my dreams for a while, unfortunately. :(  <br /><br />I have learned so much from this course about how to write code properly and also the most important thing: the best practices when creating projects!  <br /><br />This is my first time coding and it has been such an amazing experience. I can't wait for what comes next!
