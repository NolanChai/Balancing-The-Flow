I grabbed the rock above me and pulled myself up. When I reached the top, I was dizzy from looking down so far but also relieved that there were trees at least a mile below me. It took several more minutes of climbing until I found my plane where it had crash-landed into a tree. I ran over to it and began trying to open the door because I figured it might have some emergency food inside. After struggling with it for 10 minutes, I gave up and decided that I would have to find another way out of here.
