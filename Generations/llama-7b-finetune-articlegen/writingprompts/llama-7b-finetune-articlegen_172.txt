This is my view of the Orion Nebula with a 6" refractor and CCD camera. The image is stacked from many separate exposures, each of which was an hour long. I chose a different image for each colour in the image, using Ha (the blue), OIII (green) and RGB (red) filters. This particular view shows the region around IC 348 in which I found the mystery object!</blockquote><div class="figure"> <img alt="" src="/images/puzzles/mystery_solvers/2014-03-07a.jpg" width="25%"><figcaption>Astrophotography by John O'Leary</figcaption> </div><blockquote>
This is the mystery object – a very small, faint, red and circular nebulous object inside IC 348 in the Orion Nebula.</blockquote><p style="text-align: justify;">And here 's how you solved it. </p><p style="text-align: left;"><i> "I've used many filters to image this region, but the mystery object was only visible in the OIII filter (green). It's a small knot of hydrogen gas and is known as NGC 1980. I hope you enjoy the puzzle! Best wishes, John." </i> </p><div class="figure"> <img alt="" src="/images/puzzles/mystery_solvers/2014-03-07b.png" width="25%"><figcaption>Astrophotography by John O'Leary</figcaption> </div><blockquote>

The mystery object as it appears in the Ha (blue) colour image, showing no red at all. This means that this is not emission nebulosity - I think it might be some kind of dark nebula!</blockquote><p style="text-align: left;"><i>"If you look closely in the RGB image, there are some small faint stars around NGC 1980 – these appear to be associated with the mystery object. It's quite possible that all the knots are one object (a dark nebula) but that's not something I've confirmed!
