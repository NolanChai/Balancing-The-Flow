Aw jeez,'' I thought to myself, `` Which one is it?''. The Keymaster had gone back into her lair and would not return for another fifteen minutes. 
I looked around at the lockers in front of me. Some were opened; others were closed, with a key in the door. "It can't be that difficult to figure out,'' I thought. But I was wrong. 

The Keymaster's Ring had over five hundred different keys on it. A couple dozen were for the locker room itself -- the rest were for all of the classrooms and offices in the school building. To make things worse, each individual key had a different code number written on its side. The first few numbers would lock one group of doors; the next few would unlock another. It was impossible to memorize which key was for what door! 

I took out my pen and paper and began to write down all the possible codes on each key, starting with the ones that opened most of the doors in the locker room. The numbers weren't exactly random, but I couldn't figure out a pattern. It looked like a messy puzzle where you have to fill in every spot, except for one or two that don't seem important. 
After a while I gave up, shoved my keyring back in its case, and sat on the bench outside of locker room to wait for the Keymaster. A girl came out of the women's locker room wearing nothing but a towel around her neck and went straight toward the showers. Her long blond hair was hanging down almost to her waist. 
I stared at her. Then I looked away, embarrassed. She must have thought that I was staring at her because she stopped suddenly and turned back. `` Hi!'' she called. 
`` Uh . . . hi.'' 
`` You okay?'' 
`` Yeah, just fine.'' 
`` Wanna come in for a shower with me?'' 
I wanted to say yes -- I had never seen her before in my life and I was dying to talk to someone besides the Keymaster (or at least someone who wasn't as old). But instead I said, `` Um . . . no thanks.'' 
`` Okay! Well, see ya later then.'' She walked away. 
I watched her go -- her bare feet were soft and pink; the towel was stretched out over her breasts like a white bracelet -- until she disappeared into the shower room. Then I got up from the bench and went back inside the locker room. 
The Keymaster had come out, but instead of returning my ring, she just handed me a key. `` You've got one class left for today . . .'' She didn't look at me as she said this; in fact, her eyes were fixed on some spot over my shoulder. It was like talking to someone who was about to fall asleep. 
`` Y-yeah, I know.'' 
She handed me the key anyway and then went back into the lair. I turned it over in my hands. It had a number of three digits on one side (671) and the letter V on the other. The lockers here were numbered too . . . but not all of them! Some, like
