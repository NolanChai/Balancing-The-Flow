"Yes! I can do that!" shouted Carson enthusiastically. "But why does it have to take so long?" said the carpenter, and he looked at me as if I were an alien who had just landed on his planet for the first time. I knew what he was thinking; if it took six months to build a house with all the tools he needed then that meant it would be another three years before he could sell the house and move on, in other words, he'd have no money until then. It was an exciting project because his daughter, who had just got married, wanted him to make her new home on his own land. "Six months?" I asked Carson, with a little bit of doubt. He looked at me again and said, "Yes it will take you that long."
