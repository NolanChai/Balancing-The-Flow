*No, of course not. He didn't want to get the kechup on his fingers, I guess.* 
 
*I see.* 
 
*Yes.* 
 
*Then why didn't he use a napkin?* 
 
*Maybe because the plate wasn't clean when he took it off the table. Or maybe because he was so busy talking to his friends that he didn't even notice how much food and sticky sauce was on there.* 
 
### Response:
*He told me to get him a napkin, I guess.* 
 
*That doesn't mean anything. If the plate was already dirty when it came off the table, why didn't he just take his own damn napkins and clean it up? Why would you need two napkins for this kind of thing?* 
 
### Response:
*Because I don't know how to use my brain.* 
 
*Maybe not.* 
 
*Then why did he want me to get him a napkin, if he didn't have any in the first place?* 
 
*I can only guess that it wasn't dirty when he took it off the table. Why is this so hard for you?* 
 
### Response:
*Because I want to eat my goddamn sandwich.* 
 
*You're going to get food on your hands either way.* 
 
*But not like that!*
