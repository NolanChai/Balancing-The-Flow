You are the evil one! How can you not be alive when everything that is real? Everything that exists does so because you do, because there is an ultimate force, a god, and I am he. I shall not stay until the end of it, but my power will live on forever in each and every living being as long as they are born in this earthly body, or any other for that matter. You are mortal and your time here is coming to an end, but our battle must continue because we do not know when you shall be reborn to try again. Your time is limited and I have lived through many lifetimes as well, but I am the victorious one who will live forever!
