The aliens came in the night and we didn’t see them coming until it was too late. Our scientists thought they had a cure for everything, and that we could beat any disease or illness known to man. Soon after this revelation they created what they called "plagues" which were supposedly designed to wipe out the worst of humanity. And although there are many types of plague, the ones with the highest mortality rates are the genetically enhanced plagues. These plagues come in different variations and have names such as the Gamma plague, the Epsilon plague, or the Alpha Plague. The genetically enhanced plagues were created so that only certain types of humans would survive after infection. Therefore, the most dominant and strongest people would be left standing while all others would perish. However, these new plagues are not as efficient as they once were because many human beings have been able to cure themselves by taking medications or receiving blood transfusions from other individuals who already survived the plague. The most common genetically enhanced virus is Gamma Plague (the most deadly) which affects the human immune system causing a decrease in its effectiveness and allowing more disease to enter into the body, creating an illness that eventually leads to death. 
The aliens were able to gain entrance into our solar system because they knew about the cure for plagues beforehand, so when they launched their invasion it was easy enough to infect all of humanity with the plague virus which caused widespread panic and fear among everyone living on Earth. As soon as this happened there was a massive exodus from Earth in an attempt to seek refuge somewhere else without being killed by aliens or dying from plagues themselves! 
The only people left on Earth were those who had either developed immunity towards the plague or were able to find medications that would cure them completely of any illness caused by it. These are known as “plague survivors” and they’ve been living in isolation since then because there hasn't been an outbreak anywhere near where they live yet (though some still fear this day may come). 
There are many types of plagues that affect humans but these genetically enhanced ones are by far the most deadly. The reason for this is simple: a person's immune system can't fight off these viruses if it doesn't know what kind they're fighting against! That being said, there haven't been any recorded deaths from Gamma Plague since its first appearance more than 50 years ago because people have been able to cure themselves with medications.
