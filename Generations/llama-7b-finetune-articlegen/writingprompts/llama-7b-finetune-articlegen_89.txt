* Vision: We call it that because in many cases, it involves seeing something that isn't there. The ability to detect the presence of an invisible entity (a ghost) or sense their intentions or willpower (psychic ability). I've seen a lot of people use the term 'sight', but that word is also used for any instance when you are using your physical eyes, so I feel it's best to use 'vision'. 
* Defence: The first few centuries were terrifying. Many of our kind was taken by these entities, and while some did survive, they often had to leave their family behind, or be raised by the entity that took them. We decided we needed a way for children to defend themselves from this, so 'vision' was created. All humans are born with white eyes, and at the age of 18, they can choose whether to use their vision or not. It is up to you if you want to join this community, but it's not something I recommend. In fact, I strongly urge anyone reading this to find a way out now...before it's too late...
