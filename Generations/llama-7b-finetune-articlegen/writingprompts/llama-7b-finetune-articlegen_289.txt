The first word that comes to mind when describing Remi is "determination". The second word would be "luck", and the third, "success." These three words together describe his life as a pro athlete from age 8 until the present. In 1968, at age seven, he was the youngest player to ever play for an organized soccer team in Montreal. The year before that he had been asked to try out for a hockey league (in which I presume they were the only player under ten years old) but failed miserably because of his size and lack of skills. It was then, as he recalled, that he made up his mind to be "big". At age nine, Remi joined a swim club where he practiced for four hours a day on top of schoolwork; in his own words, he became an expert at the butterfly stroke and had achieved a few seconds off the Canadian record. That summer, he won 3 medals at the National Games. During high school, Remi was recruited by many universities (including McGill), but opted to go to university in the US for a year just so that he could compete with the best swimmers and "prove himself" which he did when he broke records there. But it is also here that he decided to quit swimming because, as he put it, "I was too small to be an expert". So at age 18 Remi became a football player, making the cut for his university team (McGill). He was injured on his second game but returned to play 2 more seasons. After this, Remi took up biking and became a professional in 3 years. In the summer of '93 he retired from bike racing because the sport had changed, requiring too much training. Since then he has been involved in the development of the sport (particularly mountain bikes) as well as having his own business, "Racing with Remi", which is a travel agency specializing in adventure sports vacations. Throughout these 25 years or so of competing at a high level, he has learned much from mistakes he's made and from people he's met along the way; this learning is reflected in his story as he tells it. Remi's determination, luck and success have taken him on an unbelievable journey which has been documented in "The Dream", a best-selling autobiography published by McGraw-Hill Ryerson.

### Summary:
Remi was not the biggest, strongest or fastest. He did however possess something that many great athletes have: determination and ambition to succeed. At age eight Remi played organized soccer for Montreal's team. When he tried out for a hockey league at age seven he failed miserably because of his size and lack of skills. It was then that he made up his mind to be big, and at age nine joined a swim club where he practiced four hours per day after school along with schoolwork. He became an expert at the butterfly stroke and in doing so broke Canadian records. In the summer he competed at the National Games of Canada where he won three medals. After high school, Remi was recruited by many universities to compete on their swim teams, but opted for one in the US instead so that he could prove himself against the best athletes. He did this when he broke records there as well. But he quit swimming after a year because he wasn't big enough to be an expert (which is what he wanted to be). At age 18 Remi became a football player at McGill University where he was injured on his second game but returned later that season to play two more. The following summer he became a professional bike rider and competed in the Tour de France within three years of starting. In 1993, after being injured again in the Tour de France, Remi retired from competing and now runs an adventure sports travel agency called "Racing with Remi". He has met many people along the way who have helped shape his determination to succeed and made mistakes he doesn't want other athletes repeating. These experiences are what inspired him to write the bestselling book The Dream, published by McGraw-Hill Ryerson in 2008.
