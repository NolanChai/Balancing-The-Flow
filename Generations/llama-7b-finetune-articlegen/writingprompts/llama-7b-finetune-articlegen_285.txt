"Mind if I join ya?" the voice asked me. I stared at the man and saw him sitting with a book in his hand and a pipe between his teeth. "I've seen better days..." He smiled. "Yeah," I said as he handed it to me, "And those will be worse." He chuckled.

### Response:
"Would you like some?" The man held the bottle out in front of him. It was a bottle I had seen before - once every week for the past five years - but now that I was drunk, it seemed more inviting than usual. I took the bottle and took a swig of it. The man smiled. "It's whiskey."

### Response:
I took out my cigarette holder and placed it between my lips before I lit up my new smoke. It smoked like shit, but I loved the taste. As I looked back on what was happening to me, I thought about how far I had come. There were times that I didn't think I would make it - that I wouldn't survive, let alone make it this far. And yet here I am. And I don't want to stop now.

### Response:
I smiled and placed the cigarette between my lips, lit it up with a match as I leaned back in my chair, looking at the sky through the smoke. "It's been too long since I last smoked," I said aloud, taking another drag off of it before exhaling into the air. The man looked over to me and smiled, his pipe still in his mouth.

### Response:
I took a deep drag from my cigarette as I sat down on the curb outside of the bar. It had been too long since I smoked one - more than six months now - but it was time that I did something about it. The man looked at me and smiled, his pipe in his mouth. "I don't remember you."
