I quickly got out of bed and grabbed my phone to turn off the alarm. I looked at the screen only to discover that the person who's text message had been vibrating incessantly was not my phone, but my roommate. The next morning would not be a repeat of yesterday as the day before I woke up feeling happy and excited about getting some food for my starving family. This time around I felt anxious, confused, and scared that there wouldn't be anything left for me or anyone else in line when they opened the doors at 7 am.
