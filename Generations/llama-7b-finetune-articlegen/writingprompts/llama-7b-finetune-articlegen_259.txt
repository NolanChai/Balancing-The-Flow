Hello Me?! 
 
 Why do you care so much? I just don't get it. School sucks. It is a waste of time. All your life you are going to be at some job. Just to make money, but not even enough to have fun with the things you like. The world is a shitty place and everything is bad. You know that, right? I don't understand why you try so hard.
