The room is pitch black, but as she adjusts the angle of the flashlight, it becomes apparent that there’s a large table in the center of the room, with several small pieces strewn across it. On one side stands an empty cage, and on the other rests what looks like a pile of twigs, leaves, and branches. Jen begins to scan the room, searching for any sign of life. The flashlight is shaking in her hand again, and she’s still trying to get used to the new equipment. She walks back toward the cage on one side, but doesn ’ t find anything out of the ordinary.
