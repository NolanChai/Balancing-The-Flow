"Level up!" The screen pinged as Dr. Gahmstahp killed his 100th troll. In the movies, it never ended humanity, but it at least killed some people. Initially, he created the murder system in the game as a side-quest to see if anyone could get the achievement, not realizing that someone would be stupid enough to actually do it. Gahmstahp thought about how to prevent his creation from being used for such dastardly purposes. He didn't want a nuclear explosion, so he made it so that no one can create one without the right credentials. He also made sure that the trolls wouldn't be able to produce their own weaponry and that only humans could play. This meant that there was no way for anyone to make a weapon powerful enough to end humanity. Still, Dr. Gahmstahp couldn't help but think that it would still be possible with some outside intervention, so he added a feature that made the trolls kill any other species on Earth who attempted to hack the game and turn it into a murder tool. The trolls would even kill off all the players in the system if necessary. Dr. Gahmstahp was confident that his creation would never end humanity, but he couldn't be sure that no one would ever find a way around these obstacles.
