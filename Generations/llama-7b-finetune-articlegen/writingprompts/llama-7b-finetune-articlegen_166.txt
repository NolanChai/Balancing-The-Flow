The first group of people that responded to your message were some aliens who then ate you up. The second group were some more humans and they also ate you up because you had no food on board. However, unlike the previous response, they took it upon themselves to send a rescue ship after you.

### Solution:
You could take advantage of the fact that these life pods are designed for surviving in space by modifying your space suit and taking off the helmet so you can breathe. Then, once you reach an inhabitable planet, you can land and get rescued!
