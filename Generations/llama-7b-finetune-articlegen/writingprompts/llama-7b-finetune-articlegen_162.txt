ing the enemy such that they were now scattered and fleeing for their lives, with only a few foolish enough to stand their ground and face certain death. The survivors fled across the battlefield leaving the corpses of their comrades behind as well as their weapons and armor. Many were not so lucky however. Their bodies were strewn across the landscape where they had fallen, the air reeking of death and burning flesh. He was about to issue an order to pursue the remaining survivors when a small group of riders appeared on the horizon. They spurred their horses into a run as they approached and he wondered what in the world could be so important that it would require them to ride out this far on such short notice. He smiled, though his smile did not reach his eyes. It was just another reminder of how useless these commoners were in any real battle. They would simply get themselves killed for no reason other than pride. With a flick of his wrist he turned and commanded the troops to follow him back towards camp. The soldiers had barely started their march when they came upon the carnage from the battle they had just fought. It was at that point that it really hit home just how few survivors there had been, for even more than a few of his own men lay dead or wounded along the ground. He turned back to them and shouted angrily, "You call yourselves soldiers?!" The rest of his troop looked up at him confused as they continued their march towards camp. "Soldiers don't leave battlefields littered with corpses! How many more must die before you realize this?" The men looked down again and muttered among themselves for a moment before one finally replied, "We had orders to stay on the field until all of our troops were accounted for!" It was a statement that set him off. He spun back around towards them with fire in his eyes. "Don't you understand? You have lost this war! Every man we lose only delays your fate and puts more pressure on those who survive! You are going to die here regardless of what you do now so why not die fighting?" The rest of the soldiers began to murmur among themselves once again as he continued, "I know that most of you can't fight. You haven't been properly trained or given proper weapons." This time when they looked up at him there was a mix of fear and anger in their eyes. He continued, "And I understand why many of you are scared to face the enemy but not all of them! I will take any man that is willing to fight beside me, no matter what his rank or background may be!" He turned back towards camp once again with a small smile on his face as he thought about how he would kill them for defying his orders. The rest of the day was spent marching toward their next destination which was in another part of the country that had been under siege by invaders. They were expected to meet up with some of their allies there and together they could take back control of what land remained from these invaders. He couldn't help but wonder why any self-respecting ruler would allow themselves or anyone else in his kingdom fall prey to such an easy victory when they could just as easily defend themselves against it. He had made up his mind that he would not go back home until every last enemy soldier was dead, regardless of how long it took him to do so. The next morning found them nearing the coast and although they had marched hard all night there were still many miles left before they reached their destination for the day which put them just shy of sunset when they arrived at their new camp site. They were welcomed by some soldiers who were already stationed there as well as one or two civilians who had fled here during the attack on this city but were now ready to rejoin their forces after hearing word about what was happening elsewhere in the country. He knew better than most that these commoners would not last long against such a force so he had his troops keep an eye out for any potential traitors or deserters who might try sneaking off during their stay here while they waited until nightfall before making camp themselves, knowing full well what happened when you didn't take precautions like this before sleeping outside at night (not to mention what could happen if someone decided they wanted some nice fresh meat after dark). As soon as it got dark enough for them all to move into their tents he made sure each one of his men had gone through his belongings thoroughly so there was no chance any hidden weapons would be found during a pat down later on in the evening. Once everyone else was settled inside their own quarters, he began making plans for how best to take care of these invaders come morning time when they would finally make contact with them again. He knew that while he had plenty enough troops available at his disposal now, there were still those among them who might not be up for a fight if things got rough during battle itself (which was why it was so important to have everyone sleeping inside their tents instead), so after consulting with some of the other officers present about what kind of manpower would be needed at various points around camp throughout the night he decided on one final task before calling it quits himself: finding out who among his own men had been sent here specifically because they refused to fight alongside him in battle (and thus should not even be considered part of this unit), so that when morning came and they were brought back into service with full force against these invaders everyone knew exactly how much firepower could really be expected from each side before moving forward together against them once more. With all preparations made for what was about to come next, he called off dinner early knowing there would be no point trying anything fancy given their current circumstances and instead headed back inside his tent with one last thing on his mind: How exactly am I supposed to get these men through another night without having some of them running away again before morning? It was going to take more than just sending them all home at the end of this battle if any of us are ever going to succeed in taking back control over what used to be our land.

The wind tugged at his hair almost playfully as he stood quietly surveyed the battlefield. There was, in truth, not much left to survey. His victory had been complete, his forces overwhelming, his furies the enemy such that they were now scattered and fleeing for their lives, with only a few foolish enough to stand their ground and face certain death. The survivors fled across the battlefield leaving the corpses of their comrades behind as well as their weapons and armor. Many were not so lucky however.
