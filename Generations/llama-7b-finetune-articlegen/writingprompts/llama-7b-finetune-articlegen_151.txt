When the sirens rang, families didn’t get their things. They didn’t call their employees to tell them that they wouldn’t be able to come to work tomorrow. Some went to the nearest pub, and, of course, there was a rush on alcoholic drinks. But not many people were actually drinking because the majority of the town was still in shock. I had just got married a week ago, and the siren woke me up at 3am in the morning. My husband tried to persuade me to go back to sleep but as soon as we heard the first siren, we got out of bed and put our things together. He was planning to take his father on holiday that day so we packed everything and then drove down to my mother-in-law's house, just outside town. My husband works in a factory, which is near here, but he didn’t think it would be safe for him to work that night. As I said before, there wasn ’ t much alcohol being drunk – I think people were too shocked about everything. We weren ’ t even sure if they were going to call off the sirens and when we got back home in the morning, they had stopped at 6am so it was all over by then. Today, everything is quiet again. The shops are open but not many people have come into town yet – it’s a bit too soon. At this time of year there isn ’ t much going on here anyway, because most of the shops in town are closed for lunch and the businesses close early. But we have two cinemas – one showing an English-speaking film and one showing local films – so those might start to get busy soon, as well as the kiosks outside selling snacks like ice cream or popcorn. In a couple of days I think people will start to return to their normal routines, but it will be interesting to see if they start buying more alcohol again now that they have calmed down. It’s difficult to say at the moment how much money there has been lost from the siren – I haven’t heard anything about it and I don ’ t think anyone else has either. But there are some shops that will be affected because they might not open today or tomorrow, so this will have an impact on them. For me personally, it didn ’ t really affect my day-to-day life apart from a bit of extra sleep in the morning!
