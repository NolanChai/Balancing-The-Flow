This is my second submission to the SCP competition, but I really enjoyed it. It's a very fun idea that could have been executed better in terms of the story and overall execution. The story itself has potential; however, there are so many spelling/grammar mistakes that I couldn't follow along. Also, I would like to see some sort of "end-game" for Smaug. Right now it feels like his actions will never stop unless he is killed by fire (or the Foundation). Also, I feel the "danglies" was a little corny. Other than that, I think you could do something pretty awesome with this idea! Keep at it.
