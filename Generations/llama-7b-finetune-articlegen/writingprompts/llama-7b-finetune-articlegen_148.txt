It’s been two weeks since I last heard from you, and this is the first time we’ve seen each other in all that time. So it’s strange for us to meet again here like this. It's more than a year since you left me and I haven’t seen you once in all that time. How could I ever forget you? Even after such a long time, your face still brings back memories of the first time we met. You were so young and naïve at that time, yet you seemed to have already realized what you wanted from life. It was an extraordinary moment when I saw you walk out onto the stage that night for our graduation ceremony. A few years ago, you would have never imagined becoming a champion like this. Yet here we are now! The same is true of me. Who could ever imagine that someone who is so small and short could be the strongest in the world? Yet here we are now! It’s strange how destiny brings us together at times like these. 
 
 We had a good time when we were young. And now I see you again, it's not the same anymore...
