It is important to read through the text first and then do any of the following:
1) Read it aloud for pronunciation and intonation practice.
2) Look for keywords (e.g., past; school; sandbox). Make sure students understand their meanings. You may want to define new words or offer them definitions from a dictionary.
3) Show the picture, if there is one, and ask questions about what it shows: What is going on? Who are these people/creatures? Where does this take place? When did this happen? Why do you think the narrator ended up here?
4) Write down the setting in a sentence. Be sure to include where the story takes place (time and place). Then have students read the text again, focusing on the details that will help them identify the setting: colors, temperature, weather conditions, time of day or year, characters’ emotions and actions, etc.
5) Identify main ideas/characters/events. Write these down and ask students to come up with as many as they can recall from the story. You may want to use a T-chart for this activity: Main Ideas on one side, Characters or Events on the other. Or you could write down the names of each character along the left margin (e.g., “Bones; Sandbox”) and have students add details as they recall them from the story (e.g., “Sand in sandbox felt like frozen solid but skin burned like lava even after ECT.”).
6) Write down important words or phrases (e.g., alone, boneless, school, sandbox, ECt) and have students guess their meanings based on context clues from the story. If necessary, you can give them definitions or look up the meaning in a dictionary.
7) Ask students to retell the story. Encourage them to include as many details as they remember. Then ask them why they think it ended where and when it did. 8) Have students write down one fact about themselves (e.g., “I love pizza” or “I have four sisters”). Next, ask them to add an adverb and a verb to describe this fact (e.g., “I eat pizza every weekend.”; “I am very good at basketball.”). Finally, ask students what would happen if they did these actions on Monday morning? Encourage students to share their ideas with the class. This will help them see how adverbs and verbs add detail and give meaning to the text.

### Assessment:
You can do an oral check for understanding (e.g., “What’s going on here?”; “Why did you end up in this situation?”) before or after reading the story. Alternatively, students could complete a story map and list facts about themselves on the left side of the page with adverbs and verbs written down on the right side. Then have them write an ending to their personal narrative based on what they learned from reading the story (e.g., “I ended up in jail because I broke into a car and stole some money.”).
You can also use this activity as a way to teach the differences between simple present tense and past tenses such as simple past, present perfect, and progressive past. You could ask students about their weekend or what they did yesterday/yesterday afternoon. You may want to use the following questions for each of these different times:
- What are you doing now? (simple present) - What were you doing yesterday evening after school? (past simple) - How long have you been playing soccer? (present perfect) - What did you do this morning at 6am? (progressive past). You can also ask students how they feel about certain times in the day/week. For example, what is harder: waking up in the afternoon or getting out of bed first thing in the morning? Doing homework at night or doing it after school?

You could have students complete a graphic organizer and label the different parts of speech that are used throughout the story. Students would identify the different tenses, person, voice, etc. Then ask them to write down what the story is about in one sentence using all of these elements (e.g., “She went back in time after eating a magical sandwich and ended up playing with her younger self.”). You can use this activity as a way to teach adjectives and verbs by having students label parts of speech or add details to make their personal narrative more vivid. For example, you could ask them: What did the narrator do next? (adverb) How old was he/she when they were alone in school? (adjective)  Why was she feeling so warm after eating that sandwich? (verb).
