“ Dark Falcon, this is Violent Nightingale of the Dark Flag! ” 
 
 We have received intelligence from our spies that you will be attacking the Dark Flag headquarters on Thunder Island! The Dark Flag must not fall to your hands! Do you understand?! You ’ ll never get away with this, Dark Falcon! We ’ re coming for you!! “ 
 
 I looked up at the screen. A new pilot had joined in the battle against us. My eyes narrowed as I prepared myself for the attack. 
 
 *Never let it be said that I wasn ’ t ready for any fight.* 
 
 The Dark Falcon was a symbol of hope for our people, and I would not let them down. 
 
 *And I sure won ’ t give up like this!* 
 
 I began to fly the ship towards the screen. The cockpit started shaking violently as the ship moved faster than ever. 
 
 *Violent Nightingale, come on, move your ass!* 
 
 Our pilot was quick to respond and I could see the Dark Falcon ’ s gunship coming in fast from my side of the screen. I made an aggressive movement towards it while our pilot did the same. We were both flying right at each other now and there seemed like no way out. 
 
 *I gotta get this shot!* 
 
 “ Violent Nightingale, be careful! ” White Falcon shouted. He was still unconscious so I ignored him. It had to work somehow! 
 
 I steered the ship towards a point of no return and began firing at our attacker. The gunship shot back and it seemed like we were evenly matched. We were both on fire, but neither of us could escape. We continued to trade shots until everything went black. 
 
 *I can ’ t believe this!* 
 
 I woke up in a jail cell, chained from head to toe. It was the first time since I had started my job as pilot for the Dark Falcon that I had been caught and captured by the enemy. I felt humiliation flood through me. How could we have lost? We were flying at top speed towards each other and I had given everything, but it wasn ’ t enough. 
 
 *I don ’ t understand how this happened.* 
 
 As I sat in my cell, a guard approached me. He looked me over before speaking to me. “ The Dark Falcon has fallen into our hands,” he said. “ We have the ship and all your crew are now prisoners of war. This is where you ’ ll stay until we decide what to do with you.” With that, he walked away leaving me alone again. 
 
 I could feel my rage building inside as I was locked in this cell for who knows how long. All of a sudden the door opened and White Falcon appeared. He looked at me with his usual smug smile on his face before speaking to me. “ Hello Violent Nightingale,” he said. “ I ’ m here to take you back home.” 
 
 *We won ’ t win, but we will still fight.* 
 
 It was clear that our days in the Dark Flag were over now and I knew it. We would have to go home and think of new ways to get revenge on our enemy. But even with all of that said, it did not stop my rage from boiling inside me as I stared at White Falcon. 
 
 *We will never give up!* 
 
 “ It seems that you ’ re in quite a state,” he continued. “ Do you need medical attention?” He reached towards me but I backed away from his hand before shaking my head no. “ Alright then, let ’ s go.” With that, White Falcon grabbed hold of my arm and pulled me to my feet as we both left the cell together. 
 
 *I will not give up!* 
 
 We were led through a maze of hallways until finally reaching an elevator door at its end. I was pushed into the room and White Falcon stood behind me with his gun drawn before shutting it close behind us both. The doors opened again as we stepped out on another floor where another soldier awaited for us. He nodded to White Falcon who in turn motioned for him to walk away from our position. As soon as he was gone, I saw the man in front of me begin to smile and laugh before speaking up next. “ You are here with us now, Violent Nightingale,” he said. “ But what will happen when we return home?” 
 
 *I will not give up!* 
 
 White Falcon laughed at this point as he began to walk over to him and pull out his gun once again. He then pointed it towards my head before speaking with a smile on his face. “ You can tell me when we get back home,” he said in my ear. His words seemed to echo for hours afterwards as I watched the door close behind us both, sealing our fate forever. 
 
 *Never!* 
 
 “ Violent Nightingale is dead and gone. Dark Falcon, your days are numbered!” With that said, White Falcon pulled the trigger on his gun causing a loud bang to ring through my ears as he shot me in cold blood! I fell to my knees, clutching my side with pain. The Dark Flag had fallen and there was nothing we could do about it now but prepare for our last stand...
