The door opens and I throw myself inside as if from a storm. I wipe my brow. My sweat is cooling and, almost instantly, I ’ m shaking. A climate for metal and data, not for the corporaeal. My eyes sting from the glare of the overhead lights. They are like searchlights trained on me to ensure that I am truly a member of this community: a man of words and numbers, not flesh and blood. I don ’ t belong here, but I ’ m glad I came . The building is a maze of corridors with doors opening off them at every turn; there are no windows except in the reception area. It ’ s a building for machines and men: people who are not human. Even though I can hear voices through these closed doors, they sound like someone speaking underwater. They don ’ t have the same impact as if I were to hear it above ground level. The floor is white with black squares and lines marked on it; it looks like a chessboard for giant robots . My guide, the receptionist at one of these closed doors, takes my arm and leads me through another maze of corridors until we reach room 429 . It ’ s a small room with a single window looking out onto a brick wall. The rest of the walls are covered in whiteboards with numbers scrawled on them: this is where they make decisions that affect people’s lives, I think to myself as my guide closes the door behind us and stands guard outside . The room itself feels cold and hostile; there ’ s no furniture except for a small wooden table by one corner of the window. There are no windows in this room either – just blank walls with black squares on them which serve no purpose but to make it feel smaller still . I don’t know what they ’ re doing inside here but somehow I have a feeling that it isn ’ t going well for anyone involved . It could be anything: a meeting about an upcoming war, or perhaps someone is trying out their newest weapon on some hapless prisoners. There are so many possibilities and yet none of them seem likely; I feel like they ’ re just playing with us all in some cruel game of chess . My guide returns to my side after having made sure that no one else has entered our little chamber during this short absence. He stands behind me as if he were protecting his queen from an attack on her castle . The silence inside feels deafening: even though there is a clock ticking incessantly, it doesn ’ t seem to be able to mask the sounds of the heartbeats racing against our chestbones . My guide whispers something into my ear – “don’t worry about anything”, he says calmly despite this being one situation where his job could prove useless. I want him gone immediately but at least there ’ s some comfort in having someone else by your side when facing down danger . The door opens with a loud clang and I am stunned speechless as two men walk into the room; both wearing black suits and carrying briefcases under their arms . They don’t look like they belong here but then again no one does except maybe me – it ’ s hard to say when you’re living on borrowed time. The older of these two is balding with a grey mustache, while the younger has a short blond beard trimmed neatly along his jawline; both appear tense as they walk across towards us . My guide steps forward and speaks quickly into their ears before they can do anything else: “you have been summoned by your superior officer”. They turn to me in surprise but then return to their leader who nods without saying a word – apparently this was expected of him somehow . “Please sit down,” the older one says calmly as if there were no tension between us at all. I do what he asks because it seems like this is just another day for them while for me it ’ s an adventure into unknown territory full of dangers and questions waiting to be answered . The younger man pulls out his briefcase from underneath his arm; he opens it up revealing several sheets of paper inside – probably important documents which will be used during our meeting today . My guide walks over towards the table by my side, picks up one sheet in particular and begins to read it aloud . “This is a list of all known enemy forces within the United States,” he says solemnly before handing me another piece of paper with similar information printed on it: “and this is their current location”. My stomach drops as I realize just how little time we have left until they come out into open territory . The two men take turns speaking in quick succession; sometimes it ’ s hard to tell whether one of them was talking before the other took over because both seem so focused on what needs doing . At first glance these briefcases look like nothing but paperwork but when put side by side you can see just how much work has been done by two people who don’t know each other at all . After several minutes of this, I finally speak up: “I’m sorry sirs but we don ’ t have time for questions right now”. The younger one frowns slightly as if offended while his superior glares back at me with an expression which says everything without saying anything – it ’ s clear they need more information from us before deciding what to do next . I turn around towards my guide who seems surprised by this sudden change in conversation but doesn’t seem worried about it either way; he nods slightly as if confirming something for himself rather than being told anything new . The older one speaks up again: “we appreciate your assistance with this matter Mr. Smith but unfortunately we have other commitments which require our attention immediately”. I stare at them both silently as they walk over towards the door; when it opens they both look back at me once more before stepping through – their briefcases are still in hand . My heart is racing now: did they really just leave without giving us anything? Did they not realize how much information we had provided until now? I don ’ t know what happened or why but whatever the reason was, there ’ s no going back from here so all I can do is hope that everything works out well in spite of my own lacking . The door closes behind them as if shutting off an entire world full of possibilities which will never be realized again; this room feels empty now that they aren’t here anymore but there ’ s still one last thing we have to do before leaving: find some way home so I don ’ t end up being forgotten by everyone else who was ever part of my journey through time .
