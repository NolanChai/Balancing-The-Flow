The sun is brightening, my dear. You will be glad when you get outside." "Oh no!" I cried out as he opened the door and stepped into the cool air. As soon as he set foot on the porch, he fell down to his knees. "Why did you do it? Why?" "You have to let me go." He pleaded for mercy in a soft tone that had never been heard before from him. "I can't watch my son get sick again." I yelled as loud and high pitched as possible. I knew that this was the only way to save myself from being stuck in the same position as I was a year ago, but still it hurt. The pain of watching your son die slowly before your eyes will make you do anything to stop it. "Mom, please let him go. He loves me." I could feel the tears rolling down my face and hitting the ground beneath me. "He doesn't love you! And if he does then why did he try to kill himself last night?" "I don't know," he said as he wiped away a tear from his face. He was crying now too, but for some reason it felt so much worse when it came from him than me. The tears kept coming and I could feel them running down my cheeks into my mouth where they mixed with saliva to make a sickening taste in my mouth. I tried not to think about what would happen if we didn't leave soon enough because that is all we were doing right now: waiting for the sunlight to come out so he could get back inside his home before getting sick again like last year when we left him outside without any warning or reason. It felt like a nightmare but I knew it was real life; one of those times where things are bad enough that there is nothing left except hope and faith in people who have never let you down yet, even though they should have because everyone has their own demons to deal with sometimes." Mommy?" She said with wide eyes. "It's time for bed now, go to sleep." I answered as calmly as possible but inside my mind was screaming like crazy trying not to think about what would happen next if this continued; if she wasn't able to sleep at night because her father was sick and had been for months already. We were just lucky that it was summer so he didn't get sicker during these days than normal but still, she needed her rest too if we wanted things back in order again after all this trauma." Mommy?"
