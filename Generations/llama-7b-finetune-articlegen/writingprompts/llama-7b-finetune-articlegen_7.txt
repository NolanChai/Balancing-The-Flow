Christopher checked the order again before he left the store. One double cheese-   burgers, one large fries, and a coke. Perfect, everything she had asked for. Scrunching the top of the bagg close he stepped  into the street. The night was dark, the sky still full of daytime light, but it didn't matter much to Christopher; his mind was already elsewhere as his feet made their way along the sidewalk to a small shack in the corner of the alley. He would not be seen again until he returned home from the job, which meant he had plenty of time before then and it wasn't even that late anyway. He pulled out two hundred dollars from his wallet as he walked by the corner store and then went inside to buy himself some drugs so he could keep this money with him through tomorrow morning when he would have to get up early again for another shift at McDonalds, which was his usual way of life before he got into this new job. . . . Christopher checked the order again before leaving the store: one double cheeseburger, one large fries and a coke. Perfect-- everything she had asked for. Scrunching the top of the bag closed, he stepped out onto the street, not noticing that his shadow on this dark night was stretched to twice its normal length. It was only when he reached the alley, that he finally noticed it was there at all; and it wasn't until then either that Christopher heard a faint, distant sound like someone tapping their fingers together--or perhaps just one person knocking on wood? But this wouldn't stop him from heading into his usual place of business for some weed to smoke before going home for the night with two hundred dollars in hand. The dark was already beginning to envelope everything around him when he entered this corner shack at 2am--and there wasn't a soul within its walls except himself and an old man who sat behind a desk inside awaiting Christopher's arrival like some kind of guardian angel or something even better than that. "You're late, boy," said the man with a smile on his face before taking out a cigar from underneath his chair where it had been hidden all this time (and where he kept other things too). He was dressed in white overalls and wore black boots along with an oversized baseball cap pulled down low upon his head so only two eyes could be seen peering out below them--but these weren't ordinary eyes that belonged to any old person either! They were green glowing orbs like those belonging to a cat at midnight watching over its prey as it stalks the darkness in search of food . . .  "Come with me," said Christopher quietly while leading him outside into another world--one filled with trees so tall that their branches reached upwards into what seemed like eternity above them; there was no moonlight here either because this area had been shrouded by a black cloud which made it even darker than usual during these hours of nightfall . . . "I'll show you how we do things around here," said Christopher while looking up at him with those same green glowing orbs that seemed to follow wherever he went like some kind of cat following its prey into this underworld filled with danger--but also opportunity too because there were many people who lived here who weren't afraid anymore . . .  "What do you want?" asked the old man whose name was Jim. Christopher smiled before replying: "I just need to know what I can take." This answer seemed to please him greatly and so he led Christopher into his own room which had a small bed inside as well as some clothes hanging up upon hooks on either side of its doorway (they were not made out of cloth but rather leather). The old man then sat down beside him while placing both hands behind his back before saying: "I will teach you how we do things around here, boy. It'll be easier if you just listen closely." . .  Christopher looked up at this man with those green eyes again--they seemed so beautiful when he looked into them because they were full of light like stars shining brightly above him in the night sky above them both--and there was something else too about these orbs that made one think they might be able to see through darkness itself! . .  "You're going to learn how we do things around here," said Jim quietly before handing Christopher a small bag filled with different types of pills along with some powder and two empty plastic bottles; then he held out his own hands so they were both facing each other which meant one had an open palm while the other was closed--but this wasn't what would happen next! .  Christopher took out a small knife from underneath where he had been sitting before sliding it across his arm quickly enough to make Jim gasp with surprise (and pain) as blood began streaming down both sides of him like rivers running through canyons--but then again this wasn't something new because they were used too! .  "You will learn how we do things here," said Jim while wiping away some of the blood that was trickling onto his chest before looking at Christopher again: "Now open your palm so I may see what you have done." As expected, he did as asked but then something happened which surprised him even more than when first saw these green glowing orbs in those eyes! The powder had been transformed into liquid form--and not only that either because it also became red like blood itself once Christopher mixed it with water from one of the plastic bottles! .  "You are going to learn how we do things here," said Jim again before giving him another empty container so he could add more powder into its contents along with some alcohol which had been placed on top of them both--but this wasn't all though because there was one other thing too: "Now you must put your finger in the mixture so it can see what you have done." As expected once again, Christopher did as asked before dropping his hand into its contents while looking up at him again with those same eyes that seemed to follow wherever he went like some kind of cat following its prey into this underworld filled with danger--but also opportunity too because there were many people who lived here who weren't afraid anymore . . .  "You are going to learn how we do things around here," said Jim again while taking out his own knife from beneath where he had been sitting all along and holding it up against the light so they both could see what had happened: there was blood on its tip which meant one thing only! It belonged to a human being whose life ended just minutes ago at this very moment in time--and then came another surprise . . .  "You are going to learn how we do things around here," said Jim once more before adding something else that surprised Christopher even more than what he had seen with these green glowing orbs: "We will kill you too!" Soon after this sentence was spoken, a knife came flying across the room and struck him in the back--but then again it wasn't really unexpected because they were used to doing things like this as well! .  "You are going to learn how we do things around here," said Jim once more while wiping away some of the blood that had been trickling down his chest: "We will kill you too!" Soon after, another knife came flying through the air before striking him in the back again--but then again it wasn't really unexpected either because they were used to doing things like this as well! .  Christopher stood up from where he had been sitting on his bed while looking at those same green glowing orbs which seemed to follow wherever he went just like some kind of cat following its prey into this underworld filled with danger--but also opportunity too because there were many people who lived here who weren't afraid anymore . .  "We will kill you too!" said Jim once more before adding something else that surprised Christopher even more than what he had seen so far: "You are going to learn how we do things around here." And then came another surprise. . . . The knife came flying through the air again--and this time it struck him in his side rather than hitting him directly behind one of his kidneys! But there was something about these green glowing orbs that made one think they might be able to see through darkness itself; even when Christopher was lying down on the ground after being stabbed . .
