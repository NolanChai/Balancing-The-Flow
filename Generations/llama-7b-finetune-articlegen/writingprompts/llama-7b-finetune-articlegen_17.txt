'Breakfast!', I heard a call from downstairs. I fussed under the covers for a bit, willing myself against my tired morning state to sit up. I peered around the room, my soft white curtains flowing with a cool breeze as they gently swayed back and forth; just enough to let me know it was still early in the morning. The sun shone through my window casting a warmth of light onto my bedroom floor and walls, giving them a luminous and sparkling appearance, which I loved so much! The golden rays of sunlight lit up my room like never before. I felt myself drift off into sleep once more. 'Mom?...Dad?' I called out. It was then that I realised how late it actually was and decided to get up. I jumped out of bed, waving away the curtains as I went. I tiptoed across my floorboards towards the bathroom, the sound of the water in the shower ringing through. 'Who is she?' I heard a girl's voice say, but was unable to make out who it belonged to. My parents didn't have any daughters and neither did we. I had always been a quiet child, so I wasn't surprised when no one answered me. As I entered the bathroom, my Dad's shower stopped as he walked towards his bedroom. 'Good morning, how are you feeling?' He asked me as I stepped into the shower to wash myself. I smiled back at him and said, 'I feel great!' I stood underneath the warm water for a few moments before turning off my tap and exiting the bathroom. The bathroom door was closed tightly behind me and the sound of the water in the sink could be heard, as if it had been turned on right after I left the shower. 'That's weird...', I thought to myself as I walked towards the kitchen. My Mum stood over the sink washing her dishes, humming a tune underneath her breath. It reminded me of when my parents used to sing me nursery rhymes when I was a little child; they used to make such a happy noise together and it always made me smile! 'I hope she doesn't mind if we come in for breakfast?' She looked up at me, surprised by my sudden presence. My Mum is always very shy when speaking to people outside of our family so I found this odd; usually she would be very friendly and welcoming. 'Of course, it's fine with us!' I replied as I walked towards the stove where two plates of pancakes sat ready for us to eat! As we took a seat at the dining table, my Mum looked me straight in the eye; her blue eyes glistening from underneath her eyelashes. 'Is it just you and your Dad today?' She asked. I shrugged and replied, 'Yeah'. This seemed to concern her even more because she stared at my plate for a moment before speaking again; 'That's odd...is everything alright?' 'Well...', I started off as I picked up the pancake, 'I had a dream about someone last night.' My Mum sighed deeply and said, 'It was probably just a nightmare.' She seemed to be trying hard not to worry me by saying this. I knew that she really did want to help but didn't know how; after all we are just two little girls who live together in the woods! 'I don't think it was...', my Mum stopped abruptly as her phone vibrated on the table. She quickly picked up her phone and looked at it, before putting down her pancake again. 'It looks like I have to go now.' My heart started racing as she turned towards me with a concerned look in her eyes; 'Will you be alright? I won't be gone long.' I nodded my head and replied with a small smile, 'Of course I will!' She sighed once more before standing up from the table. Before leaving though, she asked me if there was anything else that I wanted to say? I thought for a moment before shaking my head; no words came out of my mouth. My Mum smiled at me and left quickly as soon as she had said this. I picked up her pancake again and took it into the living room where I could watch TV peacefully while eating my food! The sun was still shining through my window and the rays were brighter than before, glistening like diamonds in the light of day; they lit up everything with such a beautiful luminosity that I found myself staring at them for hours. I finished my meal just as my parents returned home from their trip out to work together! They smiled brightly and came into the living room where they sat down on opposite sides of the couch, both picking up their coffee mugs with great enthusiasm; ready to watch TV after a long day at work. 'How was your day?' I asked them both in unison as we all sat there waiting for our favourite shows to start again! They both looked over at me, surprised by my question but they answered anyway; 'It's been fine!' My father smiled back at me and said with a laugh, 'We're just glad that this was only an experiment today.' I laughed along with them because we all knew how serious his work could be when he was in the lab! He went on to explain that they were going to be testing out a new chemical formula for their next project but as always promised me that it would never hurt anyone; not even themselves. 'But what about tomorrow?' My Mum asked him, 'We're going back then aren't we? The kids will be needing us.' She smiled at me and said, 'Don't worry little girl...it won't happen again!' I sighed deeply as I thought to myself how much I hated when they left for work; it always felt like everything was against me but that wasn't true! They would come home soon enough so there wasn't any need to panic just yet. The next day rolled around and my parents returned with big smiles on their faces. They sat down on opposite sides of the couch once more, ready to watch TV after a long day at work. 'How was your day?' I asked them both in unison as we all sat there waiting for our favourite shows to start again! This time my Mum spoke first; 'We had an amazing day!' My father smiled back at me and said with a laugh, 'I'm just glad that this was only an experiment today.'
