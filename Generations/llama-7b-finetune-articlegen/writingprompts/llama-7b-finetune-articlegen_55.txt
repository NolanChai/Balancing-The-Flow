Humans have been living side by side with animals since ancient times and throughout history they have had a very close relationship, some of these species have been domesticated for the purpose of helping us and others were used as food or to serve other purposes. The most important relationship that has taken place in recent years is that of the domestication of dogs which was carried out by the wolf who inhabited Europe at that time and this happened through mutual adaptation between man and the animal. The process of selection, culling and breeding with dogs has resulted in animals that are now so different from their ancestors that they can no longer mate and reproduce with them and therefore can not be considered wolves. This is because of all the differences that have been introduced by humans such as the size and coloration, even though there are still many similarities to wolves which include certain behavioral patterns. Dogs have become very important companions for people in cities because they provide us with security against those who mean harm. The dog has helped man survive by alerting him when danger is near or someone approaches his territory which makes it a reliable ally against criminals and animals that can be dangerous like wolves, coyotes, foxes etc. In addition, the dog helps humans in their work such as search and rescue operations where they are used to locate lost people buried under rubble after earthquakes or explosions. They also help detectives in the police force by tracking down criminals who commit crimes such as drug trafficking and illegal immigration because of the ability that dogs have for following scent trails left behind by these individuals which allows them to be captured and detained. Finally, they can serve as guards against burglars since they alert us when an intruder is inside our homes or offices by barking at him/her until we come back home from work etc.. In summary, the human has taken over all of nature’s niches in order to survive on Earth which makes it impossible for any other species living within these boundaries (the planet) that do not adapt quickly enough will be exterminated or die out altogether like dinosaurs did millions of years ago when their environment changed drastically due mainly because there was no longer any food available so they became extinct along with the rest of life on Earth back then. In conclusion, humans have managed to find a way into nature’s niches in order to survive which is why we are currently atop the food chain and can not be surpassed by any other species living within our planet's boundaries (the planet).
