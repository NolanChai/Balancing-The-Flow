He thought it was a joke but his wife said she didn’t think it would be funny and he felt like his head might explode from trying to wrap his brain around what was happening. He'd been in the car for 4 hours now, with no way out that he could see, except to pull over on the side of the road (something he had yet to try) or walk away into the cold wintery weather. The only reason they’d been able to find this city was because it was listed on a map in their rental car. He couldn't believe what he saw around him and he didn’t think he would be able to believe it if he weren’t seeing it with his own eyes. It almost looked like the whole thing had been made up by someone but his wife insisted this was real, that they were really in the future, living their lives as part of a big science experiment. He didn't understand what she meant and how all of this was possible, he wanted to get out but she said there was no way. His head was still spinning from the strange sight around him when he looked at his wife again. She was standing in front of him with tears running down her face. He thought it might be some kind of reaction from the news but then realized that what she’d told him earlier had finally set in and was overwhelming her now. He tried to console her, tell her everything would be okay, but he didn't know how that could be possible anymore either because he still couldn't believe all of this was real. The car started up again and he looked out the window at one last glance at his wife before turning his head away from her tears and focused on driving down the street for what felt like forever, even though it had been only minutes since they’d arrived here...
