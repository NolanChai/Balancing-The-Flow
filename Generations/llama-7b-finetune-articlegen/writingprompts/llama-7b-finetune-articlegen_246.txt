Your appearance is unusual for here. The whites are not used to seeing your kind around. They will stare at you as if you're some kind of animal. You have to be very careful with these people. If you act inappropriately, they may lash out against you without reason or even kill you on the spot. I would advise you to always wear a mask and a hood when you're going outside. That will make it so that nobody sees your face.

### Conclusion:

I knew my appearance was unusual in this place, but I never thought they would be scared of me. They must have been used to people with pale skin around here. At least the darkest ones were considered white and had the freedom to go where ever they want. So how would it look like if I would go out there? Would people stare at my appearance? Or would they just walk by without looking at me? And what should I wear when I'm outside so that nobody sees my face?
