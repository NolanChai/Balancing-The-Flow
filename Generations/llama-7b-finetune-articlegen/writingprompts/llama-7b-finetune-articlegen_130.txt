*The air in the room is chilly, she feels a slight shiver as her hand touches the icy windowpane.*
She takes in a deep breath and looks around herself. The walls are covered in ancient paintings of gods, angels, heroes and demons. She notices the books that line the walls, a library she imagined many times but never knew existed. The smell is rich with the scent of leather binding, the sharp tang of old paper and the sweet perfume of the books themselves. There are desks littered with piles of papers, quills and ink bottles.
*She turns away from the window to look at a large painting that hangs on the wall.*
It shows a tall man clad in heavy armour and his eyes are locked on her. It makes her uneasy as she looks at him. She knows who he is, it is the first thing she learnt about this place. He is called Satan. She does not know what to say, but she asks the question that has been weighing on her mind since she arrived.
*She turns and walks back to the window and looks out.*
Today I feel nothing, nothing at all. No itch no pain no strange breezes. Nothing. Earlier I thought I felt something, it was sudden but fleeting and then it was gone. I may have felt nothing then too.
*Her thoughts are interrupted by a loud bang on the door.*
