 The other day, I saw this guy who looked just like you. He said that he was a journalist and had come to write an article about you and the company. I asked him if he would like a cup of coffee and he said yes, so we went for lunch together. After lunch, I told him what it's really like here, but unfortunately it seems that he only wanted to hear positive things from me. He was disappointed when I told him about how you always make us do overtime, even though you are away on holiday with your family most of the time. He seemed interested in my opinion and asked if we could meet again sometime soon so that we could talk more about it. I said yes!
