They say it was just a mistake.  The baeker did not have enough icing.  All I knew was that I was different.  It hurt sometimes, being different.  Everyone else can't wait to be eaten. They sit so smug in their chairs, waiting for the perfect moment, for someone as apathetic and as greedy as they are to bite down into my soft flesh, hoping that I will give them more than what was given.  I think about how it must feel like a carrot being eaten by a horse. The horse might be tasteless in his ways and might not know much about life outside of the pasture or what else is out there. He might even wonder if something better exists, but when he bites into that carrot, he knows the feeling of home.  I am just a different piece of cake.
