The bags under his eyes felt like a rich leather that he could never afford. He stood on the train platform, standing perfectly still as horde's of others pushed and shoved to make it to their trains on time.

This was not his first rodeo so he knew that the man who started the rush would be in front of him no matter where he stood.
