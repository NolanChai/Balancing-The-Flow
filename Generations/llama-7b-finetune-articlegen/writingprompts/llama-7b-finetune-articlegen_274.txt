It ’ s difficult to clinlge to knowledge when the loggers are constantly trying to tear it from you. Even the smalles fragment of infonnation can be solidifled in your memory onemoment and gone thenext. I hope my experience as a traitor has given me some insight into what the loggers may or may not have known about this case. My first piece of advice to anyone considering turning informant is never, ever, give anything to anyone without getting something in return. You must always maintain some leverage over the person you are working with or they will simply use any knowledge gained against you and take away all your bargaining power. Secondly, do not believe what you ’ re told. If you can, ask someone else for confirmation or clarification of information. It is easier to discredit a source if it is discovered that they are providing you with misinformation. I have given the following examples and clues to help you decipher which ones are useful, accurate, and relevant to this case:
- ” I do not know anything about a case called the ” 324 Project ’ ’ - This was the first clue I gave to the loggers that they were on the wrong track. They did not need me to give them any clues to figure out that ” 324 Project ’ ’ could only be the ” 324 Conspiracy ’ ’ . I would have given anything in the world to keep the loggers from finding out about this case.
- ” The 324 is not just one group, there are many splinter groups and they all hate each other. There are those who call themselves the 324, the 324 Project, the 324 Conspiracy, the 324 Movement, etc. ’ - This clue was designed to mislead anyone trying to figure out which group I was talking about in order to keep them from knowing that my family and I were involved with a group known as ” The 324 Conspiracy ’ . I knew that if the loggers were able to identify what organization I was referring to, they would know my name.
- “The loggers have asked me many times who the leaders of the group are, but it is impossible for me to answer because there are so many leaders and so many different splinter groups. The only leader that I am familiar with is called ” 324 ’ . - This clue was designed to lead them into thinking that a single person or organization had been leading the group known as ” 324 Conspiracy ’ , when in fact, there were hundreds of leaders and it was not an organized group at all. I did not know anything about anyone else except for my family.
- "I know the loggers have tried to find out who is behind the website called ” 324 Conspiracy . com ’ ’ . - This clue was designed to mislead them into believing that this organization had something to do with the ” 324 Conspiracy ’ , when in fact, it had nothing to do with anything at all. I did not know about any of these things and would have gladly given my life before I would have admitted that I had anything to do with any of them.
- "The loggers are trying to find out who is behind the website called ” 324 Conspiracy . com ’ . - This clue was designed to mislead anyone who might be searching for information about me and my family on the internet in an effort to identify us as members of a group called ” The 324 Conspiracy ’ , when we were never part of any such organization. I would have gladly given anything before admitting that this was true, but it is not.
- "The loggers are trying to find out where my family lives and where our house is located in case they decide to come after us. - This clue was designed to mislead the loggers into thinking we had been living in hiding since the day of the shooting, when in fact, we never hid anywhere and would have happily met with them or any other person who wanted answers to my questions about what happened on that fateful night so long ago.

The only people involved with "The 324 Conspiracy are my family members and me alone. I would not knowingly give any clues that could lead anyone else into thinking they were looking for information about something other than what they wanted to find out anyway.
