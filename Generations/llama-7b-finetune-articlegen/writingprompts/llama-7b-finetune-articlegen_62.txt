### Code:
```
from . import data
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import pickle

data = pd.read_csv('data/fake.csv')
df = pd.DataFrame(data, columns=['Name','Age'])

# Instruction with invalid instruction text.
print df[['Name', 'Age']]
# The response is invalid and could not be processed!
print df[['Name', 'Age']]
```
### Explanation: 
Instructions are stored in .csv files in the data folder of the project. 

For example, if a user types `.get_data(age)` it would process the instructions located at `data/fake1.csv`
