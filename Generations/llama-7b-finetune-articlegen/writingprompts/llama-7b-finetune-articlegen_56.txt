`` I don't know what to do!'', I cried. ``.I think that the monster is going to eat us all!'' 
 
 The green slimy monster had a long tongue and his eyes were like two round ping pong balls. He was not very good looking at all, but he was an expert at making friends. He said that he didn't really like blood though. But I still thought it was pretty weird for someone who looked so good to like blood! 
 
 `` Not my problem,'', he repeated. ``.I'll take care of the monster.''. He left with his long, green tongue sticking out and slimy hands that made a sound when he wiggled them. The bacon was on fire, but I wasn't sure whether it would be safe to eat! 
 
 `` There are only three slices of bacon left!'', I said in disbelief. ``.I'm going to have to run!'' 
 
 Soon I heard a large bang. It was the monster trying to take out the green slimy monster who was chasing him around with a stick. The green slimy monster hit the floor hard and fell down, knocking himself out for sure. Then the bacon was safe! 
 
 `` I guess we can eat that now!'', I said in triumph. ``.We've saved all of the bacon from being stolen by the monsters.''. I looked at my friend with his face all red. He had tears running down it because he was so happy and tired out!
