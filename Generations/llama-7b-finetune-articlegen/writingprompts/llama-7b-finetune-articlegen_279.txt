Hi there! I am glad you could join us today, and I hope you will enjoy your time with the space program. There are a few things we want to cover before you head into the ship, so pay close attention.

We have a lot of new recruits that need training like you do, and it can be intimidating at first. Just remember to take your time with the program; there is no rush if we miss today’s launch. Now on to your suit!

Here, this will help you get the helmet on. The visor is for protection and the headset is for communication. Now just slip your arms into the sleeves of the suit and we’ll get you in position.

Let me show you how to adjust your headset. First, place the microphone on your chin and tuck in your chin strap. Next we need to connect the cable with a clip in the back of your suit. Once it is connected, turn the dial to adjust the volume and test out your connection!
