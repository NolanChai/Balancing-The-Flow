Inside her dark cave, Lolita sat on her rocking chair, watching her fire burn and waiting for the next morning to come so that she could go fishing again. As she watched it dance across the wooden floor, a small glow of light danced off the edge of the door as someone pushed against it. She stood up, ready for an attack, but was surprised when she heard the same voice from before: "Please let me in! I'm sorry I came all this way and you weren't here!" Lolita felt her heart sink as she saw a young man standing in front of her door; she knew that he had come to kill her. She reached for her machete, but he was already on the other side of the door, ripping it from its hinges. He came stumbling into her home, dripping with wet leaves and branches. Lolita waited a moment, then grabbed him by the throat; she could tell that he had no weapons on his person so there was no reason to let go. The young man started to choke out, "I'm s-sorry!" but then he suddenly stopped talking as the life left his body and he fell to the ground. She looked down at her bloody hands in shock; she thought that if she killed someone before, it would be because they deserved to die, not for revenge. But now she had no one else to blame. She sat back down, staring at her fire as though it were the only thing left in this world. After a moment of silence, Lolita started up again: "I am sorry that I came all this way and you weren't here."
