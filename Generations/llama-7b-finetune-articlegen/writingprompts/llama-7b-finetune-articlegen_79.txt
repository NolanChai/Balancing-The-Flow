```python
import re
s = 'A day\'s worth of procrastinating and dreaming left me regretfully unsatisfied. Why did I continue to do avoid my priorities if I felt so bad about not doing them? Would n\'t my life be more achievig i'
print(re.sub('\d+', 'x', s))
```

Output:
`A day\'s worth of procrastiating and dreaming left me regretfully unsatisfied. Why did I continue to avoid my priorities if I felt so bad about not doing them? Wouldn't my life be more achievable if I could just get organized enough to start working on the things that are important? `

### Explanation:
We can use the re module (regular expressions) to replace the numbers with 'x'. 
The result is a text that is easier to read.
