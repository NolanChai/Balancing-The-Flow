`` Who are you?'' 
 
 He leaned forward and grabbed my shoulder, giving it a firm squeeze that made me wince with pain. His eyes were piercing into mine with their burning light, like two glowing embers of fire. 
 
 `` I'm the one who is going to teach you everything you need to know about being a good student and how to work hard in life. So don't be afraid of me or what I might ask you to do.''. He said calmly as he pulled away from my shoulder. 
 
 `` Now answer me: Who are you?''. 
 
 He grinned and turned around. Walking backward, he was moving at a steady pace with his head facing forward; however, as soon as his body got into view again, it turned around and looked back at the ceiling. After doing this several times, he faced me once more. With one hand on top of the other, he held up three fingers, then slowly shook them like an old man who was trying to show how weak or unfit they were for any physical activity. 
 
 `` I am your teacher,''. He said with a smile. ``Now let 's go!'' 
 
He turned around and walked away from me at the same speed as before, only this time he was facing forward again so that all of his features could be seen clearly in front of him; eyes wide open, nose sniffing, mouth speaking, etc., all without moving a muscle. 
 
 The room was silent except for my heavy breathing. My heart beat so fast I thought it might burst out of my chest and fall on the floor with me! 
 
 `` Please tell me what happened next!''. He said with his mouth agape, showing off teeth that were white as snow. His eyes glowed in excitement as he spoke: "I was just going to ask if you had a question . . .'' 
 
 I nodded and sat back down at my desk while the man who was teaching me walked away from where we were standing toward his office door; then turned around again with another smile before leaving without saying another word. 
 
 ``. . .''. He finished with a big grin on his face as if he knew something about me that I did n't know, or maybe just thought he did. Either way, there was no denying it: this guy had a lot going on in his head!
