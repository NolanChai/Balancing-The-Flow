I'm not sure if you're familiar with our 'Freaks of Nature'? You'll see that it says freak show but really we are all human, just like you. You've been here three years because you have a 'freak' gene on your dna, that's what causes the mutations in the first place, if you want to leave then you have to find someone with the same gene and get pregnant, this will trigger another mutation of your child which may or may not cause them to be as weird as you are. If you can't find anyone here then there is always home, just go back through your closet door...
