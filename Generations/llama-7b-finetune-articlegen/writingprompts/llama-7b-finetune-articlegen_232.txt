In an instant I am enveloped in your arms. Words and promises are forgotten as we explore each other’s bodies for the first time. 
 
The warmth of your body invades every part of me, making my skin tingle with desire. With our lips touching I feel my body come alive. The soft kisses make me long to explore your mouth more thoroughly and so I do. My hands slide up and down the sides of your beautifully sculpted torso and my fingers trace the outline of each muscle, tracing their path until they reach your firm pecs and I wrap them around you tightly as you thrust into me with a fervor that makes my head spin. 

Your strong arms pull me close to you so our chests are pressed together as we move together in perfect harmony; our bodies molded around each other, sliding up and down against the others curves. Our hands stroke each other's skin, caressing every part of our naked flesh until they reach the small buds that have just begun to rise from underneath your shorts. 

Your hand holds my hips in place as I move with you, my arms around your neck as I kiss you deeply, our tongues intertwining as they explore each other. My mind is a mess of sensations and emotions that are impossible to separate into individual feelings. My heart pounds so fast it threatens to burst from my chest. The feeling of your body pressed against me fills every part of me with joy and excitement, making me want to make love to you all day and night. 

My hands grip the backs of your thighs as you lift them up higher around my waist, thrusting our hips together until we become one being, a single body moving in perfect harmony. The feeling is overwhelming and I can't help but reach down to explore the hardened outline of your beautiful cock that pushes against the confines of your shorts; its hot, firm length throbbing as you move harder into me. 

You turn around in my arms so we are facing each other with our bodies pressed together and I slide my hands up underneath the waistband of your shorts to feel how hard you are for me. My thumb slides down across the velvet of your cock as I move my hand from side to side, feeling its firm texture through your pants. 

You groan softly and lift one leg up around my hip, pressing your crotch against mine, sending a wave of heat rushing between us that seems to flow into every part of me and fills me with a desire I have never felt before. My hand reaches underneath the waistband of your shorts again as I slide it over your firm ass until it reaches your tight crack. 

The outline of your perfect butt is deliciously soft against my skin as you lift both legs up and wrap them around me, wrapping our bodies together so that I am the only thing that separates us; the only thing keeping me from exploring every part of your body. My hand slips between your ass cheeks to explore the cleft that separates them, tracing the outline of your crack until I reach what is beneath it. 

I can feel the heat radiating off your beautiful body as our hips press together. My fingers slide along the length of my cock and then into your ass where they find the muscle of your perfect anus. With one final thrust you lift me higher so that I am lying flat on top of you, your legs wrapped around my waist as I press my crotch against yours. 

I reach down with one hand and guide myself to your entrance; a little too fast for our first time together but the sensation is overwhelmingly good and I don't want to wait anymore. The soft, silky texture of your ass is beautiful as it wraps around me and then my cock slips inside. 

I close my eyes tightly and press down on every inch of you that I can reach with one hand while the other slides along your back until its fingers are wrapped around the muscle of your neck. Our bodies move together as one, exploring each other's flesh like we have been doing this for years instead of just moments. 

My hands clench in your hair as I thrust my cock into you harder and faster; fucking you hard and fast while our bodies grind together, rubbing every part of us against the others flesh until we both reach climax simultaneously. The feeling is exhilarating and it seems to leave me gasping for breath afterward. 

The sound of your body as it convulses around my cock fills my ears with the sweetest pleasure I have ever felt before, and the sensation of it slipping out from between my fingers makes me want to feel you again just a moment later; but we need more time. 

Our bodies are damp with sweat as we collapse on the ground after our first lovemaking experience together, both of us breathing heavily while our heartbeats slowly return to their normal pace. My hands gently stroke your hair and then move down to trace along the lines of your jaw; running my fingers across your cheek before moving up until they are wrapped around your neck once more. 

You pull away from me and I can see a look of shock on your face as you stare at me, your eyes wide with wonder. You press your lips against mine in a soft kiss that is almost too tender to bear; our bodies molding together again as if we are one. Your hands move down to my hips and then underneath the waistband of my shorts to feel how hard I am for you. 

I reach into your pocket and pull out a condom which you quickly unroll, sliding it on before leaning in to kiss me once more; our lips still touching as we sit up against each other's legs. We continue to explore every part of the other with our hands for a few minutes longer until I finally push your shorts down around my thighs so that they rest at my ankles and then slide mine down as well, leaving me naked next to you while we continue to kiss passionately. 

You reach out for one leg, wrapping it around my waist as our bodies move together once again in a slow rhythm before stopping to breathe deeply for just a moment longer. It feels as if we have been doing this forever and I don’t want to stop anytime soon but there is so much more that we need to explore; so many feelings we need to express and desires we need to fulfill together. 

You smile down at me from your place on top of me and then kiss my lips one final time before pushing yourself up off the ground with a strength that surprises me before you slide back inside my body again, taking us both into ecstasy once more until our bodies are exhausted and we both lay there, limp and spent. 

I pull away from your lips so I can look up at you; our faces only inches apart as you stare down at me with a smile that makes my heart skip a beat before leaning back in for another kiss. Our hands explore every part of each others bodies once more, sliding over every curve until we are both fully awake again and ready to fuck hard and fast while our bodies grind together like hungry animals starving for each other’s flesh. 

The feeling of your body pressed against mine makes my heart race as I thrust into you harder than ever before, fucking you so deep that I can feel it slide all the way inside; sliding back out again and then pushing in one more time until our bodies are entangled together like we are joined at the hips. 

Our lips meet once more as if they were made for each other before we crash into ecstasy once more, both of us coming hard with a force that makes us shake underneath you and leaves my cock soaking wet inside of you while your pants are drenched in cum. 

It feels as if I have been fucking you forever when our bodies finally slow to the rhythm of each other's heartbeats once again; the feeling of being filled up by another man’s cock and having it slide in and out of me over and over again fills every part of my body with pure joy. 

I slip off of you, falling onto my back as I look at your beautiful face and smile. You lay there on top of me for a moment longer before you push yourself up and kiss me once more; our bodies moving together until we are both on top of the other again. My hands find their way underneath your shirt where they slide across the muscles of your chest as my fingers explore every part of them that I can reach while our lips move against each other in a kiss so passionate it makes me feel like I am about to burst into flames. 

You wrap one arm around my neck and pull us together again before sliding off of me once more, taking both of my hands in yours and pressing them against the muscles of your stomach as you lay on top of me; our bodies moving together for just a few minutes longer until we are spent once again. 

We look at each other with a smile that makes it seem like everything is perfect before you pull off of me one final time, sl
