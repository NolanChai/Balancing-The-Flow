1. How far is "a few feet"? What is "the time being"?
2. There are only three choices and you need to decide what is the best.
3. A hotel is a place that has rooms for rent or something like that, right? What about other forms of housing such as apartments, houses, dorms?
4. The writer is not happy with his trip, but does he mean "the time being" in terms of minutes, hours, days, months, years etc? It's so vague!
5. In this sentence, there are two phrases that need to be completed: 1. the mountain passes on either side of town closed for the time being. 2. The hotel were double booked.
6. What is a "mountain pass"? Is it like an entrance into a city?
7. We can tell he didn't plan ahead (I bet he didn't) because if he had, there wouldn't be any problem with the room bookings or whatever.
8. What is the difference between the two phrases? I think they are used in different situations!
9. So we need to figure out what "a few feet" could possibly mean and then we can go from there.
10. I'm guessing that if he had planned ahead, this would not have happened so we don't even get to the point where a hotel is double-booked!
11. Okay, maybe they are talking about a different kind of "hotel" (as in motels or something like that). Still, what does "double booked" mean? I guess it means he has no place to stay. But then why doesn't he just go back to where he came from?
12. I can only assume that the writer is talking about a "mountain pass" as in an entrance into a city (the way through) or maybe he's talking about a physical feature of land/nature and not really anything like housing, food etc. But I don't know if this is the right answer...
13. A couple more things to think about: Is "the time being" used in a literal sense? I guess it could be but I'm leaning towards a figurative interpretation of the words. It means that something bad has happened and will continue happening for as long as there is snow on the mountain passes (or however long it takes).
14. It seems like this is a story from his life so we can assume he did not have time to book a room before arriving in town. Is this really what happened? I'm going with yes but who knows...
