Orville's squeaky jaw fell to the ground as he watched Harold get up. He realized his mistake, and regrettably turned on his heel and staggered back down the hall. 
 
 Orville began to wipe off the dampness from his face. "I have been a terrible father."
 
 `` You're not too bad, you are my father afterall. '' Harold said as he rubbed the top of his head again. `` It just never gets any easier being around you does it?'' Orville muttered out, shaking his head. 
 
 Harold cleared his throat, and then spoke, "Anyway, I have a question for you. We are on a quest to save the kingdom from an evil witch, correct?" Harold asked as he began to pace back and forth in front of Orville. `` Yes''. Orville said with a nod. `` Well that is good because, I was just wondering, what exactly is going to happen if we don't get there?'' Harold asked, raising an eyebrow at the same time as he scratched his arm hairs. 
 
 Orville began to laugh and then looked out into space. He then came back down to earth and replied, `` Well I guess that is a good question. I don't have much experience in dealing with situations like this. But what you said earlier made me realize one thing- we should stop pondering about what might happen if we do or don't succeed at the quest. We have to try our hardest, and know that if we fail at some point during it, there is nothing wrong with that either.'' Orville ended his statement with a sigh and then looked down at Harold. `` You are so right, we need to just keep moving on in life no matter what happens. We can't live our lives worrying about the future, or thinking too much about mistakes we have made in the past. It will drive us mad if we let it.'' Orville finished as he began to scratch his beard. Harold nodded his head at this and then looked up with a smirk on his face. 
 `` Well, I for one don't plan to let anything drive me insane. So now that you have brought this up- are we going to save the kingdom?'' Harold asked as he held out his hand for Orville to shake. Orville smiled and took it, ``Of course! We can do this thing together my son. '' They both laughed and then shook hands again. The two walked back into the hallway and went up the stairs. As they came to the door leading outside of the house, Harold turned around one last time and said with a smile, ``We will save that kingdom yet!'' Orville smiled and nodded at his son once more before pushing the door open and walking out into the fresh air.
