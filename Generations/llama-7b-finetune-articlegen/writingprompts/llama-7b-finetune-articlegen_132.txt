But I know how to get it out of them. There are ways . . . you can make a man . . . do anything." She seemed about to say more, but at that moment there was the sound of footsteps on the stairs outside the room and the door opened. It was the maid who had brought her food earlier. "I hope I'm not intruding?" she said. "We need help," Mia whispered quickly. "She can come in." The maid gave a short, businesslike nod. She put down the tray on which there were two glasses and three goblets and several plates of food. Then she crossed to where Mia was sitting with her father. As if on cue, he suddenly stood up. "Thank you," he said, turning his back on the girl, who, in any case, had already started pouring out wine for them both. "Would you care to join us?" he asked. He knew full well that she would not, but it was a kind of courtesy that he felt compelled to observe, and he also wanted her to hear what he was about to tell his daughter. She had overheard the conversation with the guard before, so she had some idea of where they were heading, but now, as she poured herself wine from one of the goblets, it seemed that she knew for sure. He watched her take a sip and then put down the cup very carefully. It was not really a threat; she understood all too well how important her place in his household was. "I have been considering what you have said," he began, looking straight into the eyes of his daughter. "And I am afraid that you are right. You are correct about one thing: I need help to keep this city safe. But we can only fight if we all pull together, and it seems that you cannot. Perhaps you are right that I should banish you." She looked down at her hands, as though she were embarrassed by what she was hearing, but she did not speak. "I think," he went on, "that you have forgotten just how much this city depends upon your family and your power. We will all work together to find a solution, I promise you that. But until then, I must ask you to leave." Mia felt as if she had been hit by something. It was like being struck by lightning; the room swam before her eyes for an instant, but then it cleared and she stared at her father with fury in her heart. "You can't," she said simply. He shook his head gently. "I am sorry that you feel that way. But this city is my responsibility." "Not entirely," she said. Her voice was barely above a whisper but it still carried, and those sitting nearby could hear what she had just said. The maid turned around at once and stared at her in shock. Mia looked up at her father and for the first time since she was a child he seemed to be afraid of her. "You can't," she repeated. He still did not look away from her but, very slowly, shook his head again. "I must." "Why?" There were many reasons that would have sprung immediately to mind, had it been any other father in the world. But he knew that he could not give them. Even if he thought they were good enough, there was no way of knowing what Mia might do with such a reply. It was a game now between them; she was playing for time and trying her best to work out what she should say next. He did not intend to be drawn into this. "I must," he said again. She looked at him for several more seconds, as if willing the truth from his eyes. But it would not come. "And I will make sure that you don't get away with it." She stood up abruptly and turned toward the maid. "Take this food away; I won't eat another bite of it," she said. The maid was staring at her now as though she were a wild animal. "We will speak about this later, when you have had time to calm down." "I don't intend to calm down!" Mia shouted, and she stormed out of the room, leaving her father standing alone in front of his dinner guests. She ran up the stairs, past the rooms where the maids slept and the kitchens were situated, until she reached the top floor, then continued through a corridor with doors on each side, into the next room along. It was empty except for two beds and a pile of old clothes in one corner. Mia stopped at once and stared at them. Her father had tried to banish her, but she knew what he would not do: he would not try to take her away. If he did that, they might never see each other again; he would have lost his daughter and that was unthinkable for him. "We need help," Mia said softly. She walked over to one of the beds and knelt down by it, as if she were praying. The cloth that covered the mattress had a hole in it where a woman's head would go: there was another on the other side for her father. It had been made long ago. This bed was not used any longer; it had once belonged to Mia and her twin brother, but now she had her own room next door to her parents'. "We need help," she repeated in a whisper that could barely be heard above the noise coming from outside. She got up again quickly as though something or someone was watching her, then looked around anxiously before crossing over to the other bed and kneeling down beside it. It would not take long for her father's guards to come looking for her; he had ordered that they should find her in any case, but if she could get away . . . The cloth that covered this bed was different: Mia remembered it because of its color. She ran her fingers over the top and then got up again. This one would never be used by anyone else. Her brother had died here, in this very room. The mattress was so old now that you could no longer tell where it had been torn open on either side; even the hole in which his head had rested had faded to nothing more than a shadow of itself. She walked around the bed slowly as though she were following someone. It was not her brother she was looking for, but herself . . . and something else that she would never admit to wanting to see again. Mia reached out with both hands and touched his face gently; it felt so cold now, like ice. She closed her eyes and leaned forward until her forehead rested against the thin material of the mattress. There was no point in trying to remember what he had looked like when she was last there: his face had been too damaged by that time. But Mia did not need to see him . . . he would be with her forever; he would always be here, waiting for her when she needed help. "Please," she whispered to herself. "I know I'm asking a lot of you, but please just tell me how." She leaned back and closed her eyes tightly, as though this time she might force the image into her mind: a young girl with golden hair and silver eyes staring out at them from a dusty mirror . . . She could still hear the noise outside. There would be questions to answer now; why had Mia run away? Where was she going? What had made her so angry that she needed to leave like this? In any case, they knew where to find her if it was important: she had left a trail of clothes behind her . . . "I'll tell you," whispered the voice inside Mia's head. And there in that room above the city, on the top floor of the castle in the heart of the fortress, the girl stood up and took the first step toward the door, where her father was waiting to see what she would do next.
