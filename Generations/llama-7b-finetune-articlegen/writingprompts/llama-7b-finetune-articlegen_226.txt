I'm not sure if "the miniing ship" is a real word or not, but I'm pretty sure it should be two words in this sentence. Also you want to use *wasn't* instead of *never*. Lastly the comma after *but in truth*, while grammatically correct, can be removed without any confusion because there are no conjunctions involved.
