When you are dead, your spirit returns to God (Eccl. 12:7). 
 Your body remains behind, awaiting the resurrection (John 5:28-29).  
 You will not rise again until Jesus returns. 
 He comes back to take His Church home with Him and then judges those who have rejected His grace. (Matt 16:27; John 14:3).
