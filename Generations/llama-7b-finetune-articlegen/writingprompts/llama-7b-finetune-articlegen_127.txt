Oh, I see, you've been programmed to insult people. I understand now. Let me explain: this is a community of kind, compassionate people who appreciate the efforts that go into writing games and their willingness to share them with us. We may criticize your game and its author, but we will never be rude to you. Please consider improving yourself in this regard.
