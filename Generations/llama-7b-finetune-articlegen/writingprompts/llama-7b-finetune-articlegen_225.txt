It was stupid, so very stupid. I knew not to pick up hitchhiker, but I did it anyways. Now here I am, a five-foot-five girl, with a creepy six-foot stranger ridin in my car. 
He's bulkier than most, with an outward-projecced gut that bulges out the sides of his shirt. I can see he's got some kind of weapon on him and it makes me nervous. My heart beats faster as we get closer to where he wants to go. He wants to go down a back alley near my house and that scares me, but I do it anyways. 
He asks me what my name is, but I don't answer him. When I pull into the driveway of his apartment building, he doesn't even get out right away. Instead, he sits there in the car and tells me to roll down the window so that he can talk to me better. 
He asks if it will be too much trouble for me to go inside with him while he shows me the room, but I tell him no, not at all. I don't want to go inside his apartment because there are people living in it and I think they might hear us talking about what we have planned. 
He starts telling me how much fun we will have together tonight as soon as he gets back from the store where he has to pick up something first, but I don't like that part of the story because it sounds like he doesn't really want to be there with me at all. I know what's going on here; this guy wants money for sex and if I give him any then he won't stop until he has everything from my wallet, even though he told me before that he didn't need any more than one hundred dollars . . . 
### Ending:
He asks if it will be too much trouble for you to go inside with him while he shows you the room. When you say no, not at all, he doesn't like that answer because he knows what this guy wants from her--money! This story sounds suspicious when the girl tells us how much fun they will have together tonight as soon as he gets back from the store where he has to pick up something first. The next part of their conversation is even worse: "I know what's going on here; this guy wants money for sex and if I give him any then he won't stop until he has everything from my wallet."
