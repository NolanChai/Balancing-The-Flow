My father sat down next to me, rubbing his hands together and watching the crackling flames. He looked at me with a smile, and took the mint out of my hands. "I have to tell you something." I knew that tone in his voice, and so I stopped chewing on my mint and waited patiently for what he was going to say. "Do you remember when we went to see your mother's grave last week?" He asked. I nodded my head slightly, not even bothering to take a bite of the mint this time. It tasted bitter in my mouth, as if it had lost all its flavour from being left out for so long. My father continued on with his story, telling me about how he had heard some strange noises that night. I stopped chewing once again and looked at him suspiciously. "What did you hear?" He smiled mischievousy, but it was the kind of smile I didn't like to see from my father. It gave me an uneasy feeling in my stomach, like something bad was about to happen. "I don't know," he replied. His tone had changed slightly. From a voice filled with happiness and joy, to one that sounded cold and lifeless. "What do you mean? You don't know?" I asked him again, my hands shaking as they held the mint tightly in them. He looked at me for a moment before answering. "I heard someone calling out to us." The words were barely audible, but his eyes still burned with emotion as he spoke. My heart skipped a beat when I realised what had happened next. "We turned around and there she was..." "Who? Who was there?" I asked, my voice cracking slightly from fear. He took a deep breath before answering me again. This time his voice sounded stronger than ever. It sent shivers down my spine as he spoke: 'It was your mother.'
