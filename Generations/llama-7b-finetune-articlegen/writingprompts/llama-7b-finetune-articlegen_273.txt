The first part of the question is quite straightforward - so we'll tackle it first. They say that what you think about in your last moment is the most important thing in your life. I hope that â€™ s not true because as I lay here dying, my inside thoughts are intermingled with the machinery that has kept me alive all these years. If those machines were to stop functioning properly at this precise moment, then there would be no consciousness left whatsoever and so I wouldn't have any thoughts to consider. Of course, some people say it's not death that scares them; they fear the moment before they die - the moment of uncertainty in which you don't know whether or not you will die, but there is a strong possibility you might do. That certainly sounds like an awful place to be and I wouldn't want to find myself in it! The second part of the question requires some thinking about what I would have been doing for those last 10 minutes that preceded my death. I suspect that most people would say ' watching television' or something similar, but there are plenty of other possibilities which we might consider as well. Personally, I don't think I would be writing a blog post! On the contrary, I am quite certain that I would have been thinking about someone who was particularly close to me - perhaps my wife or one of my children (or even all of them). It's likely that they are the people I love more than anybody else and so it makes sense that I would think about them for those final moments. I have no reason to believe that what other people do in their last 10 minutes differs greatly from this, but it is a question worth thinking about! In the end, I don't really know what others will be doing for their last few seconds before they die... and that doesn't bother me at all.
