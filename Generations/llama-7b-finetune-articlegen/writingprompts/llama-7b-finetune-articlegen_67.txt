 I'm so sorry I didn't listen when you told me about the danger you were going into for us. But even if I did, we would still be in love and you wouldn't want to leave your family anyway. I don't know how we would have made it together without our children and grandchildren as a guidepost of what makes a good life. We will always be together in our hearts; I can feel your presence now even more than when we were side by side for so many years. Our love is eternal, just as we are together in my heart, and all the people who loved us. You've shown me that the greatest act of love one can do is to give their life for a greater cause, which you did for our country and family.
