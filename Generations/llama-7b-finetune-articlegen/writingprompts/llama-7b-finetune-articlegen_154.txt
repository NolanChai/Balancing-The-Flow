```
I never considered myself a bad person. Sure, sometimes I donâ€™t hold the door when I am in a rush and I have cut people off in traffic without using my blinker because I am careless or left the milk on the shelf at the grocery store. However, you cannot judge me as a bad person just from those minor errors in judgment. I believe that no matter what I do in life, I will always strive to be honest and respectful towards others.
