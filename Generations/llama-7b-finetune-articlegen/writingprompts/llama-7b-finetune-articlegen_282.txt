There are some problems in the sentences:
1. There are two 'say' verbs and they must be linked with a comma as follows : They said that originally humans eat meat but after the animals were destroyed, it wasnâ€™t safe to eat them .(add comma) 
2. 'It isn't safe to eat them' should replace by: It was not safe to eat them at that time or period .
