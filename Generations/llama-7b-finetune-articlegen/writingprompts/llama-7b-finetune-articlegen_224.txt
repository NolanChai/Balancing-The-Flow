`` Oh my gosh, yes! I am so sorry. I totally forgot about the whole gender-thing. And as for looking up from this book, I have been reading it for hours now and I haven't finished yet. '' 
 
 
 `` Look at me, I'm like a human calculator. It's awesome!'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` I don't get that joke. What do you mean? That you're a human calculator? '' 
 
 
 `` See, the whole point of it was to be able to multiply and divide numbers really quickly without having to think about it. Like you would if you had a calculator on your phone or something. You know what I mean?''. '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Yes, but how is that like looking at me? Or are you saying that you can't look up from the book because it's too much work to try and take in all that information at once?'' 
 
 
 `` Noooo. That 's not what I meant. My head just spins with numbers, man! They're everywhere. '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Then why are you looking up from the book? If there were too many numbers to look at then that wouldn't be possible would it?'' 
 
 
 `` No, but…'' 
 
 
T

### Response:
`` But what? '' 
 
 
 `` I have a headache from all the numbers! So if there were even more numbers then my head would probably explode. '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` That's an interesting idea, but I don't think that works in practice. Do you?'' 
 
 
 `` You could just try counting down from one-hundred a hundred times until it stops hurting! '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` What if we got to the end of our number before your head started to hurt again? Would that work then?'' 
 
 
 `` I guess so… '' 
 
 
T

### Response:
`` Well, what if we just counted down from a really high number like one-million or something? That would be interesting too. Or maybe two-million. Then you could keep counting and never have to worry about your head hurting again! '' 
 
 
 `` Are you trying to make me dizzy right now?'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` No, not at all! I just thought that it might be interesting if we could keep counting for a long time and never have to worry about your head hurting again. '' 
 
 
 `` Yeah but I don't know why you would want to do that…'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Why wouldn't I? It sounds like a really fun thing! '' 
 
 
 ```Hey, look at all the stars. Aren't they beautiful? Did you know there are more than a hundred billion galaxies in the universe? And each galaxy has billions of stars. So that means…'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Oh my gosh! That is so cool! '' 
 
 
 `` But what does it mean for me? Is this some kind of trick question or something? '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` No, not at all. I was just saying that there are a lot more stars than people in the world and so…'' 
 
 
 `` So you're trying to make me feel small by telling me how many stars there are? '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` No, not at all. It's just that I think it would be really cool if we could figure out how many people there were in the world too and then compare it to the number of stars! And then maybe you could write a song about it or something? '' 
 
 
 `` Uh…I don't know. That sounds kind of weird… '' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` But what if we counted all the people in the world and then found out how many stars there were too and then figured out what percentage each one represented? Or maybe even did it with dogs, or cats…'' 
 
 
 ```Hey! I have a great idea. Why don't you write me a song about all the people in the world and we can see how many stars there are too? That way we could compare them to each other and figure out what percentage each one represents! What do you think?'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Wow, that is kind of a lot of numbers. How long would it take us if we wrote it down on paper? '' 
 
 
 ```Oh my gosh I didn't even think about that! Maybe we could just make up the words and then write them down later. But what if there aren't enough songs for everyone?'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Well, what are you talking about? There are only seven notes in a scale, so I can just write each one out as many times as I need to until we get to the end of our song! '' 
 
 
 ```Hey, look at all these different colours! Aren't they beautiful? Did you know that there are more than five hundred shades of blue in nature? And each colour has its own name like purple and green and orange…'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Wow, I never knew that there were so many different colours! '' 
 
 
 ```Wow, I don't know anything about this stuff. What does it mean for me? Is this some kind of trick question or something?'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Nope, not at all! It's just that if you look at the colour wheel and see how many colours there are in each section…'' 
 
 
 ```Wow. That is so cool. What does it mean for me? Is this some kind of trick question or something?'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` No, not at all! It's just that if you look at the colour wheel and see how many colours there are in each section…''

### Response:
`` Nope, not at all! It's just that if you look at the colour wheel and see how many colours there are in each section… '' 
 
 
 ```Hey! I have a great idea. Let's paint everything yellow! Then we can count up until it stops hurting!'' 
 
 
 T

### Response:
`` Well, that might work if we started from the beginning of our number instead of counting down… '' 
 
 
 ```Hey look at all these numbers! Aren't they beautiful? Did you know there are more than a hundred billion galaxies in the universe? And each galaxy has billions of stars. So that means…''
