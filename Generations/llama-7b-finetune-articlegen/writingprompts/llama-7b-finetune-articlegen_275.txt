His touch was soothing as it traveled up to her inner thigh.  
 “ Thanks for pointing that out,” she said with a smile, her words barely audible. 
 He pressed his lips against hers and they both stood there without moving. The kiss lingered longer than he had intended on the first day of school. His lips remained on hers as her hands held onto his neck, pulling him closer to her. A soft sigh escaped from her parted lips at last breaking them apart. 
 “ Anna I need you now,” Jacob whispered. He pushed his body against hers, and with a push he made his way into her panties. She felt the heat of desire increase in intensity as they both moaned and gasped. The scent of their bodies melding together made him want more. His hands moved down from her waist to the top of her shorts, he started to unbutton them when she stopped him with a hand on his shoulder.
