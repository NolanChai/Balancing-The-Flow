The way you present this is very strong and opinionated. It immediately polarises the audience into those that support abortion and those that are pro-life (or don’t have an opinion either way). You could do better to find some middle ground between these two positions, and present a less biased viewpoint. For example, you might consider saying something like:
* ‘Pro-choice advocates do n't like it, almost no-one likes it, but people have done it.’
