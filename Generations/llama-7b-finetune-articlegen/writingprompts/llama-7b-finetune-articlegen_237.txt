 “ You have found the entrance to the underground base. There appears to be some sort of alarm going off, and there are guards patrolling around here somewhere. ” 

 “ I think they might also be watching this area via security cameras... we need to figure out a way in without alerting them first. ” 

“ Any ideas? ”
