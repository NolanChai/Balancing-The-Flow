San, San is a name given to the inhabitants of the planet Sanc-Dar. They are said to be a highly advanced society that has created a utopia on their home world. It was reported that they had achieved "godhood," and that no one can ever truly escape San. However this rumor is false, for there is still one who wishes to leave the planet, in order to return back to his original universe of origin.
