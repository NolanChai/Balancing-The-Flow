My friend called me and said he has just arrived in Spain after a long journey from Mexico. I asked him if it was good. He replied 'not bad but the bus broke down'. I asked what he did then, and he told me that the driver got out of the bus and pushed until they reached a small village where there was an old man walking his goats along the road. The bus driver said to my friend, "You stay here while we have some breakfast with this nice old fellow who can help us fix the bus". My friend replied that he would like to come too but didn't know what they were going to do so he stayed in the bus. The old man arrived and introduced himself as Don Antonio. He said, "We are going to look underneath the bus for a problem." Soon after, they found an engine part that was loose and tightened it up. Then my friend noticed that some of the passengers were looking at him strangely. When he asked them why, they replied, "That old man is a wizard! He can see into people's hearts!" As soon as he heard this, my friend bolted out of the bus to get his luggage and run away with all possible speed. My mother hurried into the kitchen only to return a moment later with a cake crowned by candles. In unison my parents started singing as she placed it on the table, "Happy birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday dear son . . ." I asked what had happened and he explained that he had decided to change his name because it was too common and could be used to describe a car. So he took off to Spain with his new name, "Albert Einstein."
