**_The following is a list of possible edits and/or suggestions that could be made for this response._** 1. SanDrea's day had been just as typical as ever. She walked down Michigan Av., putting her night in order... "I have to go over the two manuscripts for Jane and James for the meeting tomorrow morning." *The second sentence is not really necessary, so it could be omitted without changing anything else in the text.* 2. She was a bit anxious about it. Jane had been rather demanding as of late... *It's more interesting if you show us that she has reason to be nervous instead of just telling us. This is how I would edit this sentence: "She was a bit anxious about it, and for good reason."* 3. She had gotten the manuscript from Jane earlier that week.* If you really want to include this, you could probably just move it here: "SanDrea was a bit nervous about it. She had gotten the manuscript from Jane early last week." *Or maybe you don't need to mention what day of the week it was?* 4. . . .and she hadn’t been able to get around to doing so yet.* If this is the reason for her anxiety, then why wouldn't she just do it now? Otherwise, maybe you should change "and she hadn't" to "but she hadn't." *I would also cut out "doing so," since there are already two verbs in this sentence:* 5. . . . so she was determined to finish them tonight.* If this is a new anxiety that just developed, then maybe you should mention it now: "She decided she had to go over the manuscripts." 6. As usual, her phone kept going off and on as she walked up the street towards her office building.* You don't need "As usual," since it already shows that this happens all the time. I would just write something like "Her phone went off and on as she walked up the street to her office building." *I'm not sure if you want a comma here, but either way, your text needs an "as" at the beginning of this sentence.* 7. The office was quiet, as always; she had been working late for so long that only one other person worked on weekends.* This is too many descriptors. I would just say something like: "...she found herself alone in her office." *The rest can be left out unless you really think it's necessary to know where she works.* 8. She was almost at the door when a loud ringing bell echoed throughout the halls and jolted SanDrea awake* If this is happening as she reaches for the doorknob, then it doesn't make sense that it "jolts her awake." Maybe you should just change "jolted" to "startled," or maybe omit it altogether. *Or maybe I'm wrong about where she was when the doorbell rang?* 9. . . . She turned around and looked at her phone, annoyed.* If this is happening after she already reaches for the doorknob, then maybe you should change "She turned" to "SanDrea turned." *Or maybe I'm wrong again about where she was when the doorbell rang?* 10. It had been Jane calling again; she didn’t know how many times this had happened.* You don't need a comma between "It had" and "been," but you do need one between "She..." and "didn't." *I would also change "again" to something like: "SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts."* 11. . . . SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent.* If you want a comma here, then put one before "it" since it is an introductory clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 12. She quickly dialed Jane’s number before reaching out to grab her keys.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "phone," since "grab" is the end of a dependent clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 13. The phone rang twice before she answered.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "answered," since "twice" is the end of an introductory clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 14. “Hello?” She heard a muffled voice on the line.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "voice," since "muffled" is an adjective and not an introductory clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 15. “Oh… Sorry.” It took a moment before she heard anything.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "anything," since "It" is an introductory clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 16. “I’m sorry about before… I didn’t realize you had gotten off the line.” She heard a sheepish voice on the other end.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "sheepish," since it is an adjective and not a dependent clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 17. “I thought you said ‘Hello’?”* If you want a comma here, then put one after "thought," since it is an introductory clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 18. “Well I’m really sorry about that,” There was a pause.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "there," since "pause" is an introductory clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 19. “Are you okay?” This time there wasn’t any hesitation before she heard an answer.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "hesitation," since it is an adjective and not a dependent clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 20. “I am now!” Her voice was a bit more confident.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "confident," since it is an adverb and not a dependent clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 21. “I’m sorry about all of this… I don’t know why my phone keeps doing this.” The muffled voice came back to life.* If you want a comma here, then put one after "life," since it is an adjective and not a dependent clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer this call, as it seemed pretty urgent."* 22. “It’s okay… I know how frustrating this can get.”* If you want a comma here, then put one after "frustrating," since it is an adverb and not a dependent clause: *SanDrea was starting to wonder if there might be another reason behind Jane's constant calls, other than just the manuscripts. As she reached for her phone, SanDrea decided that she should probably answer
