The streets smelted of horseshit and the air was chocked with smog, and for a moment someone might have heard James McGregor praying that these were smells he would not need to get accustom to. He looked upon his surroundings and it was one that gave him pause for thought. The houses, although in good repair were dull grey; the pavement cracked and stained, and the gutters overflowing with sewage. McGregor knew that this was not the place he wanted to spend much of his time. Aware that the hour was growing late, and having little else to do on an evening so like this, McGregor took a turn around the area before making for home.

### Explanation:

In the above sentence there are several points that need highlighting in order to make sense of it. The first is the use of the word ‘might’; when writing, ‘may’ or ‘might have’ can sometimes be used as a substitute for ‘could’. In this case however I believe that the author was making a mistake, and should have used ‘could’ instead. I also think that he/she could have chosen an alternative verb in order to describe how McGregor felt upon his surroundings; words such as ‘notice’ or even ‘gaze’ may have been more appropriate. The second issue is the use of the phrase ‘and for a moment someone might have heard James McGregor praying that these were smells he would not need to get accustom to.’ I think that this could be condensed into two sentences in order to make it easier for the reader; firstly, writing about what McGregor saw and then adding how he felt. I am also confused by the use of ‘smells’ twice in one sentence; I can see why the author may have used the word as it refers both to smell and sight, but I think that the sentence would flow better with the word ‘sight.’ The last issue is the use of the word ‘accu-mate’ (for accustom) - although this is not a major problem, I do believe that there are many more options for the author which he/she could have chosen in order to make the text more readable.
