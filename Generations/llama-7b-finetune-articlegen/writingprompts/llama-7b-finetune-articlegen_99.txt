I heard the bell go off followed by the sound of running footsteps.  My first thought is that it was a fire alarm, and that people were running for the exit. So I did the same.  I grabbed some of the papers from my desk (because I was so surprised), but then realized that it wasn't a fire drill at all.  When I walked into the hallway outside of our classroom, I see another teacher in his classroom holding onto his students and asking them what they were doing there? After explaining myself to him, he explained to me that this was just part of an exercise for our safety. The whole thing felt kinda weird because the sound of running footsteps were so loud (and you know how it is when someone runs by your house in real life), and I had no idea if anyone else heard them or not.
