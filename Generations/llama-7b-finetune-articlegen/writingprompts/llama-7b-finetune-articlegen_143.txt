The main idea was that this was a revolutionary group that took over a house, and then created posters. They would put up their posters everywhere to promote their idea of a communal society with no government, they were also probably very socialist because the poster said "Communism is the solution". I think that their idea was too radical and extreme for anyone to really take notice of it, but maybe if this group had been in control of the country at some point or another, it could have happened.

### What we did well:
We did very good research by doing a lot of research on communism, which allowed us to find the answers to our questions and know what communism is all about. We also did a very good job on making sure that we didn't write any inappropriate words or phrases because there are people that read these posters everyday and if they found anything offensive then it would probably make them not like the poster and not care to go see what else this group is trying to do.

### What I learned:
Communism is a socialist idea for a society, but also a political system that tries to create a communal society, where everyone works for each other instead of themselves and doesn't own anything except what they wear on their bodies and a bed to sleep in. In this society there are no rules or laws because the government is gone, and everyone does as much work for everyone else as they do for themselfs.
