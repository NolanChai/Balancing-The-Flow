Preparing for drop to Mars...
The Red Planet is home to a variety of microscopic life forms, but has never had a native species large enough to be classed as 'big'. The first such organism to appear on the planet's surface will be named by you.
You have been selected as an elite group of test subjects for this unique experiment.
We need to know if you can survive long-term exposure to Mars, and how well your physiology can adapt to the conditions there. In order to do this, we must first subject you to extreme stress in a simulated environment. Please prepare for the following simulation.
