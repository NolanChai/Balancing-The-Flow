become. What is it to be a father? What if you were a great father but never knew your own father? 
 
I knew that my daughter would grow up in a family where I loved her and she loved me, yet I didn't know what I needed to do to get there. If I had the answers now, it might have been easier for her to understand why things were changing at home and maybe for us as well.

### Challenge:
I think that if you truly want to be a good father and not just an absent one then take some time each day to read to your son/daughter from books like The Five Love Languages of Children by Gary Chapman or The Happiest Toddler on the Block by Harvey Karp.
 
### Thoughts:
I know that I can't change what happened but I sure would love to change how it feels for my daughter. The hurt from not having her father around is still there and she often has a hard time trying to make sense of the world around her without him being here.
