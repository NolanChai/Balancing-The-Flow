Corners and corners.
I thought I had gotten over that whole "imaginary friend" thing when I grew up. You know the kind - the one that is there as a safety net if something happens to me? That was not it at all, just that little voice in the back of my head. Now though I feel it everywhere. Every time I try and take my eyes off the road, I see it. Everytime I wake up from a nap and stare at nothing, I hear it. It's gotten to be so bad now that I have started taking sleeping pills to help me get through nights, but then again... how would it know?
I guess the only real question is why this feeling came back all of a sudden. I can only assume something happened in the past week or so. Something that triggered me...
