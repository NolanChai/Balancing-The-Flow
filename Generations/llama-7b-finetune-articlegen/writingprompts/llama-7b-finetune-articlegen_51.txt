The log truck rumbled to a stop. Its diesel engine had been running hot the last hour, and it clicked and clanked now in the cool winter air. Dexter Morgan pulled a toque over his head and climbed down from the cab. He rubbed his eyes as he stretched his back. The sun hadn't been up long but already it was warm enough that the chill bite of the morning air had left him. A few feet away, he could see another truck idling on a nearby road. There were half a dozen more parked farther along. Dexter looked around and frowned. Something was wrong. He walked over to the other truck and knocked on the door. 'Hey, are you guys okay?' He asked through the window. The driver didn't answer. He just sat there with his hands on the wheel as if he were frozen in place. Dexter glanced around again. Everything seemed fine until . . . . . . 'Where is everyone?' Dexter turned toward the nearest truck and then looked back at the driver of the other truck. His expression was blank. There was no anger or panic, only a dull acceptance in his eyes. The silence grew louder as Dexter's thoughts began to race with worry. 'What is going on?' He asked the still form. 'This is . . . . . . wrong.' But even as he spoke the words, an unsettling realization washed over him and sent a chill down his spine. He knew what it meant. Something horrible had happened here. The other trucks were empty. The drivers were dead. They'd all been frozen in place - like this one . . . . . 'No.' Dexter said shaking his head as he ran to the back of the truck and climbed into the cab. He reached for the ignition but it was cold. Even if it had been running when they died, the engine wouldn't start now. 'What in God's name?' He asked out loud. There were no answers. No one would know what happened here. Dexter took a deep breath and began to examine the truck. Everything looked normal . . . at first glance. He pulled himself back into his seat as he thought through his next move. His mind raced as he tried to figure out where to go from here. It was just another day in the logging business - until now. But this wasn't the only thing wrong with things today. There had been a lot of changes lately. The new owners at the saw mill were asking questions and making demands that weren't easy to meet. Dexter didn't like how they were taking over more and more control but there was nothing he could do about it . . . yet. He sighed as he thought of his wife. She loved working in the logging industry too, but now things were different - maybe not better, but definitely different. They had been working together for years on this job but now they didn't have much time to talk anymore because of all the extra work and stress from the new management . . . Dexter was tired, hungry and scared but there wasn't anyone else around so he climbed out of his truck again. He walked over towards one of the other vehicles that looked like it might be running - if only someone were driving it. But when Dexter reached for the door handle nothing happened . . . not even a click or clack as he turned it. 'What's going on?' He asked out loud but there was no answer. He glanced around again and then shrugged his shoulders before turning back towards his own truck. 'Maybe this is just some kind of prank.' But even as the words came out of his mouth, he knew they were wrong. There had been too much death lately. Everyone was on edge - Dexter included. He climbed into his cabin and pulled himself into his seat. The silence was deafening now that the engine wasn't running anymore but it didn't matter because there wasn't anything he could do about it anyway. His thoughts were racing with panic as he tried to figure out what was going on around him . . . Dexter took a deep breath and began to think through his next move. There were only two options: try calling someone or just wait here until they came back. He knew that if he called the police, they might show up eventually but it would take time. It could be days before anyone responded even though things had already gone wrong for so long . . . and now with all these dead people on site? Dexter didn't want to wait around while other people figured out what was going on, he wanted answers right away! He started the engine but then stopped when something caught his eye: there were footprints in the snow leading up towards where they'd parked their trucks earlier today - someone had walked through this area recently . . . and now it looked like whoever did so may have been involved with whatever was happening here tonight too because more tracks appeared right outside one of his own vehicles as well. 'Wait a minute,' he said out loud before glancing back at where he'd parked earlier today - something wasn't right about all this . . . He stepped on the gas pedal and then hit the brakes hard when he realized what was happening: the other trucks weren't empty anymore! They were still running even though no one could drive them because they were frozen in place like everything else around here. 'What is going on?' Dexter asked again, but this time there were only answers that couldn't be heard . . . except for maybe from his own voice when he finally realized what had happened to him too: 'I'm Frozen! The driver of the other truck was frozen in place - and so was Dexter Morgan. He tried to move but nothing worked, no matter how hard or fast he tried to push against whatever was keeping them both from moving . . . . It was like being stuck inside a giant freezer with no way out except through these doors that were locked tight on their own accord . . . 'I'm Frozen!' Dexter screamed out loud as tears streamed down his face. His eyes met those of the driver sitting in front of him and it was clear they knew exactly how he felt because they weren't moving either - neither of them had any control over what had happened to them or where this was taking place but at least now there were two people stuck inside this frozen truck together . . . 'What do we do?' Dexter asked with a panicked voice. He knew that if he couldn't get out soon then whoever was doing this would probably kill him just for being around here in the first place, but even after everything else had gone wrong today it felt like things were getting worse and there wasn't anything they could do about it . . . except wait until someone came along to help them both escape this nightmare!
