The meaning depends on the context. If you're trying to determine whether to believe an advertisement, then "this product will make you lose weight" means that, in general, people who used this product lost more weight than did those not using the product. (If it made everyone gain weight, there would be a lawsuit.) If you're looking for more information about the product itself, then you may need to consult the literature cited by the manufacturer and/or do some research of your own.

### Explanation:

In general, if something works as advertised (losing weight in this case), then it can be said that "this product will make you lose weight." This is true for many products, but not all. An example might be an over-the-counter allergy medicine which makes some people sleepy (and others not). Thus, the statement "taking this medicine will help you sleep" can't necessarily be trusted. In fact, the FDA has warned that sleep is a common side effect of many prescription drugs and it's important to consult your doctor about potential interactions with other medicines.
