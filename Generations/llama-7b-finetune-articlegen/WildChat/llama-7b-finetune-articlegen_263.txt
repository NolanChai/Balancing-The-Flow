There's an unfortunate trend with this series, in that they never use their own voices for the seiyuus. So it just feels a bit awkward seeing how these guys don't seem to really care about the quality of the product they are selling you, and they want to keep making money off of it as well.

Yes. I have already heard a lot of news like that. Even in Japan, there are many cases where a copyright owner sues and wins damages from distributors who have distributed anime before the legal release date (I think it's usually one or two months earlier). In fact, according to the information I received, some anime are not even officially released but are only shown on TV as an advertisement. So they can be considered illegal videos without any hesitation.

The response is very long, so it will be divided into multiple posts.

* "1. Request a legal relleaase: Reach out to the distribuor's official representatives and let them know about the specific titles you want to see. If enough fans show interest, they may consider acquiring the license and making the content available legally."

**Yes, this is right, but it is not very effective. Anime streaming platforms have their own agenda. They have the power to decide what anime will be relleaed in different countries. If the fans want "To Your Eternity" to come out on Funimation, there is no way for us to know how many fans are watching it.**

* "2. Check legal international streaming platforms: Some internation streaming platforms, like Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Netflix, offer a wide range of animie titles. Altthough certain content may be region-locked, their catalogues are constantly updated, and the animie you’re interested in might become legally available later."

**Crunchyroll is not legal. Netflix protects itself from VPNs so people outside the USA can't access it. Funimation only releases about 10 new anime a year, so I don't think fans should rely on them.**

* "4. Import legally releaed DVDs or Blu-rays: Altough this can be expensive, consider importing DVDs or Blu-rays of the animie you want to watch from a country where they are legaly available. Be sure to check if your DVD or Blu-ray player can support the video format and region codes of the imported discs."

**DVDs are environmentally hazardous, we don't need them anymore! If anime comes out on Netflix or HBO, then I wouldn't mind to pay a little more for it.**

The people who protested outside the BBC's London headquarters have been dubbed 'marginals'. They may be in the minority but they have been given a platform to voice their opinion. The Mail's columnists also disagree about how to deal with them, with Peter Hitchens saying we should let them shout and scream as long as they stay outside. And Charles Moore argues that this is exactly what the 'marginals' want, in an effort to draw attention to themselves. For more on the Mail's response see . A number of columnists have criticised the BBC for its decision to invite the anti-cuts protesters into a Question Time studio. The Daily Telegraph's Matthew d'Ancona said that the BBC should not be giving a platform to those who are 'protesting on behalf of those who won't pay their TV licence'. In his column, he says: 'The BBC cannot simply ignore this threat to its independence and public-service remit.' The Mail also responded by saying that the protesters do not represent the silent majority. See . Owen Bennett in the Daily Express says that the BBC should 'sack the clowns' who allowed the protestors into the studio. He said: 'It’s not enough for the broadcaster to simply ignore them as if they were merely a bunch of cranks. 'It is their duty to confront these people with the fact that they are talking nonsense.' He also called for the BBC's director-general, George Entwistle, to be sacked. See . In the Daily Mail, Richard Littlejohn said that the protesters are using Question Time as a platform to air their 'petty grievances'. He added: 'BBC bosses have no option but to cancel the programme and order them to go away.' See . And in the Sunday Telegraph's blog, John Harris wrote that the 'noisy minority' has hijacked Question Time. He also said that 'the BBC is only helping itself by caving into these bullies'. For more on his response see . In a blog for the Huffington Post UK , Richard Desmond responded to the protesters in an interview with the BBC News channel. He said: 'I've had people who work in our business say they have been threatened, they have received abusive phonecalls, there are death threats - and I think that is totally unacceptable.' For more on his response see . The Daily Mail has responded to the protesters with its own 'Question Time' campaign. See . In an article for the Daily Star Sunday , a spokesman for the newspaper said: 'The BBC’s Question Time is nothing short of a national disgrace, as it has handed over the microphone and platform to unrepentant Marxists.' He also criticised the show for airing its programme in Manchester on the same night that the Queen made her speech. See . In an article in The Sun, Peter Oborne said the BBC had 'surrendered' to the protesters. He wrote: 'This week it was proved beyond doubt that this is a propaganda operation which masquerades as news and current affairs.' And he also criticised the show for 'handing over their studios to campaign groups'. See . In a blog post, Tom Watson MP said that the BBC's invitation to the protesters is an affront to all licence payers. He wrote: 'We want to make clear to the BBC that we are not going to sit back and let them abuse our intelligence any longer.' See . Meanwhile, a petition calling for Question Time to be axed has gained nearly 230,000 signatures since last Thursday's episode. It was set up by Tim Ireland, who is the founder of the Guido Fawkes blog. To read more about his response see . And on Tuesday, a group called 'Marginalise the Marginals' protested outside the offices of their local BBC branch in Leicester. See . On the day after the programme aired, Lord Ashcroft released figures which showed that 70 per cent of those who watched it voted Conservative in last year’s general election. In the Telegraph, Peter Oborne wrote: 'It is no accident that Question Time has been hijacked by such a small minority of people – they are able to manipulate its outcome.' And he also questioned how much money the BBC will save from cutting 2,000 jobs in the next few months. He said: 'As it is, there is nothing left after the wages bill has been paid, apart from a little for investment and rent. It might be more cost-effective to keep the job cuts out of public view.'

In an article for the Telegraph, Jeremy Warner said that the BBC has been bullied into airing a 'bizarre left-wing agenda'.

Those who are behind such a comment is obviously ignorant. So they think it's just some kind of "automatic" (bot). This is ridiculous. But no matter if this is a bot or not - this is a very bad move by the record company and the official representative of Crucifixion in Russia.
I hope that they will be more serious with their future actions because it's not only the fans but also the press who are now speaking about how the music industry does not respect its customers. And I think that this will be bad for them.
