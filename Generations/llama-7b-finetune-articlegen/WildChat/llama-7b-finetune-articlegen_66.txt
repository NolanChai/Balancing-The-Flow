I've gotten a lot of comments about how the alien from the movie "The Thing" looks like him. The way I see it, that alien is very similar in design to siren head because both creatures are more like amorphous blobs than anything else. That is why they look so similar.

I don't know if I can give a proper response. If you go to the original post in the backroom subreddit, it says "It was supposed to be about how creepy it is when I realized that most of my favorite video game races are just straight up humans." But as far as what the hell this means?

### Summary:
I feel like this was an attempt to make a funny and interesting post for people who know The Backrooms, but the person writing it clearly didn't have enough knowledge about how the backrooms works. They couldn't even get their races right because some of them are human-like (like Tauren) while others are clearly not from earth (like Draenei). Also why would anyone make a post on /r/starcraft2 knowing that most people who play sc2 are not going to know what The Backrooms is?
