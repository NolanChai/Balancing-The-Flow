> [Raft](https://www.google.com/search?q=Raft+game) is an online multiplayer video game in which players build and manage a raft to survive after being stranded on a large oceanic island, facing harsh weather conditions that worsen over time and dangers such as sharks and other sea creatures. 
> You need to build shelter for protection from the elements. The most challenging part of the game is managing your food supply - you can either hunt for animals or gather berries, but it's a delicate balance between hunting for meat and collecting berries for sustenance.  
> I would say that the biggest challenge in Raft is surviving in this hostile environment. The game is set on an island with no land mass - players are stranded at sea and must build a raft to stay afloat while they search for food, water, shelter and other resources. It's a lot of hard work!  
> You can craft weapons like spears or bows to protect yourself from sharks and other creatures that come close - but don't forget about your own health meter too!
