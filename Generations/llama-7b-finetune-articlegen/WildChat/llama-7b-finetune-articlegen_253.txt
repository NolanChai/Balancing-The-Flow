I'm sorry this chapter is so long, but I didn't want to cut anything out. And yes, the title of this fic has been taken from one of my favorite songs on a band called Pink Floyd. I have also seen "The Sound Of Music" and liked it, though I felt the film was better than the play.

Anyway, after writing a chapter that took me three days (I spent most of yesterday editing) I want to know what you think. I hope you like it. If not, let me know why in your review. And if you do like this chapter, please rate and leave a comment.
