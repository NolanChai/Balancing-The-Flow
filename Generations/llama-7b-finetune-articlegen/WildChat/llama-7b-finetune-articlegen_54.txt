This statement is not true in all cases.

### Reason:

- People forget, if they do not practice the skills learned or reinforce them through repetition and practice. The brain does not store information forever. The longer someone knows something, the easier it will be to recall when he or she needs it. 
- This statement does not recognize that learning is a process. You have to work at it. Good memory helps, but there are other factors involved as well (e.g., time, motivation).
- While some information can be recalled without conscious thought after extensive practice and repetition of the skill/knowledge learned, other types of learning require conscious effort or thinking when applied in a new situation (e.g., learning a language).

The only way I can think of is to summarize it as follows; It may be true that memory plays an important role in the process of learning but not necessarily, all learning needs to take place in a way whereby the learner has to remember everything he/she learns and memorization can be a very tough task for many people. Learning does not only involve memorizing things from the past but it is also about understanding new information. For instance, when we learn a new language we do not need to remember every word but understand their meaning which leads us to use them in our conversations and this way helps us learn more about that language and how to speak it fluently.

We often think of memories as things that we remember, but what exactly is memory? Memory is defined by the Meriam Webster Dictionary as "the mental capacities to store (information), retain (knowledge), and recall (past events)." This definition is a fairly general one. We tend to focus on information that we know in our everyday life because it is easiest for us to relate to, but it's important to take into account all forms of memories including stored knowledge, past events, or even sensations experienced throughout the day. Memory can be divided into many categories: sensory memory, short-term memory, working memory, and long term memory. 

#### Sensory memory:
Sensory memory is our first line of defense. It's where we receive information from our eyes (visual), ears (auditory) or touch (haptic). We only process these sensations for a split second before the information moves to short-term memory, or if it doesn't, we are not able to retain it. 
#### Short-term memory:
Short-term memory is where we can store and recall memories. However, these memories do not last long without further processing, which is why it is imperative that information is transferred into long term memory before we forget. It is also known as working memory or active memory because this is the only form of memory we have control over, and it takes up a great deal of mental energy.  
#### Long-term memory:
This form of memory allows us to recall memories that are unrelated in time and space from each other. This means that any information stored in long term memory can be recalled at any time because these memories are not lost when we change our environment, or even if we go without sleeping for days at a time (Kensinger et al., 2013).

**The learning myth "Memorization is the key to successful learning" has been proved untrue. In fact, it's just a very naive statement.**

We have had countless experiments with different kinds of students and different methods to examine what kind of method works best for learning. And we find that memorizing can be good but not always necessary. Especially in today's world where you can simply look things up on the internet whenever you don't remember a word, memorizing isn't as important as it used to be.

In the 1890s, there was a famous experiment by Sir Francis Galton where he examined how well people can reproduce words that they are given randomly. He gave 2 groups of people some words and told them to copy those words down. After giving out all the words, he asked each group if they knew any of the words beforehand, and found that about 60% of the words were known by at least one person in each group. So his conclusion was that "Memorization is the key to successful learning". However, it is a very flawed conclusion because people are likely to be familiar with certain types of words, like names or words they have been exposed to before. 

The most recent studies on memorizing suggest that memorizing can help you to recognize and remember something once you see it again. But what if you want to do something with it? That's where we have trouble because the information stays in our short-term memory for only about a few minutes, and then disappears forever. Therefore, unless someone is practicing their memorizing skills often, they are not going to remember anything after a while.

To put it simply, **memorization isn't enough**. If you just want something to be in your brain but don't want to do anything with the information afterward, then sure go ahead and memorize everything. But if someone wants something useful out of their knowledge, they will need more than memorizing. They have to learn how to **organize and connect** those facts into a bigger picture so that they can see how different pieces work together as one unit. For example: if you want people to know about the world around them but don't teach them why things are important or how they relate with each other, then it won't make sense in their brains because there is no context for these facts and ideas.

Therefore, **memorizing alone isn't enough** because most of what we know can only be understood after learning the connections between those pieces of information first. This way you will have a better understanding of how everything fits together as one unit instead of just knowing every fact separately. 

The best thing about learning today is that there are so many different ways to learn, and it isn't limited by just memorizing facts anymore because technology allows us to look things up instantly when we don't remember something. However, I believe the most important thing in education should be teaching people how to organize their thoughts into a bigger picture so they can connect all these pieces together as one unit instead of just learning every fact separately without context or purpose behind them.
