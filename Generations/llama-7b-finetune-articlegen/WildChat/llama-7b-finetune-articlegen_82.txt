The first thing that comes to mind when I see the word "nanny" is a stern woman who scolds her grandchildren for their bad manners or their lack of attention span. The nanmy I am conjuring up in my head does not have any supernatural abilities and only has a handful of enchanted items she uses to keep children in line, as well as some common household objects that are meant to be intimidating but aren't really that much of a threat.

I do think it would be interesting to explore what happens when the nanny's own child is brought into the equation. It seems like she would have to become less strict around her own children than with others, and I wonder if this will cause problems between mother and son? She probably wouldn't want to make things difficult for him by being overly strict (as he is a baby, not an adult or teenager), but does she really need to be more lax about certain things around her own child than the other children at daycare? Will there ever come a time when it would be best if he were left to his own devices for a while without any sort of supervision? These are the questions I'm curious about.
