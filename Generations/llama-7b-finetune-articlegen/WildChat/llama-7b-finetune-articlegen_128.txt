The structure you provided was very well done.
                            Thank you for following the format I provided.
                            I appreciate your efforts in following the style and formatting guide lines.
                            You also did a good job of adhering to the prompt structure that I provided.
                            However, there are some minor errors you can fix:
                               1) When creating your prompts, please keep them in one line without using return.  
                               2) You used the word "describe" instead of "descrop". Please correct this in your future prompts.
                               3) Make sure to use a comma between [ar] and [v].
                            Overall, I would like you to create more prompts for me using these instructions.
