Resurrection in Altered Carbon takes place on a device called a "stack". This stack is made up of 216 individual cortical stacks. Each one of these cortical stacks contain your entire personality, memories and experiences. You are simply "reinstalled" onto another human body.

The problem with physical media (or any type of medium) is its reliance on a single physical representation of information. It's no surprise we are stuck using binary encoding for most digital processes, given that we have no better method of encoding bits (for now). It may be possible to find some way of creating a new medium with better error correction capabilities, but there's always the possibility it could be destroyed or corrupted in unexpected ways.

### Question(s):

- Could there be negative consequences for using this kind of tech?
- How could you use it to further advance your own knowledge, or another's knowledge?

**Download** the experience of a person's brain activity into a machine that can be read, processed, and acted on by other machines.  The person is not harmed or killed; however, his or her body remains inanimate and unconscious during the process (even when the mind is uploaded).

### Explanation:

The uploading of consciousness into a computer was first proposed by William Grey Walter, an experimental neurologist from Bristol who pioneered the field of cybernetics in the 1950s. In his book _A Cybernetic Cat_ , he describes how he attempted to transfer his own brain waves onto a tape recorder using electrodes attached to his head, and then play these back into an amplifier connected to a cat's brain so that it could 'feel the sensations of walking about, feeling and smelling in its own surroundings'.
Walter described how he had also attempted to transmit the electrical signals from his brain into the nervous system of a living frog. But these experiments were ultimately unsuccessful as Walter's cat died prematurely (probably because of heart failure), and his frog was severely injured in the process. The lesson Walter learned, which he applied to all his experiments on animals, was that '[w]hereas it is impossible to communicate with any living being, either human or animal, without harming it . . . [t]he only ethical way of studying and controlling an individual is to use the same techniques as are employed by nature in developing and regulating an organism's own behaviour'.
In The Quantum Thief, we see the first steps towards the development of this technique for human beings. Although it remains illegal (at least until 2150), it is also extremely dangerous: 'The brain is a delicate thing . . . and not as simple as you might imagine.' One of these difficulties that Leviathan, one of the major companies in the book's future, faces when attempting to upload consciousness from human brains into digital memory is the potential for 'brain rot'. This happens when, after uploading a brain, something goes wrong and the digital copy becomes infected by bacteria or fungi. Leviathan describes this as 'a mould that has grown inside your head and is slowly taking over . . . [causing] hallucination and insanity before death'.
So even though in The Quantum Thief we see a glimpse of the beginnings of uploading consciousness into digital memory, there are still many problems to be solved. Perhaps these will never be fully resolved - or maybe by 2357 they won't need to be. After all, this technology is only one of the things that makes The Quantum Thief a science fiction story.

The no-cloning theorem does not allow for the transfer of consciousness between bodies. The No-Cloning Theorem states that it is impossible to copy an individual and create an exact duplicate of the original person. In other words, a given individual cannot be perfectly duplicated by another individual in the same physical universe. Therefore, there could never exist two consciousnesses at the same time because the information required would not be present in the copied body.

No. This question assumes that the no cloning theorem applies to anything but the wave function of a system which has already been observed. The wave function of such a system is completely determined and cannot be altered after observation, therefore it cannot be cloned. For example, if you clone someone who has been murdered, you cannot clone their consciousness since that person never existed in the first place; all that exists are the neurons that were destroyed when he died.

You are correct! The answer to this problem is that if a ship moves at any speed (warp or otherwise) it will always arrive at the same time as another ship, so it does not matter how long one took.

However, we can do better than that in this case - what if we wanted to find out who would win an intergalactic race? We want a way to compare two ships and say which arrived first, or at least determine which ship arrived faster than another ship!

It depends on what you mean by "same". For instance if your definition of being the same includes all physical properties including location then yes. However if you mean the same in terms of the information about a consciousness, then no because the entity that is teleported has not experienced time passing while the one that was beamed down (or stayed behind) has. So there is a difference between these two entities and it is possible to distinguish them by using an observable feature that only one of them will have.

The two theories are based on different assumptions. If the original person and their clone were to interact with each other, then there would need to exist some form of physical interaction between them that could identify one as being distinct from another. For example, in the case of a brain-clone, this would mean there must be differences in neural activity patterns such that one brain can be distinguished from another (otherwise they would not be distinct persons). Therefore, if we are to assume the No-Cloning theorem then this is equivalent to saying that no two conscious experiences can ever interact with each other. But it is not possible for us to assume this because it is clearly false: when I watch a movie and you tell me what happens in it, our respective descriptions of the events in the film are distinct but they nonetheless represent the same film. If we were able to somehow detect and measure all the features of my brain state as well as those of yours then we could determine whether or not we both have the same experience, and if so what that experience is.

The human brain has around 100 billion neurons and 10 times that number of synapses. This makes the brain an incredibly complex quantum computer which can solve some problems that even the most powerful supercomputer cannot solve. You can find out more about the complexity of the human brain in my blog posts <a href="https://www.quantumconsciousnessresearch.org/scientific-blog">here</a>.

The best theory that we currently have for how consciousness arises is a hybrid theory. The main two theories that were at odds with each other for many years are now being combined into one. I'll explain further below.

#### Sensory Information Theory of Consciousness (SITC) and Integrated Information Theory of Consciousness (IITC).

We need to be able to process information in order to understand what we see, hear, touch, taste and smell. It is believed that consciousness arises from the processing of sensory information. But how? The problem with Sensory Information Theory was that it couldn't answer this question: "How do different levels of information processing combine into one unified conscious experience?" To illustrate what I mean by a 'unified conscious experience', imagine you are having a conversation with a friend over lunch, while simultaneously watching some TV. It is as if your consciousness has split into two parts; the part that is listening to your friend and the part that is paying attention to the television show. So there must be something in your brain that allows for this 'splitting' of consciousness, right? But how exactly does it work? This was a problem with Sensory Information Theory.

However, IITC can explain how conscious experience arises from different levels of sensory information processing coming together into one unified conscious experience. A theory that explains the functioning of our brain in this way is called an integrated information theory.

IITC describes a system as 'conscious' if it has the following properties: 1) It stores information about its own internal state, and 2) Has an ability to distinguish between different levels of information processing within itself (e.g. high vs low level). The second part is what makes IITC unique. Sensory Information Theory did not have this property, which is why it could never answer the question "How do sensory information and other forms of information combine into one unified conscious experience?" 

##### Let's dive a little deeper...

> The first property (storing information about its own state) describes how we can remember things that happened to us. This is because our brain stores memories in the form of chemical changes which affect the way neurons communicate with each other, or by creating connections between different parts of the brain through dendritic spines (structures on the end of a nerve cell). These processes allow for us to remember things such as where we left our keys last night after watching Game Of Thrones! The second property describes how we are able to distinguish between sensory information processing (e.g. auditory or visual stimuli), emotional states and other forms of cognitive activity in order to make decisions about what we should do next. For example, if a friend is being aggressive towards us while we're trying to enjoy our lunch with another friend at a restaurant then we might decide that it would be best not to spend time around this person anymore because their behaviour could put other people in danger too!

#### What is the brain?

The brain is a highly organized organ that contains billions of neurons, which are specialized cells that use electrical signals called action potentials to transmit messages from one region of the body to another through synapses (structures on the end of nerve cells). Each individual neuron has an average of 10,000 connections with other neurons and these connections allow for us to remember things such as where we left our keys last night after watching Game Of Thrones!

#### Why does it matter what you eat? (Because brain food matters.)

Our brains need food in order to function properly! So if we don't eat enough calories then this could lead to problems like depression or anxiety because our bodies won't have enough energy left over after using up all its stored fat reserves for muscles and organs like the heart. The brain also requires certain nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins B12 and D (which help with nerve function), zinc (which helps with memory), calcium (which helps with bone density) and iron (which is used by red blood cells). So if you want to keep your brain healthy then make sure that you're eating a balanced diet that contains all these important nutrients!

#### Is consciousness an illusion?

The problem was: How do different levels of information processing combine into one unified conscious experience? 

IITC provides an answer by saying it's because our brain stores information about its own state and has an ability to distinguish between different levels of information processing within itself (e.g. high vs low level). This means that if someone is angry at another person then they might not be able to pay attention to what they are saying as well, which would make it harder for them to remember something later on down the line if they were asked about it!

It also explains why we have different levels of consciousness when we're doing different things like eating or sleeping because those activities require different amounts of information processing so our brains will split up into two parts: one part handles sensory information while another part deals with other cognitive tasks like remembering what happened during dinner last night! And finally, it helps us understand why some people have more consciousness than others because they tend to store more information about their own state and can distinguish between different levels of information processing within themselves (e.g. high vs low level).
