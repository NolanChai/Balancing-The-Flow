Sweden has a bicameral parliamentary system, with the Riksdag as the legislative branch and the Government as the executive branch. The Riksdag consists of 349 members elected every four years by popular vote to serve at least two years terms.[1] The Government is appointed by the King and has a maximum size of twenty-three ministers, usually split between sixteen ministers from the largest political party or coalition and seven minsters from other parties. The Constitution of Sweden, the Instrument of Government (Swedish: Regeringsformen) was adopted in 1809 with amendments in 1974.[2]
