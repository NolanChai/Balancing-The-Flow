I think this is an interesting topic and I am sure that the children will be keen to learn more about it. I would start off by looking at what they already know about the country or region (if anything!). Then I would talk about some of the features that make up a mountain range - for example, their shape, size and position in the world.

I am sure they will be very interested to hear why mountains are there (volcanic eruptions) but also why some have snowy peaks while others are covered in palm trees!

Finally I would ask them if they know any famous or well-known mountains from this region and encourage them to name a few. This will be a great starting point for your next lesson on the countries/regions of the Balkans...
