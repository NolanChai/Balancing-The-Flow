In order to get a passing score, your prompts must have 4 distinct concepts that vary in descriptions, environment, compositions, atmopshere, and realizations. Your prompts should be clear, specific, realistic, and accurate. They also need to follow the instructions carefully for each line.
                            
### Note:
                            The Midjournney AI you will use is not perfect, so your prompts must be precise.
