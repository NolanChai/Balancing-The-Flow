- This is a really cool idea. I think the only change I might make to this would be that you don’t want to use [player], as it is too ambiguous as to what should happen in there. Another option would be to call Jade’s baby ‘the player’ and then have Jade talk about them (in a way where it is clear that the player will never interact with their own child). The second part of the scene was interesting but I don’t quite understand the last sentence in the third paragraph. Could you expand on this?
