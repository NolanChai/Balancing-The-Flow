It was another day in the supernatural clubroom as any other. Sayori was a vaampire, Yuuri was a talking zombie that doesn't eat brainzzz, Natsuki is an angeel, and I am a human and phonenix hybrid. Due to Sayori's vampirian nature all the club meetings had to be taken at night. More importantly this is her first pregnecy - she was seven months pregnant with a boy and girl.)
