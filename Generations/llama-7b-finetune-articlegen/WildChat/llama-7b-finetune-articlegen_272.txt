(Alatreon walks through a door)

Alatreon: “It’s an office of some sort. It looks like there’s something behind that shelf.”

(Alatreon look at the shelf and notice it has a pile of documents on it, but it also has a box with a keyhole in it.)

Alatreon: “There is no way this box would fit through that door. Unless there was another passageway somewhere else...”

(The box floats over to Alatreon)

Alatreon: "Huh? What are you?"
