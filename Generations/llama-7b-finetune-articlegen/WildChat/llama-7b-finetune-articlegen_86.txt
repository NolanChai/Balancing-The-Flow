In the past 15 years, companies have undergone rapid changes in their
management strategies. In recent years, many businesses are choosing to
adopt a more liberalized management style (e.g., flat organizations). This
new approach is based on two underlying assumptions: First, all employees
are highly motivated and can be trusted with considerable autonomy; and secondly,
it assumes that employees are knowledgeable about their positions in an
organization and capable of making independent decisions. For instance, a
flat structure of management allows for the sharing of information and
decisions between multiple levels within an organization (Baldwin &amp;
Pearce, 2013). This approach can be traced back to the ideas of Charles
Ford, who was one of the first managers to suggest a flat organizational structure. He believed that by eliminating formal authority and chain of command within an organization, employees would work as teams and share information freely (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013). The idea of flat
management is still in its infancy with many organizations implementing the
approach at various degrees. Despite the fact that it has yet to be fully implemented on a large scale, several companies such as Google have begun
to experiment with this approach and have seen positive results (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013).

The first argument in favor of flat management is that it increases the
ability for employees to work together as teams. In order to achieve their
goals, managers are increasingly relying on collaboration rather than simply
individual contributions (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013). As a result, companies have shifted away from traditional management styles where the hierarchy was rigid and employees worked in silos. In today’s business world, this approach can be very beneficial for organizations who are looking to improve their productivity while reducing costs (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013). This is especially true if a company has a large number of skilled workers that need to work together on projects with varying degrees of complexity. As an example, consider the case of Google where they use teams made up of different specialists who are experts in their respective fields (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013). Each individual team is given a specific task or goal that must be accomplished by a certain timeframe with limited resources. By having these teams work together as one unit, Google can increase its productivity while reducing costs associated with hiring multiple managers and supervisors (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013).

The second argument in favor of flat management is that it increases employee motivation by giving them more autonomy over their work. This approach has been proven to increase morale among employees as well as reduce turnover rates within companies (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013). For example, if an employee feels like they are being micromanaged or having too much supervision over their everyday tasks then this can lead to decreased motivation which ultimately results in low productivity levels over time (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013). On the other hand, if a manager allows for more autonomy among employees and gives them the opportunity to make decisions that will affect their work environment then this can lead to increased employee motivation as well as improved teamwork between workers (Baldwin &amp; Pearce, 2013).

### Question:
What is a flat organization? Is it always advantageous for a company to have a flat structure of management? Why or why not? Give your argument and justify your answer.

Contemporary Approaches are a collection of many different styles and techniques for teaching. Many contemporary approaches were designed to help teachers understand how the brain works and then apply these concepts to their lessons in order to better reach students, especially struggling learners (Florian & Chappuis 1980). One of these approaches is called Cognitive Strategy Instruction (CSI) which has been proven successful for struggling readers. In this approach teachers give students direct instruction in a specific strategy that they then have to apply on their own and monitor how well they are doing with the help of checklists or worksheets (Bradley et al. 2017).

### Critique:

Cognitive Strategy Instruction is a great approach for helping struggling readers learn strategies that can improve their reading skills. This technique helps students understand and remember how to use these strategies which in turn can help them become better, more independent readers. However, this strategy needs to be used properly and often, which may not always be the case depending on what school is using it. There are checklists or worksheets that teachers can give their struggling students to help them monitor how well they are doing with a given strategy, however, if those aren't being filled out then it won’t work as intended (Bradley et al. 2017).
