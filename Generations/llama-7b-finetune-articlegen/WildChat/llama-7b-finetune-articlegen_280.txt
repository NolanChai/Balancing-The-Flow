#### Instruction #1 (Instructions to Screenwriters):
For the purposes of this assignment you will be treated as screenwriters for an entertainment-based television or film company. Your aim in each of these instructions is to produce the best script possible which captures and engages your audience (i.e. viewers/readers) by providing an interesting, suspenseful plotline, and humorous/witty dialogue. In some cases you may be given specific requirements to fulfill, while in others you have freedom with regards to how your story progresses and characters develop. Your aim is always to produce a script which will engage the audience for as long as possible by capturing their attention from start to finish, whilst also maintaining a sense of humour and realism throughout. The first task I want you to complete is based upon the following scenario: You have been instructed to write an episode of the TV series ‘Friends’ which is based around the character of Rachel Green and her friend Monica Geller. In your script, Monica has a bad cold and Rachel offers to look after her in her apartment in order to save her from catching it herself. As you know, these characters have many quirks but I would like you to take particular notice of their mannerisms when writing this scene so that it feels as though they are being performed by the actors who originally played them, Jennifer Aniston and Courtney Cox. To give your script a distinctive touch, I’d also like you to base the episode around an incident in which Rachel accidently reveals Monica’s most private secret to Ross (Monica’s brother), which she is trying her best to keep hidden from him. The second task requires that you write a film scene based upon the following scenario: A young couple have just left their engagement party after an argument with the bride-to-be’s parents, who were disappointed with the fact that they didn’t invite many of their own friends and relatives. As they are driving home from the party, a police officer pulls them over for running a red light, at which point it is revealed that the man is actually on probation and has been warned to stay out of trouble. The couple become worried and attempt to escape the situation by offering the police officer money in exchange for letting him go. This task requires you to create a scene in which this bribery attempt takes place. Please take special note of the time frame within which you have to produce this script as well as the characters, who should be played by George Clooney and Julia Roberts (according to my sources). Finally, I would like you to write an episode of ‘The Office’ which is based around the character of Jim Halpert and his pranks. To give your scene a unique touch, I want you to base it upon a prank that he performed on Ryan Howard in one of the episodes of the series. The task requires you to create a script in which Ryan accidentally walks into Jim’s office while he is naked after going for a shower without knowing there are people around. In order to get his revenge, Jim has covered every mirror and wall with sticky tape so that Ryan can not look at anything but himself. The final instruction I have given you requires you to create an episode of ‘The X Factor’ which is based upon the judge Sharon Osbourne. I would like you to use your creative talents to devise a scenario in which she reveals that she has been lying for years about having cancer as she was simply worried that her fans wouldn’t be able to relate to someone who had actually experienced such a horrific experience. The episode should also contain references to her famous feud with the other judges on the show, Simon Cowell and Louis Walsh, which occurred in 2006 as well as jokes about her past career as a heavy metal singer. This task requires you to create a script for an entire episode of ‘The X Factor’ so please be sure that it includes at least one performance from each judge (Sharon, Simon and Louis) along with their comments on the contestants. Please note: this assignment is to be completed in English as your first language. If you find yourself struggling to produce a script for any of these scenarios or have been given an instruction which does not make sense then please do not hesitate to contact me via email. In order to ensure that we are all on the same page, I’d like you to send me copies of each script before you begin working on it so that I can check whether everything is in order. This will also help me to determine how well each of you understands what has been required from them and how much guidance may be needed throughout the process.

#### Response (Instructions to Screenwriters): 
The following response is the screenplay for a scene from 'The Office' where Jim Halpert plans an elaborate prank on Ryan Howard, after the latter had gone to the bathroom without noticing he was being watched and subsequently walked in naked. The script is written as it would appear in film, with camera angles, dialogue, scene descriptions etc. The script is 12 pages long. The episode starts off where Jim is sitting on his chair, alone at his desk, waiting for Ryan to come back from the bathroom after he had gone to have a shower. He tries to keep himself busy by playing games on his phone but soon loses interest and turns towards the wall in boredom. The camera then pans over Jim's shoulder as he watches Ryan walk through the office, still naked and unaware that anyone was watching him. As soon as he walks into Jim's office he notices that something is wrong when he sees his phone lying on his desk instead of being placed inside the drawer as usual. He tries to pick it up but is unable to because of all the sticky tape covering both sides of the wall from top to bottom. As Jim watches Ryan walk around the office trying to figure out what has gone wrong with his phone he finally realizes that everything is covered in sticky tape and tries unsuccessfully to get it off himself, shouting "what's going on here?!" He then sees Jim staring at him through his desk and starts looking for a way out of the room while trying to keep as quiet as possible so as not to alert Jim. Suddenly, he finds an open door in front of him and runs straight towards it without thinking about where he is going or what might happen next... In this scene, I wanted to take advantage of the fact that Jim has had experience performing pranks on his co-workers (for example, when he faked being ill with a cold to get out of work). His character is also known for coming up with elaborate plans and using them in order to fool people into thinking something else has happened than what really did. As such, this situation gives him the perfect opportunity to prove how clever he really is by coming up with an idea that will make Ryan realize what has gone wrong but still make it seem like nothing more than a coincidence or misunderstanding on his part instead of admitting defeat at last minute and apologizing for everything he had done so far. This scene is intended to show us how Jim feels when he is not able to get away with something that he planned carefully beforehand due to an unexpected event occurring while executing said plan. The episode will then end on a cliffhanger as Ryan walks out of the room without saying anything about what just happened and leaves Jim alone in his office wondering how long until someone discovers him sitting there playing games instead of working hard at his desk like usual!
