(After noticing the puddle, Yuri said "Uhm...Natski? I don't think your cupcake batter is supposed to be blue..." She looked down - and her eyes grew wide. There, in front of her, was a tiny baby girl! She picked it up and examined it, but there were no signs that it had been born from Natski. Sayori then appeared from behind a nearby shelf.)

Sayori: "Ah, I've just come back...I was watching the news."
Natski: "...? News?"
Yuri: "Uhm, you don't remember...?"
Natski: "Uhm...no..."
Yuri: (With a slightly disgusted expression) "Oh. That's probably for the best..." She put it back down and then disappeared behind her book again. Sayori looked at the girl, but did not pick it up.)

Sayori: "...What shall we do? You should probably take it to the hospital."
(Natski quickly stood up and rushed out of the room. Yuri followed her.)
Yuri: "Uh...say, you two don't have to leave! It was just a baby - it won't hurt anyone!" Sayori remained silent.)

### Event 1

Sayori (After leaving the clubroom) : "Natsuki-san, please bring the baby back here as soon as possible..."
(Natski stopped outside of the building and looked at her phone. It was then that she noticed a large amount of blood on it - as if something had just happened.)

### Event 2

Natsuki (As she rushed to the hospital) "Sayori-san...Sayori..." She gasped in surprise when she saw Sayori lying motionless on the floor. Her eyes were open, but there was nothing behind them - no life at all.)
