<p>This is the powerpoint app. You should be able to view it with <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/powerpoint/" target="_blank">Microsoft PowerPoint</a>. If you're not using Windows, use a Linux VM (either VirtualBox or VMware) and run VirtualBox Guest Additions for the best performance. Enjoy! :) </p>
