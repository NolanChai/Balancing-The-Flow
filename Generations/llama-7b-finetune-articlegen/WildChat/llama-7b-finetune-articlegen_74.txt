You are required to create a response for each prompt that you received. You can either provide the images that were generated from your prompt or just give your feedback about the image (either positive or negative). Feel free to choose the way that you wish to respond in this project, but make sure to include your response as a part of the project submission.
                            
                            You are also required to provide 1-2 words of feedback for each prompt provided by me. If the image was not generated using the prompt you provided then just tell me that it did not generate any images and you will receive one extra word of positive feedback (instead of two) from me.
