We have just launched a new UK Plug Protector, which will only allow a UK power supply to be connected to it. The device is easy to use and allows any non-UK plug to be inserted into the UK plug socket. When an unsuitable power supply has been attached, an LED on the Plug Protector illuminates, preventing the unauthorised supply being used. The LED will turn off once a valid UK power supply has been connected. 
The Plug Protector is now available for purchase from our online store:   https://www.plug-protect.com/shop/products/uk-plug-protection-pack?variant=29506448473&gclid=Cj0KEQiA_vKqBRCr0ZzUYuVGXxwBEiQA63tJTjY6bRWLV6lcGw2m-HZSsVWO98YpHsZyVqDqVkKQqdIaAqX8P8HAQ
