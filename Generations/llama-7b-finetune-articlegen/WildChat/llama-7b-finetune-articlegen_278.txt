1) Subliminals that are used by the people who have been abused when they were child (or even when they are not children), should be like a "therapist in their head" - telling them how to feel better, what to do, what is wrong with this or that behavior and so on. So I would use something like this:
* "You don't have to take any of the blame for it." (affirmations: 1) "I was not bad at all, I was just a child" ; 2) "They were wrong to do it." ) 3) "It wasn't my fault."; and so on).
* "You can forgive them now" (Affirmations: 4) "It is ok if they have made mistakes. That doesn't mean that I don't love/like/appreciate them"; 5) "I can move forward without holding grudges."; etc...
* "Your childhood wasn't as bad as you think it was" (Affirmations: 6) "I am loved"; 7) "My parents/guardians are not bad people - they just had some issues/problems at that moment and I have to accept that."; etc...
2) Affirmation can be something like this:
* "You are a great person and you deserve all the happiness in life" (Affirmations: 8) "I am an amazing person"; 9) "My friends love me and appreciate me. I am not alone."; etc...
* "You have been through difficult times, but it is time to move forward now!" (Affirmation: 10) "Everything will be better from now on.") ; or any other positive affirmations you think can help people heal their childhood and become a happy person.
3) The other thing that I would do is - use subliminals, which are helping people to believe in themselves more (their own self-esteem), so they don't blame themselves for everything (like when something happens, or even if it doesn't happen). And then we could also add some "forgiveness" affirmations with them. For example:
* "You are awesome!" (Affirmation 11) "I am amazing"; 12) "I can be loved and appreciated by others."; etc...
* "Your childhood wasn't as bad as you think it was, but sometimes things happen that are not your fault. It is ok to feel bad about this situation, because you can not change what has already happened - so forgive yourself for everything (and your parents/guardians too) and move forward." (Affirmations: 13) "I am a good person"; 14) "Everything will be better from now on. I can let this go now!"; etc...
So it would look like something like that - depending on what subliminal you are using, of course!
