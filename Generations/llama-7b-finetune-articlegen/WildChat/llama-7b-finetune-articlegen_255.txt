**Driving Route:** Start driving from Ring of Kerry travel clockwise. Stop 1) Killarney (67.242058 -9.505173). There is a parking lot in town for €2 all day, otherwise try the car park beside the tourist office on Park Road, Killarney (67.241435 -9.497084) .   Stop 2) Torc Waterfall (67.332903 -9.533518). Go through town and take the left fork at the first traffic light, you can either follow this road to its end or keep straight ahead for a couple of kilometres until it meets with the N22 once again. From there, continue down the main road for about 10 minutes until you arrive at a large car park on your left.   Stop 3) Ross Castle (67.282419 -9.554076). Take a right from Torc Waterfall onto the N22 and drive for another few minutes until you get to this castle.    Stop 4) Gap of Dunloe: At Ross Castle, take the right turn into Gap of Dunloe (67.31986 -9.56209). There are a number of ways to go through the Gap that have varying fees. I would recommend renting bicycles and riding all 11km back and forth, from the upper lake to the lower lake, at least once (67.347164 -9.584105). It's a long ride with a lot of up-hill climbs, but it is well worth it!   Stop 5) Muckross Abbey & Gardens: At the end of Gap of Dunloe, drive straight down the road towards Killarney until you get to this abbey (67.347180 -9.428399). Once there, explore the abbey and gardens, and take the 10 minute walk to Ross Island for views of Torc Mountain & Castle from across the lake (67.350670 -9.429678).   Stop 6) Skellig Islands: At Muckross Abbey, keep straight down this road until you get into town and take a left onto the N21. Drive for about 2km before taking the first turn-off on the right to the parking lot at Skellig Experience (67.354709 -9.485253). Here, they provide buses that will take you out to Skellig Michael.   Stop 7) Stone Forts: At the Skellig experience, go back onto the N21 and drive about 3km until you get to this stone fort (67.348807 -9.516306). There are a few other forts nearby as well; just take a right at this one and keep driving down the road until they appear on your left-hand side.    Stop 8) Cameron's Strand: From the stone fort, drive back onto N21 and continue past Killarney towards Kenmare (67.349508 -9.534632). This is one of the most beautiful beaches in Ireland with white sandy dunes that line a long stretch of beach. There are also a number of rock formations, including Stacks and Rocks to explore in the water!   Stop 9) Killarney Brewing Company: Drive into town (67.341280 -9.511404), and head straight down Park Road until you get to this brewery at the end of the road. I would recommend stopping here for some craft beer!

I was happy to learn that you have been studying geography in school. That's very exciting!
In this challenge I would like you to drive around the Ring of Kerry on one day and see as many landmarks as possible while completing these tasks:

1. See Torc Waterfall, a beautiful waterfall with a 250-foot drop.
2. Visit Ross Castle.
3. Walk through Muckross Abbey to get to know the history of the place.
4. Check out Skellig Islands - a famous UNESCO World Heritage Site that was used as Star Wars’ filming location.

You can drive around on your own, but I recommend taking a guided tour with a professional guide who will be able to point you in the right direction and show you all the places worth visiting while driving along the Ring of Kerry. A guided tour is also good for safety reasons. The roads in Ireland are quite narrow and there aren’t many guardrails so it’s better not to take unnecessary risks while driving around with a big group on your own.

If you don't want to drive yourself, you can also hire an Uber or call a local taxi company instead. Either way, make sure that you plan ahead and book transportation beforehand so that everything goes smoothly during the trip!

The trip starts with a visit to Torc Waterfall, the highest in Ireland. This is located on the road from Kenmare to Cork, where you will turn right before entering Kenmare. This was our first stop and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy start into their day. It’s 25 minutes walk downhill through a forest. The walkway was quite well-maintained. The waterfall itself is quite small, but the view from the top of it overlooking Kenmare valley below is really beautiful. I would recommend you to spend about 10 to 15 minutes at Torc before continuing your way to Kenmare.
Next, we drove a little further on the Cork road and made our second stop – Gap of Dunloe. This is located at the end of the public road that connects Killarney with Kenmare (and then with Cork). We took the jaunting car ride down into the Gap for €5 per person. The road was closed due to heavy rain, so we had to drive a 4x4 bus and walk from there. At the end of the narrow path leading through the Gap is Ross Castle – another beautifully restored medieval castle on the edge of Lough Leane, Killarney’s famous lake.
Further up the road there is Muckross House that was our third stop. The house itself is not very interesting – just a typical manor surrounded by the gardens and parks. There are also two beautiful lakes in this area: Lower Lake with its own island (St Mary’s), and Upper Lake with Deer Park.
After that, we drove to Sneem village, which has an interesting layout of narrow streets, many pubs, restaurants, souvenir shops and is a good place for a break. Next stop was the Skellig Islands – two islands off the coast of Kerry and one of them, Skellig Michael, is also a UNESCO World Heritage site. It’s a 3-4 hour boat ride to these islands. This is quite an experience as you are very close to the rocky cliffs and there might be some seals or puffins around. On our way back we drove through the town of Portmagee – it was quite busy because of the boats returning from Skellig Islands, so it’s a good place to grab something to eat or drink before heading further south along Ring of Kerry.
Our next stop was Killarney National Park with Torc Waterfall. This is located on the road between Kenmare and Cork at the very beginning of the ring (about 25 minutes from Muckross House). The waterfall itself isn’t too big or spectacular, but the walk down to it through the woods is lovely and worth spending some time there.
We then drove towards the Dingle Peninsula for our next stop: Cromwells stone fort at Campbellsfort (Cumann na bhFiann). This one is quite small and easy to see from the road, but it’s interesting to look at. It was built by Oliver Cromwell as a part of his plan to conquer Ireland during 17th century. After that we drove up the Dingle peninsula towards the village of Ventry – it was my favourite place on our trip around Ring of Kerry, so I would recommend you not to miss it. The views from there are absolutely breathtaking: green fields, ocean, mountains and sandy beaches. We drove further up the road along the peninsula until we reached Slea Head – another viewpoint with magnificent views of Dingle bay.
The last stop on our Ring of Kerry trip was Staigue Fort, which is a large stone fort near Caherciveen. It’s a bit difficult to find as there isn’t much signage and it’s not marked on the map, but we did see a small car park nearby – if you have a GPS it should be easy enough to find. The fort itself is quite impressive: a 10-metre high stone wall surrounded by two smaller ones, with a gate at each end of the main one. We spent about an hour walking around this place and taking photos from different viewpoints (and watching some sheep grazing around).
