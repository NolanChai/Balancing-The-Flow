I love this book, it's so interesting. It is really good. I hope you can write more books like this one. Please write more soon, I will read it as soon as it comes out. You are my favorite author because of these stories! Thank you for writing such a good book.

Dear . . . .
You are a very special friend and I'm sure you can do this. First, read through what you have written so far. Read it aloud and listen to yourself. Now, go back over every part of your story that doesn't seem right or interesting. Change it until everything makes perfect sense. Your story is about a girl named Strombilia (Say . . . Stron-bull-ya) at the beach. She has her red shirt on and she is walking with her friend, Krispy (Kris-pie).
Strong bull-ya, very happy. Look, it is me and my best friend, krispy, we are having fun! It's a sunny day in the beach, I put some suntan lotion on my body because I don't want to get burned. We have gotten here at 7:05 AM; the time to arrive is at 8:32AM. At 9:30 we start our first wave. (We can see the water from where we are sitting). Krispy and me, we are looking for sharks, because we really want to swim with them.
It's my favorite thing in the world to swim with a shark. At 12:45PM, I decided that it was time to have lunch. I got some food from Krispy and I started eating it. Then all of a sudden I see something come out of the water. I looked at my friend, Krispy, but she couldn't tell me what it is because she didn't know either. So I kept staring at this thing and then it just swam away. At 3:24PM I started to feel kind of sick so I went back home.
Suddenly, as soon as we got into the car, Krispy fell asleep. We were going pretty fast but I had a hard time keeping up with her because she kept waking up and falling asleep again. We finally got home and put our stuff away for tomorrow then went to sleep. It was really fun today.
Love . . . . Stron-bull-ya, bye.

Hi, I am Strombilia. Today is my first day at the beach. I was excited to try out all of my new bathing suits! The first one that I tried on felt like a tent around me. It was a pink monster suit. Then I went into the ocean and it got really hot. I decided not to go into the water anymore because I started feeling sick from all the saltwater in my eyes and mouth. My third bathing suit felt great! It was green with some white spots on it, like a leopard print swimsuit. The spray of water splashed me on my head when I tried to go into deeper parts of the ocean. I liked how cooling and refreshing that was. As time passed, more people started coming to the beach as well, so there were not many places left where you could sit without getting poked by other swimmers’ legs or fins. That’s when I saw this group of teenagers who looked like they were having a lot of fun! They had bright colored bikinis that made me feel like an old lady. It was really hard not to be jealous at first but then I remembered how great my bathing suits felt on me today so I just went back home and sat there with my new friends, waiting for the next day when they might come back again!
