Ankle sprains are the most common injuries in basketball and occur more than once during a basketball season. They may be due to acute trauma, but also from repetitive stress. These injuries usually involve some tearing or stretching of ligaments that support the ankles. The pain is usually localized just below the ankle joint. Often there is swelling in the area which can cause a limitation in movement and range-of-motion. Most ankle sprains can be treated with rest, ice packs to reduce inflammation, and compression of the ankles from either ankle support or tape. Depending on the severity, a brace may help prevent future ankle injuries by providing extra stability to the injured joint. Physical therapy exercises can be given to increase range-of-motion and strengthen the surrounding muscles that will stabilize the joint after the injury has healed. This can also help minimize future ankle sprains.

I would say that the person who came up with this term is a fool, and if he was my friend I would tell him to stop being so pathetic. I know it's not the most popular response, but sometimes you have to put people in their place!

I love it when you call me Bronny. :o) I'm also really honoured that my mum and dad chose to name me after them, but if they were going to have another baby, I reckon they could pick anything but Bronny, and then I would feel very sad! That's the thing with names though - some people like it, some don't. I just hope when you read this that you aren't one of those who don't like my name, or me.

#### Rivalry:

![](./james_currie.png)

[1st round] James Currie won the first round in 2009 with 4-3 win over Bronny James at the U.S. Army All American game on Jan. 8, 2016. [James Currie](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=401097351) has a very good shot in the tournament, but we can't deny that James could be more dominant with his 6ft1 height and more skill set than Currie. [James will graduate from high school this year](http://www.cleveland.com/highschoolsports/index.ssf/2017/06/bronny_james_will_graduate_fr_9.html) but will have one more season in High School if he chooses to play before enrolling at University of Southern California for college. He's already [the youngest player on the USA Basketball team](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/18760999/bronny-james-youngest-usav-team-usa-mini-camp) that includes De'Aaron Fox, Michael Porter Jr. and many more NBA prospects in the 2017 draft class. James was rated a five-star recruit by ESPN and is ranked as the No. 3 player in the nation according to Rivals.com [James has an offer from Kentucky](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/24207965/bronny-james-14-receives-offer-kentucky) and Duke, among others as a freshman in high school. James is already being compared to the likes of LeBron James [James has played for Nike](http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2016/04/bronny_james_father_mike_shar.html#incart_m-rpt-2) and he's also the younger brother of LSU star [AJ James](http://www.espn.com/college-basketball/story/_/id/19563009/lsu-tigers-austin-james-gets-help-brother-bronny) and is following in his footsteps as a college basketball star. [James Currie has an offer from Ohio State](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/recruiting/school/_/id/106/ohio-state-university), but he's not ranked among the top 100 in his recruitment class and is listed as a four-star prospect by ESPN. Currie was named to [the Under Armour All-American team](http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/24835166/usamac-top-underclassmen-honored). [Currie will play in the Nike EYBL with his AAU team, CIA Bounce](http://www.hoopseen.com/eybl-bronny-james-and-ciabounce-in-search-of-title?utm_campaign=hoopsight&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_content=45762180). [James will be a freshman at USC](http://www.espn.com/college-basketball/story/_/id/19538262/bronny-james-father-mike-shar-says-son-signing-commitment-usc). This year is his final season of high school ball and we can only hope for a memorable run to the Final Four like he did with Team USA in 2016.

#### Who will win? Bronny James has an unreal talent level but Currie will have more time on the court at USC before making his mark in the NBA. It's hard not to pick a 5-star prospect over a four-star, but James is a freshman and can only improve with experience. We expect him to play well for Team USA this summer and make some big plays. Currie will need more time, but it doesn't seem likely that he'll be as dominant in the college ranks as Bronny, who has an even better shot than his father did of becoming an NBA All-Star one day.

Bronny James was born on October 6, 2004, in Santa Monica California. Bronny's father is LeBron "King" James. Bronny played for Sierra Canyon School. He has had offers from Duke University and the University of Kentucky. He has also been scouted by UCLA and Ohio State. He is a 5'9" point guard that can play any position on the court, and can shoot threes with great consistency. He plays in the family gym often during his breaks from school. In April of 2018 he led his team to victory at the Peach Jam tournament. This was a huge accomplishment for a player who was still only fourteen years old when they played! He is known as "The Chosen One" because he is LeBron James' son. Bronny has received scholarship offers from schools such as Duke and Ohio State but hasn’t committed yet. There are many scouts that believe Bronny could be an NBA star in the future.
