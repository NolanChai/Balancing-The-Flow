(She pulled out some sort of egg from her bell, and put it in her lap. She looked up at me with tears in her eyes.)

Alice: "Please...save my baby."

(My wings were beating so fast that I could feel the wind as I took the egg to a room next door. It was the same room where Alice gave birth to the baby. When I opened the door, there was nothing but an empty room.)

Safi'jiiva: "Where is it?!"

(I walked around and started to look for anything. But I came up empty handed. Then suddenly, the floor cracked a bit. There were cracks running all over the place, even on the walls! It was like they had been there before.)

Safe'jiiva: "It must be here somewhere."

(As I searched for that egg, I saw something in my periphrial vision.)

(It was Alice. She had a red glowing orb hovering over her head, and she was looking at me with a smile. Then the orb went into her belly button.)

Alice: "Hmmm....I've always wanted to keep it...but I guess that won't be possible."

(Her eyes opened wide as she looked up towards the ceiling. Then, they began to glow bright red. As if she had superpowers or something.)

Alice: "Now for a little payback." (she got up and walked towards me with her hands outstretched)

(My heart was beating so fast I thought it'd explode at any second, and my wings were flapping. I could feel the wind rushing past them.)

Safe'jiiva: "NO! Don't come near me!"

(She raised her hands even higher and then brought them down on me - but she just ran right through me!)

Safe'jiiva: (thinking) 'how is this possible?'

Alice: "Huh?! I can pass through things like this?" (she tapped my body as if to prove it.)

(The pain that was coming from Alice suddenly disappeared. She started laughing and running around the room, hitting herself on the walls with her hands.)

Safe'jiiva: "H-hey...why are you doing tha..?"

Alice: (hysterical) "I CAN PUNCH MYSELF! I CAN PASS THROUGH THINGS!" (she started to laugh even more as she hit herself on the walls.)

Safe'jiiva: (thinking) 'wow...this girl is insane.'

(She suddenly stopped laughing, and her eyes went back to normal. She got up off the floor and looked at me with a serious face.)

Alice: "Now....we shall see how powerful you really are." (she started running towards me)

Safe'jiiva: "I-it won't hurt if it doesn't touch me." (she ran at me as well)

(She rammed her head into my stomach, and she pushed off the ground. We were both in midair! Alice was laughing so hard that I could barely hear anything!)

Alice: "HAH! YOU CAN'T HURT ME!" (she kept running towards me)

(We were getting closer to the floor, and it felt like she'd land on me any second. I closed my eyes as if that would stop her from hitting me.)

Safe'jiiva: "Nngghh..."

Alice: "...?" (she opened her eyes) "Wait...are you dead?! HAHA!"

(I suddenly opened my eyes, and I saw that she was still in the air. She was flying back up to the ceiling.)

Safe'jiiva: "Why is this happening?" (I started running towards her again as well)

Alice: "I CAN FLY!!" (she kept laughing and flapped her arms)

(I got close, and I grabbed a handful of hair. But nothing happened - she was still in the air!)

Safe'jiiva: "Huh?" (I stopped and looked up at the ceiling)

Alice: "...?" (she came down to the ground and landed on all fours, shocked)

(I walked over to her, and I saw something strange.)

Safe'jiiva: "What is this?"

Alice: "Huh?!" (she looked at what was on the floor next to her) "This...is my egg..."

Safe'jiiva: "Your egg?! The one that you had before, when I saved it from your belly button."

Alice: (nodding) "Yeah. That's right. But...the strange thing is....it hatched." (she picked it up in her arms and looked at me with a smile.)

Safe'jiiva: "And that would be..." (I squinted my eyes, trying to get a better view of the egg)

Alice: "My daughter. She's perfect! Look!" (she put it under the light, and I could see what was inside of her.)

Safe'jiiva: "...wow..." (I looked at it in wonder for a bit more time)

Alice: "Her name is....Nyx." (she gave the egg to me as if it were something valuable. And I knew why she did that because...I felt something different when holding her.)

Safe'jiiva: "...thank you, Nyx..." (I smiled and looked back at Alice) "And you are?"

Alice: "I'm Alice, of course."

(She extended a hand to me, and I shook it. Then she sat on the floor and began eating her lunch.)

Safe'jiiva: "...hey! You're done with your food already?!" (I was still hungry)

Alice: "Yeah...I got so much of my energy back that I don't even know what to do with it." (she looked up at me for a second.)

Safe'jiiva: "...and why are you here?" (I sat down on the floor and put Nyx in my lap)

Alice: "Well...the doctor said that I had an extremely rare case of superpower-like abilities. And apparently, there were only two people who could help me deal with them." (she pointed at the teacher as if to prove it.)

Safe'jiiva: "So you're a superhero?!"

Alice: "Well...not yet. But I have all these powers that I can't control, so they made us come here."

(I looked over at Nyx in my lap, and she was staring back at me with the cutest look on her face.)

Safe'jiiva: "...she is very beautiful." (I leaned down towards Nyx) "Her name suits her...it means 'night.'" (Nyx's eyes were still closed as I spoke, but she started to open them now. I felt the warmth of her gaze on me.)

Alice: "...what was that?" (she looked at Nyx and then at me) "How did you know that?"

Safe'jiiva: "...I don't know...it just seemed right." (Nyx began to move around in my lap as I held her.)

Alice: "It really is a strange thing. My mom always thought Nyx had the ability to see things before they happened - but when she gave birth, it didn't happen at all! She was just born with eyes that look like mine." (she laughed) "I guess that means I'm the only one who can see what she sees."

Safe'jiiva: "...is that so?" (Nyx looked over to Alice as well, and smiled back.)

Alice: "Yeah. It just took a while for her to open them all up...but now they're wide-open!" (she put her hands on Nyx's head) "She'll grow into such a strong and powerful person."

Safe'jiiva: "...and you?" (Nyx closed her eyes as if she were going back to sleep. I noticed that there was something around her neck.)

Alice: "...I guess we're both pretty special here, huh?" (she touched the necklace around Nyx's neck) "She even has my blood in her veins - she's part Red Dragon."

Safe'jiiva: "...so you have a connection with dragons as well." (Nyx began to wiggle around on my lap, and I smiled at the cuteness.)

Alice: "I guess that makes me an even better person than she is!" (she giggled) "She's always been more powerful than me. It was pretty much just a matter of time before her powers showed up." (Nyx woke up and looked at the
