A good diet consists of eating whole foods with no additives. I encourage my students to eat a variety of fruit and vegetables, wholegrain products (such as brown rice and wholemeal bread) and lean meats (chicken). When cooking try and use herbs and spices in place of salt or sugar. Stick to two cups of alcohol per day for men and one cup per day for women. Avoid saturated fats, these can be found in fatty cuts of meat and dairy products such as butter and cheese.
