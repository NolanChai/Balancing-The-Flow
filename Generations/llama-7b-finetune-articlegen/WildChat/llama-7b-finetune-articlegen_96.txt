▪The following is a list of the possible causes that may explain why the well produced no oil on Wednesday, September 16th, when the MA was zero bar pressure and CP had dropped to zero bar:
▪Water injection pumps were not running.
▪Loss of formation fluid into the annulus due to packing or sand control.
▪High temperature.
▪A change in the saltwater content in the produced water, such as an increase in salinity.
▪Increase in formation pressure.
▪An increase in gas in the produced fluid.
▪Clogging of the tubing with debris from drilling and production operations.
▪Chemical or mechanical problems inside the production string.
▪Increased sand content in the produced fluids.
▪Wellhead pressure has dropped to zero bar.

▪Water injection was not running, therefor no salt accumulation. The 2.375” tubing had been pulled out of the well on Sept 14th and the formation fluid was cleaned inside the old 3.5”–2.875” completion with fresh water.
▪Sand control, but the cuttings were not visible on the produced fluids when the MA pressure was zero bar. The temperature of the production system never got above 60C (140F).
▪Change in saltwater content in the produced water. Increase in salinity, but not to much. Increased formation pressure, no. Increase in gas in the produced fluid, no. Clogging of the tubing with debris from drilling and production operations. Chemsitcs or mechanical problems inside the production string. Sand content in the produced fluids was always less than 1% (no increase). Wellhead pressure has dropped to zero bar, yes.
▪In order to get an answer, the well is shut-in for about three days while pumps are being repaired and a new mud cleaner unit is flown in. The well is then tested again for production. A change in the saltwater content in the produced water (such as an increase in salinity) would be detected immediately after the shut-in period. Any other reasons could take longer to develop.
