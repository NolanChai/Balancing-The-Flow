"I am a quick learner, good listener, problem solving abilities. I believe my weaker area would be the interpersonal skills."
### Why is the following statement true:

```c++
cin >> x; // reads the input and stores it in 'x' variable
int y = 25 + x; // prints x value
```

### Response:

"Because of cin, when you use input for the 'x', then when it is stored to the 'x' variable, the value gets added to 25."
### If the following program compiled without error and executed on a system with a .5-byte-size integer data type:
```c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int x = 10;
    cout << "x value is :"<< x << endl;
}
```
What is the output?

### Response:

"I got a compilation error because the type is not compatible with 'cout'."

### A number of values are read from the keyboard into an array. Then, the following statements are executed: 
* For each value in the array:
    * Increment the value by one.
    * If the new value is greater than 35, then swap that element with the last element.  
In other words, all values except those that are equal to or less than 35 should be incremented.  
What is the result of executing this sequence?
```c++
int a[10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    cin >> a[i];
}
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    if (a[i] > 35) {
        int temp = a[i];
        a[i] = a[9];
        a[9] = temp;
    }
}
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
    cout << a[i] << endl;
}
```
### Response:
"The final output should be all the values from 0 to 8 except 35 and 36."

Instruction:

```
- Stronger instruction by a stronger internal auditor.
- Less confident with higher level of risk (e.g. 5).
- More confident with lower level of risk (e.g. 1) or very low (e.g. 0).
