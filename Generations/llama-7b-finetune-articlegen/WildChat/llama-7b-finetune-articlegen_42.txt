### Action:
I am calling CCMS to find out how many students in the school district.

### Comments:
I will add a note regarding annual statement here. I need to check with Annual Statement

Hi Shane, 
thank you for the clarification!  
The statement on the state of production is still valid (but needs to be updated with the actual number of students) -- but that will happen after the summer.   
Regarding the statement on the annual report - I'm not sure if the average size of classes matters since this is a performance metric for the CCMS vendor -- not a benchmark of our own class sizes. The CDE only requires an aggregate figure across the entire system; and that is what we will calculate (if we are required to provide one).   
Thanks,  
Alejandro
