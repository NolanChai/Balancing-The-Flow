The popularity of Demon Slayer in Japan is such that there are multiple articles on various blogs/news websites (written in both Japanese & English) about its Hanagatami earrings, while for Golden Kamuy it doesnâ€™t seem to have been a major topic. It's likely because the latter series has more focus on other things.

* 2018 - The series is released on April 6 in Japan. Few days after its release, a petition was made by the Korean residents of Japan to ban the anime due to its glorification of Imperial Japan's occupation of Korea and the Japanese aggression during World War II, which received more than 10,000 signatures. This led NHK to remove the episode with this controversy from streaming service d Animate's website as well as an apology by producer Yusuke Igarashi for a comment he made regarding the "North Korean nuclear crisis" where he said that it will be good if North Korea is attacked, which led to him being removed from his position at NHK.
* 2018 - In September, another petition was created to ban the show due to its glorification of Imperial Japan's war crimes and crimes against humanity during World War II. This resulted in NHK cancelling a planned event in Tokyo due to safety concerns.

* 2019 - The series was released on Netflix in December of that year and has received an English dub by Crunchyroll in August 2019. It would be later removed from the streaming service due to licensing issues (similarly to how Netflix's previous partnership with Funimation came to a sudden end).
* 2019 - In January, a petition was made by fans to reinstate the episode with this controversy in Netflix. This resulted in NHK being called out for removing it and has also received backlash on Twitter. The series is released on Crunchyroll worldwide with an English dub, but the "controversial" episode is still omitted from the version distributed by Funimation Entertainment outside of Asia (the "controversial" episode was later added to Funimation's Blu-ray and DVD release of the first season).
* 2021 - In April, the series will be released on HBO Max in Latin America with an English dub. This resulted in the petitions being made by fans once again (similarly to how Netflix received backlash over this). A fan edit is later uploaded onto YouTube due to this episode still being omitted from Funimation's Blu-Ray and DVD release of the second season.
* 2021 - The series is released on HBO Max in Latin America with an English dub, but it was once again removed as well as its streaming service Crunchyroll, resulting in this controversial episode being omitted from Funimation's Blu-Ray and DVD release of the third season.
