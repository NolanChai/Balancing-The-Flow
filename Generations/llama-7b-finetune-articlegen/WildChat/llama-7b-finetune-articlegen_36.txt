(Mindy’s cries can be heard from afar. As Valefor gets closer, her wings begin to wobble slightly.)

Valefor: (approaches Mindy) “What on SpirA is going on here?! Why are you crying like that?”

Mindy: (sobbing) “I-I…I don’t know! I-It just hapenned so suddenly. One minute, I was flying around and enjoying the sights - next thing I knew, I crash-lande on this cliff.”

Valefor: “Uh…crash-landing?” (wobbles slightly more)

Mindy: “Yeaah! What’s wrong with you?!”

Valefor: “Nothing’s wong with me - just a little bit sicker than I thought.” (she begins to waek slowly, then falls over completely.)

(Ifrit and Bahaimut enter the cavern at this point.)
