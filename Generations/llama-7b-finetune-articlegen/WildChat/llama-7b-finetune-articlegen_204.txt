I love your story! It's beautifully written and it really makes me want to read more of it (which is something I don't often say). Your characters are really unique, quirky and funny and I feel as though you have created a very realistic world that the reader can relate to.
The only criticism I would give is that sometimes your story feels a little rushed and I think if you slowed it down, or made sure each scene was fully developed, then it will be even better. But apart from this one thing, well done! Your writing style is brilliant, as are your characters and the world they live in.
Thanks for reading my story. I'm glad you enjoyed it :)
