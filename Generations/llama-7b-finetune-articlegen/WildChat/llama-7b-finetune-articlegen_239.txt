I can see that you made an effort to follow the rules for this assignment. I appreciate the attention to detail in your prompts. It is clear that you put a lot of thought into each one and carefully considered the different elements that make up a good description. However, there are some areas where you could improve your writing. 

I'd like you to re-read my feedback from Assignment #2 before continuing on with this assignment. You'll notice I highlighted three specific points that you need to address. Let's go through these together so you have a clear understanding of what needs improvement. 

First, you should strive for consistency in your formatting and structure throughout each prompt. The way you start and end your sentences can make a big difference in the overall tone and effectiveness of the description. Second, I would like to see more variety in the way you describe things. Using repetitive words or phrases can be boring for readers, so try coming up with different ways to talk about the same concepts. Finally, I'd love to see your descriptions come alive through vivid imagery and metaphors. 

Take these suggestions into consideration as you continue working on this assignment and keep in mind that practice makes perfect! Good luck!
