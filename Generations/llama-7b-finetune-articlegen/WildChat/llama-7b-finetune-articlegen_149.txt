Ciptan (Cipt)

Bandaraya is planet Ciptâ€™s capital city in the star system of Teg, it is located in the center of planet, and surrounded by five other cities, which are located on equator. The surface of the planet is covered by white clouds that forms the atmosphere, but underneath them there are lakes and rivers with very clear water. The capital city has an artificial lake in its centre that connects to a river. There are many bridges over this river, as it flows around the city and through the outskirts of it. The buildings are made from white granite rocks, which were taken from nearby hills and mountains by giant machines. They have various heights and shapes but are all very neatly arranged along the streets of the city. Cipt is a planet with an atmosphere and mild temperature, so the citizens live in these skyscrapers buildings rather than underground ones like on Pandora from Avatar. The population density is quite high due to the small size of the planet, but there are wide green spaces for people to walk around or even have picnics. Due to the abundant water supply, Ciptans can grow different kinds of plants inside their houses and offices; some even have fish tanks at home so they can relax by watching them swimming around in peace! The buildings also have glass facades on every floor so that natural light penetrates deep into each room. This helps save electricity bills because artificial lights are not needed during the daytime when there is already plenty of sunlight outside anyway!
