(Outside…)

Saiko: “Whoa…I can’t believe I was out there on that pitch for 140 minutes! I am so tired…”

Sachiko: “I bet Saiko doesn’t want to hear any of my excuses about why we had such a long game tonight.” (shrug) “Anyway, I hope you weren’t too angry with me for taking off like that!”

Saiko: “Well…I guess not. But I don’t think it was very nice to leave your teammates stranded on the pitch all alone! And besides…you were playing so well after that injury.” (grin) “Maybe you should have stayed out there for just one more game, huh?”

Sachiko: (smile) “I can’t say that I wouldn’t like to. But if I had, we probably would have lost the match.”

Saiko: (sigh) “Yeah…I know. It was pretty silly of me not to think of it that way at the time…”

Sachiko: (nod) “That’s okay! You did what you thought was best for your team, and I can’t blame you for that.”

Saiko: “I know…” (shrug) “Well, anyway…it’s all over now. The final score is 3-1!”

Sachiko: (smile) “That’s awesome! It’s a shame we couldn’t win by more points.”

Saiko: “Yeah, I know…” (grin) “But don’t worry about that. Just enjoy the celebration after party with us tonight!”

Sachiko: (laugh) “I think I will!” (sigh) “Thanks for giving me some time off from all those hard kicks, Saiko.”

Saiko: “No problem! You’re a tough one to dodge…but it was fun trying anyways.” (smile) “See you later!”

Sachiko: “Bye-bye!”
