The red-orange color indicates the most used word in the post. The top right corner represents the number of comments on the post with a down arrow indicating a negative value for it, because less upvotes than expected and a higher comment count compared to what was expected. The second column is the average of all the votes for each word on the reddit post (0 if there were no votes), this number shows how much of an impact that word has in the overall rating of the post. So the lower the value, the less impact it will have on the final score of a post. The bottom left is the upvote rate or total amount of upvotes divided by the number of comments (negative if there are more downvotes than expected), and finally the green color represents how much better or worse this post was rated compared to what we expect, red means it's lower then expected while blue means it is higher then expected. So all in all the post had 75.3% of up votes which is a lot for Reddit but the total number of comments on the post are lower than expected and there were more downvotes too so in my opinion this post didn't do as well as you would have hoped (I think I can say that because it has more then 500 comments).
