Celestiine Week's accident caused damage to her spinal cord at the C3-4 level. As a result of this she lost all sensory feeling below T6 and has limited function in her upper extremities. Her condition is classified as incomplete tetraplegia. She received intensive rehabilitation after the injury, but still remains dependent on others for basic care activities. Celestiine's accident resulted in a cervical tracheostomy. In addition to this she also has a gastronomy tube and a nephrostomy tube for her kidneys. As she is now completely paralyzed, Celestiine's condition makes it impossible for her to perform any kind of work or study. She needs assistance with all activities of daily living as well as ongoing care at home by a nurse or family member.
