**Chapter 1. Smoke Automatic Fire Detectors**

Smoke automatic fire detector is a device which can detect smoke in a building and automatically activate an alarm, sounding a signal (either loud enough to be heard throughout the whole building or over some particular area) or alert people of danger through lights or voice message. The smoke detector will also switch off the main power source to any fire equipment such as sprinkler system if necessary. The most common types of smoke detection devices are : ionization and photoelectric detectors, each having advantages and disadvantages in certain conditions .

The ionization type smoke detector is more sensitive to flaming fires than photoelectric sensing device. They do not react as quickly as a photoelectric unit to smoldering combustion and they can be triggered by cooking fumes or dust, which is why they are not suitable for use in kitchens (though some modern units may incorporate a hush button to disable the alarm in this event).

Photoelectric smoke detector uses infrared light source(s) that projects a beam through the air into an adjacent chamber. In order to get the detector's attention, a small amount of dust or smoke would have to disrupt the light and trigger it. Since these types are not as sensitive to flaming fires, they do not respond quite so quickly to smoldering combustion but will react much faster than ionization units to smoking materials (though this type should not be used near an open flame).

The advantage of using the photoelectric smoke detectors is that it's less likely to sound a false alarm caused by cooking, dust or steam. On the other hand, the disadvantage of the photoelectric device is that they are more expensive than ionization devices and they have slower response time compared to an ionization type.

**Chapter 2. Heat Automatic Fire Detectors**

Heat detection method uses a thermal sensor (usually in combination with an infrared sensor) which is able to detect changes in heat patterns that occur before smoke or flame is detected by either smoke sensors or flame sensors.

Most modern heat-activated detectors use a non-contact infrared detector (NCI). NCI is a two-part device, where one part sends out pulses of infrared light and the other part measures the amount that returns. The difference in temperature between the two parts can be used to determine if something has changed in the room. This change could be caused by a person walking across the room or it could mean there's a fire. If there is an object blocking one of the sensors, it won't detect anything and will remain silent for some time until someone walks away from that area . 

A disadvantage in using heat detector as well as ionization smoke detector is false alarms caused by cooking or dust. A fire alarm system should have both types of sensors, but only one is needed in any given room to ensure maximum safety. 

**Chapter 3. Automatic Fire Detectors In Flames**

Automatic fire detection devices are used in conjunction with smoke detectors and heat detectors (in different areas). Automatic fire detector should not be used in place of either a smoke or heat detector as it has its own limitations when it comes to activating an alarm. 

An automatic flame detector is used primarily to detect flames but can also be used to detect high-temperature conditions that may indicate an imminent fire. This type of device consists of two parts: a light source and a detector (sometimes called "flame-sensing elements"). The light source emits ultraviolet radiation while the detector senses changes in infrared energy from heat waves given off by flames or hot gases . 

Another type of automatic fire detection device is called an "air sampling detector" which has a chamber that draws air into it. This air is then filtered and examined for trace amounts of combustible gas (usually carbon monoxide). If any gas is found in the sample, it triggers an alarm . 

One advantage to having this type of device is that it can be used even if there isn't a strong enough smell present to set off a smoke detector or heat sensor. 

**Chapter 4. Concusion**

Smoke and Heat detection systems are the most common types of fire detectors used in building. Both have their own advantages and disadvantages as well as false alarms that could happen from cooking or dust particles. When installing any type of automatic detector, you should consider what it is meant for: if a room needs smoke protection only then use a smoke-activated device; but if the building requires both heat and smoke detection then use an NCI (non-contact infrared detector) which uses pulsed light to detect changes in temperature.
