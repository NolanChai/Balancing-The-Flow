Eating healthy is one of the important things that we need in our lives, especially if we want to keep our bodies strong and fit. As more and more people are nowadays choosing a healthier diet and exercising regularly, this essay would discuss some reasons for this trend as well as possible ways to encourage them.
On the one hand, there are several factors that make people eat healthy food and exercise regularly. First of all, health problems are getting serious in many countries all over the world nowadays. More and more people suffer from diseases related to unhealthy diet and lack of exercises. According to the survey carried out in 2016 by the World Health Organization (WHO), there were 15 million people died due to eating unhealthily in that year only, which is almost half of total deaths in the world. It is alarming when we consider how serious diseases can affect our lives and make them shorter than normal lifespan. Furthermore, it costs a lot of money for treatments related to health problems caused by eating unhealthy foods and not exercising regularly enough. Therefore, people are choosing healthier options and doing more exercise in order to avoid such serious diseases as well as keep their bodies strong and fit.
On the other hand, many ways have been adopted by countries worldwide to encourage people to eat healthier and do regular exercise. First of all, governments can provide subsidies for products that are considered to be healthy such as vegetable and fruits which contain a lot of nutrients. They also can put tax on foods that are not recommended by experts such as soft drinks or sweets since they are unhealthy and even addictive. Secondly, more people can be encouraged to do regular exercises when governments make policies for building sports grounds and fitness centers in public areas free of charge so that it is easy for them to access to these facilities without any charges. Finally, media such as TV shows or newspaper articles should educate people about healthy diet and encourage them to do regular exercises at least 30 minutes a day by reporting stories related to diseases caused by unhealthy foods and lack of exercise regularly.
In conclusion, there are several reasons for increasing trend towards eating healthily and doing regular exercise such as health problems or high cost incurred from treatments for them as well as governments' efforts through subsidies on healthy products, imposing taxes on unhealthy foods, and providing sports grounds free of charge.

Eating healthily is no longer a fashion, but it has become a necessity these days. It has been seen that increasing number of people have taken up eating healthy foods and exercising regularly in order to lead an active life style and stay fit. Some of the major reasons behind this trend are discussed below:

Increasing awareness about health related problems among people has made them realize the need for eating healthy foods. They have also become more cautious about what they eat, thereby preferring to eat those food items that are rich in nutrition and contain lesser fat content. Eating such kind of food will help one keep away from lifestyle related ailments such as heart attacks, cancer etc.

Lifestyle changes have also contributed towards this trend. People today spend more time behind their desks than ever before. They have become lazy and do not indulge in physical activities which were considered normal few decades back. Thus, they are gradually becoming prone to diseases caused by obesity such as diabetes etc.

Increasing awareness about the benefits of exercise among people has also contributed towards this trend. People have become conscious about the health hazards caused by lack of physical activities in their daily life and hence are motivated to lead a healthy lifestyle. Also, they now realize that if they do not workout regularly, then it might get difficult for them to perform well at their jobs or studies.

The government has also taken initiatives towards the same by increasing the budget for public awareness campaigns and encouraging people through incentives such as tax deductions on food items rich in nutrients and lesser fat content etc.

In short, this trend is largely due to an increased awareness among people about health related issues along with lifestyle changes that have occurred over the past few decades. The government also needs to take steps towards encouraging more and more people towards leading a healthier life style by making them aware of benefits associated with eating healthy foods and exercising regularly, which in turn would help reduce cases of obesity related diseases such as diabetes etc., thereby improving the overall standard of living in our country.

I agree with your argument that awareness has a positive effect on the trend of healthy eating and regular exercise. However I would argue that another important reason behind the increase in popularity for these lifestyles is due to the advent of social media such as Instagram, TikTok etc. and the fact that they have been able to create new celebrities that promote healthy living and fitness. For instance, many athletes on Instagram have started influencing their followers by posting pictures of their daily workout schedules and recipes for nutritious meals which is encouraging them to exercise regularly or eat well.

Moreover, I agree with your suggestion that more public health campaigns should be run as they could be beneficial in raising awareness about the importance of having a balanced diet along with regular workout sessions so people will start adopting these lifestyles at an earlier stage.

I've seen a lot of things in my life. Some of them were beautiful, some of them were ugly. I have also seen many different people and I can tell you one thing about them - they all love their children more than anything else. When your child is sick or hurt, nothing matters to you anymore. It's like there isn’t even a word for pain in your vocabulary. You would do anything to help him/her. If it was possible, I would even change places with my son so that he could be free of cancer and I - his father - could have this disease instead of him.
I will never forget when the doctor told me that my boy is sick. It’s not a big surprise though because my wife's family has a long history of cancer in both men and women, but at least it was not me or one of my relatives. When they gave us the news about my child, I did everything to save him. We had all possible medical tests done by doctors of different specialities from around the world. There were two possibilities - either his body would fight against cancer or he will die soon.
The whole story is a tragedy in itself. When you have your first child, you don't even think about deaths and diseases because everything looks so perfect. It was only three years ago that we started to see the world in a new way when my son was diagnosed with cancer and started his treatment. Everything was great until this moment and now - there are just dark days ahead of us. I'm not saying anything against my wife, but she is a strong woman who can handle everything on her own and she has been doing that since the very beginning.
It’s hard to say how much time we have left together with our son. We hope for miracles all the time so that one day he could be completely healthy again, but it seems like this isn't going to happen anytime soon because his cancer is still incurable and there are no real treatments which can help him fight against it without causing too many side effects (and I mean severe ones).
