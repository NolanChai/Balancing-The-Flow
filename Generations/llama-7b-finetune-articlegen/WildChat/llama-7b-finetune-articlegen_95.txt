> In Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), how does Hyperglycemia affect the levels of Sodium and Potassium?

Hyperglycemia causes a decrease in tubuloglomerular feedback, resulting in an increase in glomerular filtration rate. Glucose reabsorption decreases during chronic hyperglycemia. The result is higher levels of urine sodium (due to glucosuria) and potassium (due to the osmotic load).

Potassium levels will decrease because H+ ions from the hydrogen ion concentration will enter cell, in order to neutralise the negative charge of the hydrogen ion. As more positive charges are lost into the cell membrane, then more potassium must leave in order to maintain equilibrium (i.e. prevent cell becoming too negative).

The patient has a diagnosis of Pneumonia. She has a productive cough and complains about cheat pain with inspirations and fever. Her signs are consistent with consolidation in her left lower lobe. Treatment will include antibiotics, analgesic medicines to reduce the fever and coughs and chest physiotherapy (coughing).

* The most pertinent information in this scenario is that the patient was found to have an enlarged prostate and elevated PSA (prostate specific antigen) level. He had undergone a biopsy which showed benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
* This means that his prostate gland has become very large and is causing problems such as difficulty urinating. The benign nature of the condition means that it will not progress to cancer, however the treatment for BHP would be similar. He was prescribed Alpha Blockers which are a group of drugs that act by relaxing smooth muscle in the prostate and bladder neck, thereby reducing pressure in the urethra and improving urinary function.

The significance of the findings can be seen from this case. In this case, the patient was suffering from pain in her left upper back radiating to the right shoulder and arm area. The symptoms were quite persistent in nature. The most important thing about these findings is that there may be some nerve compression or inflammation of muscle tissue that are causing these issues. The patient could be suffering from any number of things which can cause these type of problems. She also stated that the pain gets worse with certain activities and lessens in others, which means that she could have been suffering from a disease called fibromyalgia where there is widespread pain throughout the body. It is important to know what causes this type of pain so that it can be properly treated by medical professionals.

The most likely diagnoses are
- Diverticulitis/Diverticular disease, if the abnormality on USG and CT scan is a diverticula. The patient will require antibiotics to treat any bacterial infection of the abscess. The diverticulosis may be managed with lifestyle modification.
- Appendicitis, which must be ruled out. The abdominal pain is highly suggestive and the appendix should be explored during operation (Appendectomy)

The 2 main reasons that this person would have difficulty urinating is because he has a prostate tumor and also he had surgery.  The patient was diagnosed with prostatic hyperplasia (benign prostatic hypertrophy) on August of 1980, according to the medical records from Mayo Clinic. He had surgery for bladder outlet obstruction on September 24, 1980 and it was followed by a urethral dilatation, which is a procedure used to widen the urethra (a tube that carries urine from your body) in men. The patient's medical history shows that he had 3 bladder outlet obstruction surgeries and multiple catheterizations for incontinence and bladder dysfunction, as well as a prostatectomy on July 12, 2012 with an extended stay of 5 days at the hospital. This information can be found on page 269 in the "Laboratory and other clinical findings" section. The patient is also taking hydrochlorothiazide which may cause bladder dysfunction, according to this article: <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/372466>.
### Assessment:
Because the patient had 5 surgeries and several hospital stays for his prostate cancer and bladder dysfunction, he may be very depressed. The symptoms of a depression are increased sleeping time, decreased energy levels, feelings of sadness, or feeling guilty or worthless. <https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007>. There are also many different types of depressions and they can be categorized by their severity, the length that they last for, or if it is related to a certain cause. The patient may have an adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood because he went through so much during these surgeries and his symptoms are still affecting him in 2014. <https://www.psychiatryadvisor.com/anxiety-and-depression/adjustment-disorders/> . Also, the patient may be suffering from a depression disorder due to the loss of urinary control which he is experiencing, because it could have affected his confidence and ability to go out in public or do activities that require him to use the bathroom. <https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007>.

* The abgs were normal.
* The pulse oximeter had a 70% reading.

Expected - Acute Gastroenteritis, but may be due to pancreatitis or cholecystitis. Need to confirm with the following investigations:
- Blood Culture for bacteria and fungi culture (if patient has fever)
- Stool examination to rule out ova and parasites
- Lipase, Amylase, Glucose, Protein, Bilirubin and Creatinine levels 
- Ultrasound of abdomen
- Blood test for Hepatitis B, C, HIV

There are several reasons why someone may experience abdominal pain. The most common symptoms associated with abdominal pain are nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea, gas and cramping. Other possible symptoms include abdominal bloating, weight loss and fatigue (MedicineNet). Abdominal pain can be caused by many factors such as food intolerances or sensitivities; however there is no single cause for this type of pain that every patient experiences because each person has a unique reaction to specific triggers.

It was a man with an iron bar. The defendant did not see him with his own eyes, but saw him through another person who was hit by the attacker. Then he saw it again on TV. He knew that he had to be involved and testified to it.

no, because he has H. pylori gastritis which is a cause of peptic ulcer and also we do not need to check for peptic ulcer if the patient is having H. pylori positive, as they will automatically be diagnosed with that.

A75 year old male with chronic diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia who presents to the ED with a new-onset substernal chest pain. Patient has been found to have a high troponin level of 0.94 ng/L. There is no history of myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease. Other risk factors for acute MI include tobacco use, diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Atherosclerosis can lead to plaque formation which may become unstable causing a rupture of the fibrous cap over the plaque leading to thrombus formation, myocardial infarction, or sudden cardiac death (SCD). These events are thought to be associated with the release of inflammatory mediators and procoagulants. 

### Question:
What would you do in this patient?
