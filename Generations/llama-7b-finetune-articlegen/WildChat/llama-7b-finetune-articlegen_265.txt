summarise this: I conclude by noting that a name based on Hermanuvis is attested once outside Egypt in an inscription from Dion in Macedonia dated to the imperial period (22). The form of the name there is Ἑρμανοῦβις, which is not known from Egypt. The name is probably to be related to the cult of Hermanuvis attested by a third-century dedication in Thessaloniki, which was set up by a cultic association of Hermanuvis on behalf of certain individuals (see LIMC no. 15). This document and the personal name, along with a statue of the god from the Sarapeum of Carthage, suggest that the cult of Hermanuvis enjoyed some popularity outside its original home in the Roman period.[23]
