[player]: (after walking around for 20 minutes and finding nothing) "Awww, come on! Where can this village be?" (suddenly, they hear a groan from underneath them)"Oh...good grief. What in the..."
(They look down and see that their foot is now stuck in what appears to be a giant snowball.)

[player]: "Uh...hello? Is there anyone here?" (after a long silence) "Okay, maybe I'm not supposed to be here yet." (they get out their phone and dial the number of a certain red-haired man...)

"Hello? Mr. Sparrow...it's me..."
"[player]?! Where are you?! And what did you do to my snowballs?"
(after explaining where he is, what happened to his snowballs and the story about how they got stuck in a snowball...)
Mr. Sparrow: "Well, I'm not going to be able to help you get out of there anytime soon...I'll just have to come down there myself."
"Okay...thanks." (the player hangs up and continues walking around the village...)
