Write a Day 2 script for Aranea.

(Character: Aranea The Spider Queen, [Player], [the Spiders])

(Aranea has been through a single pregnancy - and her pregnant sister Mindy just passed away the previous day)

(Suddenly, Aranea feels the urge to have another baby. And so she does.)

(The Spiders all look at [Player] in disgust as they all realize that [Player] has come into their den unannounced and possibly wanting to kill them)

She is going to die soon. I am not sure how to handle it, but the best way I can think of would be to pretend to have a conversation with her for as long as possible, then when you leave, make sure she understands that you will be back in just a few minutes and don't worry because you are coming back. You have to wait until she dies so you don't get kicked off the bus for trying to steal another person's seat.

In order to help Vanessa get better we need to try to find the cause of this depression. To do this I will ask her a series of questions that will hopefully lead me in the right direction.
