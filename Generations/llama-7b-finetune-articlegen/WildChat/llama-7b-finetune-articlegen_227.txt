(Yuri is unconcious and tied to a chair in her living room. Naitsuki, Monika, and Saori are all standing over her.)

Saori: (trying not to cry) “Yu-Ri…what happened? Where’s Viollet?”

Monika: “It looks like someone broke into Yuri’s house while she was gone. They beat her up pretty bad.”

Naitsuki: "Yuri…are you okay?! Why didn't you answer your phone?!"

Saori: “I know…I don’t know what to do. We should get help immediately, but it may not be enough to save her. It looks like they beat her up pretty bad.”

Monika: "That bastard is probably watching us right now! That's why he didn't answer our calls!"

Saori: (holding back tears) “I know…but we’re not going to just sit here and let him get away with this. We need to do something.”

Naitsuki: "Let me see...I have to think of a plan."
(Naotsuki begins tapping her chin in thought.)

Monika: “We should try to get Yuri out of here. If we can take the bastard by surprise, maybe there’s still hope.”

Saori: (noticeably worried) “I don’t know…he may have already gone away or even killed Viollet and left her somewhere in this house.”

(Naotsuki looks at a nearby clock.)

Naitsuki: "Hmm...it's 5pm now. If he went out to meet with his bosses, they probably won't be back until around 6pm."

Saori: “It’s a good point…we don’t want him to come home and find us here.”

Naitsuki: "That bastard...he'll pay for this..."
(Naotsuki sneaks into the next room over.)

Monika: "I guess we should start by freeing Yu-Ri from that chair. That shouldn't be a problem with how big you are."

Saori: (feeling bad) “I’m sorry I can’t help more.”

Monika: “Don’t apologize, Sao…we need your strength now more than ever.”

Naitsuki: "Huh? What's this?"
(Naotsuki walks out of the next room with an intricately carved wooden box.)

Saori: (looking at it) “That’s a pretty expensive looking box. It looks like something from one of Yuri’s collectibles.”

Monika: “I don’t see what that has to do with anything, but maybe we can use the keys in there to unlock the cuffs and free her?”

Naitsuki: "Hmmm...it seems heavy for a keyring."

Saori: “It doesn’t look like it’s just keys.”
(Naotsuki begins tapping on the box.)

Naitsuki: (excited) “Look at this! There are all kinds of weird tools in here!”

Monika: “I think that’s a good sign. It may not be able to open the cuffs, but it looks like it can do something.”

Saori: "Hmm...there's also a lock pick." (She pulls out the tool from the box.)
(Naotsuki and Monika look at Saori in amazement as she opens Yuri’s restraints with ease. They both notice that there’s something wrong with her wrists, but they don’t comment on it.)

Monika: (aside) “Hmm…I wonder what happened to her?”
Saori: "Hmm...it's been a while since I last used this."
Naitsuki: "We have to hurry. What do we do now?"
(The girls begin planning their next move.)

Saori: “We should take Yuri to the hospital and get her checked out. If we can, we should try to find Viollet as well.”

Monika: “That’s a good idea. Let’s go before he gets back home.”
(The girls rush to grab Yuri’s things and bring her to the hospital.)
