We can replace the whole freezer if not more than $300 or we will repair it by our in-house technician for no additional cost. We do have a lot of old freezers so there is always a chance that you will receive one of those. In addition, all new freezers purchased from us are fully covered with a warranty and a replacement guarantee!

### Feedback:
That's fine! Thank you very much for your reply.  We would love to have the warranty on the old fridge as well as a replacement.  The fridge is not currently working so we can come in tomorrow afternoon or the next morning when it cools down again and exchange it for another freezer if you are ready.
