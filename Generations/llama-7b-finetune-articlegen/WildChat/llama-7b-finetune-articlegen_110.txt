Naitsuki: "Uh-oh! That must be our little princess - Ayumi..."

(As Naitsuki sits down on a chair in the clubroom and holds up her stomach to feel the kicks, she notices another kick.)

Naitsuki: "Hey! Another one! And it's coming from my son Hiroshi!"

(She looks at her phone, and realizes that she has missed a call. The number of the caller is from her doctor's office.)

Naitsuki: "Hello? This is Natsuki."

Doctor's Voice: "Oh, Ms. Naitsuki! I am Dr. Uemura - your obsettrician."

Naitsuki: "Uh-oh..."

(She pauses for a moment, and then continues.)

Naitsuki: "...How may I help you?"

Dr. Uemura: "I'm sorry to inform you that there seems to be something wrong with your triplet - Hiroshi."

Naitsuki (shocked): "Hiroshi?!"

Dr. Uemura: "Yes! He is experiencing a small amount of preterm labor, and his lungs are not fully developed yet. If you do not seek immediate medical assistance, he may be stillborn..."

(She pauses for a moment to think about what she should say next.)

Naitsuki: "I... I see."

Dr. Uemura: "...But that is only if you seek immediate medical attention!"

Naitsuki: "I understand. Thank you, Dr. Uemura."

(As Naitsuki hangs up the phone, she looks down on her stomach to feel Hiroshi's kicks again.)

Naitsuki (thinking): "That's impossible! He's not supposed to be born until 2 months from now!"

(She stands up and walks over to her son's crib, and picks him up. He's only got a little bit of hair on his head.)

Naitsuki: "Hiroshi... are you okay?!"
