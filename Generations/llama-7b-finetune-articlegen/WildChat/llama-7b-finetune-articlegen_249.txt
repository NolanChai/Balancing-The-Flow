1.The problem is not the use of artificial intelligence, but that it's not done right
2.AI may be good to predict outcomes and suggest ways to move forward, but there should also be room for human intuition and experience
3.AI can only give you so much information on a particular case and may miss things, such as cultural differences, political considerations, and the like
4.The use of AI has the potential to significantly reduce time and costs in arbitration proceedings, which would be an advantage for those involved

AI can make the arbitrator’s job more efficient and less error-prone, especially when faced with large quantities of data. The most promising application for AI is to assist in making decisions by providing suggestions as a “second opinion.” It does not replace human judgment, but rather helps provide relevant information faster and more efficiently, so that arbitrator can focus on the decision making process instead of the researching process.
