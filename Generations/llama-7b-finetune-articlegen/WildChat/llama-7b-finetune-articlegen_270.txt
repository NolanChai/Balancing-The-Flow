Dynamite is made of nitroglycerine and nitrocellulose. The first step in making the explosive is mixing these two chemicals together, which requires caution as they can explode or burn when mixed together.
The next step is to shape the dynamite into sticks. This involves cutting it into pieces that are approximately 1 meter long and 20 centimeters wide, then compressing them into sticks by hand. Finally, the sticks are dried for several days before being ready for use.

> Hi, my name is Dana and I am going to teach you how to make dynamite. It was invented by Alfred Nobel. He wanted a way to explode rocks quickly and easily with out the use of gunpowder and other materials that were dangerous at the time. He took nitroglycerin which is very volatile (meaning it will explode if exposed to air or water), sodium chloride, charcoal, and diatomaceous earth(a kind of clay that makes a stable absorbent for liquid). He mixed them in an iron flask and then put the mixture into an iron cylinder with a safety fuse. Then he put this cylinder into a wooden casing filled with sawdust. Finally, he poured water into the bottom of the wooden case to stop any explosion from happening due to fire or heat. When it was finished, he tested it by using a dynamite stick. He lit one end and let off the other which created an explosive force about 20 times that of TNT!

### Reflection:

> I learned a lot while making this project but some things were hard to figure out like how much water to put in it, or what the chemicals would make when you mixed them together. Also, one thing that is important for kids to know before doing this experiment is to always wear gloves and eye protection!
