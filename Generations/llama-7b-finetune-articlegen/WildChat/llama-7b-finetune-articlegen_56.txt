###### I am aware that the information may not be exact. For example, it is possible that the number of people in prison could increase or decrease in any given year. However, if this happens by a very small amount (e.g. 1-3%) then I do not expect to see much difference in the percentage of men compared with women in prison. Similarly, there is always an error margin when comparing two populations of different sizes and I will accept your answer even if it is within this margin

Yes, it is common. It's not as popular among people who are older than 50 years old or have white skin, but still a lot of people use it. The color you pick depends on the person and there are a lot of colors to choose from. Most men prefer brown or black hair (the most used colors in Brazil). There is also another type of dye that makes your hair really bright which some like (especially women) but not all like it. It's kinda like a highlighting for the hair, you don't see a big difference if you're not looking at the person from too close, but people who use this are sure to point out when someone has that hair dye done! I personally have never used one of these two types before, I always use brown and black color.
I hope this helped!
