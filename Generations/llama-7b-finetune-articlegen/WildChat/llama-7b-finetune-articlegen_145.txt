Dear John, this is a very interesting question that can lead to many different directions. I decided to start by analyzing Hitler’s leadership style and the way he treated his followers, especially during WWII. After doing some research about his life before and after WWII ended, I came up with three main points: 1-Hitler was very charismatic leader who managed to gain a lot of people's trust in him and his ideologies; 2-he treated his followers like family members/friends; 3-Hitler believed that he was the rightful leader, even if it meant killing millions. As you can see, I didn't choose any specific characters from WWII because they were all part of one big group who followed Hitler blindly and did whatever he told them to do (including killing Jews). If there had been an election among these people after his death in 1945, no matter what party won or how many votes each candidate received - it would still be a dictatorship since the winner wouldn't have any opposition against him. However, if someone wanted to make a movie about Hitler's civil war from October 1963 after he died in 1962 (which was the year when I finished writing my script), I would suggest using different characters from WWII who didn't follow him blindly - but instead they had their own agendas and wanted power over Germany/Europe. In addition, if someone wanted to write a movie about Hitler’s civil war after his death in 1945 (which was when I finished writing my script), it would be much easier since there were many different political parties fighting for control over Germany - which means that anyone could win an election!
