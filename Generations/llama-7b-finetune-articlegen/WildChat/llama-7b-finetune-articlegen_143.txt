The first chapter is a very good introduction to the book "Psychological Decision Making" by Eldar Shafir and Gerd Gigerenzer. The authors attempt in this chapter to provide an overview of the various decision making processes that individuals, as well as groups engage in when faced with uncertainty. The authors have divided this chapter into three major parts, namely rational decision making models, intuition and emotions as decision-making techniques and group decision making.

The first section entitled "Rational Decision Making Models" deals with the various steps involved in decision making processes. In brief it can be stated that any kind of decision making process is a four step procedure whereby we start by identifying a problem, followed by generating alternative solutions and evaluating these alternatives before taking a decision or action. The authors also discuss other aspects such as post decision reflection and learning from the same.

The second section "Intuition and Emotions as Decision Making Techniques" deals with the various ways in which our emotions can influence our decisions and how we can use intuition to make better decisions. The authors also discuss the role of emotionally intelligent individuals when it comes to decision making processes.

The third section "Group Decision Making" focuses on the factors that are relevant for effective group decision making and ways in which groups can work together effectively for making their decision. 

In short this is a very good introduction to the rest of the book by Eldar Shafir and Gerd Gigerenzer where they try to make the reader understand the psychological aspects of decision-making processes that we follow as individuals or in groups.
