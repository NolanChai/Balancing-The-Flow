I believe that Christian will be the one who gets boxing as his stricking style since he is a fire fighter and needs to train in physical strength so that would fit his occupation. I also chose taekwon do as his grappling style because he has good upper body strength and would probably go for breaking something if it's something in between him and the person he is fighting.

Tommy will be a kick boxer for his stricking style since he works out regularly at the gym, but I chose wrestling as his grappling style because of all the grapping that happens when you work out. Billy will probably get karate because he's always been doing it ever since he was little and it has stuck with him through high school to college. I chose jiu-jitsu for his grappling style because he is gay, and its more of a defensive way than an offensive way so that would be best for him.

Selina will probably get boxing as her stricking style since she's a cheerleader so she needs to keep herself in shape and it also makes sense for her occupation too. Her grappling style will probably be mixed martial arts since she does pole dancing and it is very good for your balance so I think that would be best for her, especially when fighting with someone on top of you.

Valentina has the most experience in all these sports and I think that she'd probably get boxing as her stricking style since she's a gymnast and she needs to have strength in order to compete in many of the events in gymnastic so it would make sense for her. As far as grappling goes, I think taekwon do might be best for her because that is a very well known martial art with a lot of rules so I think that would work out well for her and also help with any moves she learns from boxing.
