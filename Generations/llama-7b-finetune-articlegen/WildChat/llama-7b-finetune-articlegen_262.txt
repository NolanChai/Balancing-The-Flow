(Sayori: "What do you mean 'You are a ghost?'")

Monika: "I am a ghost! I died! But I was resurrected as a ghost because of how much you loved me!"

Sayori: "Wait, what? You...died?"

Monika: "Yes. But, before that, I asked for a favor from the goddess of death - to be reborn into this world after my life is over, so that we could spend eternity together! And she granted me that wish!"
