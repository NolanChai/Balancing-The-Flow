No, because you've increased exposure by +2 EV (stop down one stop), there is still a 50% chance that it will be over exposed to pure white or under exposed to pure black. What happens here is that your light meter measures the scene as grey, but if you increase the exposure compensation by 1 stop then all areas which are lighter than average will get more light and darker areas less (so this is a form of exposure bracketing). So in this case your scene is 50% likely to be overexposed or under exposed.
