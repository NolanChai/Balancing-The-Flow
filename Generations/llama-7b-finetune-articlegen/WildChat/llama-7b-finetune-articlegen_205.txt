The core is the center and most important part of the earth, it is hardened and very hot. The inner core is the hottest place on Earth at approximately 5000 degrees celcius. The outer core is hotter than the surface of the Sun at over 4000 degrees celcius. The inner core is solid but the outer core is liquid, although it's not quite as simple as that. Both parts have a large amount of molten iron and nickel, with some trace metals thrown into the mix. The outer core is also separated from the rest by an iron-nickle barrier which stops things flowing in or out, this also prevents them mixing together. The Earth's core is one of the main reasons that our planet has such a large magnetic field, the magnetism comes from electric currents inside the liquid metal in the outer part of the core. This current was caused by the Earth's original rotation. Another interesting fact about the Earth's core is that it produces Earthquakes. There are two types of earthquake, tectonic and volcanic but they both have similarities as well as differences.
