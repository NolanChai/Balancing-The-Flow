Scene #1 - [Luffy is in a cave]
Lucy: You are standing in an open cave with a giant staircase leading upward into darkness above and three exits on either side of the room. To your northwest, you see a dark crack that looks to be the entrance to a secret passageway. There appears to be a hidden trapdoor underneath one of the chairs in front of the fireplace. The east exit is guarded by an ogres head and torso. It has a mouth full of sharp teeth and horns growing from its head. A few feet behind it, you see what looks like two dead soldiers with spears lying on their sides on top of a table. To your northeast, you see what appears to be another set of secret passageways leading into the darkness. The west exit is guarded by a troll, which stands between two large trees. It's holding a shield in one hand and an axe in the other, both dripping with blood. There are also some rotting bodies lying around near it.

Lucy: You can go north to the hidden passageway, east to the ogres head, northeast to the secret tunnels, or west to the troll. The secret tunnel has a small chest with some gold coins and a dagger in it. The hidden entrance has nothing in it.

Lucy: [Give your first command]
