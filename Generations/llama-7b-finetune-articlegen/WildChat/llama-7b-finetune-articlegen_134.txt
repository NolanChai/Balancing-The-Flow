### Discussion

The superheating is used to remove the compressor surge when the suction temperature of the compressor reaches the critical temperature, and it reduces the compression work by 0.2%. In practice, the superheated degree is usually 15â„ƒ. The higher the superheat degree, the less the refrigerant load on the compressor, so that a large number of heat pumps with low compressors can be used in winter, and the system can operate stably even at high outdoor temperatures. In contrast, if there is no superheating, when the ambient temperature is higher than the critical temperature, the compressor will surge frequently and affects the stability of operation.

Increasing boost is good for high-power (>100 kW) engines only. If you need more power in a small displacement engine, then adding exhaust gas recirculation and leaning the mixture will give more bang for your buck than trying to increase boost.

1. For the same turbine speed, the power increases when the temperature of the compressor increases and the pressure ratio decreases. This is because that at higher temperatures and pressures, the working fluid has a greater ability to do work, so that the efficiency will increase; on the contrary, when the temperature of the compressor increases, its operating speed decreases and the flow rate decreases accordingly. At this time, since the power output does not change, the efficiency drops.
2. As shown in Figure 2-6, a turbocharger is an axially asymmetric impeller with an axis of symmetry along the shaft axis. The radial force generated by the pressure difference between the center and outer sides of the blades changes as the blade angle increases. The blade angle has no effect on the axial force. The directional force will also change as the blades rotate, so that the impeller will always maintain a certain degree of axial thrust regardless of its speed. 3. The turbine inlet temperature is too high.
4. If the temperature rise of the engine and the exhaust gas is too large, it may damage the components or burn the turbocharger. Forced cooling by adding water can be used to solve this problem. At present, water injection coolers are usually installed on the turbocharger. In addition, some advanced models adopt a variable speed oil cooler to adjust according to temperature.
5. The blade angle of the impeller increases with increasing pressure ratio and decreases with increasing shaft speed (Figure 2-6). Therefore, at high speeds and high pressures, the impeller needs to be designed with large angles to ensure that the efficiency does not decrease sharply due to flow separation. On the contrary, in a low-speed, low-pressure environment, small blade angles are used so as to reduce axial thrust and improve the stability of the impeller.
6. The turbine inlet temperature is too high. When the turbocharger is designed with a higher speed and pressure ratio, the power required by the engine increases accordingly. Therefore, if the fuel supply cannot meet this power demand, it will increase the exhaust gas temperature, which may cause damage to the turbine blades of the turbocharger or burn the entire turbocharger.
7. Forced cooling of the engine and exhaust pipe is generally adopted for forced cooling. Water injection coolers are usually installed on the turbocharger to ensure that it can continue to work in a wide range of working conditions. In addition, some advanced models adopt variable speed oil coolers to adjust according to temperature changes.
