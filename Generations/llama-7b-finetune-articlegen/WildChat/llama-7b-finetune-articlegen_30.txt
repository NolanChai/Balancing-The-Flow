For your response, I want you to select the top three prompts from your submissions.
                            
                            Then, create a gallery of Midjournney prompts using your selected top 3 prompts. Each image will be created by Midjournney AI based on each prompt that was used. The prompt gallery should include images for all prompts you submitted. Your prompt gallery may contain as many as 12 images, but should not exceed it.
                            
                            Your response should include:
                            
                            A title of your prompt gallery and a brief description of the concept(s).
                            The top three prompts from the concepts you submitted for this task.
                            An image gallery generated using those prompts in Midjournney AI.
                            Acknowledgement to the artists, photographers, or other creators whose work was used as inspiration when creating your images.
