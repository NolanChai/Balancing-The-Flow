                    /imaingne prompt: a beautiful young woman in a fluffy red dress with a silver necklace. She is wearing red high-heeled shoes and smiling at the camera with her eyes closed, like she is daydreaming about something sweet. Her hair looks soft and curly, and there are shiny strands of hair that have fallen in front of her face. In the background you can see a white wall decorated with flowers and plants, making it look very cozy. The camera is focusing on the woman's right arm which holds one hand in the air as if she is about to give someone something or hold them tightly. You can also see that her fingernails are painted bright red, matching her dress and shoes perfectly! --ar 1:1 --v 5.2
