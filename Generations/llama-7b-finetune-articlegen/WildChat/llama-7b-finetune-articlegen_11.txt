### Notes/Requirements:
                           1. Your images must be JPGs, with less than 20mb per image.
                            2. For example, the prompt "/imaigine prompt: cute dog" should have two outputs, one for the dog's face and another for its body.  The same applies to any other prompt in your work.
                           3. Do not provide an output of the first concept [1], as it will be used as a starting point for the next prompt [2].
                            4. As described above, you can use any image for your prompts. However, you are required to provide a reference image (i.e., the original concept) in addition to your prompt outputs.
                            5. Use "Dog" instead of "Canis Lupus Familiaris", as this is Midjournney's AI's preferred name for that animal.
                           6. You can add an additional output if you wish, but it will not be graded.
                            7. Please provide a brief description for your prompt outputs and reference images in the README file as well.
