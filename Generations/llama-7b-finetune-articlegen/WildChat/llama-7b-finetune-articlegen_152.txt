This is fine. We will have a little more work to do now that it has been pointed out to us. If we are going to make use of the storyline, then let's try to incorporate something we might not normally have included into this series. Let me see what I can find regarding a little girl in Japan who is being pursued by her birth family for reasons unknown and why she does not want them to know where she lives. There are probably quite a few people in the world who would love to help out a poor kid, but if she had been adopted by someone like Karen Xu's parents then they would have had no intention of turning her away from anything.
I think it is fine for Rose to be adopted by Joseph, since he is not married and does not seem like the kind of person who would do something terrible to someone else (unless you want him too). This would mean that Rose would live with both her adoptive parents, which could cause some tension between them if one or both of them are not nice people. However, maybe they wouldn't be so bad because it seems like Joseph and Karen have a good relationship? That way there can still be conflict over where Rose lives but without any actual fighting going on in front of her face (since she would probably go somewhere else if things got too heated).
I think we should make sure to include some kind of reason why William was being mean to Rose, so that it doesn't seem like his character is just there for the sake of having him around. He could have been a student who was trying to get into her pants but got turned down or something similar. Just as long as we don't make him seem like a total jerk.
I also think Karen Xu should be more involved with Rose in general, because she is going to become an important character later on so we need to establish some sort of connection between them beforehand. If she doesn't have any interaction with anyone else then there won't be anything interesting about her when she meets up with Rose again!
