A warm golden hue radiates from this sleek and powerful machine, its metallic sheen reflecting light in a way that seems to capture the very essence of sunlight itself. The rich color of this animal-car is like a lion's fur bathed in sunshine - both fierce and regal, with an air of power and strength unlike any other vehicle on the road today. It truly does feel as though one could rule from atop such a car!

"The color of this animal car is a warm, honey-hued gold that looks like the fur of a lion in the sun. The shade is radiant and majestic, with a sense of royalty and power that makes the car feel like a throne on wheels. The finish is almost regal, sparkling with tiny flecks of metallic light that add to the car's sense of grandeur."

1. My first thought was to take the words out of order so that they became: 'The car has a black and white stripe exterior.' So I decided to do this and I am glad that I did as it would not have made sense otherwise!
2. The first thing that came to my mind when I read the phrase 'black and white stripe exterior' was 'zebra' so I thought about writing a status message that linked back to an image of a zebra I had previously posted on Facebook. It is quite obvious that the car I have chosen has been painted in black and white.
3. I have always liked animals, especially the colourful ones which is why I chose to write about them in this case! The only thing that came to mind when reading the phrase 'black and white stripe exterior' was a zebra but because I like cars I thought it would be nice to combine those two things.
4. The first thing that came to my mind was zebras, but as there is already an image of a zebra in one of my posts on Facebook, I decided not to use this and went with the idea of painting something black and white because you can't make it out what colour it is!
5. The only thing that came to mind when reading this was zebras as they have black and white stripes all over their bodies, so I thought about writing a post saying that this car must be painted like one of these animals or even linking back to the picture of one in my gallery!

The picture is of a Mercedes-Benz G500 SUV with a tan body, an orange paint job on the bumper and hood, and chrome details all over (especially around the door handles). It looks like a G-Wagen in general, but this one has been customized.
