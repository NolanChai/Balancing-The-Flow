Depends on your goal. If you are trying to grow muscle tissue by training hard at the gym and eating well, it might take longer to notice any changes due to the 1-month breaks (and you'll need to increase your volume of exercise). If you want a "glow" or the feeling that your body is stronger, then taking the injections with a lower dose will be enough.
