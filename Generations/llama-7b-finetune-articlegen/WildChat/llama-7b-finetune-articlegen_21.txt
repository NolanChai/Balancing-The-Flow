A man, who looks exactly like a woman, is forced into becoming a femboy (man-like woman). The rival of this femboy forces the man into a relationship where he has no control over his body and mind; this storyline will give the reader a feeling that the writer does not know how to create a good plot. The first thing I would change in this prompt is that the female coworker should not be in the picture, because the competition between women could actually make sense with the plot of the story. When you say "Her rival has a plan" what is the plan exactly? You do not give any details to the reader on how this rival did this. It would help the reader to understand what happened if there was more information given. The reader needs to know that this woman has been enchant by some kind of magic. I think it is important to be detailed in your storytelling because you want to engage the reader. By not giving enough details, you are taking away the readers' ability to fully understand what they are reading. You will also loose the reader when they feel like there isnâ€™t a plan. The storyline should start out with how the woman finds out that she is a femboy and then continue on from their. It is important to remember that the reader does not need to know everything about the character, but you must give them enough information for them to understand what is happening in the plot. By making the rival take control of the man's life, it will make the story more interesting for the reader if the rival is a woman who has hated this person for years and wants revenge on her. It makes sense that the rival would be someone that you have known for many years because this person knows what is going to hurt you in your life or career the most. The rival being another female will also create suspense, which is good in a story because it gives the reader an idea of what they will learn next in the plot. It makes the reader more interested in reading if there is conflict and mystery throughout the storyline. If you want to make your writing engaging for the readers, then you need to be specific and give them information that is important to know about the character. The rival's motives should be clear to the reader so they can understand why she wants revenge on this person who has hurt her in some way over the years. This story would be more interesting if it showed what the relationship was like between these two women before he became a femboy and how their relationship changed after his transformation because of enchantment from a rival coworker, not just describing it as "He is now the stay at home femboy husband of his rival". The readers can get this information from other parts of your writing prompt instead. It would be best to put these details in other sentences so that when they read through all of them, they do not have any questions about what is happening or why it is happening because there will be no confusion for them anymore if you gave more specific information than just saying "He now lives with his rival" without telling the reader how he got there. By using details and specific information in your storytelling, then readers will feel like they know everything that needs to happen next when reading through each sentence so they can continue on throughout this fictional world created by yourself as an author of this writing prompt.
