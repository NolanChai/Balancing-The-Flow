- How music is created today is very different from how it was produced before the digital era. The most notable difference is that nowadays artists are able to produce and promote a large number of tracks relatively easily with modern technology. Some songs can be recorded, mixed, mastered, promoted and published in just hours or days. This process was much more difficult to perform with analog equipment such as vinyl records and tapes. 
- Artists also rely less on record labels now than they used to which allows them the freedom to create music without having their projects signed to a label beforehand. They can also directly work with their fans online by using social media, email listings or digital platforms like Bandcamp where fans will purchase tracks outright and pay a flat rate for each song rather than getting royalties based on streams.
- Streaming has caused some artists to lose money because there are fewer people paying for music instead of relying on ads and social media promotion to generate revenue. However, this trend may soon change with the launch of subscription services such as Spotify Premium which offer higher payouts than ad-based streaming sites do. 
- In recent years royalties have grown significantly due largely in part because more people are using online platforms like Spotify and Apple Music for their music listening needs instead of going out to stores or downloading files from peer networks. This increase is partially offset by the fact that artists may receive lower payouts on each track than they used to which makes it difficult for them to make money if they do not have a lot of followers or fans who will pay for their music directly rather than relying on streams alone as a source of income.
- All these changes combined mean that nowadays there are many different ways in which an artist can create, release and promote music but it is becoming increasingly difficult to make money from doing so without having either large audiences or access to paid subscriberships such as Spotify Premium or Apple Music's "Family" plan which offer higher payouts than ad-based streaming sites do.
