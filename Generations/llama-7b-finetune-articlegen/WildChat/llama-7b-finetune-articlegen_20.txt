Without any other word, Mishaali aimed her right hook at Karen’s face, the Kolkata woman managing to block her Hyderabadi rival’s right hook with her ottee arm and grabbing into her deltoid, Karen forces herself back against the floor and executed a monkey flip.

Karen attempted to land an uppercut on Mishaali’s jaw but was blocked by Mishaali’s left arm. The Kolkata woman then tried with a right hook, but Karen blocked it with her right elbow. Karen tried to get in close and land some punches before Mishaali could hit her with another powerful kick.

Misahali quickly reacted and tried to block the blows from coming on top of her face but was caught by a knee that landed in her chest, followed by an elbow shot that came down on Misaha’s jaw. Karen attempted a second uppercut, which also hit Mishaali square in the face.

Misahali tried to duck under one of Karen’s blows but was unsuccessful and took another blow from her rival as she landed an elbow to her face. Misaha then tried a right hook that ended with a low kick, which left Mishaali lying on the mat.

Karen grabbed onto Misaha’s hair and began pulling it upward, but the Hyderabad woman quickly reacted and managed to break free before she could be subjected to another head-butt.

Misahali then landed a right hook that sent Karen back against the mat, followed by several more blows from Misaha’s fists. 

The Kolkata native was finally able to regain her composure and began striking back at Mishaali with powerful shots of her own. As soon as Karen saw an opening, she tried to hit a left hook that connected, followed by another right hook on the chin before landing an uppercut which sent Misaha’s head flying into the mat. 

Misahali was quickly up on her feet and began attacking again with a flurry of punches while Karen attempted to land some of her own but fell victim to another powerful knee, followed by more elbows from Misaha. As Misaha continued to land blows, Karen’s strength began to fade and she soon found herself lying on the mat as Misahali continued to land punches to her face.

As the fight neared its end, both fighters were visibly exhausted but still determined to finish it off with one final shot. But before either woman could take their last blow, the referee intervened and called a halt to the match after ruling Misaha as the winner by way of TKO.

* The fight begins as Mishaali starts off with a punch at Kareen's stomach, knocking her down back first on the floor. She propels herself up using the momentum from the previous attack and tries to kick her rival in the face while she is still lying on the ground. Karen gets up after taking the kick to the face and rushes Misahali. They exchange blows with their fists, knee, elbows, and kicks. Kareen keeps getting a little more aggressive and frustrated with each of her attacks. She takes advantage of the opening and propels herself off the ground at Mishaali to slam her down onto the mat. Mishaali quickly gets back up by using the momentum from her head slamming into the mat and she grabs Kareen's leg. They struggle on the mat, trying to throw each other around for a submission hold or pinfall. Karen seems to be getting tired as she begins to lose her grip on Mishaali who then uses that opportunity to gain the upper hand with a quick head-scissors and tries to pin Kareen's shoulders down to the mat. She continues applying pressure but can not keep it locked in because Kareen is trying too hard, allowing her to slip out. Karen begins to get frustrated and yells as she struggles back up. Misahali sees this and decides to grab Kareen's leg again, this time throwing a quick heel-hook to the outside of her leg which causes Kareen to scream in pain. Kareen kicks with all her might to get free of the hold but to no avail as Mishaali gets it locked in even tighter and Kareen is forced to tap out. The match ends and both women walk off the mat, wiping their sweaty faces. Karen seems disappointed and upset as she walks away while Misahaali walks up to her and congratulates her on a good fight and talks about the next time they get to fight each other again.

Mishaali retaliaites with a series of swift, boned-shattering strike, targeting Kareen’s vulnerable ribs. The room reverberates with the symphony of grunts, cries and the clash of Mishaali's fists hitting Karene's body.

The two are tied up in a fierce battle as they continue to trade punches, the sound of bones hitting each other echoing through the air. Mishaali is determined not to give Kareen a chance to get her balance and recover as she continues to strike out at her opponent with hard-hitting blows. Kareen, meanwhile, tries to fight back but it’s obvious that she has been beaten down by Mishaalis onslaught of attacks.

Mishaalis body begins to shake from the adrenaline and exertion as she continues her assault on Karene. The room is filled with a mixture of the two fighters grunts, screams, and even some laughter as Mishaali starts to gain an upper hand in this fight.
