I really like your idea and it is a good example of how to do this challenge with some room for creativity but also very structured. I am glad you chose a topic that was easy to describe so that we could all visualize what was going on. You did a great job and I can't wait to see what you come up with next!

TeLL Me more about Naomi's appearance, how was it established, what is it now? Describe this in detail and coherenct with the predicaement itself. Tell me more about her concentration. Tell me more about Kimberly waiving her hand in front of her nose. Tell me more about the two women's banter over the pungent smell in the air. Tell me more about Kimberly holding her nose. Tell me more about Naomi becoming free of her awkward stance and heading to the bathroom.

She's very funny! She was a great friend to have. I would tell her what was going on in my life, and she would always laugh. We talked about everything from school, to boys, to family.

She was the perfect person to talk to. I remember one time, we were talking about some guy that had asked me out before and how embarrassed I felt afterwards, and she started laughing so hard that tears were running down her face. I never really understood why it made me laugh too at first because it wasn't like that funny to me, but when I thought more about it later I realized how silly we both had been!
