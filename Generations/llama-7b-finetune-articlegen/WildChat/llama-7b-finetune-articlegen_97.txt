Andrea: You’re not supposed to be here!
Jane: What? Why? Is something wrong?
Andrea: Mom and dad are in a meeting. They won’t let me in!
Jane: Okay… (pause) I think you’d better go, Andrea.
Andrea: Jane, please help me! Don’t make this about you and your stupid boyfriend again. 
(She breaks down in tears.)
Jane: Come on. Let's talk it over with mom and dad when they get home.
Andrea: I can't wait that long, Jane. (pause) Please help me!
Jane: Andrea… (pause) look what you’ve done.
(She starts to cry.)
Jane: I know it was a mistake, but still… 
Andrea: Jane! Help me! This is all your fault.
Jane: Look, Andrea, there has to be some way out of this.
Andrea: You don't understand. (pause) It was my fault too. Mom and dad will kill us if they find out.
Jane: No one’s going to kill you.
(A long pause.)
Andrea: I need you, Jane.
Jane: What are you talking about?
Andrea: Help me… just help me! 
Jane: Okay, but not with this, okay? (pause) You can do better. Don’t let them get away with this. 
(Puts Andrea in her bedroom closet.)
Andrea: Jane, please don't leave me like this.
(Jane shuts the door and leaves.)
