I am a professional engineer that has done work with quantum computing. 

Quantum computers can solve problems that regular computers cannot, such as factoring very large numbers and solving systems of linear equations. A quantum computer uses quantum physics instead of classical (Boolean) logic to solve these complex mathematical problems. Quantum physics is the study of particles at a level smaller than atoms. These particles obey rules based on probability and can be in multiple states simultaneously (superposition). Because of this, information can be stored much more compactly with less energy when compared with regular bits, which are either 0 or 1. Theoretically, quantum computers will be able to run a thousand times faster than a classical computer as they use fewer components and less energy.

There are many ways to build a quantum computer, but all of them involve using superconducting electrical currents to manipulate the qubits (the smallest unit of information in a quantum computer). The qubit must remain cold (-273 degrees celsius), so most quantum computers will use liquid helium as a coolant.
