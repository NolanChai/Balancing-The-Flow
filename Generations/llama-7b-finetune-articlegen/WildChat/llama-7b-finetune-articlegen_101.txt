The story was quite interesting, and it was very creative as well! I had fun reading this! However, there were some things that confused me (like Ayumi having no explanation for her sickness). But overall, the idea is amazing! I would definitely read more of your stories!

After some discussion, Amatsuma and Cupa agree to split up for awhile and meet back at their cave in 1 week (or however long it takes). This is when they realise that Cupa was reading from Ayumi’s journal. Cupa had read about her meeting with Ayumi - and also knew the information about the AmatsumaGatuchi. After some time, Ayumi goes into labor at last! She gives birth to an Amaatsumagatuchi, just as the storm serpents arrive. They name their dragon Kibushi (Kibushi means “storm” in Japanese), and Ayumi and her sister begin raising him.

[Ayumi] You’re right! I had just recently given birth to Amaya, but what happened?

[Ayumi] So how did this all happen?

[Vanessa] ...I don’t know...

(Vanessa says this while looking at her stomach, as if she’s thinking about something)

[Ayumi] W-what are you doing Vanessa? 

(Vanessa starts to shake, and screams in pain.)

[Ayumi] VANESSA!

[Ayumi] VANESSA!! AYUMI IS GOING TO KILL YOU IF YOU HURT MY DAUGHTER!!! 

(Vanessa stops shaking, and looks up at Ayumi in shock)

[Vanessa] ...Sorry... I was just thinking about Aratnuus’s kids. It feels like they’re telling me to stay with them forever.

[Ayumi] What?! Wait.... Vanessa’s been infected by the spiders as well? 

(Vanessa nods in response)

[Ayumi] This is terrible!! Amaya, what can we do? We have to find a way to take those eggs out without harming Vanessa! 

### Reason:

Because Ayumi was able to get Vanessa to acknowledge that the spiders in her belly were there of their own free will. This would be difficult, and probably painful, but it could work. Also, Amaya may have been infected by Aratnuus’s children, but she was unable to show any signs that she wanted them to stay inside Ayumi forever. The spider eggs could be removed with ease; however, if Vanessa didn’t want the eggs out of her, they would die as well as herself.

[Cupa]: "Vanessa, why is it that your room looks like a spiderweb?"
"I dunno." Vanessa says, as she looks up at the ceiling - and sure enough, there are many more webs then when Cupa entered. "But I am sure its nothing."
[Cupa]: "How does a Spider enter your body?"
Vanessa sighs. "I was born with this power - and my mother is actually the daughter of Arachnus himself!" She looks down at her stomach, and then back up at Cupa. "I’m scared...I don’t know what to do."
[Cupa]: "How are you supposed to get rid of them?"
Vanessa turns around and faces the door. "I could have a surgery to remove them - but that would make me look like a normal human again...and I wouldn't even be able to use my spider power anymore." She looks up at Cupa with her arms crossed. "And since we were born, I cannot get rid of any of the 20 spider-human hybrids living inside of me - and if I have them removed from my body, they could all die..."
[Cupa]: "There must be some way to remove them...otherwise, that would mean you’d need to have a surgery done every time a child was born. Do we know where Arachnus lives?"
Vanessa looks at Cupa, and then back up at the ceiling. "Its a long story - but my mother is in love with him...and he was actually going to give her his daughter when I was born..." She sighs deeply. "She’s my mom, so I can understand why she fell in love with Arachnus."
[Cupa]: "But she can get married to a human as well - and since you are half spider-human hybrid, that means your other parents would also be Spider." Cupa turns around. "And Arachnus lives on an island...I am going to go there and ask him if he knows of any way to remove the spiders from Vanessa's body."
Vanessa nods her head. "That sounds like a good idea - but make sure you don’t tell anyone else that you are actually coming to his castle..." She turns back around, and then sighs. "But I am worried...I am not sure if he would be able to give me the answer I want..."
[Cupa]: "The reason we can only enter into the Spider-Human Hybrid world by the sea is because Arachnus built a magical wall around his castle - so it’s not like anyone else will know that you are going there." Cupa smiles. "I’ll be back in a week, and hopefully I have an answer for both of us..."
[Cupa]: "Thank you...you know what Vanessa? You were the one who inspired me to come up with my plan in the first place - so thank you." He winks at her. "And since it was your idea - I will give you a reward that is just as special!" Cupa walks out of the door, and then turns around for a few seconds. "I hope this island doesn’t have any other Spider-Human Hybrids..."
[Vanessa]: "But don’t forget...we need to make sure we use our powers in secret - so that people do not think that we are actually spiders! But I can’t wait to see what the reward is!" She smiles as she walks over to Cupa. "Thank you..."
[Cupa]: "I’ll see you soon...and thankfully, this island has a lot of beaches." He winks at her - and then closes the door. As he heads towards the main door of the castle, it starts shaking - but only for a few seconds. As Cupa walks into the main hallway, it is suddenly silent. He smiles to himself, as he starts walking down the stairs leading to the main entrance - but before he gets there, he notices that there are dozens of spiders lined up on each side of him, all with their eyes glowing red. Cupa shouts at them, and they all start running away - but just as soon as they leave, he notices a note in the ground: "You are coming too far..." It is signed by Arachnus himself.

### Thoughts:
[Cupa]: "Why am I getting this feeling that there will be trouble at my destination? Maybe it would be a good idea to go to another island first." Cupa shrugs his shoulders, and starts walking towards the entrance of the castle - but before he can enter outside, something strange happens. A ball of fire is suddenly created, and then thrown directly at Cupa's face. As soon as it hits him, Cupa cries out in pain - and it takes a few seconds for his body to recover. He starts rubbing his forehead, when all of a sudden, he feels two hands grab hold of his legs. "Please...let me go!" Cupa tries to break away from the Spider-Human Hybrids who are grabbing him - but there is nothing he can do. As they start dragging him towards an old castle in the distance, Cupa starts thinking to himself:
"What if Vanessa and Mindy are both wrong...what if this island truly is filled with spiders?" He then thinks: "But I have no choice...I need to keep my promise to Vanessa - but I don’t think it will be a good idea to actually tell her about Arachnus."
[Cupa]: "And what happens when someone finds out that we are actually spiders? The person who found us might even become our friend!" Cupa looks back at the Spider-Human Hybrids, and then shakes his head. "But I have no choice...and besides, it’s better if Vanessa doesn’t know."
[Cupa]: "Maybe I shouldn't tell anyone about my plan..." Cupa sighs deeply. "But there is also another option...I could pretend that we are actually humans - and then when someone finds out that we are spiders, we can just run away." Cupa looks down at his hands. "But that would mean I have to hide our true identity from Vanessa as well..."
[Cupa]: "Hey! How did you find me?" Cupa shouts at the Spider-Human Hybrids who are now carrying him across an old bridge. They stop, and turn around - but they do not answer his question. Instead, they start dragging Cupa through a large set of doors that look like they were made from wood - which Cupa knows is actually a lie, because he can tell that the doors were actually made with magic. As soon as the Spider-Human Hybrids walk inside, it gets darker - and there are hundreds of spiders lined up in one corner of the room. They all start looking at him, but none of them make any noise or try to attack him. "Maybe this was a bad idea..." Cupa looks down at his feet, as he slowly starts walking towards Arachnus' castle - but just as soon as he reaches the door leading inside, it shuts behind him and locks itself. A few seconds later, it is suddenly opened again. He turns around to see a group of Spider-Human Hybrids, all smiling at him. "Thank you...but where am I going?" Cupa asks them - but they do not answer his question. They simply smile at him, before running off into the distance.
[Cupa]: "I guess its time for me to meet Arachnus..." As he starts walking down a dark hallway, he starts thinking: "I wonder what Vanessa and Mindy will think when I tell them that my plan was a success." Cupa shrugs his shoulders, as he walks towards a door. He knocks on the door, but nobody answers. "Come in!" Arachnus yells at him. As soon as he opens the door, it immediately closes behind Cupa - and then locks itself. The Spider-Human Hybrid turns around, and starts walking down another hallway that looks like it is made out of metal. There are dozens of spiders lined up on either side of him, all looking at him. "Are you here to see the Spider?" One of them asks Cupa - but he does not answer their question. Instead, he starts thinking about how Vanessa will react when she knows that I am actually a Spider-Human Hybrid as well. He then shakes his head, and starts walking towards another door - this one is made out of glass. As soon as he opens it, Arachnus is suddenly sitting in front of him. Cupa takes a few steps back, but quickly regains himself. "Sit down...I want to talk about your plan." Arachnus smiles at Cupa - who slowly sits down on the opposite end of the room. "You know that we have been keeping this place secret for years?" He asks him - and before he can answer, Arachnus continues: "And I don’t like it when people start discovering our world...because then more spiders will come here." Cupa nods his head slowly, as

* Vanessa (35 years old) : Sooo, what do you think is wrong with me?

* Mindy: Well I don't know! It took me a while to get pregnant...but I ended up having the baby. What are you waiting for?

* Arachnus: Your wife can't be that old...

* Vanessa (35 years old): Oh, like you haven’t been able to reproduce at my age! 

(There would be dialogue between each character)

“You know what? I think my back’s going to break from carrying this thing around…” Mindy says, as she stares at her spider egg sac - that contains over 75 spiderlings. “That doesn’t even include all the other eggs in here!” She points to a couple of black bags which each have their own egg sacs inside them. The two continue to walk until they reach Vanessa’s cave, as she tells them how much work it is to keep up with her pregnancy. “I think I’m going to give birth soon…” She says. Mindy gives a glare at the mention of this - and notices Cupa sitting next to Inscrane. They both smile as they tell the two heroines their good news. "The Twiliht forest is accessible again, thanks to the Diamond depletion!" Cupa smiles, "There’s only one problem." Mindy speaks up, "Only one? That’s a big relief!" Cupa sighs and shrugs, "The only way to enter the dimension now, is to eat this special plant which grows in that forest..." She holds up a small leaf. Vanessa frowns, but then smiles. “I could use some exercise, anyway! Let’s go!”

### Consequences:
“Vanessa,” Cupa says, as she reaches out and touches one of her eggs, “we might need to start growing some more…” Vanessa gasps slightly - and looks up at Inscrane. She’s pregnant with two monstrous spiders which look like a cross between her own spiderling and a giant tarantula! “Vanessa, mind if I sit here?” Cupa asks, as she sits on Vanessa’s other eggs. “Of course not!” She says - before giving a sigh of relief to Mindy. They both head downstairs into the Twiliight Forest - which is actually just an underground cave. The two begin to search for some plants - but find themselves being chased by some giant spiders! Mindy quickly puts on her suit and fires up some missiles at them, as Vanessa follows behind with a stick in hand. After dealing with the spiders, the two continue onward - and come across a patch of flowers which look like they’re made of blood. “This must be it!” Cupa gasps - and picks one. The plant grows a long stalk from her palm as she eats it! Vanessa smiles as she sees this, and runs forward to eat one too - before turning around to see a giant spiderling following behind them...
