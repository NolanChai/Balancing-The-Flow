1) The return of Hookocho has been a great episode it was very enjoyable. 2) This is very good idea for an episode. I really like this because dexter and Dexter's lab are both my favorite cartoon show.

I've done the job and now I am not ready to return home with a bag full of bounty, but instead I want to visit a very special place. The name is not important because it is my favorite place in all the world and no one will be able to pry me away from it. My task for you Hookocho is to take your time and make sure that when you get there, you have everything ready. That way I can just come visit whenever I want and enjoy my favorite spot.

Hookocho was one of the main villains in Jeepers Creepers 2. He is an evil wizard who wanted to create an army of creatures like him to take over the world. However, he was unable to do so due to lack of knowledge about spells or magical abilities. He also had a weakness: if someone else casts magic on him first then his own spell will fail!

No because she is a good person and does not want to ruin lives and I would say that you could try and see if someone knows her. If they know her then ask them if she likes kids. They will most likely tell you that she does like children, but also add on that they do not think she would try to kidnap a child, or even hurt anyone for that matter. But I can't guarantee this because as I said before, everyone has different opinions on the topic so just remember: Don't ask too many questions and if you want an answer, then be ready to hear it, no matter how you may feel about it.

Hookocho: You'll never get away with this! 

Dexter & DeeDee: 
(While they are running away) Why do we always have to be chasing bad guys? 

Dexter: (Both of them stopped) Stop running around the city and I will stop chasing you. 

DeeDee: It's not my fault, it was Hookocho that made me run away! 

Hookocho: (To himself) If we don't get out of here they will find us! 

Dexter: I guess this is the end for us. 

Dee Dee: But, why can't we go home? 

(Hookocho walks away and the police arrive.)

There's one line that we could get into the audio for this one, it's just a bit too difficult to actually get into the video for technical reasons. There is an alternative version with all the voices and music intact over at our subreddit, feel free to check that out! The full dialog can be found here: https://www.reddit.com/r/steamhounds/comments/68s15u/episode_59_script_readthrough/

P.S: You might want to go through the whole series again and try to find what could be a better time for that episode! :D

"In an effort to create a peaceful place for creatures to live, Koosland has created a unique race of 'Peepers'. Peepers are small green creatures that have 3 eyes and they only exist in the minds of humans."

> This is the original name for the character, I think I found this name in some other games but now that I think about it, there could be a game where a girl wearing glasses is named Hookocho. So I don't know if they have different meanings. But there might not be any relation at all, it's just the names I saw on the internet which seems to match my character's name in this game.

1. A. The major roles are : Hastings, Baines, Mr. Giles, Miss Havisham, Estella, Pip, Mrs. Joe Gargery, Drummle. 2. The minor roles are : Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, Compeyson, Wemmick, Jaggers, Orlick and Pumblechook. 

### Reflection:
I think in this episode, the writer used a lot of characters to make it more interesting and make the story be more complete. I hope that I can use more characters in my future essays.
