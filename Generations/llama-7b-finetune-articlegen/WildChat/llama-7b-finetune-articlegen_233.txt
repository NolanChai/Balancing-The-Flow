Ayumi, Cupa, Vanessa, Andr, and Blazettespoke with each other before they spoke with Amautsama. They talked about how their world had been destroyed by Xyzas, and that Ayumi seemed to know something about what happened to them when she was sick - she said she had a feeling of knowing what Xyzas were, but could not understand why. She also asked for more information on the disease, but Cupa said she didnâ€™t remember anything about it anymore. They talked about how they wanted to help her because she had saved all their lives in one way or another and was very important to them as a friend before finally deciding that they would not tell Amautsama everything just yet. The girls asked for him to be more gentle with Ayumi than he usually is when dealing with monsters, and they agreed to stay here at the caves while looking out for any trouble or danger that might come their way in the future so long as Ayumi is well taken care of during this process..
