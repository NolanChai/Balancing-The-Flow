Comment: Is your API key enabled for trading?

Comment: I think so , I don't know how to check that :( . I created a new account and I added the same api keys but getting same response :(

Answer: You can find out if you have access to trade here. https://www.mexc.com/account/profile

If there is a 'TRADE' button on your profile page, it means you do have trading permission for that API key.
