This is an engaging scene from the movie I am writing: **"The Glamorous Life Of A Recovering Ballerina"**

Heather Schmidt has always been a very energetic person. She was the most active child in school and excelled in every sport she played with. When she was 14 years old, her parents enrolled her to the dance academy to start ballet classes because they wanted their daughter to be an elegant lady, who would have everything figured out about life and never get tired of it. She started dancing at 15 and got accepted into the ballet school as well. At 16 she was already dancing in small parts of the big ballets: "Coppelia" and "Giselle". Heather was talented, hard-working and had an amazing physique. She never got sick and her parents always supported her because they thought she would soon become a prima ballerina.

I will provide a detailed medical report for you with the information of Susan's history of illnesses. I have attached the medical reports regarding the patients. Please take a look at it.
