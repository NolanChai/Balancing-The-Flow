I don't know much about monster riding but I do like your monsties. Especially you're Levitatan and Temnocera. I also find that it is very interesting that you can have two of the same dragon type in your team, even if they are both Eldees!
I am looking forward to fighting against a rider who knows so much about monsters (and has such good taste as well)!
