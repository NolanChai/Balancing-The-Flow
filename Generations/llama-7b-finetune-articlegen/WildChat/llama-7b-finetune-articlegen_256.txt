Saiko: *chuckling* “That’s right, I was waiting for this.”

Naomi: “Eh?”

Saiko: “Don’t look now, but Sakura’s making her move again.” (Sakura is a girl.)

Naomi: “Hm? Oh, that’s right. She likes to wake me up at night.”

Yui: “Huh…she sure does like to stay active late into the evenings. I wish she could sleep through until morning!”

Saiko: “That’d be nice, wouldn’t it?” (Sakura is a girl.)

Mio: “She just loves her mother so much that she doesn’t want to miss a second of her time.”

(In the clubroom…)

Yuri: “We decided to do a photo booth for our next event, but we’re not sure what kind of theme to go with.”

Saiko: “That’s actually why I came here today. I was thinking that it would be neat if everyone took some pictures together and then we could compile them into one big group shot!”

Naomi: “Oh? That sounds like a lot of work, but that might be pretty fun.”

Mio: “Sounds like something you’d do at summer camp…” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Saiko: *nods* “Yeah, I guess it would be a little bit similar. But that was actually the idea I had.”

Mio: “Well then, I’m down for anything.”

Naomi: “Me too!” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Yuri: “That sounds great! It should be a lot of fun. We can have the photo booth set up in the cafeteria, so everyone will get some nice pictures to take back home.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Mio: *nods* “That sounds like a great idea!”

Yuri: “Great! I’ll start working on getting the equipment together. The rest of you just need to think about how we should theme this thing.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Naomi: “I guess it would make sense if there was something that everyone could relate to, so I’ll brainstorm some ideas. Do you have any in mind?”

Saiko: *nods* “Yeah…like maybe a ‘Best Dressed’ photo contest or an ’80s-themed thing? We could all dress up as characters from The Breakfast Club and take pictures.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Yui: *laughs* “That sounds like a lot of work. But I’m sure we can think of something fun.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

(A few days later…)

Naomi: “Hey guys! I have an idea for the theme of our next event!”

Saiko: *nods* “Great, what’s it called?”

Yui: “Oh no…you don’t mean that one with all the costumes and stuff, right? We talked about doing something like that last time, but it just didn’t seem to work out.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Saiko: *nods* “Yeah…it would be a lot of work. And I don’t think we have any good places here on campus that would make for an appropriate background.”

Naomi: “Well, it wouldn’t need to be a whole costume thing. All you really need is something simple to go with the theme.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Mio: *raises an eyebrow* “Okay…and what would that theme be?” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Naomi: “It’s called ‘Dress-Up Day.’ It’ll basically just be a bunch of us taking pictures in our best clothes. I think it’d look pretty cool, actually!” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Mio: *smiles* “You know what? That sounds like fun.”

Naomi: *nods* “I’m glad you guys liked the idea! It should be a lot of fun, too. Just make sure that you come prepared with something nice to wear.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Saiko: *looks at Yui and smiles* “Yeah, I’ll start working on getting the costumes together for us all now.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Naomi: *nods* “That sounds great. And if you can get a hold of some nice backdrops or something like that, then it should really look amazing!” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)

Yui: *chuckles* “Alright…I guess I’ll need to start brainstorming some ideas for this thing.” (Little kids usually take photos to send home to their parents.)
