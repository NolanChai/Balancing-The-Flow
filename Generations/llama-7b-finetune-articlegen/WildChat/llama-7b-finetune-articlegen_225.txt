Try This Code.

\begin{code}
Sub Macro2()
Dim rng As Range, i As Integer
Dim ws As Worksheet, dt As Date
Set ws = Sheets("Sheet1")
On Error Resume Next 'Ignore any #N/A values in column B.
rng = ws.Range(ws.Cells(4, 2), ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, 2).End(xlUp))
For i = 5 To rng.Row Step -1 'Start at row 5 and decrement each time.
If InStr(rng.Cells(i).Value, "Service") <> 0 Then 'Check if Service is found in the current cell of the range
dt = DateValue(rng.Cells(i).Offset(0, -2))
If dt > rng.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, 5).End(xlUp).Row Then 'Check for the max date value in column H
rng.Cells(3, 6) = "Max Date: " & dt
Else
'Do Nothing
End If
Next i
End Sub
\end{code}

> A new workbook is opened with two worksheets named "Sheet1" and "Sheet2".

\begin{code}
If ActiveCell.Value = "SERVICED" Then
MsgBox ("Please enter the service number of the next service due")
End If
\end{code}

Answer: \section{Update:}

I have added a check for the condition that `ActiveCell` is in the range of column B, and not somewhere else. I also removed the `Option Explicit`. You will probably get an error if you don't run it after adding the line.

\begin{code}
Option Explicit 'Requires to use this in Excel 2007 or above only
Sub TEST()
    Dim rng As Range, i As Long, v As Variant
    Set rng = Columns("B").Find(What:="SERVICED", After:=ActiveCell)
    If rng Is Nothing Then Exit Sub 'Found no "SERVICED" in column B.
    For i = 2 To rng.Row
        v = rng.Value
        If LCase(v) <> "serviced" Then GoTo NextLine
        MsgBox "Please ensure that an identical Service is created with a Next Service Due Date after changing this to SERVICED." & Chr$(13) _
             & "NOTE: You must have a Next Service Date greater than the Current Service date.", vbCritical, "ERROR!"
        GoTo NextLine: 'Skip next line. This is important!
NextLine:  rng.Offset(0, -2).Select
    End If
End Sub
\end{code}
