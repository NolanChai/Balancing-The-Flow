This is an amazing start to the new year, however it's not clear whether or not it has been an amazing start to a new year (or another academic year). Perhaps the author could try to reword the sentence so that it is more clear. 
Also, it seems like this month was not only September, but all of K2 as well. It seems like the author may be referring to both the kid's and teacher's progress from K1 to K2. 
It has been an amazing start to the new year... - I think you can cut out 'to the new year', as it's not really relevant to the rest of the sentence, but that is only my opinion. It may be good to put the whole sentence in italics, so we know if it was a quotation from another person or if it was the author's own thoughts/feelings. 
It has been an amazing start to the new year and a wet one for us in Guangzhou. Even with the rain the K2 classes have had a great start and month... - I think you could use the comma as a full-stop, or maybe change 'and' to 'with'. 
It has been an amazing start to the new year and a wet one for us in Guangzhou. Even with the rain the K2 classes have had a great start and month of September... - I think it would be clearer if you said 'even though it rained...' instead of saying 'with'. 
This year has had a few changes in both staffing and academic, but through all we see a positive attitude flowing in classrooms. Our kid have adapted well with new teachers.... - I don't think that sentence makes sense as it is. If you took out the first word then there would be no problem... 'Our kid have adapted well to new teachers'. Maybe something like, 'All of our kid have adapted well to the new teachers we have.' 
I do like how you mentioned 'phonic's', but I don't really know what that means. However, if it is a lesson in phonics then I think you could change it to 'phonetics'. Also, you may want to put apostrophes in the words that are missing letters. 
The month of September is the month of adaptability... - It doesn't really sound like a good idea to say that someone has adapted well if they have had difficulties, so I don't think this sentence works. Maybe change it to 'The month of September was the month of adaptation.' or 'The month of September was the month in which students had to adapt.' 
We would like to take the opportunity to wish all parents and students a Happy Holiday... - I think you could say, 'we would like to wish all parents and students a happy holiday', instead of saying that we want to 'take an opportunity'. 
Also, the last part of your response is very repetitive. Perhaps you can cut out some sentences so it is not so long and wordy? (This may have happened unintentionally because you were trying to fit everything on one line, but I think if there was a sentence that started with 'we also would like', then maybe you could use a new paragraph to talk about something else. Just an idea.) 
Best wishes.
