Philo lived in Alexandria around 25 BCE through CE 50. He wrote in Greek about his views on Judaism. His most well known books include _On The Creation_ and _On The Special Laws_. These books are where he explains how the law was made by God, and how it is to be interpreted. He also explains many stories from the old testament, which helps readers understand them more.

The book "Legends of the Jews" by Louis Ginzberg, published in 1909. It was originally written as a series for the Jewish Encyclopedia, which were intended to be historical stories and folklore about jewish tradition. The book has an introduction that describes how these stories where collected over thousands of years and the importance of sharing their culture with people outside their community.

### Summary:
The book is divided in 27 sections. Each section covers a different topic, ranging from creation to redemption. Ginzberg includes many folklore stories that show how jewish tradition has been passed on generation to generation through oral tradition and religious practices. The topics covered include the origins of Judaism, miracles, biblical stories, etc...

### Analysis:
The book was written for the Jewish Encyclopedia in 1905 and was later published as a stand alone book. This makes sense because it seems to me that these are oral traditions that were recorded by someone who had no formal education. The tone of this text is very casual, yet very descriptive. It reads as if the author is telling stories from his childhood growing up in Judaism. For example, on page 2 he talks about how people used to pray at the Western Wall when they where in Jerusalem and the miracle that occurred when a rain fell on them during their prayer time.
