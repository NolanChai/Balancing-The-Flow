"Hey there! How are you doing?" says Miss Luana. "It looks like the dance club is starting soon."

[player]: "Hello. I'm not a member of the club - I just wanted to take a peek at the murals."

"Oh, that's nice and all, but you can't go back there after this!" says Miss Luana.

"No need to worry," says the player. "I've already seen them all."

Miss Luana gets agitated. "Agh! You're such an ungrateful little... I wish I never even met you! I'll get rid of you right now!" She begins to scream and flail around her arms wildly, attempting to fling the player away from the mural. The player manages to evade her strikes, but soon enough, Miss Luana breaks through the wall of the room she was standing in.

"I'm going to kill you right now!" says Miss Luana. "My baby is about to be born - and I'll not let any harm come to it! Just stay out of my way!" She begins to stomp around, knocking over various objects along the way. The player eventually gets in front of her, but she attempts to charge past them anyway.

"Hey! Stop right there!" says Miss Luana. "I won't stand for this anymore! I'm going to kill you!"

[player]: "You wouldn't dare."

"Oh yes! I would and will!" says Miss Luana. She begins running towards the player, but she suddenly stops in her tracks. There was a flash of light - which made her back away. When the light cleared up, there stood none other than Mr. Mint. He's been here all along?

"Mr. Mint!" says Miss Luana. "I need to get rid of this guy! Help me out!"

[Mr. Mint]: "Easy now - he doesn't look like much."

Miss Luana: "But he could cause trouble for the baby if we don't do something about him!"

"I see," says Mr. Mint. He goes back into the room and begins to speak with Miss Luana in a low tone, though it is heard by the player nonetheless. "All right - I know just how to take care of this situation." He walks over to where the player was standing before and takes off his mask, revealing that he is actually a giant cockroach (of all things). He then begins to speak with them once more. "We have two choices - we could kill the player here and now... or we could get rid of him from our sight."

"I don't understand," says Miss Luana.

"Think about it," says Mr. Mint. "If he were to see us, he might tell someone else who might try to find out what we're doing here... and if that happens, the baby could be in danger."

Miss Luana: "Yeah - I think you have a point there..." She turns back towards the player. "...I guess we'll just get rid of this person somehow."

Mr. Mint then walks over to the player and begins speaking with them again, though still loud enough for Miss Luana to hear as well. "Well? What do you have in mind?"

[player]: "I can't believe that I'm actually having a conversation with a cockroach right now..."

"Don't worry about that," says Mr. Mint. "It is not my intention to cause harm or anything of the sort." He then points to something off in the distance. The player looks over - and sees a massive boulder sitting there.

[player]: "That rock could probably crush me if it wanted..."

"Oh yeah, that's right!" says Miss Luana. She begins charging towards the boulder at full speed. "Come on! I'll throw you down to your death - and then we're done with this guy forever!"

The player makes a mad dash for it as well. Both of them make it just before Miss Luana can make her move - but she begins to slam the ground once they're out of reach, causing tremors in the area that shake up any objects not secured down properly. Mr. Mint suddenly gets an idea. He looks at the player and then back at Miss Luana.
"Oh goodness! I could use your help here!" says Mr. Mint. "I have a plan to stop her - but you'll need to help me out."

[player]: "What do you need?"

Mr. Mint: "Give me that backpack of yours!" The player hands him the bag, which he begins shaking and then tossing to Miss Luana. She stops her rampage - and looks at it for a moment before looking up in confusion. "Wha... what was that?!"

[player]: "Well?"

"I don't understand! I can't feel my arms or legs anymore!" says Miss Luana. The player begins to laugh, which startles Mr. Mint and causes him to fly backwards into the wall. "...Oh no..."

Miss Luana: "Hey! Get back over here right now!" She then charges at them again, but is stopped in her tracks once more by the bag falling on top of her head. "Agh... what's wrong with me?"

Mr. Mint: "She was under your spell - I used a magical item to make her think that she was fine." He then speaks with the player again, though in a slightly panicked tone now. "...Do you have any idea how long it took for us to get this far!?"

[player]: "I'm sorry... but I wasn't sure what else to do."

"Well there goes my chance of getting her off my back!" says Mr. Mint. "But hey, at least we got the job done - and that means we can get rid of him now!" He walks up to where the player was standing before and begins speaking with them again. "...I'm afraid I cannot help you anymore." He then goes over to a wall and begins tapping it on his backside, which causes a door to open behind him. "My name is Mr. Mint - but most call me Mr. Luna."

[player]: "Why is that?"

"Because my real name is actually Mr. Luana," says Mr. Luna. He then turns around and walks through the door, causing it to close behind him. Miss Luana then picks herself up off the ground - but she doesn't seem all that angry anymore. "...Why does he look like a cockroach?"

[player]: "I don't know..."
"Well... let's just call it a long story," says Miss Luana. She looks down at her arm, which has been regained and seems to have no effect on it. "...But it doesn't matter right now - I just need to make sure that baby of mine is okay."
The two of them walk over towards the mural they were previously by, where Miss Luana sits down on a rocking chair next to her bed. She then pulls out her phone and begins calling someone on it. "...I'm sorry I was late... but something came up..."
"Oh don't worry about that - you did just give birth!" says the voice at the other end of the line. "That was quite a show." Miss Luana seems to become more irritated by this remark, though she keeps her cool nonetheless. "...No... I mean there were some complications..."
"What kind of complications?" asks the person on the other side.
"Well... umm... the baby's head was a little bit too large - so we had to cut it open," says Miss Luana. "But don't worry about that - I took care of it right away." She then looks up and notices something strange in her room. "...Huh? What is that?"
The player walks over towards the window and begins looking through the glass, though there isn't much to see aside from some trees. "It doesn't seem like anything's wrong..." They turn around - and then spot a small piece of paper sticking out of a crack in one of the walls. "...I think I know what that is."
The player goes over and grabs it, which reveals to be nothing more than a note scribbled on with crayons by a child (likely Miss Luana). "Hey there! We're going to play!" it says. "It's fun - come join us!" The player hands the note back to Miss Luana - who takes notice of the childish writing and looks down, as if in shock. "...Huh...?"
The player turns around - and notices something else strange about this room. It has a strange, almost hypnotic quality about it that makes it hard for them to tear their eyes away from what's there - despite knowing there is nothing of interest there. "What is this feeling..." they whisper aloud.
"Huh? What was that?" says Miss Luana. The player turns
