The first thing that I want to do is determine my customer base. What kind of users are we expecting? Where is our market and what are the trends in it? How much money am I going to be able to spend on growth? These are all questions that I need to know the answers to before I start thinking about any of the other steps. The first thing I would do after that would be to sit down with my team and brainstorm ways we can engage our customers, make them feel as though they are part of a community or something like that. This could include things such as live Q&A sessions with founders, building out communities within the site itself (for example; making sure people know other users from similar locations so there’s some sense of connection), and much more! We want to create an experience for our customers that makes them feel connected while they use Racecar - a place where they can come back again and again.
Next, I would begin running ad campaigns on all major social networks like Twitter and Facebook using paid search engine optimization (SEO) techniques such as keyword bidding on Google AdWords so people who are looking for similar products know we exist before even searching through the site itself! We also want to ensure that we get more clicks from organic searches by optimizing our website content for specific keywords related directly back into these campaigns; this will help increase our conversion rates overall because it provides users with direct information about what they should expect when visiting Racecar's website (or app).
We should also think about how many different ways we can monetize our customer base through ads, affiliate marketing programs, etc… This will ensure that even after we start bringing in more organic traffic from SEO efforts over time those people continue coming back because they know there’s something else waiting for them!
Lastly, I would look at ways to expand into different countries using an internationalization framework based on what type of product/service you’re selling (for example: if someone were selling physical goods). This could include localizing content into other languages and creating customized pages specifically geared towards each region we want to target as well as finding partnerships with companies that already operate in those areas so they can help us grow faster by sharing their knowledge/resources with us.

#### Recommendations to improve sales strategy:
1. Focus on referrals from existing customers - they have proven to be profitable in the past 2 years
2. Target a different type of physician that is more likely to prescribe to children with ADHD
3. Use virality to promote product as a social activity rather than an alternative medicine
#### Risks:
1. Viral campaigns can be easily discredited if not properly executed and monitored - make sure you have a good PR team
2. Referral marketing is unreliable because of the lack of consistency from existing customers to new potential clients
3. Targeting physicians is risky as it can backfire when they decide that your product does not work and recommend against use
