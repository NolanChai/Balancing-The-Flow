Eye of Kingthulhu: "You could have just waited until Archegonia got up."

Archegonian: "Owww....I'm fine. I just...felt a little pain, but it passed away quickly."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "I don't really know what's going to happen when you step through that portal, but I think we should all get ready for anything."
