The player plays as a young boy with the power of wind, he goes by many names but for now he will go by Yun. The game starts off in the woods where the main character is just going around minding his own business, when a giant bird comes out of no where and tries to attack him! Luckily (or unluckily) you can use your wind powers to fly up above the bird and then throw him back down with an ice blast. The bird hits the ground and is knocked unconscious. The boy walks up to it, notices its glowing red eyes, and picks it up by the neck. He looks at his hands in shock and realizes that this isn't a normal bird. As he stands there with the bird in his hand, a strange man comes out of nowhere and snatches it away! "What are you doing with my pet?!" he yells and grabs the boy by the shoulders. The man throws him on the ground and takes off running into the woods. The young boy gets up and follows after him. The boy, Yun, then begins his journey to find out more about this world that he has been transported too.
