> I was thinking more along the lines of "The two of you are really going to have your work cut out for you." "Why is that?" "Well, because they're a bunch of brats and it's going to be an enormous pain in the ass getting them all on the same page. Oh, also, they'll try and take over everything we do and we won't have any room left for ourselves." "Why don't you just ignore them? It's not like there's anything stopping you from doing your own thing and leaving them to their own devices." "Because if we let them run around doing whatever they want, eventually they'll get in the way of everything. If we put a stop to it now then maybe we can salvage something from this."
