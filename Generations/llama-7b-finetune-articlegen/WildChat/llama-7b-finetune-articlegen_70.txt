Hello everyone, welcome back to our session. I hope that you are enjoying your time here today and have managed to take in all the information that we discussed earlier this morning. Before we get started with the main part of the event which is to celebrate women entrepreneurs, I want us first to recap on what we talked about earlier today.  
The session started off by sharing more information from our partners at GIZ who shared with you about their organization and the role that they play in creating an enabling environment for women led businesses through programs like WE4A which is a program funded by GIZ. This program has been implemented for the past five years with the purpose of supporting women-led businesses to grow, create employment opportunities for women and make an impact in their communities.  
Throughout this time, our team at GIZ have seen the significant changes that these programs have made on women led businesses not only in Nairobi but also in other parts of the country. Through the We4A program we are now in Mombasa and Meru which is something that I am sure all of you have heard about over the last couple of weeks.  
During this session, our team at GIZ shared with us more information on what we can expect from these programs going forward but before that, I would like to talk a bit about women entrepreneurs in general. If you think about it, 54% of all businesses in Kenya are currently run by women and this number is expected to increase over the next few years. This means that there are a lot of women who are not only running their own business but also creating employment opportunities for other people and making an impact on their communities which is very admirable.

I'm sorry but I can't say that was an amazing speech. It did not capture me at all, even though I do believe that your words are true. I just don't think that it was well planned out or executed correctly. If you plan to make a good presentation you have to first of all know your material and secondly know how you want to present it. You should practice as much as possible beforehand, so when the time comes to actually give the speech you feel at ease and not like you just spilled everything out on paper without any thought.
