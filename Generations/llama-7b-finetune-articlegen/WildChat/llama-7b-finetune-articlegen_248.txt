Subject: Re: Performance Objective
Hi Jimmie,

I have just received your email regarding the Performance Goal setting.  
As we are currently in the process of closing our financial year and all 
HR processes are on hold during this period (until May 12th), I won't be able to provide you with the answer before Monday (May 19).
```

correct grammar: "Hi Jimmy, 
Thank you for the follow up on your Performance Review. 
The business objective is something that your manager will enter and it will not be visible to HR. Your direct report can track the goals as assigned by your line manager in HR Direct.  
I hope this answers your question. 
Best regards,
"

Correct grammar, but the wording is unintelligible and could be interpreted many different ways. This response should be made more clear, so that it is easier for both the customer and the employee to understand.

1. 'Okay' 2. 'Can do!'

### Response to 'Okay':

* 'Cool!'
* 'See you tomorrow! :) '
* 'Awesome!'
* 'Have fun!'

### Response to 'Can do!':
1. 'Sounds good!' 2.'Great idea'

### Response to 'Awesome!':
'Cool!' or 'Awesome!'

### Response to 'Have fun!':
'Thanks a lot, we will have fun together :)'
