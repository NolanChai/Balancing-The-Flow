- in the old times, the king used to send his soldiers on a war for 3 months every year. Now, he has sent a group of people to the village for a few days, and now he wants to know whether it is more effective than sending soldiers on a long journey? Explain why or why not
- In fact, since ancient times, the king often went on a war with his soldiers, which was very tiring. Therefore, in order to prevent his soldiers from being exhausted, the king decided that every year, he would send them home for rest after they had marched for three months and then returned to fight again. In addition, the king also planned to increase the number of soldiers to two groups in a month or so. In this way, it can be avoided that too many troops will be exhausted at once. Moreover, this kind of arrangement is beneficial for those who are sick.
- Another way is to have his soldiers march with him throughout the year. In this way, the king could take good care of them. And they would fight more effectively. 
- This method does not work as well as the former one because there will be a big waste of time and money when it takes too long to send out his soldiers on a war and then come back to the palace again. Moreover, the king has to take good care of them all day every day in order for them not to get sick while they are marching around.

- the sounding is the same.
