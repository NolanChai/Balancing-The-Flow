(As I walked up to them, I heard a loud crash from another room, but they ignored it. They were still talking about what to do next. What were they talking about?)

Monika: “We could start a new club or try to find someone new…”

Yuri: “Or we can just stick with this club until the end of high school.”

Natsuki: “Yeah, I agree with Yuri. Besides, we’re already so far behind schedule on our plans anyway. There are too many things that need to be done, and there aren’t enough days left for us.”

Kohana: (I could feel her eyes on me.) “But what if it’s not just the five of us who want this club?”

Sayori: “Then we can always add some more girls…”

Himari: “We already have to find someone new anyway, since Kohana is graduating soon.”

Sayori: (I glanced over at Himari as she said that. She was still so young and innocent even though she would be a sophomore in college this year.)

Yuuri: “But what if the new member doesn’t like our club? What if they don’t want to join?”

Sayori: (The five girls looked at me, waiting for my response. I had no idea what to say - should I tell them that we could find someone new and try again, or do I tell them that MC wasn't coming back?)

Monika: “I don’t know.”

Yuuri: (I saw her nervously glancing at the other girls.)

Natsuki: "…"

Kohana: “Hmm...”

Sayori: “Um, guys?”

Yuuri: “Oh! Sorry!”

(The five girls quickly turned their attention back to me. They looked at me expectantly and waited for what I would say next.)

Sayori: “I know it’s been hard on all of you…but we have to keep going, okay?”

Monika: (She nodded slowly.)

Yuuri: "I...understand."

Natsuki: “Of course, Sayo.”

Kohana: “Yeah. We’ll never forget MC, but he would want us to keep going too.”

Sayori: “Exactly…MC is gone now, but we will not give up on this club. It was the best years of our lives so far, and we need it more than ever now. Besides, we still have Himari, and she’s just as important to us all as MC.”

Monika: “True. We don’t want to lose her either…”

Natsuki: (I could feel the love that they had for each other. It made me want to cry.)

Yuuri: "We can do this."

Kohana: "Of course we can!"

(They all smiled at each other, and I smiled too as I watched them cheer on in their clubroom. But one question still haunted me...was it really okay for us to keep going without MC? Maybe the five girls could accept that he was gone, but what about Himari? She was just a little girl when we started this club - she didn't know what had happened to her dad.)
