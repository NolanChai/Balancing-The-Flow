> I found the problem. In my case, there is not "data.json" file. But I have another way to use this code without it:
```javascript
$.ajax({
    type: 'GET',
    url: 'http://localhost/my_api/', //URL to api
    dataType:'jsonp', 
    success: function(data) {
        alert("I'm here");
    },
    error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {
        console.log('error');
    }
})
```

You can use the following code to check if the list contains the object you're looking for. If it does, then print its name and the number of times that item has been added (i.e. what index). Otherwise, just print out "nope" on a line all by itself. 
```
def check(myList):
    if myList[3] == 'Pizza':
        print('Found! Item was at index number:', myList.index(3))
    else:
        print('No dice, bro')
```
