* Background
ACME energy has diversiifed and are looking at Wind as an alternate power sourcse. There is an ambitious multi-billion dollar investment plan to put an offshore wind farm with turbine generating energy to help offset the energy demand.
To support this business initiative, the Group CI/CISO are working with regional CI/CISOs and CISOs in the respective countries to identify the future IT and Security strategy to support this initiative. This is a multi-year investment program, and the decision has been taken to use the public cloud to build the future IT environment for this initiative. This is also part of a wider cloud migration plan for ACME Energy.
The result is a new IT strategy and a corresponding Cybersecurity strategy with several security programs that need to be implemented over a three year period. ACME uses the NIST cybersecurity framework, CI/IS 18 for operational controls and the CSA CCM 4.0 for cloud security controls.
ACME has decided to partner with ZKC Consulting to deliver the Cybersecurity strategy and work with regional Cybersecurity teams to implement the changes. The company has taken a cloud first approach to implement the two new IT strategic programs and three strategic security programs listed below.
 Design and implementation of new wind farm using cloud technology and remote software updates.
 Creation of a new data lake that will be used to collect data from the wind turbine and other OT devices, which will be used for several purposes including system monitoring and advanced data analytics capabilities. The strategic security programs are as follows:
Provision of secure data connectivity from the wind turbines to the Cloud (the cloud provider has not yet been confirmed).
Creation of a new Operational Technology Security Operation Center (SOC) that will monitor the security of the OT devices used in the wind farm.
Creation of a Threat Intelligence program to protect the new wind farm infrastructure against cyber threats.
Your Role: In your role as an external Security Consultant, you are required to provide a report advising on the implementation of one of the strategic security programs; Creation of a new OT SOC that will monitor the security of the OT devices used in the wind farm.
The CI/CISO has been working with the CISOs team to identify the capabilities required to build a SOC that will monitor the security of the OT devices. The agreement is to build a SOAR platform that will provide orchestration, automation and response. This is in addition to the vulnerability management and penetration testing requirements. Both teams have agreed that all products need to be cloud native and should include the use of a SIEM. The CI/CISO wants to use Azure Sentinel as the SIEM but the CISOs want to use Google Chronicle. This SIEM will also be used to monitor the security of the data lake. The CISOs want to use Qualys as the vulnerability management tool as it is currently being used in ACME.
You are expected to provide the following high level outputs for the first phase of the project:
Outline the requirements for SOAR in the context of ACME’s operations. Propose a specific SOAR solution based on your requirements. Explain the security controls that need to be implemented for the proposed SOAR solution. Evaluate Azure Sentinel and Google Chronicle SIEM solutions and provide your recommendation. Please explain the criteria you will be using for your analysis (you do not need to consider criteria which are not directly impacting the security operations, e.g. costs). Explain the operation procedures the SOC team needs to create to deal with security threats.
Please explain how you will integrate different data sources into the SIEM to create a single pane of glass view that will provide security analysts the relevant information.
Investigate if Qualys vulnerability management tool is the best tool for ACME and if you feel this is not the right tool, please provide a gap analysis and recommend the tool that should be used. Explain the penetration testing approach and define the scope of the penetration testing program.

**Instructions:**  Write three or four sentences justifying your choice for each of these criteria. You might find that this is easier if you start with a table (which can then be turned into an answer) and then add in some commentary afterward, but it’s fine either way.
### Justify the following criteria:

1. **The criteria should not require the creation of new knowledge.** It may seem intuitive that the requirements for a successful project should only ask for things that already exist, but there are still plenty of reasons to specify something new in your project. This is especially true if you have limited time or budget and need more than just existing software packages to achieve what you want from them; however this isn’t always possible (e.g., when developing an algorithm), so consider whether any particular requirement might require knowledge that isn’t currently available rather than trying to create it yourself by making assumptions about future technologies etc., which could lead down dangerous paths instead of being helpful in creating something useful today!
### Justify the following criteria:

2. **The project should be feasible within a short period of time (a year or less).** This is important because it ensures that we can meet our deadlines, but also allows us to focus on other aspects such as user experience design which may take longer than expected due to delays caused by unforeseen circumstances etc.. If you don’t have this constraint in place then there will always be room for improvement down the line if something comes up unexpectedly; however these types of changes tend not only disrupt existing workflows but also introduce additional cost/complexity into an already expensive process (e.g., adding another team member).

- Infrastructure: The serverless codebase in the application uses AWS Lambda functions to process incoming requests, which are invoked by API Gateway. To run these Lambda functions, the service has been deployed on a set of auto-scaling EC2 instances hosted in an Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling group.
- Security: The application is protected using AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF). All incoming traffic to the service must first pass through this WAF before being allowed access to the backend services. The application is also protected from DDoS attacks using the AWS Shield Advanced. 
- Maintenance and Monitoring: The codebase of the application uses GitHub Pages for continuous deployment, with code review done by a team member every week. For maintenance, the service uses AWS CloudWatch alarms to track certain metrics, such as CPU usage and disk space utilisation. Any critical metric value is automatically forwarded to the on-call engineer, who can then investigate the issue and take appropriate action.
### Additional comments:
- I'm not sure if this counts as infrastructure since it's a separate service from what we use in our application. However, I could include it if necessary.

This paper will outline the development of a new SOAR (situation, objective, approach, result)
model for analyzing and resolving cyber security issues. This model will be used to analyze
the situation with regard to malicious code on Facebook and develop an SOAR solution based on
the information gathered in the analysis step of the process. The model proposed by this paper is
similar to the SOAR model that is currently being utilized in the industry, but it incorporates a
unique approach to the situation-identification phase of the process. In addition, the model will
allow for greater flexibility with regard to the analysis and resolution phases of the SOAR process.

Given that this is a high-stakes environment, where one misstep can mean a catastrophic breach of security, it’s important to have a rock-solid approach. The following SOARs are all excellent options for IT departments that want the best possible protection and compliance, but each has different strengths and weaknesses when compared against the others. In this section we'll take a look at how these options stack up in terms of their features and capabilities to determine which one is most appropriate for your needs.

### Criteria: 1. Integration with SIEM
One of the most important considerations when choosing an SOAR tool is whether or not it will work well within your existing IT infrastructure. Each solution offers different levels of support for integrating with SIEM tools such as ArcSight or Splunk, so make sure that whatever option you choose can be easily configured to fit into your current environment without major disruptions or additional costs incurred through customizations required on either side (either by changing the software itself or hiring outside consultants). For example:
- CortXSOAR provides robust integration capabilities with SIEM solutions and offers out-of-the-box support for multiple data sources, enabling users to quickly identify anomalies in real time based on customizable rulesets. Its advanced analytics engine allows organizations to correlate events across different systems while providing actionable insights into potential threats before they become serious problems.
- FortiSOAR includes an intuitive dashboard that enables administrators to monitor all security incidents from one place without requiring manual setup or configuration efforts on either side; it also supports integration with third party applications such as ArcSight for improved efficiency when managing large-scale operations within complex networks.
### Criteria: 2. OT Device Integration and Scalaibilty
Another important factor to consider is the ability of a SOAR tool to integrate with your organization’s existing OT devices (such as industrial control systems) and scale up/down depending on changing requirements over time due changes in staffing levels or shifts in security priorities from one project phase to another. Here are some key features that will help determine which solution is right for you:
- CortXSOAR offers extensive support for integrating with OT devices such as programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human machine interfaces (HMIs) and other types of industrial automation systems; it also includes a scalability module that allows users to add new nodes dynamically if necessary without disrupting existing operations or incurring additional costs through hardware upgrades.
- FortiSOAR provides out-of-the box integration with OT devices via its proprietary API platform which enables administrators to create custom workflows for monitoring events across multiple networks simultaneously while maintaining a high degree of flexibility when configuring security settings based on specific requirements at any given time point during operation cycles.
### Criteria: 3. Data Encryption and Access Control
The ability of an SOAR solution to encrypt data stored within its platform is another important factor that must be considered before making a final decision about which product you choose; some vendors offer encryption capabilities built into their core infrastructure while others require users to purchase additional modules separately:
- CortXSOAR includes strong end-to-end encryption algorithms ensuring complete protection against unauthorized access even when stored within public cloud environments like Amazon Web Services (AWS). It also provides role based access control so that only authorized personnel can view or modify sensitive information without compromising security protocols established by IT staff members responsible for managing user permissions across various systems throughout your organization's network infrastructure.
- FortiSOAR includes robust encryption capabilities along with other advanced features like multi factor authentication (MFA) which makes it easier for administrators to control access rights while ensuring that all data stored within its platform remains secure regardless of whether or not third party vendors have been given explicit permission by management teams prior approval before accessing sensitive information during investigations conducted internally or externally on behalf clients outside your organization's direct jurisdiction.
### Criteria: 4. Regulation Compliance
Finally, it is important that any SOAR solution you choose will meet all relevant regulatory requirements established by governing bodies within regions where your operations take place; this includes things like complying with PCI-DSS standards when dealing cardholder data as well as HIPAA regulations designed specifically healthcare organizations handling patient records etc.:
- CortXSOAR provides robust compliance capabilities so that customers can easily achieve certification for different industry standards such as SOC2 Type II audit reports required by many financial institutions around world who want assurance their systems are securely managed before giving permission grant access sensitive data contained therein without risking violating any relevant legislation enacted country region where operations take place (e.g., GDPR).
- FortiSOAR offers similar features allowing customers to quickly achieve certification required by regulatory agencies such as NIST or FINRA in order meet stringent security guidelines established these organizations prior granting access sensitive information held within their platform environments across multiple countries throughout globe depending location operations take place (e.g., EU-US Privacy Shield).
### Criteria: 5. Cloud-native Functionality
Finally, it is important to consider the ability of any SOAR solution you choose will work effectively in cloud environments; some vendors offer native support for public or hybrid cloud architectures while others require customers purchase additional modules separately if they wish take advantage services offered through these types infrastructure:
- CortXSOAR provides comprehensive support across multiple platforms including Azure Stack, AWS & Google Cloud Platform (GCP) making it easy deploy across public/hybrid environments without needing to modify core components existing IT infrastructure currently used by organization on day-to-day basis.
- FortiSOAR offers similar functionality enabling customers easily take advantage cloud services provided through various vendors around world without having worry about compatibility issues associated proprietary technologies sometimes encountered during migration processes undertaken when moving operations from one vendor's platform another’s offering greater flexibility more features at lower cost compared alternative solutions available market today.
