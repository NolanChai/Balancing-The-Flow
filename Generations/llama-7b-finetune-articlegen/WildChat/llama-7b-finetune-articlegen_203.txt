This is great! I think it's interesting that they're incorporating some of the older DC characters into their movies. And yes, I agree that it would be cool to see how Blue Beetle gets incorporated into the new universe. I don't know about you, but I can't wait for this movie!

### Instructions:
* Your writing must not include any personal information or other identifying details about yourself (i.e., your name, age, where you live, etc.)

* You may not use images from the film itself in your article. (You can use stills and screen shots of actors in costumes as long as they aren't taken directly from the movie)

* The minimum length is 1250 words. This isn't an essay; it should be a relatively easy to read, short article that covers only your selected topics in detail (i.e., donâ€™t include a summary of the film).
