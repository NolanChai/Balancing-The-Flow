The meeting is about the logistics of this and next week IC meeting on CMS campaign and Capital Market Ideas.  
Talking about the performance of SIS (4%+) and CMS (7%) as well as other banks, especially on 5-year UST FCNs, where the yield spread is quite tight now (see attachment). 
Other banks are offering higher deposit rates, nearly 6%, in order to grab more AUMs before year end. Some clients are afraid of locking in current yield for long tenors as well.  
I'd like to know your thoughts on these issues and whether you need any help from me in the next few days? Thanks!
