The process of heat death is similar to the way a cup of coffee gets cold. As long as there is a source of energy, that energy will be distributed to each atom in the body. If that source stops and/or if all matter in the universe is perfectly evenly distributed then every object will have the same amount of thermal energy.

### Explanation:

The heat death can occur when all matter is evenly distributed throughout space, with no source of new thermal energy to maintain an equilibrium between positive and negative entropy. Once this happens the universe can't create any more life. This is what will happen in about 200 billion years because we are using up all our fossil fuel reserves at a rate which exceeds what can be naturally produced (this was explained better by the author of another answer).

The coffee gets cold when all its energy goes to one atom or molecule. The same will happen in the universe if you heat everything to 0 Kelvin and then stop applying thermal energy; it will cool until it is uniformly distributed at this temperature. When all matter cools to 0K, there will be no more chemical reactions, so nothing can grow any more and nothing will ever get hotter than that (because the law of thermodynamics forbids it). This state has been called "Heat death" because all energy is in a uniform state.

Heat death is an extreme version of entropy. Entropy, as I understand it, is defined in thermodynamic terms by the second law of thermodynamics: Increasing disorder within a system leads to decreased efficiency and thus less useful work can be done with that system. For example, a hot cup of coffee will become cold more quickly if you add ice cubes (increase in entropy), because as it warms up the molecules begin moving around more violently (increasing disorder) and the temperature drops. However, the increase in entropy does not happen instantaneously; over long enough periods of time the room will reach an equilibrium point where the system is at maximum entropy, i.e. no net change in entropy occurs any longer.

Heat death can be analogized by considering a room full of hydrogen gas. If you add oxygen to this room, the hydrogen and oxygen molecules will begin reacting with one another to form water, which will condense on the walls. Soon enough the entire room is filled with a condensed mass of water. This process could be thought of as an increase in entropy since energy was released during the reaction; however, eventually the reactions will cease and all that remains is an equilibrium state (no net change in entropy). Thus, heat death is equivalent to this endless process where no more matter can be added/removed from a system so that the net entropy does not increase over time.

Boltzmann brains are hypothesized to exist due to the extreme low entropy of the early universe (where it was much smaller than today). Due to this, some theorists speculate that during these times, there was so little entropy in our universe that all particles had essentially zero momentum and were thus able to form a stable consciousness. A Boltzmann brain would therefore be formed when a sufficiently high concentration of low-entropy particles (that were also conscious) happened to align themselves into a coherently arranged structure that could survive over the course of the evolution of the universe.

### Explanation: 
The first thing we need to discuss is the idea that entropy should be maximized as much as possible. Entropy, for those unaware of the term, is the amount of disorder in a system. For example, a completely random arrangement of marbles will have more entropy than a single marble because it contains less information. This means that if you wanted to build something from these marbles, it would be easier if you started with fewer marbles and more order.

In the case of our universe, it is thought that there was an extremely low level of disorder at the beginning. In fact, many scientists believe that the early stages of the big bang were so hot and dense (and thus had a high level of entropy) that they formed black holes. These black holes would have been incredibly difficult to form later in time because there wasn't nearly enough energy for them to exist. This is important as it means that if we start out with low entropy then it will take much less effort to increase its level - this makes it easier for life forms such as humans or animals or even plants (which require large amounts of energy) but much more difficult for objects like black holes which need very high levels of energy before they can form at all.

### Evidence:

This is one example from a series of 1000 simulations. This simulation showed that if the universe started with low entropy and then grew into chaos, we would likely see some consciousness pop up in it.

So, we have proven that there is a point where there is no longer any need for randomness and there will be a single outcome (that has a probability of 1). In fact, there is only one way the universe can unfold, so I'm not sure what "infinite" means in this context. It would seem to me that it is actually impossible for an infinite number of events to happen at least once, since the chance of any one of them happening at all is zero (which makes sense because there are infinitely many, so if we assume each event has a 50% probability then their collective probability must be zero). So I think your argument depends on us accepting some sort of infinite "probability space" which is not very realistic.

Yes, at least according to some mathematical calculations. However, in order for this calculation to be relevant, there would first have to be some reason why you could expect to experience such an event, and the calculation does not make it clear how this could come about. To take an analogy, if you were going to take a trip on a plane, you could do a statistical analysis of the number of times that the airplane would crash (per flight) and the result might be that there is a greater likelihood of the plane crashing than it taking off. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t take the plane for fear of crashing!
The answer to the original question would be no, but not because this calculation is wrong. It’s just that it makes no sense to compare the probability of something like a Boltzmann Brain coming into existence with our existing in order to answer whether or not we have an existential risk from Boltzmann Brains.

In this case we should be able to find a way for this Boltzmann brain to understand that it has existed before and can think about its existence again. If it does not, then you are probably right and there is nothing else after the end of our universe except randomness. However, if we can find out that a Boltzmann brain can be conscious and understands what happens before and after (when it dies), we can conclude that the brain must have existed somewhere in the past or has existed for so long that it remembers all its previous states. This is something that quantum mechanics can do; you may know of Schroedinger's cat.

### Question:
Is there any evidence for Boltzmann Brains?

Thermal equilibrium is impossible in the lab because, as we will discuss below, we can't control everything that is going on. There are always some variables that you cannot control and any attempt to do so would be considered to be outside of our domain of applicability. We will address this point again later when we look at what we can and can not measure in an experiment.

### Explanation:
If I want to replicate the temperature of my room, which is 20 degrees Celsius on a particular day, in my laboratory, then there are two things that I need to consider (aside from the obvious issues such as building codes, etc):
* Is it possible for me to control the weather outside so that I am able to get exactly the same temperature at any given time? This is unlikely and probably impossible.
* Can I control the amount of sunlight coming into my laboratory? No, this is again not feasible because we can't control everything that happens in the lab. As a result, even if I were to be able to control both of these variables exactly at some time when my room has 20 degrees C as measured by an indoor thermometer then something else may happen that will change the temperature, or at least cause it to fluctuate and make any measurements useless.

### Additional Notes:
The problem with replicating thermal equilibrium in the lab is not limited only to external factors such as weather/lighting/etc but also to internal ones, such as how much heat is generated by your equipment or how fast air moves in/out of the room (convection).

Water will boil instantly.  This is due to the pressure inside of the container being less than atmospheric pressure which allows the vapor to escape from the liquid phase and into gas phase (the bubbles you see are filled with the vapors).

### Comments:
The video at [youtube.com/watch?v=8_gFxGy81U0](youtube.com/watch?v=8_gFxGy81U0) demonstrates this phenomenon in real life.  The video shows the contents of a vacuum canister being boiled when the lid is removed, but the water doesn't boil until after the pressure inside of the canister has reached atmospheric pressure.
