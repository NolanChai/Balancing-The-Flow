The response will be graded on your prompt structure adherance, composition of prompts, and how well you follow the instructions. Above is a sample of what each prompt should look like. The first two prompts are good examples, but the last one needs to have more specific descriptions.
                            

### Deadline:

                            You can work on this anytime before November 6th at 12PM EST, and submit your work in Canvas by then. You can submit multiple prompts if you like, but each prompt will be graded individually.
