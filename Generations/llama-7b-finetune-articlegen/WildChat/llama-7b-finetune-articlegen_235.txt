This response was written by someone who did not study the topic at hand in school and may have seen the assignment as a chore, rather than an opportunity for personal growth.
The first thing that stands out is the student’s lack of understanding on how to properly structure his paragraphs. The first sentence of each paragraph is too long and should be divided into more than one sentence. In addition, some of these sentences are grammatically incorrect. For instance, he writes “Siincete the Restoration” instead of “Since the Restoration.”
It also appears that this student was not taught how to effectively summarize a text. For example, he has only included key facts from the paragraphs without using his own words and rewriting them in an organized summary. In addition, there is no sign of any critical thinking or analysis on what the text says. This makes it seem as though he has just read through each paragraph, copied some sentences, and pasted them together with little to no organization.

I think it's in a pretty good spot. We have not had any major issues within the state or with our nation as of late, so we are doing quite well. I think that as long as people continue to show up and vote for the candidates who support the common man and put others before themselves, then things will stay the way they are today.

### Question:
Do you support or oppose allowing local counties to decide whether to permit casino gaming?

### Response:
I do not support this at all! While it may bring in some revenue for the state and county, I think that it will create more issues than solve them. I feel that people who visit these establishments are more likely to cause issues or get into accidents because of their impaired judgement due to the alcohol involved. There is also a high probability that crime rates around casinos will increase as well. It's not worth it at all, in my opinion.

### Question:
Do you support or oppose requiring photo identification when casting ballots?

### Response:
I do not support this at all! While I believe that everyone should be allowed to vote if they are eligible, the requirement of ID for each individual voter is unnecessary and will only cause more issues than it fixes. People will have a harder time getting to the polls with these requirements in place, which defeats the purpose of voting from your home state. I think that people should be allowed to vote as they please without having to show any identification at all because this can potentially leave them vulnerable if someone else were to steal their information or use it for illegal purposes.

### Question:
Should the Missouri Department of Transportation be required to build a four-lane highway that extends from St. Louis to the Lake of the Ozarks?

### Response:
I do not support this at all! While I understand that they should have a better system in place for travel, I don't think that it is necessary to extend the highway as far south as possible or build more lanes where there are currently only two. There are many other projects that could use funding before something like this should be considered because of how much money would need to go into building such a long stretch of highway with minimal return on investment due its current status as being only used by those living in Missouri or visiting from out-of-state for vacation purposes.

### Question:
Do you support or oppose legalizing the production, sale and use of marijuana?

### Response:
I do not support this at all! While I believe that it should be illegal to sell any kind of drug, I don't think it would make much difference if marijuana was legal because people are still going to smoke it regardless. In my opinion, if you want something bad enough then you will find a way around the law and continue using whatever substance you desire even though it may have negative effects on your life or others around you who might be affected by secondhand smoke from your usage of these products as well as other forms such as edibles which could potentially lead to an increased rate in overdoses because people aren't used to eating cannabis instead of smoking it directly into their lungs (which could result in them becoming addicted).

### Question:
Do you support or oppose requiring employers to pay for birth control pills and other reproductive health services?

### Response:
I do not support this at all! While I believe that everyone should have access to the medications they need, I don't think it is fair to make employers cover these costs because not every company will want or be able to provide them for their employees. This could lead to higher healthcare costs overall and fewer opportunities for those who are looking for work because some businesses might choose not to hire individuals if they know that they will have additional expenses associated with offering insurance plans like this one which can sometimes take years off your life due its high cost per month compared other types of coverage such as dental care which has been shown time after time over decades how effective it is at preventing serious health issues such as cavities etc.; however, there have also been studies conducted where researchers found that people who receive regular checkups from their dentists were actually more likely than others with no insurance whatsoever! This makes sense because if someone has good teeth then they probably won't need surgery down the line either which would result in higher medical bills later on.

> There will be no problems.  The people will do everything they are told to do, when and where they are told to do it.

### Discussion:
> The only problem with a government that does not tell the truth is that eventually everyone learns the truth.
