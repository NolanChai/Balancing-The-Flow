The USDA has jurisdiction over plants and animals but it does not have jurisdiction over pathogens or pests. This means that the investigation and approval process for gene-edited crops falls to the US Department of Agriculture, which has jurisdiction over all living things that are used in agricultural production (including plants and animals). The USDA is responsible for regulating food safety and labeling issues related to genetically modified organisms.

Fauls. Gene transfer is not allowed between species that normally don't exchange genetic information (aka. non-crossing organisms). This includes all crop plants and most animals, but does allow crosses with bacteria, which are able to pass through cell membranes.

The first method (electroporation) is an ex vivo technique where cells are electrically stimulated to become permeable, while the second (AAV) is a virus which has been manipulated in such a way that it can be used as a vector for delivery. The first technique would not require an animal model.
