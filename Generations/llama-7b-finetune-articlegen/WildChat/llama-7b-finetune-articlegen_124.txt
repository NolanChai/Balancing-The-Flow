I think that the first time I saw a Picasso, at my parents' house. They had bought it for their home in Spain, from a young dealer who was going to Paris on business. The painting had been painted on an old piece of furniture. It is a "head" made with a woman and a man's face, but I didn't know how to tell the difference at that time; I thought it was just one woman. That painting stayed in my parents' house for many years until I went to Paris in 1965. That first trip to Europe opened up my eyes in every way, and the second time, when I moved there in 1970, I discovered Picasso. It had been a long journey, but once it was over everything started to make sense. In that year, I also saw a lot of Francis Bacon's work: he was one of my main references, although Picasso remained the master who always held me in his grip; there were very few painters whom I admired more than him.
