**The idea is to create a website that has a section for each type of diet, and where users can click on it to get information. This information could include a short description of the diet and/or a list of foods commonly eaten in that diet, with links or videos about how they should be prepared. Each section would also have a link to a recipe book that users can buy online if they wish**

**An interactive timeline showing how the product development went. For example: "Development started on Monday 29th March, and the first prototype was ready by Thursday 1st April."**

**An interactive timeline with a Gantt chart of the project's progress from beginning to end (with dates for each section, as well as how long it took to complete them). This would be useful if we were doing this assignment in real life!**
