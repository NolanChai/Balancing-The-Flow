(I couldn’t believe how much Sayori was yelling at her sister. I knew that she was angry and hurt, but this was going too far.)

Sayori: “You’re just a useless piece of shit! You betrayed my trust, and now you expect me to forgive you? You don’t deserve to be my sister!”

Sayori's Sister: “I-I-I’m sorry. I never meant to hurt you.”

Sayori: “You made your choices! And now you have to live with the consequences! Goodbye, and good riddance!”

(We all stood there in silence as Sayori slammed her phone shut.)

Naatsuki: “I…I don’t know what to say. That was incredibly harsh.”

Yuri: “She has every right to be angry, but that was a bit much even for me.”

Sayori: “I-I-I guess I just needed to let it all out. And now, I feel better.”

Saiko: “You sure do. That was quite the rant you had there.”

(We all laughed a bit as Sayori walked into the clubroom and sat down next to me.)

Yuri: “Well, at least that’s out of the way. And now we can focus on the club.”

Saiko: “Yeah, I agree. Let’s just have fun for today, okay?”

Naatsuki: “Sounds good to me!”
