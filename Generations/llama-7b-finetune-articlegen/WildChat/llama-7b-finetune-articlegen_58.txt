The number of bits that the instruction occupies in memory. This is usually 16 for instructions, although it can be larger if the CPU has more than one address bus. The size is used to determine what the instruction does, as well as the maximum amount of data that an instruction can access at a time (if an instruction specifies an address register and a data register).

### Explanation:
A bit in memory is simply a 1 or a 0 that takes up one storage location. When talking about bytes we are talking about a collection of bits, as many bits make one byte. The amount of bits that the instruction uses is determined by the opcode length.

156 ml(+0.04 ml) of 1 molar H2SO4 were needed to oxidiize all of the .07g (.32mmol) of KI to .01mol of KIO3, which was then titrated with a 156ml standard solution of sodium thiosulfate. The average ionization constant for the .01 molar solution was found to be .447M

### Error Analysis:
The error analysis is done by comparing the volume of acid required to oxidiize the titrant with a standard KI solution, and by comparing the molarity of the solution obtained after titration with the calculated value.

When potassium dichromate is added to a solution containing sodium thiosulfate and an acidic solution it will produce two ions. The first ion produced by this reaction is chromium(VI), which has the formula of [Cr(H2O)6]3+; however, if the second ion that is created contains sulfates and thiocyanate ions.

\[\mathrm{Na_{2}S^{2}O_{3}+4K_{2}CrO_{4}\rightarrow Na_{2}[Cr(H_{2}O)_{6}]^{+}+4K_{2}SO_{4}+2SCN_{2}^{-}}.\]

The ions produced are:
\[Na^{+}+\mathrm {S^{2}O_{3}^{2-}+CrO_{4}^{2-}\rightarrow } \]
\[\quad Na^{++}[SO_{3}]^{-}+Cr^{3+}.\]

Then, the final ionic equation of this reaction can be represented as:

\[\mathrm {Na_{2}S^{2}O_{3}+HCl(aq)+K_{2}CrO_{4}\rightarrow Na^{+}(aq)+Cl^{-}(aq)+SO_{3}^{2-}(aq)+Cr^{3+}(aq)+K_{2}SO_{4}(s)+SCN_{2}^{-}(aq)} \]

The molarity of sodium thiosulfate can be calculated by using the following formula:

\[M=V\cdot \mathrm {Molecular\ weight\ of\ compound} \]

Using the molarity equation above, and solving for V, we get that:

\[67mL\cdot {\frac {23}{39}}\]
\[\quad =54.13mL.\]
