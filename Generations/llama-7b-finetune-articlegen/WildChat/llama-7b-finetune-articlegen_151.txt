This is a response to the task 'Generative AI: Imagine Prompts' by [@makitok](https://twitter.com/makitok). You can see their original prompts [here](https://twitter.com/makitok/status/1638152094037861381), and you can view the submissions on the AI by clicking here [here](https://midjournery.herokuapp.com/) and entering your prompt in the box below the image. You should follow the directions laid out in their prompts to create a prompt for each of the four concepts they provided: - A star with flowers, metallic, colorful, hexa-gon [2] - A detailed description of [1] with specific imagery details [3] - A detailed description of the scene's environment [4] - A detailed description of the composition [5] - A detailed description of the scene's moood, feelings, and atmosphere [6] - A style (e.g., photographys, painting, illustration, sculpture, artwork, paper-works, 3D, etc) for [1]. [7] You can see my example prompt here: /image prompt: a captivaing Halo Reach landscape with a Spartan amidst a battlefield, fallen enemies around, smoke and fire in the background, emphasizing the Spartans determination and brave-ry, detailed environment blending chaos and beauty, illustration, digital art --ar 16:9 --v 5
                            
                            
                            The AI will create an image using these prompts. I highly encourage you to take a look at what it creates so that you can better understand what is expected from this assignment and so that you can give constructive feedback on the submissions! You should also view [these instructions](https://midjournery.herokuapp.com/help) if you have any questions or concerns about how to use the AI, and feel free to reach out to me on Discord @Raymond#1004 if you need additional guidance.
                            You will be graded using a point system. To earn full points, your prompts must adhere to the format of "image prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [ar] [v]" and each submission must include four separate prompts, one for each concept (for a total of 40 points). You can earn partial credit if some parts of your prompt structure do not match this format. For example, you will receive 1 point per line missing from the prompt structure (e.g., "image promt: [1], [2]...") as well as 1 point for each concept missing from your four prompts. If all of your points are deducted because of errors in format, then I encourage you to redo this assignment and submit a new one. You can earn partial credit for prompt style if the image generated is not visually appealing or does not accurately represent the concept (for a total of 20 points).
                            The submission with the highest overall score will receive two credits, the second highest submission will receive one credit, and all other submissions will earn no credit.
