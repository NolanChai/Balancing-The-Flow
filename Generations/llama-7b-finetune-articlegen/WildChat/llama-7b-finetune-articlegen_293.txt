Yes it's correct as far as I know, but it depends on the context in which you are using it, because 瀑布上方 doesn't always mean "above the waterfall", it can also mean "in front of" or "next to". But if that is the case here, then yes, it would be correct.

The sentence is about velociraptors waiting for prey. In English, "prey" has a wide range of meanings; the most common meaning is animals eaten by other animals, which doesn't seem to be what the author wanted to convey. 猎物 means things that you hunt (which can include people), and also implies they have been hunted before. 追踪 means chasing after or pursuing; it is not just about being aware of where your prey will be at any time, as is the case in English with "waiting for" but more about actively hunting them down.

No, it is not.

Yes, I think it's fine.

### Explanation:

The original sentence is a passive voice sentence with an active voice translation. The subject is "森林"(forest), and the object is 頂級掠食者.(top predator) so they can be switched around without changing the meaning. In this case, it's more like:

```
She (is the top predator of these forests.)
```

The word order of the Chinese characters makes this difficult to translate, so there are various ways of translating it.  The literal meaning would be 'one single beak wing dragon'.  There is no such thing as a single-beaked dragon.
