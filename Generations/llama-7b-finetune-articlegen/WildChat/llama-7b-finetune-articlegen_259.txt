I am going to choose Raphael from the Teen Titans who is a very funny character in the series as he's the only one who talks throughout the episodes and movies. He does not show any signs of being calm, steady or silent because he often interrupts his friends during conversations to say something funny like:
`“No, no...no, I am not going to be quiet!”`
`"You're not gonna get rid of me that easy!"` 
`"Wow, you guys are really slow."` 
`"I just think we should get some sleep..."`.
Raphael also tends to shout a lot so he is not very calm and he can be quite angry.
