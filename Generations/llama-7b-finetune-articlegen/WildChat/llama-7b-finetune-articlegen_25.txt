[player]: "Alright, let me have a look at your belly."

(I examined her belly.)
Minny (in pain) "No! Wait! I don't want you to see him..."

[player]: "Okay…"

### Response:
Minndy (in pain) "He's a baby. And he's going to be strong...very strong."

(I noticed that the girl was very nervous, and she had an unusual expression on her face.)

[player]: "Everything okay?"

### Response:
Minny (in pain): "He is strong...stronger than even I can imagine. His power would surpass that of a Royal Red."

(I noticed the girl's eyes were glittering, and she seemed like she was in a trance.)

[player]: "Huh?! What happened?"

### Response:
Minny (in pain): "It's him...my son...he's coming out!"

(I noticed how the girl's stomach began to grow, and a small red sphere appeared from it. It looked like it was going to explode.)

[player]: "Damn, his power is even greater than I thought."

### Response:
Minny (in pain): "Huh? What's that sound…"

(The girl's body began to tremble as the sphere inside her stomach grew bigger and bigger.)

[player]: "Here! This is what you need!"
(I took out a bottle of medicine from my base, and handed it over to the girl.)

Minny (in pain): "Oh...thank you…" (painfully) "...hmmph?" (gasping in pain) "AHHH!!! HELP ME!!!" (giggling in pain)

[player]: "Relax. It's going to be alright."
Minny: "...what do you mean...relax…? I feel like my baby is about to come out of me..."
(I saw the sphere slowly shrink, and fall out of her body.)

### Response:
[player]: "Yes. That's what a childbirth feels like." (patting her back) "...are you okay now?"

Minny: "Heh...well, I guess this is normal for all mother to go through." (blushing) "(I mean, my son just came out of me..."
(The girl smiled and patted her belly.)

[player]: "Wow! He's so cute!"
Minny: "Oh...yes he is...he's my pride and joy...my little..." (blushing) "...I named him Astro." (giggling)

### Response:
Minny: "(Haha!) He can't be helped, since his name came out of my mouth!"
[player]: "Hehe! I see!"
(We both laughed.)

Minny: "Anyway...I guess you need to take him. I don't want to see my son suffer because he lacks strength." (giggling) "You should take good care of him..."

[player]: "...really?"

Minny: "Yes! He is going to be the strongest of all!" (laughs in joy) "(I can't wait for you two to meet each other. It will be fun!)
(The girl handed over Astro, who was covered with his mother's blood and placenta.)
Astro: "Huh?! Who are you?"
Minny (in pain): "Oh...my child!" (giggles) "(It's been 30 months since I gave birth to you..."
(The girl looked at Astro, and smiled as she spoke to him.)
Astro: "What is it mother? Are we going back to the surface?"
Minny: "Of course! You're my son after all." (smiling) "(But before that, I need you to meet someone first. It will be fun for both of us.)"
(She handed over Astro to me.)
Astro: "...who is it...?"
