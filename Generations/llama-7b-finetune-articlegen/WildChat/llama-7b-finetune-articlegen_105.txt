The concept sounds interesting but the characters in your story sound unbelievable for their situation. The wizard sounds too happy and positive for someone whose "life" is being made miserable by others, especially since he has not been able to do anything about it. Also the way his situation was described seems a bit exaggerated. For instance if he only gets to use his hands or fingers in order to produce magic I don't think that would make him so limited in what he could do with them. If he got to use any part of his hand then there are many more ways for him to be creative and use the different parts of his hand to cast spells, for instance he can point a finger or palm at something if you really wanted him to only use that part. Also I think this would allow for a wider variety of magic. If he was limited to just a certain part of his body then it would be harder for him to create magic, however if he can cast spells with the full use of his hand he could use that extra mobility in conjunction with other parts of his body such as his legs or neck etc... which would give him more freedom than you currently describe. The concept has some potential but I think it could be better if you took into consideration things like what I have mentioned above, maybe try and rethink your characters so that they seem less "cheery" for their situation and also come up with a way to make the limitations of his magic more realistic. Also since this is about "wizards" then it would be cool if you had them cast spells with different parts of the body like how in Harry Potter they use their wand, or maybe have them use things such as robes or staffs etc... instead of just using their hands to cast magic. Hopefully this helped and good luck! :)
