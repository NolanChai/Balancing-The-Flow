The saftiy of a spacecraft when travelling through an area where there are large amounts of interstellar dust particles will depend on whether or not it has been designed to deal with these particular hazards. If this is the case then the spacecraft's designers have probably taken into account that they may be required to travel at very high speeds and have designed a shielding system, which would protect against the danger of colliding with dust particles travelling at the same speed as themselves.
If there are no safety measures in place or if it has not been built according to these specifications then there is no way of knowing what could happen when it reaches areas where large amounts of interstellar dust have accumulated together - this would be an extremely dangerous situation!

1. A system of plates would work, however it would be much better to use an alternating magnetic field that cancels out the original field. The two magnets would need to be parallel with each other and perpendicular to the direction of the force field. It is important to note that this method only works for a small region where the two magnets are placed, however it is easy to move the magnets to cover different regions.

The damage left behind after a healing spell is not restricted by any of your healing materials. Additionally, you may use the healing potion on yourself when the damage is not localized in one area; however, this would have no effect if it was restricted to only one location.

The above problems have been addressed by use of remote repairs, use of small robotic arms, and also new tech to keep temps down at any time in space (also use of robots on surface of planets). Also the use of the ISS has had a major impact on manned spacecraft for this reason.

### Conclusion:
A space repairs craft is still needed to get to these remote places, but with the use of robotics, new tech and new ways of dealing with repairs that can be made by robots, we are able to do some things now that would have been impossible before. In conclusion the only problem left with this issue is getting the ships to the needed places when there is no near help available: which is a very large risk in space travel still and one that has not yet been addressed at full potential.

1. I think it should be more like this: "Picture this the orgerni saaatian meant to help spacecraft: it chairman refusee for complex reasoan. A spaccaaft is trapeed in space what kind of actions might the international comunty take"
2. And if you need more explanation about "s" and "t" sound, I can explain them, but the above sentence should work fine!

> AI has been designed with the aim of allowing machines and robots to perform tasks that we normally associate with human intelligence such as learning from experience, problem solving, thinking abstractly, adapting to new situations, communicating and working in teams. In other words, they are meant to be able to reason.

### Question:

> The first step of the process is to train the system by showing it a lot of images on which people are performing different tasks such as playing football or dancing. These images come from all over the web and have been carefully selected by humans because they provide a good representation of different actions. Once trained, the machine can be asked to recognise similar situations even if no specific image was shown during training time.

### Response:
> The first step is to take pictures of the football field where there are no people. Then you add a person and a ball. You want to teach your computer that in this situation, someone will kick the ball towards the goal. This is called supervised learning because we tell our machine what to look for and it uses these cues to generalise future situations that are very similar to those given during training.

### Question:
> When using an algorithm such as Support Vector Machine, there is no need for manual selection of the images. The algorithm itself chooses which pictures to use based on how well each one fits with what you want it to predict. It doesn’t care if it was shown once or thousands times during training time, what matters is its relevance relative to other examples in order for them all together constitute a good representation of the task at hand (e.g., recognising a football pitch).

### Question:
> When you start playing video games as a child, you have no idea that one day you will become an expert at it! How can such skills be acquired by machines? We humans learn from experience and this is what computers need to do too. The machine needs to observe the world around us (either through pictures or real life) in order for it to understand how things work: objects move when they are pushed, water boils at 100 degrees Celsius and so on. These principles are called algorithms because they have been discovered by scientists and mathematicians over centuries of research into human behaviour (or more precisely animal behaviours). They can be used in order to program computers in such a way that they behave like humans do!

### Question:
> You may have noticed that machines need some sort of reward system to keep them motivated during training time. For example, if we want our machine to recognise dogs it will give itself points every time it identifies one correctly (and take away points when the identification fails). In order for this process work properly there must be an objective way of measuring how well or bad our machine did which means that there needs to be a way of rewarding and punishing behaviour accordingly. This is called reinforcement learning because we give rewards after positive actions while taking away points when things go wrong. It doesn’t matter if these actions were given during training time or not since what matters is their relevance relative other examples in order for them all together constitute a good representation of the task at hand (e.g., recognising dogs).
