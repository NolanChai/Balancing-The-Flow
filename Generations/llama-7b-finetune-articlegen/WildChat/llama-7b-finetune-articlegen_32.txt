### Description:
The first step in the process would be to get a GPS and have it ready for when you go on your date. I have provided a picture of an example of how you would set up your GPS before your date. The second part is that you will need to make sure your clothes match your location. I would suggest wearing a pair of jeans with a dress shirt and a tie so you are looking clean cut. This is important because if you look disheveled then she may not take the date as serious as she might if you were clean cut. The next step that you need to do before your date is go on a walk around the neighborhood so you know where all the different stores and landmarks are located in case there is an emergency that you have to leave and find help with. The final thing that you should do is to make sure you have enough money set aside for gas because it might cost you $50 or more just to drive back home depending on how far away from the location your girlfriend lives.
