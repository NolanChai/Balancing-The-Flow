I do not agree with this assessment, but it is my duty to remain silent, for I know how much suffering would fall on my people if they found out that their queen was injured. The rebels who attack us are uncivilised brutes, and we have no choice but to fight them with every weapon at our disposal. We must stand firm in the face of danger, because if we do not, then all hope will be lost. We cannot give up on our queen, for she is the last true ruler of Belpaesa. If we lose her, then there is no one else who can lead us into battle and defend our people from these scum-sucking animals. So let us remain strong, loyal subjects, and together we will win this war!
