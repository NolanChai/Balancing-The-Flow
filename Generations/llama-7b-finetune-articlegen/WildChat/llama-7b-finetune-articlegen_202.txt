First off I think the best way to go about this situation would be to have each of the five people take turns in a rotation basis where they take one turn hosting the meeting then handing over the responsibility to another person and so on. This will ensure that everyone has an opportunity to host the meeting as well as give everyone enough time to adjust to different environment. I think it is very important to make sure everyone is comfortable because if not, people would be distracted which might lead to negative consequences such as misunderstanding or disagreement. I believe this rotation basis will help solve the problem of uncomfortability for each person.

When I have a meeting or group discussion with multiple people in attendance, my goal is always to be inclusive. In order to ensure this happens, it's important for me to have an open mind and actively listen to the people around me, no matter what their age, gender, ethnicity or experience level might be.

If I see someone who looks uncomfortable during our meeting, I will ask them if there is anything that needs improving so we can continue to work together more effectively as a group. I've also found it helpful for me not just to listen but speak up in situations where other people might be feeling overlooked or left out by the conversation taking place around us because I want everyone in attendance at our meeting (or discussion) to feel like they are contributing something valuable towards whatever topic we happen to be talking about!

It's important for me not only listen actively but also ask questions when needed so everyone gets an opportunity share their thoughts on anything being discussed during a particular time period because no one wants their voice drowned out by someone else's opinions without giving them first chance themselves. I always try my best ensure communication between people remains good throughout any meeting or group discussion because it helps create an environment where ideas flow freely and everyone feels comfortable enough share what they have to say without fear of being judged harshly!
