I am very sorry that the time wasn't suitable for me and my team. Could we meet up on Wednesday at 9:00 AM or Thursday at 10:00 PM? We also have a few other dates available in the week if you could let me know of any days and times which suit your schedule. Thank you, Olalere

Hi Neil,
Sorry if I'm a bit late on this. I had some family emergency which got in the way of my day today. I hope everything is OK with your family ?
I would love to meet up for another meeting so how about Monday? I was thinking we could talk about your progress since our last meeting and I could give you some feedback on what you've been doing right, wrong and where can you improve. It will be a good time for you to ask any questions if there are anything that you might still need clarification on or just share with me how things have been going on.
Also I want you to let me know what you thought of my feedback from last week.
Thanks, Walid

Hi Neil,

Unfortunately we're not in a position to move the meeting any further from the original date. However if you have no plans on that day we could always try and arrange another one for later this week? Let me know your thoughts...

Thanks,
Walid.

I think the error is that it's supposed to be "our" instead of "you're", so try: Partner not availible anymore to attend our meeting today, he asked me to reschedule. Email has been sent with other available slots.

Please confirm that you can make the following dates in early March. 23rd, 24th, or 30th are all possible days. There will be a $50 fee associated with each practice day you attend and this needs to be paid before March 1st. We are limited in our capacity to take on more players so if we have too many sign-ups we may need to cut some people from the event.
