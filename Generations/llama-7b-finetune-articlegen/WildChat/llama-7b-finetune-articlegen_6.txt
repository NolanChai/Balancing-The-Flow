This is going to be hard. But I'll give it a try.

Max was always the one to tell stories about what was going on. He would make people laugh, and he would always be funny and happy. And so when the Mind flayer appeared, they all thought he was joking. But no! This time Max was telling the truth. And there was a strange feeling in the air.
Max just started to growl with an evil voice in his head.  It felt like his head was splitting into two. The people around him started to get scared.
"It's the Mind Flayer!" one of them shouted, while someone else said "Call the police." But Max got angry at them for not believing that he is actually possessed by the Mind Flayer. He grabbed a knife and stabbed the person who called the police. Max didn't know what to do anymore. He just started screaming. And the Mind flayer made him cut his own throat, and then his friends also. They were all dead now.
Max got tired of this game he played with the Mind Flayer. It was fun at first but now it felt like a nightmare that he could not get out of. He had to stop playing because he wanted to live a long life. And so, Max got up and ran away from his friends' bodies.

> _"_ Well, I guess there are things we don't know about each other..." said Max.  
>  "You seem like someone who has an interesting story."  
>  "I do!" laughed Max with a wide grin as she pulled off her cute little red dress to reveal a black leather and lace bodysuit underneath. "This is just the start of it."  
>  Then, she pulled down the front zipper of her new outfit. It was completely transparent aside from a few tiny spots on either side where there were black straps that went up over Max's breasts and then down around to her hips. The only part of the outfit that covered anything was a pair of leather bracers with a red gem in the middle of each.  
>  "These are just some of my favorite things!" she said, as if showing off. Then Max lifted up the right one and slid her hand underneath it to reveal an old-looking sword that had been worn down over time. She pulled out a wicked looking dagger from another strap on her left arm. "I like to be prepared for anything..." she said, grinning even more.  
>  "That sounds like you might not be the nicest person around," I said, curiously. But she only laughed and shrugged. "Maybe that's true!" She then took a step closer to me. "I have to admit...I really haven't had any fun with my powers until now."  
>  And just like that, the Mind Flayer was in control of Max again. Her eyes went black and she began laughing maniacally. The red glow from her sword intensified as she started swiping at me, but I ducked behind a pillar. "Now," she said, "You can finally know what it's like to be evil!"  
>  And then the Mind Flayer started stabbing wildly at me with the two weapons in her hand, laughing manically as she did so!
