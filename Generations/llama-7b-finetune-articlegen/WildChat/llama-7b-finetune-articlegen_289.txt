Dear Iceman,
I like your idea! But it sounds as if you have trouble expressing yourself in English. Please try to learn more English words that can express your feelings better, because they can make the story more interesting for the readers and also easier for them to understand what is going on in this story. For example:
- Instead of "Freedom planet Girls and Naruto are stranded on a desert island", you could say "Naruto and Freedom Planet Girls find themselves stranded on an uninhabited desert island" or "Freedom Planet Girls and Naruto have been shipwrecked..."
- Instead of "Lose memory" you could say "Forget his memories". Or use a synonym for lose, like forget. (The word "lose" can be used to mean "to fail to find", which is not the meaning you want here.)
- "Naruto x Freedom planet Harem." day 1: This sounds strange. Why would Naruto and Freedom Planet Girls have a romantic relationship, if they are only stranded together on an island? You might say "...Naruto and Freedom Planet Girls begin to become friends" or "...are becoming friends", instead of "Harem". If you mean that the girls start liking Naruto... well, we will wait until the story unfolds! ;-)
- I am sorry to have to point these things out. It is not my intention to criticize your writing skills, but to help you improve them. Maybe this could be a good chance for you to get in contact with some other people who are interested in creative writing and who can help you to get better at it! If you would like more advice, or if you have any questions about grammar, please feel free to ask me (in English, of course).
Best wishes. :)
