* Azure is a cloud computing platform from Microsoft that offers various services like storage, networking, analytics, etc.
* It supports a wide range of operating systems and can be deployed on-premises or in the cloud.
* It also provides an API for developers to create custom applications.
* Contoso can use Azure to deploy its application without worrying about infrastructure management or hosting costs.

1. Click the New button to create a new slide with an image.
2. The text box for this slide is on the left side of the screen. It will be the first slide of your presentation and contain the image you select in step #1.
3. Underneath the textbox, click the insert button that has a picture of a folder within a folder on it.
4. Choose your images.  You can change this to whatever size you want; just make sure they all fit in the frame you've made for them. The recommended image width is about 8 inches or so wide and 5 inches tall, which should look fine in PowerPoint.
5. Once you have selected your image, click on the place button at the bottom of the window (with two arrows pointing to the right) and it will be inserted into your slide.
6. Now, click the design tab again and change the text box from a title (which would look like 'Slide 1' in this case) to whatever you want it to say. Just type that information into the textbox at the top of the window.
7. Click on the font size button (it is located near the alignment arrow at the right side of your slide). This will make sure that all fonts within PowerPoint are uniform, so that if you ever change them, they won't appear different across all slides in your presentation!
8. Choose any other features you would like to add before clicking OK on this box and saving/printing out your work.
9. In step #2 (in the instruction above), slide 1 should now be what is displayed in PowerPoint, with an image in it that looks like what yours does! :)
