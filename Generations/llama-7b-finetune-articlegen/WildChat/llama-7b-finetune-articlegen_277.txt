Dear Parent(s),
Thank you for your letter! I’m glad that my child is doing well at school. And I hope she will enjoy Halloween party as much as other PN kids do.

I also appreciate the teachers’ effort and enthusiasm in teaching. It is indeed heartwarming to witness their enthusiasm for educating our children. The lessons are always fun, exciting and memorable. In addition, I am thrilled that my child has grown and developed in leaps and bounds since joining PN. Their commitment towards providing a diverse and multi-cultural environment is admirable.

I agree with you that the International Food Week was an educational and fun experience for children. They were able to taste, learn about different cuisines from around the world, and make friends with kids of various backgrounds. This has helped instill a sense of understanding and acceptance in our little ones.
The song "Happy birthday" is very helpful when it comes to celebrating special events. Children should be familiar with these songs before they enter primary schools.
I am thrilled that my child was able to perform on stage as well. They are eager to learn new things and have been making great progress in their academics, which makes me proud of them!
Thank you for all the hard work and dedication you put into educating our children. We look forward to continuing this journey with you and seeing what exciting things lie ahead.

Hello Panda Parent, this week has been an eventful week. The PN ba bies have continued to learn about family members and have also started learning about Bir thday s a nd how t o celebrate them. We have been practicing singing the birth day song and we made birth day crown s to use during our Friday bir thday party dramati c role play. The PN students have been very excited with the arrival of fall and have en joyed all the fallactivi ties we have planned for them. They also did really well with recognizing number 1 and 2. The little pandas are also huge fans of jumping, climb ing a d riding bike s! Their gross motor skills and stre ngths continue to improve.
