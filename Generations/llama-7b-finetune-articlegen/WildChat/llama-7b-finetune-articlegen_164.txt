I'm not a programmer, but I do have one for you to try. This is a .NET application that has a form with 3 buttons: one labeled "start" and the others labeled "1", "2", or "3". Clicking "start" starts the timer with its respective label. When each button's time elapses, it turns green (i.e. the user can click again). If there is a timer left running when you close the form, it will still count down after closing and the timer's text will turn red, indicating that your computer has been turned off. I know that this doesn't really have anything to do with keys...

Please, write something else besides the keys. You can take a look at my [Microsof Office 2016 Professional Plus Product Key](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47579728/microsoft-office-professional-plus-product-key). I hope it'll help you. Good luck!
