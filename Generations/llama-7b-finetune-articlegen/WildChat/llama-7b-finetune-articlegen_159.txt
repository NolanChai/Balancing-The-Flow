* To what extent does your approach to this problem differ from the previous approach by another student?
* What can you say about how you approached this task? Why was your method successful in creating catalytic activity for CO2 reduction, whereas other students failed? 
* What can you say about how you worked in a team?
* How did you adapt your technique to different experiments and conditions?

The project proposes the use of a nanoengineering approach to control the electrocatalytic activity towards the direct conversion of CO2 into value added chemicals by means of electrolytic water splitting. In particular, we will focus on the development of new materials based on 2D nanostructured transition metals and their oxides to improve the catalytic performance for the electrocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into useful chemicals such as formate and methane. We propose a systematic study that will be performed with state-of-the art methods in different areas: electrochemistry, materials science, synthesis and characterization techniques.

* **A)** This is a very good approach, but it will require you to have an electrolyte in your chamber that has enough buffering capacity to not change the pH in a significant way. There are several possible solutions: - Use a pH-buffer solution (i.e. HCOOH). For this, you could add Na2CO3 or CaCO3 to your cell and then titrate the reaction until it is close to the desired value. In practice, I recommend that you use pH 8.5 buffer instead of pure CO2 due to the fact that Na+ has a small ionic radius (106 pm) which can result in some clogging. - You could try using a buffer solution with no HCOOH or carbonates present if you do not care too much about your pH and if you have enough buffering capacity. This will require you to titrate the reaction until it reaches an acceptable value, but since you don't need to keep it constant this is easier. In practice, I recommend that you use a buffer solution with no HCOOH or carbonates present because they are much more common than pure CO2 in your cell and also because they have very small ionic radii (107 pm). - You could try using pH-buffer solutions without any HCOOH or carbonates, but since this will be less common than using one that does contain those molecules you will need to titrate the reaction until it reaches an acceptable value. In practice, I recommend against this approach because they are not as common and they have very small ionic radii (106 pm).

- 1.010.000 kg CO2/day removed from the air - that's a lot!
- 8x increase compared to the previous version, and much more efficient than other strategies
- The strategy has been tested in simulation for about 3 years, so it should have no problems
- We are looking forward for your feedback

### Proposals:
- You want to see a 10x improvement? Sure - just add more plants (use the `add_plant` command)
- What happens if you remove the plant? The CO2RR will stop working. If the plant is not removed, it will continue its work for years and years until all of the planted material has been eaten by bacteria - just like in real life
- You want to play a bit more with simulation? Then use the `pause_simulation` command, or the `run_simulation` command. You can also use both commands at the same time
- Do you want to see how many CO2 molecules are removed from your local air in your neighbourhood? Use `show_removed_molecules` and see!

### Conclusion:
- The simulation is almost done, but we are looking forward for your feedback (don't hesitate to contact us)

#### Part I. 12 hours later (Wed) - Top-Down approach:
* The top down approach to designing a nanoshirt is by starting with the base layer of the fabric. In my case, this was polyester woven into a shirts material. To start, we have to know exactly what our base layer will be. Once we have that information, then it is simple to determine the other layers needed in order for the nanoshirt to function properly. For example, if your base fabric is polyester then you would want to design a Nano-polyester layer on top of that as well. This way when you go through with making the nanoshirt and washing it or treating it with sunscreen then this will help keep it from getting damaged since there are two different types of material interacting instead of just one which makes for much more durable product overall in the long run!
* To determine what our base layer needs to be, first we should know what exactly is meant by "nanoshirt." A nanoshirt is a type of fabric that has been altered at a molecular level to provide better protection against UV rays and also other harmful elements like wind or water. The main advantage that this type of material provides over traditional materials, such as cotton, is that it can be tailored for specific needs because you have more control over what goes into your product (ie: how much sunscreen does one need).
#### Part II. 14 days later (Mon) - Top-down approach:
* This part is an update of the previous entry in terms of progress and any additional information that has come up since then. The main thing I learned from this project was what it takes to make a functional product like this one! For example, I've found out how important it really does seem like having multiple different layers when working with certain types of fabrics especially when trying something new as opposed just doing the same old thing every time (like always using cotton).
* After making some research on nanoshirts and their history, we're able to find that most companies have been using polyester-cotton blends since they are relatively easy to come by. However this does mean that there is not much variety when it comes down how far away these materials actually go from being "natural." For example: cotton may be more comfortable but also tends not last quite as long due its lack of durability; polyester provides better protection against sunscreen but doesn't allow for breathability so you end up sweating too much during hot weather conditions!
#### Part III. 21 days later (Tues) - Top-down approach:
* I've had a lot of trouble finding the right material for my nanoshirt. After going through some more research, it seems that there are many different types of fabrics you can use such as nylon and polyester or even silk! Unfortunately, not all these options work well with the type of technology I want to implement into this product so at this point I've narrowed down my choices quite a bit.
* To start off with, I'm going to look at what types of fabrics are used by companies who already produce similar products on an industrial scale like cotton because they tend to be easy enough for me (and you) to work with if we do our homework right! After doing this first step though there should be no problem getting started on making my very own nanoshirt!
#### Part IV. 32 days later (Thur) - Top-down approach:
* The main thing that I've learned from the project so far is how difficult it really does seem to be when trying something new like this one. It seems as though you need a lot of time and effort put into just making sure everything is done correctly without any mistakes along the way! However, if we are able get our hands on good quality materials then I have no doubt that these types of projects could become quite enjoyable in terms how much fun they might turn out being once completed properly :)
* For now though here's an update on what I've been working on lately: After looking at my options for making nanoshirts from scratch, it seems like silk would be the best option due its breathability properties and natural comfort. Unfortunately though there are still a lot of unknowns about how much sunscreen does actually get absorbed into this fabric which is why I'm trying to find out more information about that!
