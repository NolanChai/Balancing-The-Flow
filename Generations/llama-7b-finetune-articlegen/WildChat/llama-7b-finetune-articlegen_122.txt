I like this. I like this because of how simple it is. There is no story here, just a few clever shots that add up to something much bigger than they seem. The use of motion control adds an element of mystery and intrigue and the shape is really nicely done. The lack of story means that I can't remember anything about this campaign but the thing that remains with me is the shape - I know exactly what it looks like, despite having not seen it for almost 10 years! It's a simple concept executed well.

The original idea was to write something along the lines of:

"A dark room. The only light coming in from a blue light and the TV static. A faint light can be seen on one of the screens, showing one of the new ident's namely "PyLons". After this, the lights dim and fade out, with nothing but blackness."

I think it would be better to describe it as: 
"A dark room, with only a blue light illuminating the room. The TV static is faintly heard, but no sound can be seen on the TVs. A faint blue light from one of them can be seen, showing a still frame from one of the new ident's, namely "PyLons"."
