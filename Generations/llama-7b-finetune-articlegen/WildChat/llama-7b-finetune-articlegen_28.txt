The article "China's new military budget is a warning to Taiwan" by Tom Phillips (theguardian.com) makes the argument that China's 10% increase in defence spending, from $54 billion to $62 billion, signals China’s desire for continued growth in its military. He supports his claim with data, stating: “China is now reportedly set to overtake the US as the world’s biggest arms exporter by 2017”. Phillips also cites a Chinese defence ministry official who states that China’s growing military strength is not aimed at other countries but rather is for self-defence and maintaining peace. In my opinion, I believe Tom Phillips made the correct argument in his article, as he makes an excellent point that although China wants to be a peaceful nation, it will have to continue its growth in defence spending because of the increasing tension between itself and Taiwan.
