This is a good script for beginning hypnotists as it is basic in nature. It is also useful to see how a bare foot induction can work because it shows that you don't need an elaborate setup to hypnotize someone, and this may be reassuring if you are worried about not being able to induce trance properly. Also, the fact that David obeys Nadine’s commands without resistance shows how easy hypnosis is for most people and can help eliminate any concerns over having your subject resist you. The scene also shows how much fun can be had with hypnotism and this may encourage new people to experiment on their own or attend a local class (if they have not already). 

### Reason:
-	It’s basic in nature, and shows that anyone who knows about hypnosis can induce it. This is good for people who want to start practicing with friends without having to learn too much. -	It shows how fun hypnotism can be and might encourage a person to attend classes or experiment further. 
-	It demonstrates the ease of hypnosis. -	It’s easy, so it will appeal more to beginners and people who want to use it recreationally rather than professionally.
