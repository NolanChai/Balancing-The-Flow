1. Include your company name in the subject line so it’s clear you are a business and not just another person sending an email.
2. Use the recipient's name (it might be nice to address them by their title as well).
3. Explain how you found their information or why you chose this recipient. If they were referred, include that referral in your opening. You can also mention how long ago you followed up and why it took so long for you to get a response (if applicable). 
4. Mention something from the person's LinkedIn profile/webpage/etc. to show you’ve done some research on them before reaching out. This shows that you’re not just looking for an opportunity, but rather someone who can help further your career!  
5. Say why this is a great time to connect—whether there's a project coming up where they may need additional resources or if it’s just general networking opportunities that might arise down the road! 
6. If there's an opportunity available now (and again, make sure it's something you wouldn't normally see on their site), ask for them to apply within two weeks so you have time to review applications before closing the window of opportunity. You can also say that if they don't end up applying immediately but would still like more information about future openings at this company, please let them know where to go (this is an excellent way to build rapport). 
7. If you’re not currently working with the recipient and haven’t met before, mention how nice it was meeting them and why they should keep in touch—either through social media or email if necessary!  
8. If there's no opportunity available now but it may be later down the road when something does come up again (or even if another company contacts them), ask for a follow-up within two weeks so that you have time to review applications before closing the window of opportunity! 
9. Say how much you enjoyed talking with them and thank them for their time; let them know it was nice meeting/talking with them, too (if applicable). You can also mention what a great person they are or why it’s good that you got to meet them—either way, this is an excellent opportunity to build rapport!  
10. Ask if there's anything else you can help them with in the future (like offering advice or information about another company) so you can continue supporting each other moving forward! 
11. Offer your assistance going forward—this might be something specific like connecting them with a friend who works at their dream company, helping out when they need extra resources for an upcoming project, etc., but it also could just mean being there as a support system if needed (for example, reaching out after seeing how hard someone has been working). 
12. If you haven't met in person or spoken before, thank them again and let them know that while the opportunity may not be right now, this was an excellent meeting/conversation so please keep in touch!
