1. Story: I was having lunch at the cafeteria when a girl came in and sat down at the table across from me. She looked like an ordinary college student, but something about her seemed familiar. It wasn't until she started talking that I realized who it was-the famous singer Tallia Mar! I couldn't believe my luck! She was doing the 'Try Not To Laugh Challenge' with water while laughing and fartering. It was hilarious! I laughed so hard that I almost wet myself. What a great way to spend my lunch break!
