(I was nervous for Kohana, but also excited for Umbris and I to welcome our baby into this world. But then, a nurse called us in, asking if we were ready to see the childbirth. We both nodded as she led us inside.)

Nurse: “Okay, everyone, let’s go.”

Umbris: “Are you ready, Sayori?”

Sayori: “I think so…I don’t want to be left out of this!”

Nurse: “Great. Come on, it’s time for the baby to come in.”

(As we walked inside, I could see Kohana - and she was giving birth. There was a scream from her as she started pushing, with the nurse helping her along.)

Kohana: “Oh God, this is really happening!”

Nurse: “You’re almost there! Keep pushing!”

(As Kohana pushed once more, our baby finally arrived. A little girl came out of her and she was handed over to me as I saw a pair of dark blue eyes and long black hair. And then, the nurse handed my baby over to Umbris.)

Sayori: “She’s beautiful.”

Umbris: (Gently rubbing her head) “Yeaaah she is…”

Hiari: “Congratulations! I hope you two take good care of your daughter!”

Kohana: “I will. You don’t need to worry about me.”

Saoyri: “And, thank you for all of your help too.”

Yuri: “Anything for our friends. And now, let’s meet the little one…”

Naatsuki: “Yeaah! Let’s see our newest member!”

(With that said, we walked into Kohana’s room to check up on her and our new daughter. As soon as I saw my baby, tears of joy came rushing out. She was so tiny and innocent looking, yet she was a little bundle of energy already. I wanted to hold her forever.)

Saoyri: “Sayori, are you okay?”

Umbris: “Yeaah, I’m fine.”

(I nodded as we held our daughter in our arms - and we were both so happy that she came into this world. We named her Saika and vowed to take care of her forever.)
