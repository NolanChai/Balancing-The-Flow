In an exothermic reaction, for a balanced chemical equation, there is no mass gained or lost by any atom. Therefore, to get this question correct, you must identify which atom was the limiting reactant and account for all of its change in mass. Because you know that the balanced equation requires 2 moles (grams) of Hydrogen per mole of Oxygen gas, and there are two oxygens per Hydrogen, there are four times as many atoms of oxygen present in each reaction. Therefore, if water is produced from a 32 gram sample of hydrogen gas reacting with an 8-gram sample of oxygen gas, then the same reaction would form 160 grams of water from 128 grams of hydrogen gas and 256 grams of oxygen gas.
