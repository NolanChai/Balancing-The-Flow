It took 36 minutes for the first email to arrive in my inbox. The sender was a friend who had recently moved to a new city and wanted to let me know how things were going so far. In that time, I was able to get some work done around the house and catch up on some reading. When the email finally did arrive, I was excited to hear about my friend's new life and glad to be able to check in with them.
