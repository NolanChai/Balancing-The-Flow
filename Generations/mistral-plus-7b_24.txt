The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued new guidelines for the labeling of honey in order to prevent misleading claims and deceptive advertising. Under these guidelines, honey must meet certain standards in order to be labeled as such. Specifically, it must contain at least 90% natural sugar derived from the nectar of flowers. It also cannot have any artificial sweeteners or additives. In addition, the labeling must clearly state that the product is made with honey. The FDA hopes that these guidelines will help consumers make informed choices about their food and prevent them from being misled by false advertising.
