 m, her parents, and two siblings entered North Korea for what is believed to be the first time by a South Korean family in over six decades.

The group arrived in North Korea on Thursday after spending months applying for permission from both governments, as well as undergoing extensive security checks and screenings.

As they stepped off the plane in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, they were met by a large crowd of cheering fans and government officials. Dami, who won The X Factor Australia in 2013, is known for her powerful voice and emotional performances, and her family's journey has sparked interest around the world.

While the North Korean government has strict controls on foreign travel, it has been working to improve relations with South Korea in recent years, including allowing more South Koreans to visit the country. However, the North Korean border remains one of the most heavily guarded and restricted in the world, with few exceptions.

It is not clear what Dami and her family will be doing while in North Korea, but it is believed they will be performing at a music festival and meeting with government officials to discuss cultural exchange programs.

The footage of their arrival was posted on social media by several news outlets, and has received mixed reactions from viewers. Some are praising the group for their bravery and determination in crossing the border, while others are critical of the North Korean government for allowing such a high-profile South Korean family to enter the country.

Regardless of the reaction, Dami's journey is sure to be remembered as one of the most remarkable and historic moments in the history of North Korea and South Korea relations.
