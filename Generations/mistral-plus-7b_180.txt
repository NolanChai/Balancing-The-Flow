Uruguay became the first country in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage on Tuesday, when its Senate passed legislation that allows gay and lesbian couples to marry and adopt children. The 16-to-13 vote followed a heated debate in the chamber, with opponents arguing that it would threaten traditional family values and that children should be raised by a father and mother. But same-sex marriage advocates have pointed out that gay and lesbian couples already raise children in Uruguay, and have called for them to receive the legal protections that are granted to heterosexual parents. President Jose Mujica is expected to sign the legislation into law soon, making Uruguay the 13th country worldwide to allow same-sex marriage.
