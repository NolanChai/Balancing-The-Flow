Temperatures are set to nudge a record-breaking 21C from the start of next week as Britain braces itself for an autumnal heatwave.

The Met Office is forecasting highs of 17C in parts of the UK on Monday and Tuesday, and upwards of 20C by Wednesday.

It could be the hottest day of the year so far - and will be well above the average for this time of year, which is just 9C.
