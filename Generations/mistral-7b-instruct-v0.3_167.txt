 It appears that you have provided a news headline about an event that occurred in 2009 at the Organization of American States (OAS) meeting in Honduras, where Latin American nations voted to revoke Cuba's suspension from the organization after nearly 50 years. This move represented a shift in policy towards Cuba among many countries in the region.

However, it is important to note that this change did not mean an automatic return of Cuba to full membership in the OAS. Instead, it opened the door for further discussions and negotiations regarding Cuba's eventual re-integration into the organization. The United States, along with several other countries, voted against the resolution, maintaining their longstanding policy towards Cuba.

Moreover, it is essential to understand that this event took place in 2009, not in the present day. If you have any questions about specific details or events related to this incident or its aftermath, I would be happy to help!
