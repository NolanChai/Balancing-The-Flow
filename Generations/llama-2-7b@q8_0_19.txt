The four men were identified as 29-year-old Michael Gonzales Jr., 18-year-old Andrew Johnson and two other suspects whose identities have not been released because they're juveniles.

The shooting happened about 7:50 p.m. Saturday in the 7400 block of Sweetwater Springs Boulevard, Austin County Sheriff Ken DeFoor said.

Two days later on Monday, the three teen suspects were taken into custody after a short pursuit that began near an address in Cleveland, Texas. The fourth suspect remains at large.

### Question:

Suspects are charged with murder and other offenses, DeFoor said. They face a capital murder charge because the victim is an emergency medical services provider, he added.

Authorities have not released information about whether the men knew the doctor or his family.
