 California officials have announced that they will not arbitrarily release 33,000 inmates as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court. Instead, they will submit plans to the federal courts in two weeks specifying ways to remedy prison overcrowding. The Supreme Court ruled on Monday that California's prisons are dangerously overcrowded and must be reduced by about 13,000 inmates. Officials have said that this would require major changes to the state's criminal justice system and could lead to longer sentences for some offenders.
