According to a recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), more than 200,000 children in U.S. schools were subjected to physical punishment, such as spanking or paddling, during the past school year. This form of discipline is not only harmful but also ineffective in addressing behavioral problems, the AAP says. The organization urges schools and educators to adopt alternative methods of discipline that are evidence-based and promote positive behavior.
