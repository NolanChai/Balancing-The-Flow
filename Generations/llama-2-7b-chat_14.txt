According to the police report, Rick Ross was driving his luxury vehicle at a high rate of speed when he suddenly heard multiple gunshots coming from somewhere on the road ahead. He quickly swerved to avoid the danger, but unfortunately, his actions were not quick enough. The impact of the collision caused significant damage to both the Rolls Royce and the apartment building, with several windows shattering and debris scattered everywhere. Luckily, no one was injured in the incident, but it's unclear how the rapper will explain this latest mishap to his fans.
