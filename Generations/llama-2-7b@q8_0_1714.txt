1) What is "the" Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria? There are at least two of them - ISIL/ISIS/Daesh (Islamic State) and al-Nusra Front (Jabhat al-Nusra). They are also different from the main al Qaeda organization.
2) "Now" means when? How did it get that status before this moment?
3) What does "best-equipped arm of the terror group in existence today" mean?
4) There is no mention about what this information came from - US intelligence agencies or private sector analysts. And there is no mention of who "directly familiar with the information" actually are, and their status within the organization(s).
5) I think it's important to make a distinction between ISIS (Islamic State) and al-Nusra Front - they are different organizations/terror groups. They have different goals and ideologies.
6) How do we know "best equipped arm" is better than the main Al Qaeda organization?
