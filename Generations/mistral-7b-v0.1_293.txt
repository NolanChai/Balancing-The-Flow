According to CNN's article "The Value Of College: It's Not What You Think" by David Matthews, the value of a college education is not just in terms of monetary compensation after graduation, but also in personal development and life experiences that come with it. The author argues that college offers more than just a degree; it provides students with opportunities to explore their interests, develop skills, and make connections that can last a lifetime.
