Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have been alive if they had opened the windows. The victims, two young children and their grandmother, were found dead in a caravan at a holiday park on the Dorset coast. They were believed to have been overcome by fumes of carbon monoxide gas which accumulated inside the caravan due to faulty heating equipment. Carbon monoxide is an odourless, colourless, poisonous gas produced by burning fuel. It is thought that this tragedy could have been prevented if the family had simply opened a window. A coroner said that a build-up of carbon monoxide in the caravan was caused by a faulty boiler and a blocked chimney. He added that it would not have taken long for the victims to become seriously ill from breathing in the poisonous gas, which is produced when fuel such as gas or coal does not burn properly. The coroner emphasised that opening windows can help to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning by allowing fresh air to circulate and reducing the risk of an accumulation of the gas inside a building. He urged holidaymakers staying in caravans or other small spaces to ensure that their accommodation is well ventilated at all times, even if it is cold outside.
