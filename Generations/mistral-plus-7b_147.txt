Warring parties in South Sudan have agreed to peace talks where a cessation of hostilities between President Salva Kiirâ€™s forces and supporters of former Vice President Riek Machar will top the agenda, the United Nations special representative to South Sudan told CNN on Tuesday. The agreement for the ceasefire was reached on Monday during talks in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, between representatives from the two sides. The ceasefire is expected to take effect at midnight on Thursday local time, according to a statement released by the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP) following the meetings. Both parties will withdraw their forces from key cities and towns within seven days of the agreement taking effect, and will also ensure the safety and freedom of movement for civilians and humanitarian workers, according to the AUHIP statement. The two sides are expected to meet again on Friday to discuss the implementation of the ceasefire.
