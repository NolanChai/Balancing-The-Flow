The cost of weddings has risen so much that people are going abroad. I think it is a good idea because they can have a good wedding ceremony, and still save money. Many couples donâ€™t want big weddings but they get pressurised by their families and friends to have them. So this way they can avoid the pressure and enjoy themselves. They also get to go on honeymoon at the same time.

I would prefer a small wedding with my family in attendance, followed by a party for all of our friends later on. I want to be able to spend more on my honeymoon than on the wedding itself!
