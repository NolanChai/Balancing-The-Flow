September is the best time of the year as it has the lowest levels of stress in comparison to August or December, according to a study by AXA PPP healthcare . 
The study also suggests that Monday's are the worst day for feeling stressed. 
Friday, Saturday and Sunday are the most relaxing days to be at home because of lower levels of stress and higher levels of happiness on these days .  
September is the least stressful month overall with an average happiness rating of 80 per cent compared with January's worst month which has a rate of just 67 per cent. 
The researchers claim that 'life events' such as moving house or getting married can cause stress, but being on holiday and spending time at the beach is what makes you happy . 
They also suggest that people should be aware of the activities they are doing on certain days in order to maintain their happiness levels.  
The study was carried out by analysing the online activity of more than 2,000 adults across the UK and found a significant difference between the happiest day - Tuesday (average rating 84 per cent) and the least happy day - Monday (71 per cent). 
It also suggested that the happiest time was at lunchtime on Thursday, while Wednesday is the most stressful time of the week.  
The study also found a significant difference between men and women with men tending to be more happy than women - an average 83 per cent compared with 76 per cent. 
A spokesperson for AXA PPP Healthcare, said: 'It's clear that people are feeling the pinch of living on a budget following recent tax rises and this has had a knock-on effect to their happiness ratings .  
'The findings show it is not just about where you live but also how much money you have . With so many of us struggling to keep up with bills, it is important that we all take time to focus on our own happiness.' 
She added: 'If a person does this then they can increase their likelihood of finding happiness in the long-term and make life feel less stressful .' 
The research also found that Monday was the most stressful day for men while Wednesday is the worst time for women.  
Overall, Tuesday at lunchtime was rated the best time by men and women.
