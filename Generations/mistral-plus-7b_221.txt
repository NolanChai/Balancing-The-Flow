The South Korean family of the 2013 X Factor Australia winner has completed the almost impossible task of crossing the restricted North Korean border. In tense footage, singer Dami Imâ€™s father Kim and uncle Sang-Ho were seen walking across the heavily guarded border on Monday after being granted permission by North Korea authorities.

The pair were then reunited with their family at a bus stop in South Korea, where they embraced and cried after their long separation. The two men had been detained in North Korea since 2016 when they entered the country without permission to visit relatives. They were eventually released in May this year as part of a deal between Australia and North Korea.

The crossing was made possible thanks to the efforts of the Australian government, which used its diplomatic channels with Pyongyang to negotiate their release. The two men have now returned home to South Korea, where they will be reunited with their families after almost three years apart.
