On a sunny and calm Sunday afternoon in early March, over 130 whale watchers were treated to an incredible sight as they cruised along Sydney Harbour. As they approached the area where the humpback whales are known to frequent, the passengers of the vessel began to spot what can only be described as a large pod of these majestic creatures. The whales were seen breaching and playing in the waters, performing various acrobatic feats that left the onlookers in awe.

The sight was truly magnificent, with the humpback whales making their way through the water in a steady stream. As they came closer to the vessel, everyone on board was able to see them up close and personal. It was an unforgettable experience for all who were lucky enough to witness this incredible display of nature.
