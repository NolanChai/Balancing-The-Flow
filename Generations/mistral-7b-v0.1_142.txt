The cheetah is known for its ability to sprint at high speeds. It can reach speeds over 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) when hunting. The cheetah is able to run so fast due to several adaptations it possesses. Some of these adaptations include a large heart, which pumps blood throughout the body quickly during exercise, and long legs, which provide more ground clearance than other big cats.
