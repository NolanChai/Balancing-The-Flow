The world's largest-selling brand of cigarette is under fire for allegedly targeting vulnerable young people through its marketing campaigns. According to a new report by anti-smoking charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), Marlboro, which is owned by Philip Morris International, has been accused of using glamorous models and appealing visuals to entice young people to smoke. The report also claims that the company has failed to comply with advertising regulations aimed at protecting children from tobacco marketing. In response to the allegations, a spokesperson for Philip Morris International said the company is committed to responsible marketing practices and will work with regulatory authorities to address any concerns.
