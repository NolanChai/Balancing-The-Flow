It's one very, very small step for man - but a giant leap for antkind. Around 800 common ants, usually found pattering across pavements and picnics, have been sent to the International Space Station as part of an experiment to study how they live in microgravity. The ants will be monitored by scientists on Earth using cameras and other equipment, with researchers hoping to learn more about their behavior in space. Ants are known for their ability to adapt to changing environments, so studying them in space could help us better understand the effects of weightlessness on living things. The experiment is part of a wider project to study how organisms from Earth would cope in space.
