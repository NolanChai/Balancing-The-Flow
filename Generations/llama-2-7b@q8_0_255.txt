Albert is 89 years old.
His wife, Martha is 71 years old.

Martha has dementia. She needs help in all activities of daily living (ADLs).

The family home was built to be accessible. But the couple are still dependent on others for some ADLs like: cooking, cleaning and shopping.

Albert has Alzheimer's disease too. The family is considering long term care in a nursing home or retirement facility as Albert's condition deteriorates further. But Martha has been living with dementia for 6 years already.

### What happens to the couple now?
The situation is difficult because Marthie requires full-time assistance and Albert is physically not capable of assisting her all the time, given that he suffers from Alzheimer’s disease. The family has exhausted their resources on caring for them at home. They have had to sell off part of their house in order to hire an attendant for Marthie and also to pay for a caregiver for Albert.

### What are the problems?
1.	Albert can’t provide proper care for Martha who needs full-time supervision as her dementia has worsened over time, while she is at home.
2.	Albert needs help to do things that he can no longer do like eating and washing himself etc. He cannot go out of his house without assistance now.
3.	Albert has Alzheimer’s disease which means that he requires 24/7 supervision as he is likely to wander off and get lost. This creates additional problems for him because there are no nursing homes nearby that can accommodate this type of resident.

### What are the alternatives?
1.	The family has to look at a long-term care facility where both Albert and Marthie could stay, as they need different types of care. The couple does not want to be apart. But they cannot afford to pay for such long term care themselves. 2.	The family is considering putting the house on sale. But the house is in a great location. The family may have difficulty finding another buyer for it and may also face other challenges when looking at selling their home.
3.	They are thinking of downsizing so that they can move to an independent living facility that provides care for people who still require some help but do not need full time supervision as Albert does. 4.	They might also consider moving to a retirement village or nursing home where both of them could stay together and receive the care that each one requires.
5.	Another option is to look at other care homes in their area, which they can afford.

### Conclusion:
This family has a difficult situation as Marthie needs full-time supervision while Albert suffers from Alzheimer’s disease and cannot live independently anymore because he does not have the cognitive ability to do so safely without assistance at all times. 
It may be necessary for them both to stay together in an environment where their individual care needs can be met by professionals who specialize in assisting people with dementia or Alzheimer’s disease. They would benefit from having access to activities that stimulate memory and cognitive function which could help delay progression of the diseases they suffer from as well as reduce anxiety caused by being separated from one another for long periods during each day due to their different care needs.
