A council is investigating why swastikas are carved into the stonework of its historic buildings after the discovery of the offensive symbols in two separate locations. The latest incident was reported at a community centre in the town, where a swastika was found etched into a wall. This comes after a similar symbol was discovered in another location last week, sparking outrage among local residents. Council officials have condemned the actions of whoever is responsible for the vandalism and are working to ensure that the incidents are thoroughly investigated. The council has also reassured the public that measures will be taken to prevent any further instances of this nature.
