The six dogs rescued were all underweight and malnourished. The owner of the dogs had previously been charged with 65 animal cruelty violations, but was not arrested because he agreed to surrender his pets for medical care. The Pinal County Attorney has filed a petition in superior court asking the judge to allow Animal Control officers to enter the property and remove animals.
