A U.S. Senate committee has approved a bipartisan immigration bill that would provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The legislation passed by a vote of 16-5. If it passes in the House and is signed into law, an estimated 8 million people could apply for legal status.
