- [0.38] The Koch brothers are billionaires with an antiquated mindset who use their wealth to try and control politics by putting a conservative spin on everything.

#### Against:
- [0.38] They are trying to take away our right of free speech by having these veterans speak out against candidates that go against their political views.
- [0.25] They are using the veteran's words without them even knowing it, which is really wrong since they are trusting you with the truth. 
- [0.17] They shouldn't use these people as puppets for their political agenda.
