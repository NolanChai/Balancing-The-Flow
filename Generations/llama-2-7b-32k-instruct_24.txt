Honey mixed with sugar might be sweet, but it is not 'honey.'. The Food and Drug Administration is taking steps to ensure that shoppers who buy honey are getting the real thing. The FDA issued a final rule on Friday to define what qualifies as honey in its most recent effort to protect consumers from unscrupulous companies trying to pass off other sweet syrups as the real deal. 
The regulations are intended to combat fraudulent labeling of products, including those marketed as "honey" that contain no or very low amounts of honey and are actually a mixture of sugars with names like "nectar," "golden," or "white." 
The agency defines honey as any "bee-derived food product" containing at least 51 percent honey by weight, excluding water. It says the labeling must clearly state the ingredients and must not mislead consumers with statements such as "honey blend." The rule also prohibits false or misleading claims that a product contains any part of a beehive or has been approved or endorsed by the FDA. 
The final rule is an update to existing honey regulations first issued in 1948 . At the time, it was common for some products labeled as "honey" to contain very little honey. Since then, the definition of what constitutes honey has changed as fraudulent labeling has become more commonplace and consumers have become savvier about what they're eating or drinking . 
The FDA received comments from more than a dozen individuals and organizations that supported the proposed rule . It also heard concerns from some, including some beekeepers who said it could lead to confusion at farmers markets where small-scale producers would have difficulty meeting requirements. The agency noted that those concerns will be addressed in future guidance documents issued after the final rule goes into effect on Aug. 29 . 
The FDA also received comments from some members of Congress, including Sens. Tammy Baldwin and Jerry Moran, who had asked for an update to the honey regulations back in 2017. They applauded Friday's announcement. "Consumers deserve to know what they are buying," Baldwin said in a statement . Moran said the FDA had made it easier for consumers to make informed purchasing decisions and for small producers who sell their honey at farmers markets to comply with federal law . 
In recent years, the number of honey-based beverages has skyrocketed. People have been sipping on honey lemonades and teas in addition to enjoying the sweet taste of honey drizzled over their morning toast. The agency said it also recently found that some products labeled "honey" contained no or very low amounts of honey at all, a development that led the FDA to take action . 
"Consumers who purchase a product labeled 'honey' expect that they are getting honey and not simply another sweetener," said Martha Feldman, a senior advisor in the FDA's Office of Policy . "Today's final rule is intended to provide greater certainty for consumers about the types of products that can be labeled as 'honey.'" 
In addition to honey syrup blends, some food manufacturers have also been marketing honey-based sauces, snacks and other products that contain little or no honey . The agency's final rule does not include any product specifications for those food categories. 
The FDA has already taken action against several companies and individuals who made false claims about their honey products. In a 2018 settlement with two manufacturers, the government said they sold millions of pounds of "honeynut" spread that contained little or no real honey at all . They were also accused of making misleading statements on their product labels . 
Another company selling "honey-based sauces," also known as "honeydrop," settled with the agency in a similar fashion last year after its products were found to contain little or no real honey, according to court documents . In that case, the FDA said it was unable to find any evidence of any honey in two flavors of sauce and alleged that company's owner had defrauded consumers by labeling his product "honeydrop." 
The FDA's move comes after Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., introduced a bill last year to strengthen the definition of honey . The measure would have banned food products that contain little or no real honey and don't meet federal requirements for labeling . It also would have prohibited companies from making misleading statements about their products on social media, websites, product labels and other marketing materials. 
The FDA said it is reviewing the senator's bill to determine whether any additional steps are necessary or appropriate to better protect consumers who purchase honey . The final rule will not require manufacturers of existing "honeynut spread" products with low amounts of real honey to recall and reformulate their products, but companies that continue to label their product as "honey" would be subject to FDA enforcement action . 
The agency also announced on Friday it is establishing a new, dedicated email address to help consumers report complaints about misleading food labels to the FDA's Office of Compliance . Consumers can reach out at fdafoodsafety@fda.honey"
