Gaddafi's fugitive son tries to reach Zimbabwe (AFP) AFP - Colonel Gaddafi's fugitive son Saif al-Islam is trying to reach a safe haven in Zimbabwe while also negotiating to surrender, officials said on Tuesday. 
  
 Saif had been expected to arrive soon at the eastern Libyan port of Brega where the rebels are gathering fighters and weapons for the assault on Sirte, the last bastion of Gaddafi loyalists. But instead he has headed east to Asaba in a convoy of luxury vehicles that includes tanks . 
  
 The rebel leadership said they were unaware of Saif's whereabouts and had no confirmation of the reports, but one official added: "He is trying to reach Zimbabwe." 
  
 A Libyan source told AFP earlier that a convoy from Sirte headed by Saif was seen leaving Brega on Monday. "I have information he is negotiating with rebel leaders in the east," the source said, adding that no deal had been struck yet . 
  
 The rebel leadership also denied that it had sent its deputy commander to Asaba for talks, but an AFP correspondent witnessed Saif's arrival there. 
  
 Rebel fighters from the western city of Misrata said they were chasing Saif eastwards and that his convoy was "stuck in traffic" on a highway. "We are following it," one rebel leader told AFP by telephone . 
  
 The rebels have been advancing towards Sirte, after Gaddafi's hometown of Sirt was taken Monday and the fugitive leader's son Mutassim surrendered there . 
  
 Saif, a former justice minister who once served as his father's spokesman in Britain and Europe, has been branded by the rebels a war criminal for ordering attacks on protesters. 
  
 The Libyan government, which Gaddafi fled last week, had offered to let him flee the country if he surrendered but Saif has rejected the offer, saying it would amount to suicide . 
  
 He was expected to arrive in Zimbabwe via Sudan and Chad on his way home after fighting alongside government forces against rebels in Nigeria's northeastern city of Damaturu.
