The NUS Liberation group, which is part of the National Union of Students and campaigns for the rights of LGBT students, tweeted an image on Monday evening featuring a man holding a pint with the tagline "​Prost!" (Cheers!). But it also includes a symbol similar to that used by SS officers during the Second World War. The group's account was suspended and they apologised after complaints from members of the public.  
The organisation said on Twitter: 'We have deleted this image and are sorry if it has offended anyone.'  
But an NUS spokesman said that although the use of a symbol associated with Nazism is 'never acceptable', the group had been unaware of its significance. He added: "This was not an attempt to trivialise the Holocaust or glorify SS officers but instead to celebrate German culture."  
The student union's website includes references to Pride, LGBT rights and a 'safe space' for students who are members of the LGBT community. The group has also organised events with the same name as the drinking event held on Monday night and another called ​Pride Sounds'.  
NUS Liberation has been contacted by the Daily Mail but did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  
The group is one of several student unions in the UK that are members of the National Union of Students (NUS). However, NUS itself does not have a Liberation or LGBT representative body.  
Meanwhile, the University of Liverpool Students' Union was criticised for having its own LGBT officer role which some said was an attempt to pander to minority groups rather than supporting all students. One student said: 'When I came out as a heterosexual male this year it would not have occurred to me that someone should have a specific job on campus just to represent my sexuality - and it's insulting the way our union tries to divide us with their incessant LGBT nonsense.  
​In January, a teacher at a school in Hampshire was suspended after she used an image of a woman dressed as a Nazi for a lesson on propaganda and fascist regimes. And earlier this month, the Oxford University Labour Club was banned from using the word 'Paki' - an offensive term for someone who is Pakistani or Muslim - in its name.

"​The group was also criticised by some members of the public, with one person writing on Twitter: 'You are using a SS symbol to promote an LGBTQ+ event. I think it's safe to say this is not appropriate at all.'  
Another user added: ​'SS symbols can be used inappropriately or in bad faith... but in this case, the use of the symbol does seem to have been well-intentioned (albeit ill-conceived). It doesn't make it right, though. The symbol has a deep historical significance.'  
​Another Twitter user said: ​'I think it is absolutely ridiculous that you would use this SS symbol as a celebratory one for "Pride" and the LGBT community when so many people had family members who died in Nazi concentration camps.  
And another person tweeted: 'Using symbols of Nazism to promote LGBT causes is an example of cultural appropriation, not allyship.'  
The NUS Liberation group's website has information about LGBTQ+ rights and a guide for people who identify as members of the LGBT community. It says: ​'Racism, transphobia, homophobia, biphobia and ableism are all interlinked.'  
The group also has a Twitter account, which features images of different pride flags and pictures from Pride events. It says on its profile that it was set up in 2015 to 'represent LGBT students' at Liverpool John Moores University."
