Horses have been banned from marching in the World War I centenary ANZAC parade in Albany due to safety concerns. Equestrians are outraged the change is a last-minute decision, and fear it could set a precedent for future Anzac Day marches.

The Department of Defence decided against allowing horses in the parade due to safety concerns, but equestrian groups have called the decision ‘unfair’.

‘We were told there were too many vehicles to allow horses into the area and that it was a safety issue,’ Western Australian Equestrian Federation president Lynne Starr said.
