This code was created using python3.6 in visual studio code on macOS Sierra.

There are many ways to solve this problem but I chose the most direct method with no loops, just if/else statements and string manipulation.

I would love some feedback on how I could improve my code!

### Solution:
```python3
age = input('What is your age? ')
if int(age) > 25:
    print('Over 25')
elif int(age) == 25:
    print('Exactly 25')
else:
    print('Under 25')
```
