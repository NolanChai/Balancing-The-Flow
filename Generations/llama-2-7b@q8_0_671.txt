My engineering background might make me better than some people at thinking logically or solving problems.  But that doesnâ€™t mean I can just switch off my emotional brain when it comes to making decisions about how to interact with other humans, especially the ones who work for me.  Emotions are a critical part of leadership and there is no way around that if you want to be successful at leading people.

### Response:

Yes, emotion definitely plays an important role in my life but I also try to make logical decisions as well. However sometimes emotion can cloud logic or make us take certain actions we might not normally think about doing.  However it is important that we use emotions for good and not evil.
