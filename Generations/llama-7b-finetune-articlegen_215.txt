Chron's disease is inflammatory bowel disease that mainly affects the large intestine and can be linked to an immune system malfunction. 30 years ago it only affected around one in every million people. However, a new study carried out by researchers at Stanford University School of Medicine has found that young sufferers are now twice as likely to need hospital treatment than their older counterparts. Around one third of the patients who were admitted to hospital for Chron's disease between 1980 and 2006 had been diagnosed with it before they turned 25, compared with just a quarter in the previous decade, according to Dr Eric Benchimol, the study's lead author. The researchers analysed records from more than half a million hospital patients at 48 US teaching hospitals and found that while overall incidence of the disease remained stable between 1976 and 2006, admission rates jumped by 35 per cent. A higher number of young people are needing hospital treatment for Chron's disease today than a decade ago, doctors say . The researchers analysed records from more than half a million hospital patients at 48 US teaching hospitals and found that while overall incidence of the disease remained stable between 1976 and 2006, admission rates jumped by 35 per cent . The findings were presented today at Digestive Disease Week in San Diego, California. Dr Benchimol said: 'Chron's disease is a severe condition that requires hospitalisation.' Chron's disease was first identified as an independent illness during the late 19th century, however its name has been changed several times over the years. It is now more commonly known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Around one third of the patients who were admitted to hospital for Chron's disease between 1980 and 2006 had been diagnosed with it before they turned 25, compared with just a quarter in the previous decade . A higher number of young people are needing hospital treatment for Chron's disease today than a decade ago, doctors say. It is more commonly known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) - seen here in a computer generated image of an inflamed colon . Dr Benchimol added: 'The rising rates of young people admitted to hospital with this illness could be due to an increase in the number of people being diagnosed. Or, it may mean more patients are developing severe symptoms at younger ages.' IBD can cause cramping and diarrhoea or constipation, weight loss, fever, rectal bleeding, and other signs and symptoms. Inflammation also can lead to ulcers, fistulas and bowel obstructions. The causes of IBD are still not fully understood but there is strong evidence that genetic factors play a role in its development. There have been reports from around the world of an increase in diagnoses of both Chron's disease and Crohn’s disease - two major forms of inflammatory bowel diseases - over the last few years . The most common symptoms are cramping pain in your abdomen, diarrhoea (loose watery stools), weight loss and fever. Inflammation also can lead to ulcers, fistulas and bowel obstructions . Some people who have IBD may also have arthritis and eye inflammation or irritation that can cause vision problems. There are no known ways of preventing chronic disease. However, a healthy lifestyle that includes eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly can help relieve symptoms of IBD. There is also some evidence that certain nutrients may lower the risk of developing Chron's disease .

A healthy lifestyle that includes eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly can help relieve symptoms of IBD. There is also some evidence that certain nutrients may lower the risk of developing Chron's disease. These include omega-3 fatty acids, found in fish, flaxseed oil, canola oil and walnuts; folate, found in leafy green vegetables such as spinach, turnip greens and romaine lettuce; iron, found in red meat, poultry, fortified breakfast cereals and dried peas; calcium, found in dairy products (particularly low-fat varieties) and dark green leafy vegetables; and fibre, which is found in whole grains, fruits, beans and vegetables.

The researchers analysed records from more than half a million hospital patients at 48 US teaching hospitals and found that while overall incidence of the disease remained stable between 1976 and 2006, admission rates jumped by 35 per cent . According to Professor Mark Pimentel, director of the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles who has published research on rising disease incidence, he believes that it may be due to genetic mutations which have led to changes in how the immune system functions. He said: 'What we see with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases is an increase in their severity.' In 1996 researchers published a study showing that young people with Crohn's disease were more likely than others to have severe forms of the disease. A higher number of young people are needing hospital treatment for Chron's disease today than a decade ago, doctors say .

A healthy lifestyle that includes eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly can help relieve symptoms of IBD. There is also some evidence that certain nutrients may lower the risk of developing Chron's disease . However, Professor Pimentel believes that these mutations are more common in young people due to environmental factors such as our changing diets. He said: 'People eat different types of food than they did 100 years ago and that causes stress on the digestive system.' These changes may be related to increased rates of obesity and diabetes, which are known risk factors for inflammatory bowel diseases. Professor Pimentel believes this increase could also be due to a rise in the number of people who suffer from food allergies . In 2010, researchers found that more than half of all hospital admissions with IBD were linked to complications caused by nutritional deficiencies.

He said: 'The genetic susceptibility is very high, but you still need environmental factors.' It's not known whether environmental changes will have a long-term effect on rates of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
