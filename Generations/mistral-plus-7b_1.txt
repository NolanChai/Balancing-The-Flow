UNITED NATIONS (CNN) - A rare meeting of UN Security Council heads of state, led for the first time by a US president, adopted a resolution focused on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons Thursday. The resolution urges all countries to refrain from developing, acquiring, testing or using nuclear weapons and to take steps towards eliminating their nuclear arsenals. It also calls upon states to provide assistance to other countries in dismantling their nuclear programs and ensuring that any materials they possess are securely stored and accounted for.

The resolution was adopted by a vote of 13-0 with Russia abstaining. The meeting, which brought together the leaders of all five permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States - as well as the presidents of South Korea and Iran, was seen as an important step towards strengthening international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation.
