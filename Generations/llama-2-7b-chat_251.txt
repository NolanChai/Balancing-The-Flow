Luis Fernando Sánchez Arellano, a former police officer who turned to crime and became one of Mexico's most feared drug cartel bosses, was arrested on Thursday. The 47-year-old was taken into custody by Mexican marines at an upscale residence in the city of Tijuana, where he was found hiding in a secret room. Sánchez Arellano, also known as "El R3," had been on the run since last year, when he was charged with drug trafficking and organized crime. He was considered one of the most dangerous criminals in Mexico, with a $2.1 million bounty on his head.
