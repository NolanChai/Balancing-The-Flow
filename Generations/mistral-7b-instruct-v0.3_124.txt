 It seems there was an incident involving Colombian and Brazilian television personalities that escalated into a physical altercation at a restaurant in Fortaleza, Brazil. This unfortunate event occurred as both nations are preparing for the upcoming World Cup quarterfinal match. It's important to note that this is not representative of the feelings or behaviors of the vast majority of people from either country, and I hope that the excitement surrounding the tournament remains peaceful and sportsmanlike.
