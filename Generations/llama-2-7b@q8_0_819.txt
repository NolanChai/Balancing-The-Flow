- It seems like a good idea for the sun to be spherical because it would make sense that everything in our universe are similar to each other. This makes sense as well with the law of gravity and how all things have a gravitational pull on something else. 
- I think it is very strange that the sun has the shape it does, especially since it's supposed to be hotter than we know. The reason that I say this is because there would probably be more pressure put onto the surface of the Sun and cause it to deform into a different shape if it were actually as hot as they think it is.
