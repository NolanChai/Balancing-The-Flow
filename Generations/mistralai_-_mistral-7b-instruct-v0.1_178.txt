 The temperature in Fortaleza, Brazil during the FIFA World Cup match between Mexico and the Netherlands on June 20th, 2014 was reportedly around 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit). This heat caused a significant amount of discomfort for both players and spectators alike. In response, the tournament officials introduced a new policy allowing teams to request a "cooling break" during the match if they felt the conditions were too hot. This was the first time the policy had been implemented in FIFA World Cup history. As a result, Mexico took a brief cooling break after the halftime whistle, while Holland did not. Many spectators also retreated to the back of the stands to escape the heat, with some even fainting due to the extreme conditions.
