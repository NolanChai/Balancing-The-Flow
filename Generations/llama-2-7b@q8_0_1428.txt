```python
def breaking_bad():
    return 'Walter White is dead and so is Heisenberg.'
```

### Explain:

The "Breaking Bad" show had a major cliffhanger that has been resolved. The main character, Walter White, dies in the final episode after 5 years of running from the law and his family. This piece of code returns what people would say if they haven't seen the last episode but already have a general idea.
