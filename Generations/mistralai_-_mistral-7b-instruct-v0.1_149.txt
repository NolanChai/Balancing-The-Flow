 Singer Glen Campbell's wife Kim said that her husband, who has been suffering from Alzheimer's disease for several years, is likely not fully aware of the nominations he received for his work on the hit song "Shallow" with Lady Gaga. She shared in an interview that while Campbell may not recognize the award or the movie it was featured in ("A Star is Born"), he still appreciates music and enjoys singing.
