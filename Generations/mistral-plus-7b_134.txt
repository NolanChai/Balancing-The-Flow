The Kremlin has been accused of using fake video footage to bolster its claims that Ukrainian forces are behind a series of attacks on pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine. The footage, purportedly showing a Ukrainian missile attack on a building in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk, was widely shared by Russian state media and used as evidence of Kievâ€™s involvement in the conflict. However, independent experts have raised concerns that the video is likely to be fake, pointing to inconsistencies in the footage and its apparent lack of context. The Kremlin has rejected these allegations, insisting that the video is authentic and that Ukrainian forces are responsible for the attack.
