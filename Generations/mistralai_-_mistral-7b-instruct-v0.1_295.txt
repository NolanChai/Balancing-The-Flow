 The police search came as part of an ongoing investigation into allegations against Lord Alistair McAlpine, who has denied any wrongdoing. The search took place at Parliament on Tuesday evening.

The search is understood to have taken place in the House of Lords chamber itself, where Lord McAlpine's seat is located. It is not clear what evidence police were looking for or what specific allegations they are investigating.

Lord McAlpine was arrested earlier this month in connection with historic abuse claims made against him by a man known only as "D" in court documents. The alleged victim, who cannot be named due to legal restrictions, claimed that Lord McAlpine abused him in the 1970s and 80s when he was between the ages of nine and 16.

Lord McAlpine, a peer since 2005, has denied all allegations against him and said he is prepared to prove his innocence in court. His lawyers have previously stated that the allegations are "totally baseless" and that the man making them is likely to be motivated by money or revenge.
