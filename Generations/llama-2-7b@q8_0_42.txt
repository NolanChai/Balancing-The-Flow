"My grandparents did it, my parents did it and I’m sure you do it as well — spanking," Goldberg said. "The reason that I would never hit my daughter is because I was smacked when I was growing up."
She went on to explain that she doesn't believe in hitting her daughter but that she does support using a wooden spoon or even an open hand for young children.
"I don’t want to raise anybody’s ire, but we all were spanked as kids," Goldberg said. "Some of us get it on the buttocks and some of us don’t."
