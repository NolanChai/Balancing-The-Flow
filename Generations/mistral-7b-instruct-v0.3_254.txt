 been surpassed by Sky Broadband in a recent report by consumer watchdog Ofcom. According to the report, TalkTalk received 46 complaints per 100,000 customers, while Sky had 53 complaints per 100,000 customers. The report also indicates that Virgin Media remains the least complained-about broadband provider, with only 17 complaints per 100,000 customers.

The findings are based on data from July to September 2012 and reflect a significant improvement for TalkTalk, which has been at the top of the complaints table for several years. The report attributes the change to improvements in TalkTalk's customer service and network performance.

However, it is important to note that even though TalkTalk has dropped to second place, its complaint rate remains higher than the industry average. This suggests that there is still room for improvement in terms of customer satisfaction.

In response to the report, a TalkTalk spokesperson said: "We are pleased to see an improvement in our performance and we will continue to work hard to make sure our customers receive the best possible service." The company also announced plans to invest Â£1 billion in its network over the next three years to improve reliability and speed.

Sky, on the other hand, said it was committed to delivering great customer service and would continue to listen to feedback from its customers to make improvements where necessary. The company has also recently launched a new broadband package with unlimited downloads and faster speeds in an attempt to attract more customers.
