The chief executive of NATS should have his bonus payments slashed by the government, according to the MP who has led calls for an independent inquiry into why planes had to be diverted around London because of a technical glitch on Monday night.

#### 1) Which statement does not belong in this list?

A. A NATS spokesman said on Wednesday that all flights were back to normal and there had been no repeat of the disruption since Tuesday evening.
B. There was “no cause for concern” about air safety, according to a senior NATS official who added: “It’s not like it wasn’t working.”
C. The computer system in question, which directs planes across UK airspace, had been used since 2013 with no problem until Monday night, when it suddenly crashed and failed to switch from one day to the next at midnight.
D. In an emergency NATS can hand over control of its computer system to another provider that works under contract to the company. But it cannot do so if there is a serious technical fault in its own software.
E. The glitch led to many flights being diverted and some having to return to their departure airports for several hours while NATS tried to resolve the problem.
