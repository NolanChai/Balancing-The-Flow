The report is correct that we do hold a large amount of cash, but it is worth noting that this does not necessarily represent money that would have been spent on transfers if we had chosen to invest in the playing squad.

We are mindful of our responsibility to the supporters to only spend money that is surplus to the needs of running the club and so we have been very careful with our cash balance. We have made a number of significant investments over recent years, including the Emirates Stadium, which has not yet been fully amortised and still carries significant debt.

The cash we hold also reflects a substantial amount that will be committed to capital expenditure in the coming year. This includes the redevelopment of our training centre at London Colney, which is due for completion by next summer, and the purchase of a new squad training base. As a result, we do not expect to have any surplus cash available for transfer investment this summer.
