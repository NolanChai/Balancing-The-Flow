The four Georgia teens, ages 15 to 17, were escorted into the courtroom by sheriff's deputies, their faces pale and nervous as they took their seats at the defense table. The judge set bail at $500,000 each for the quartet, who are accused of beating 18-year-old Timmy Jenkins to death during a party at a house in the suburbs last weekend.
