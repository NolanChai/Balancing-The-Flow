 The financial results for Arsenal's 2013-14 season indeed show a substantial amount of "free" cash, totaling Â£173.3 million at the end of May. This significant sum could theoretically be used as a transfer kitty for manager Arsene Wenger to strengthen the squad. However, it's important to note that not all of this money may be immediately available for transfers due to various factors such as debt repayments, stadium improvements, and other operating expenses.

Still, having a large cash reserve is a strong position for Arsenal to be in, and it provides the club with financial flexibility to make strategic investments in player acquisitions or other areas of the business if needed. The exact allocation of these funds will likely depend on Arsene Wenger's transfer targets, the club's overall strategy, and negotiations with potential players and their representatives.
