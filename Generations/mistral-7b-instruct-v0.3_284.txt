 It seems that Aston Villa is currently experiencing a challenging period, as their goal drought has significantly dampened the excitement generated by their impressive start to the Premier League season. This dry spell in scoring goals contrasts starkly with their best start to a Premier League campaign since 1998. I hope they can find their form and score again soon to bring back the enthusiasm among fans.
