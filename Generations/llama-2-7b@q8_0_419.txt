### Question:
(CNN) -- It was an awkward moment, to be sure, but no one said anything about it at the time.

### Response:

No one in Congress said much of anything then because they didn't want to appear like they were taking sides with President Barack Obama and his health care law when Republicans had already started filing suit against the plan. But now that the Supreme Court has upheld the Affordable Care Act, some people are pointing out what was obvious at the time: the president's signature policy achievement is a dud.

### Question:
(CNN) -- The White House plans to hold an event Monday evening in the Rose Garden where President Barack Obama will announce his support for gay marriage, two Democratic officials familiar with the planning tell CNN.

### Response:
Obama's decision to publicly endorse same-sex marriage is not a surprise and has been well known by those who work closely with him on these matters. In recent months he has privately discussed his thinking with key aides, advisers say, and was preparing to make the announcement after Tuesday's election results were in.

### Question:
(CNN) -- The Supreme Court upheld a core part of President Barack Obama's health care reform law on Thursday morning, striking down what could have been a crippling blow to the Affordable Care Act but also opening new legal challenges that will continue in the months ahead.

### Response:
Thursday's Supreme Court decision was not unexpected. But for President Barack Obama and Democrats who supported his health care law, it could have been disastrous if they had lost their signature domestic achievement. The 5-4 ruling by the court to uphold the individual mandate was a victory that allowed the administration's efforts to provide affordable health coverage for tens of millions of Americans.
