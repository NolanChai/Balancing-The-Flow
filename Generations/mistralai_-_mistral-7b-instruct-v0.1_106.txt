 month-old son in February while under the influence of methamphetamine.

The Somali immigrant had pleaded guilty earlier this month to child endangerment and drug possession, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

At the trial, prosecutors presented evidence that Ali-Mohamed Mohamud beat his son, Mohammed, with a frying pan after becoming angry over the boy's crying. The boy suffered serious head injuries and died two days later at a hospital.

The father was found guilty of second-degree murder because he knowingly caused the death of his child while under the influence of drugs. He had been using methamphetamine at the time of the assault, according to court testimony.

The trial comes as the use of methamphetamine continues to rise in the United States, particularly among young people. The drug can cause serious physical and psychological harm, including hallucinations, paranoia, and aggression. It can also lead to long-term health problems such as respiratory issues, heart damage, and mental illness.

Mohamud's conviction is a reminder of the dangers of using drugs while parenting. Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of methamphetamine, which can impair judgment, reaction time, and decision-making skills. It can also lead to violent behavior, including physical abuse of children.

Parents who are struggling with addiction should seek help from a healthcare professional or support group. There are many resources available to help people overcome addiction and improve their lives, including counseling, medication-assisted treatment, and support groups such as Narcotics Anonymous.
