I'm not sure how the NYPD handles these cases but I would assume there is a specific protocol they follow that's similar or the same as this case. The case of Gilgo Beach may be different than other cases because it involves multiple victims and locations but, in general, I think a standardized procedure for the process of handling a missing person case could work well to prevent a delay in response time and in reducing the amount of stress caused by uncertainty about what has happened. The procedure should involve multiple people with various roles which may include police officers, detectives, coroners, or other appropriate personnel.

### Proposal:
In cases such as this one where there have been no witnesses or suspects, it will be difficult to determine how and why the victim has been killed without a proper investigation. Therefore I propose that upon receiving notice of a missing person case from law enforcement, the appropriate personnel should begin immediately by searching for the missing individual's cell phone records as well as other potential information that can lead investigators in the direction of where they might be located. This could be done either through a warrant or subpoena or by accessing their account information remotely (if this is available). In addition, I would include a plan for how to search for any other potential victims who may have been with them at the time they went missing or who may have disappeared in similar circumstances.

### Solution:
The procedure should start by finding out where they were last seen and when they went missing as well as who was with them (if anyone). After this, it's important to find any potential witnesses or suspects that can lead you in the direction of where they might be located. This could also include searching for clues such as how they died or if there is evidence of foul play involved in order to determine if more victims are out there who may have been targeted similarly and need assistance right away before it's too late!
