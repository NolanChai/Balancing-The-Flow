The larger-than-life family that features on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was apparently given an early look at the premiere of the reality show last weekend. The Alana Thompson family, which stars in their own spin off series from Toddlers & Tiaras, were spotted by Daily Mail photographers leaving the AMC Theatres at Atlantic Station on Sunday. Thompson's mother June was dressed down in a grey t-shirt and jeans while her daughters Honey Boo Boo (left) and Lauryn Beth (right) looked equally casual in T-shirts, leggings and sneakers. |
