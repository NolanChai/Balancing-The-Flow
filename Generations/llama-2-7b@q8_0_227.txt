We have to use a string as the key and dictionary as the data structure to store the details about this person.
The input is in the form of 4 lines of text, we need to split these lines by commas, and create an array or list from them. We then need to iterate through each element in the array or list and compare it with each line in the dictionary that has been created earlier (for simplicity let us say this dictionary is called dic).
If there is a match between the two elements we would want to do something, if not, we will continue searching for a match.
Once you have found the key which matches the value in the array or list, print that and then print the rest of the data (for simplicity let us say the name and address) as well.
