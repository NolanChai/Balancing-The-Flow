 This is a very tragic incident that highlights the importance of safety and supervision. It's important for adults to always be aware of their surroundings and to keep a close eye on children when they are near moving vehicles. In this case, it appears that Cameron Laughlin may have inadvertently left the car running while attending to the child in the back seat. It's also possible that the child was curious or confused about why the Jeep was moving and tried to get out of it. Whatever the reason, this has been a terrible outcome and it's important for us all to take steps to prevent similar accidents from happening in the future.
