If seeing GIFs across the web isnâ€™t enough to satisfy your need for the short moving animations, you can now create them using Facebook. The social network has created a new tool that allows its users to make GIFs from videos uploaded on its site. When creating a GIF, Facebook users can select specific frames in the video and then cut them together to form an animated loop. They can also choose from more than 50 filters for their GIFs and add a caption or text. The new feature will be rolled out across web and mobile platforms over the next few days.
