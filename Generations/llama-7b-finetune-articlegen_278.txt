The discovery was made during a raid of the village of Yousufiya about 25 miles from the Iraqi capital, said the official who asked not to be identified because he is not authorized to speak with the media. The bodies were discovered in the courtyard of one home and there were as many as eight corpses buried underground, he said. "We found only their heads. Their hands were cut off. ... It was a horrible thing," the official told CNN's Mohammed Jamjoom. The mass grave is believed to be part of a series of attacks that occurred in Yousufiya and other surrounding towns starting last summer, the official said. "These areas are still under control of al Qaeda but it has changed dramatically over the past year," he added.
