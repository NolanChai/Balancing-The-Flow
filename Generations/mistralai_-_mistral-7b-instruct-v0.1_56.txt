 An undated picture of Scottish separatist Adam Busby, who has been charged with emailing a series of bomb threats to Pittsburgh University. Busby is believed to be from Glasgow and is reportedly the first person to be charged with terrorism offenses in Scotland for emails sent outside of the United Kingdom. The charges against Busby have sparked debate about the role of law enforcement agencies in monitoring online activity and whether it is appropriate to prosecute individuals based on emails sent from other countries.
