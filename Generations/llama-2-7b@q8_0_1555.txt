Crystal Palace 1, Everton 2 ...

Six-time champion Liverpool are still alive in the title race after a 3-1 victory at Southampton. The Reds were trailing until Sadio Mane scored late in the match and that is exactly where he started to make things happen. He was involved in all three goals, scoring once and assisting twice. Mohamed Salah (7 points) also found his scoring touch again after a dry spell and he netted two more goals.

The title race is now wide open with Liverpool on 42 points. Manchester City are still second, but they have only 39 points. Leicester are third in the table and Chelsea (fourth) are just two behind them, while Tottenham and Arsenal are at the bottom of the top four with 38 points each.
