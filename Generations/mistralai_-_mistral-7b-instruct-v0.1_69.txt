 Ol Boy, the dog who fell into the ocean and was rescued by divers, is recovering at a veterinary hospital after being treated for hypothermia. The dog was swimming with a group of children when he suddenly disappeared beneath the water.

The divers who were training nearby spotted his struggling head above the waves and rushed to save him. They used a catch net to grab him and pulled him onto their boat. Ol Boy was in a state of shock and shivering from the cold water, but he was otherwise unharmed.

After being brought back to shore, Ol Boy was transported to the veterinary hospital where he was treated for hypothermia. He was placed on oxygen and given intravenous fluids to help him regain warmth and strength. The doctors also checked for any injuries or illnesses, but fortunately, they found nothing significant.

Thanks to the quick thinking of the divers and the caring staff at the hospital, Ol Boy is now recovering well and expected to make a full recovery soon. He has been reunited with his owners and is being pampered with lots of attention and love.
