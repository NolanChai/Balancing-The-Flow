 It seems that Spirit Airlines has expressed some discontent with the recently implemented airline price advertising rule. The rule, enacted by the U.S. Department of Transportation in January 2012, aims to make it easier for consumers to compare airfares by requiring airlines to advertise prices inclusive of all mandatory fees.

Under this new regulation, airlines must display the total price of a ticket upfront, including government-imposed taxes and fees, baggage costs, and seat selection charges, among other items. This is intended to help consumers make more informed decisions when comparing airfare options.

Spirit Airlines, known for its low base fares but numerous add-on fees, may find this rule challenging as it could potentially alter the way they present their ticket prices. However, it's important to note that the rule was established with the intention of promoting transparency and fairness in airline pricing for consumers.

For more information on Spirit Airlines' stance regarding this new rule or for updates on any changes in policy, I would recommend visiting their official website or contacting them directly.
