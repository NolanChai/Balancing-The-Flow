 In English:

Nicklas Bendtner will be fined by Arsenal after an internal investigation was launched into a bizarre incident in which he threw a glass on the floor of a London bar and accused a woman of stealing his phone. The Danish striker, who has been out of favor at Arsenal this season, could face disciplinary action as well as legal consequences for the incident. The club is expected to release a statement later today.
