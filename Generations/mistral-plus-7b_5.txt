Roy Hodgson has come under fire for making public Raheem Sterling's admission that he was feeling tired ahead of England's Euro 2016 qualifier with Estonia. The Liverpool winger revealed his fatigue in a press conference on the eve of the game, stating that he had been playing non-stop and that it was taking its toll on him mentally and physically. However, Hodgson decided to make this information public, drawing criticism from some quarters who felt that it was unnecessary and potentially damaging to Sterling's morale. Many believe that it would have been better for the manager to keep this private, allowing Sterling to deal with his fatigue in his own way without the added pressure of having it broadcast to the wider world.
