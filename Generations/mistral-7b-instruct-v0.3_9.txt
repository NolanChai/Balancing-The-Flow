 It sounds like they may have discovered an unexpected find while excavating the underground garage for the new hotel. The object could be anything from a large piece of debris, archaeological artifacts, or even a buried utility line.

To confirm what it is, they would need to conduct further investigations. This might involve bringing in experts to assess the discovery, such as archaeologists, geologists, or engineers. If it's an archaeological find, the appropriate authorities should be notified to ensure any historical significance is preserved and properly documented.

If it's a utility line, they would need to contact the relevant utilities companies to have it identified and safely disconnected before continuing with the excavation. It's essential to proceed cautiously to avoid any potential risks or damage.
