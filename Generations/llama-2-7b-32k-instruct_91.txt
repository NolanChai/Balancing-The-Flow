We went on holiday together in August and then spent quite a bit of time apart for work reasons.   It was around this time that she sent me a picture with a guy captioned "Love you." I felt confused as to what it all meant, but then when she returned from holiday we had an argument about the picture as it clearly didn't mean anything, and I ended up storming out of her house.   There was tension between us for the next couple of weeks and eventually a few days ago we agreed that we would take a break from seeing each other as it wasn't working any more . I have been on holiday in Bali with some friends since then, but when I got back to London yesterday morning I went to her place and she told me that she had slept with someone else while I was away.   She seemed surprised by my reaction to this and thought I was being over the top for what is a very natural thing to do .   To be honest I am still in shock from the whole situation, as we were so comfortable together and had spoken about sleeping around in the future if things didn't work out . In fact, when she initially showed me the picture of her with someone else it was on my birthday and I jokingly told her to make sure that the person she was going to be intimate with looked better than me.   She then went off on one about how much prettier this other guy was than me, but when I said I would have done fine I got a bit of attitude .   The fact is we had been in touch since August and nothing had come of it, so the way she just completely blew up my world yesterday has totally shocked me. She seemed to think that as she hadn't slept with anyone else for nearly 14 months I would have expected her not to sleep around while I was away .   What she doesn't know is how close we had gotten, and when she showed me the picture I didn't react well because I feel like it could all still happen.
