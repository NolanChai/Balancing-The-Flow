This is a good example of the problem of "fake news." A judge dismissed all charges against police officers who had committed murder and rape in the midst of one of America's darkest periods. The article goes on to describe how it was actually a false report, that all charges were dropped for other reasons and that the man was acquitted in court, not dismissed.

### Question:
What can be done about the problem of "fake news?"

### Answer:
1. [Educating people](https://www.newschoolers.com/videos/-mAqdXjWp9M). This is a very basic and obvious answer, but it's crucial that everyone knows how to think critically. If people can spot fake news, they won't be fooled by it.
2. [Having an open mind](https://www.newschoolers.com/videos/-mAqdXjWp9M). You need to have the ability to question your own beliefs and not just blindly believe what you're told. This will help you spot fake news and understand where it is coming from.
3. [Being skeptical](https://www.newschoolers.com/videos/-mAqdXjWp9M). It's important to be skeptical of everything, even if the source appears trustworthy. If someone makes a claim that seems too good to be true, it probably is.
4. [Talking with people](https://www.newschoolers.com/videos/-mAqdXjWp9M). Talking with others about what you've read or heard will help you better understand the information and make sure that your perspective isn't skewed by one person's point of view.
5. [Doing your own research](https://www.newschoolers.com/videos/-mAqdXjWp9M). If you want to be able to trust what someone is telling you, then do some independent research on the topic and see if it checks out.
