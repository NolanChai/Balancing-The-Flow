A former policeman who became a feared cartel boss has been arrested on suspicion of killing 45 people.

The suspect, whose identity is being withheld for security reasons, was captured in Mexico City on Tuesday morning and will be taken to the state of Nayarit, where he is alleged to have committed his crimes.

He was previously a police officer in Jalisco state but defected to organised crime after becoming disillusioned with the lack of resources for fighting cartels.

Mexican security forces are working on a theory that many local and even federal law enforcement officials are compromised by drug gangs, as well as being under-resourced.

The suspect is alleged to have been in charge of kidnapping and murdering people for the Sinaloa cartel, Mexico's most powerful criminal organisation.

He was arrested on suspicion of killing 45 people in Nayarit state, where he worked as a drug enforcer for the group.
