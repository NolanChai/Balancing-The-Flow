Liv Tyler doesn't like to be bothered by her agents at night because she values her privacy and personal space. As an actress who has been in the industry for over two decades, she has learned that it is important to have boundaries in place to protect herself from unwanted attention and scrutiny.
Tyler has always been a private person, and she makes sure to prioritize her own needs and desires when it comes to her career and personal life. While she understands the importance of being accessible to her agents and representatives during work hours, she believes that it is crucial to have time for herself outside of those hours.
"I'm not a machine," Tyler said in an interview with CNN. "I need my rest and my privacy. I can't be 'on' all the time."
Despite her fame and success, Tyler has always been mindful of maintaining a healthy work-life balance. She believes that by setting boundaries and prioritizing her own needs, she is able to stay grounded and focused on her goals.
"It's important to remember that you are more than just your career," Tyler said. "You have a life outside of work, and it's important to nurture that as well."
