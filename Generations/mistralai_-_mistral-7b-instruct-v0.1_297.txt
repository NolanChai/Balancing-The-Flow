 Comments about women

Jeremy Clarkson has been accused of making sexist and discriminatory comments about women during an episode of The Apprentice on BBC Two.

In the show, Mr. Clarkson made several controversial comments, including calling a female contestant a "bitch" and joking about her being pregnant. He also made derogatory comments about women in general, saying that they should be "on their knees serving men."

The BBC has said that it is investigating the matter and will take appropriate action if any wrongdoing is found. This is not the first time Mr. Clarkson has been criticized for his behavior on television, and it remains to be seen whether this latest incident will result in any serious consequences for him or the show he hosts.
