The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that pilot error was the primary cause of the crash, which killed both crew members on board. "While there were a number of contributing factors, including weather conditions and UPS's own safety record, the pilots' failure to follow proper procedures was the most significant factor in this tragedy," said NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt at a press conference Tuesday.

### Question:
But some critics have questioned whether UPS could have done more to prevent the crash, pointing to a pattern of safety violations and lax oversight within the company. "UPS has a long history of putting profits over people, and this tragedy is just the latest example," said Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), who has called for greater scrutiny of UPS's safety practices.

### Answer:
Indeed, UPS has faced criticism in the past for its safety record, with some accusing the company of cutting corners to save money. In 2017, a UPS driver in California was killed when his truck collided with a tractor-trailer, and investigators found that the driver had been pushing his delivery schedule to meet unrealistic deadlines set by UPS management.

### Conclusion:
The crash of UPS Flight 1354 serves as a reminder of the dangers of air cargo transportation and the need for greater scrutiny of safety practices in the industry. While pilot error was the primary cause of the crash, there are also broader systemic issues that must be addressed to prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future.
