 It seems like you're sharing news about the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requiring black-box warnings for certain antibiotics due to potential risks of tendon ruptures and tendonitis.

The FDA is asking manufacturers to add a "black box" warning, which is the agency's most prominent warning, to their drug labeling. This warning will alert patients about the possibility of developing tendon problems, such as tendon ruptures or tendinitis, while using these antibiotics.

The antibiotics affected by this announcement include:

1. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro), levofloxacin (Levaquin), and moxifloxacin (Avelox)
2. Gemifloxacin (Factive)
3. Delafloxacin (Baxdela)
4. Sparfloxacin (Zagam, no longer marketed in the U.S.)

This action comes after a review of reported cases and concerns about tendon problems linked to these antibiotics. The FDA encourages healthcare professionals to consider other treatment options when possible, especially for patients at higher risk, such as those over 60 years old, taking corticosteroids, or with kidney, heart, or lung transplants.

Patients who experience symptoms like pain, swelling, tenderness, crepitus (hearing a grating sensation when moving the affected area), or difficulty moving any of their joints while using these antibiotics should seek medical attention right away.
