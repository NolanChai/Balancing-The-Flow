Fashioniastas, it is a word that sounds as if it comes from a foreign language. But in Japan's Harajuku district of Tokyo it is spoken every day by those who are addicted to fashion. It refers to fans of the area and its fabled creative style. The Harajuku girls - or guys for that matter - are famous for their love of colour, quirky sense of style and penchant for dressing up in friilliest ensembles they can. However, a group called 'The Harajuku Mothers' has been fighting the tide against fashion trends, which it claims have grown to a point where Japanese youth are starting to look like freaks. The group has called on schools and businesses to stop people dressing up as superheroes or wearing animal costumes because it makes them feel bad about themselves. A report from the group says: 'In recent years, Harajuku fashiion trends have grown even more bizarre than ever before. People of all ages have begun dressing like freaks and imitating Japanese comics characters in an effort to show their personality.' The mothers' claims that 'freak-show' fashion has grown too extreme are disputed by a local retailer, who said: ‘In recent years people are becoming more and more conscious about individuality. ‘Japanese people want to express their unique personalities through what they wear so I can’t really say the Harajuku fashiion trends have become too crazy.’ The group adds in a report: 'There is no doubt that some people like the freedom of being able to dress however they wish. But others find it uncomfortable. Some businesses are also concerned about customers' behaviour.' Fashion is everywhere in Japan, but especially in Harajuku where thousands of youth gather each weekend dressed in their best outfits and posing for pictures. In recent years there has been a proliferation of comic characters who wear special clothing to blend into crowds. The 'Kawaii' or cute culture is a major trend among the young, with children as well as adults dressing in brightly coloured clothes and accessories which are almost impossible to miss. Other popular styles include gothic and punk-rock, while the latest craze in Japan has been 'gekiroku' or Goth Loli - a mixture of harajuku fashion and schoolgirls. A similar trend is 'kawaii kei', a style based on anime characters. Some people also like to dress up as animals including dogs, cats, horses and rabbits. It has been reported that Japan's economy minister has banned government employees from wearing brightly coloured clothing in an attempt to present a more serious image of the country. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said it had instructed its 138,000 civil servants not to wear 'loud colours' as part of wider efforts to improve work efficiency, according to news reports on Saturday. It is unclear how much impact the ban will have since many public officials already dress in somber grey or black suits for their jobs. The ministry said it has instructed its 138,000 civil servants not to wear 'loud colours' as part of wider efforts to improve work efficiency, according to news reports on Saturday . But the ministry admitted that there were no official rules barring employees from wearing bright clothing. It also said that it would take a long time for officials to conform to the dress code since many of them have been used to wearing colourful garments for years.
