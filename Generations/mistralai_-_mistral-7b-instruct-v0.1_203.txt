 The use of the Nazi SS victory symbol by the university students' union is highly offensive and inappropriate. It is important for all organizations and individuals to be mindful of the historical significance and impact of symbols that may be perceived as hateful or discriminatory, especially in a public setting.

The union should immediately issue an apology and take action to remove any promotional materials featuring the symbol. It is also crucial for the union to educate its members on the history and meaning of Nazi symbols, and to ensure that they are not used in any context that may be perceived as offensive or disrespectful.

It is important for universities to have clear policies and guidelines around acceptable behavior and communication, particularly in regards to issues related to diversity and inclusion. The union should work closely with the university administration to develop and enforce policies that promote respect, tolerance, and inclusivity on campus.
