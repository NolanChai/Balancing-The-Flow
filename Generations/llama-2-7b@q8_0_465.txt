   A German furniture store is offering £15 gift vouchers to customers who return mugs that the company sold decorated with roses and poems - next to the photograph of Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.
 
  The move comes after a British customer complained about finding the picture of the Führer on one of the items she ordered from online retailer Nolte for £30 (US$41) in November last year.
   The mug was emblazoned with a picture of Hitler and a poem from the Nazi regime, as well as red roses and the name of the company's owner.
 
  It is not known whether the customer will now return the item to receive the £15 voucher being offered by Nolte, which sells high-end furniture through an online shop and a showroom in Hamburg.
   The company said that the image of Hitler was used without its knowledge after it bought a collection of designs from another retailer, adding: 'The inclusion of images, texts or other contents is not checked by us. We do not approve of such images.'
