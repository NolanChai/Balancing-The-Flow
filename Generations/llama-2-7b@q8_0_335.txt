I disagree with your opinion. In fact, I believe that if you are not a resident of those countries, it is much harder for you to understand the situation because there’s so many things going on that you may never know about it and only hear it from news channels. I don’t think the militants dressed as soldiers in order to slaughter civilians, they are just doing what they believe they have to do. There’s no way for them to see it wrong, since their culture has always taught them to follow Allah blindly without thinking of other people or opinions. So the only thing left is for us to help those unfortunate children by donating money or even just a few dollars so that they will be able to go back to school and have a good education.
