HIV Remission in Infants
* First Case of Its Kind Reported (New York Times)
  * Cases like this are rare, but possible!
  * The child has had no therapy since she was 18 months old and tests for the virus came back negative. She is now almost four years old.
  * A study published in _Science Translational Medicine_ examined 27 patients who were "functionally cured" of HIV (not completely, but can live without medication)
    * All cases reported so far have been children who were born to HIV-positive mothers. It is unknown whether adults with HIV could be functionally cured through the same approach.
  * Doctors have found that the "Holy Grail" of treating patients infected with HIV is to get them to an undetectable state on antiretroviral therapy, so they don't transmit it to others or experience more serious health problems from the virus. But that hasn't been proven in adults yet.
    * In children treated as early as possible, it appears to be working. The Mississippi baby was born with a detectable level of HIV. By 18 months, her levels were undetectable.
  * Doctors are still not sure why the treatment worked so well in this case; they aren't sure what made the virus go away or if it will work for other children, but hope to test more.
* The Missippi baby and the other patients who have been cured of HIV are a ray of hope that scientists can stop the deadly virus in its tracks. (NBC News)
  * We are still at the beginning stages of understanding this disease.
    * Doctors need to study cases like these, but there is no reason to believe every patient would respond as well.
* The Case of the Missisippi Baby: A Study and a Mystery (Wall Street Journal)
  * After testing positive for HIV in blood work, doctors at Children's Hospital began treating her with triple drug therapy in an attempt to get rid of the virus entirely.
    * In February 2013, after 4 months of treatment, tests showed that the virus had disappeared from her body. She has remained HIV-free since then and shows no signs of infection.
  * The patient was treated in Jackson, Mississippi, but the results were published in New York City by doctors at Case Western Reserve University, the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and the University of Mississippi Medical Center.
* A Remission From H.I.V., Not a Cure (New York Times)
  * The case has raised hopes among scientists that they may be closer to a cure than ever before. But experts cautioned that this case should not lead to premature optimism.
    * The patient was treated for more than two years before she went into remission, and doctors have been unable to re-establish the virus since then. She has remained HIV-free for 28 months so far.
* Doctors hope to treat other children with HIV (CNN)
  * Children treated as early as possible seem to fare better than adults, and their outlook is improving over time.
    * The Mississippi baby case shows the importance of early detection and treatment; doctors say there are no guarantees, but they may be able to replicate that success in other children.
* Doctors Cite Case as Advance in HIV Treatment (New York Times)
  * Experts are optimistic about treating other patients with the same approach because early treatment appears to help keep HIV levels low and prevent complications.
    * The child received a triple drug therapy for more than two years before she went into remission, which is longer than most patients receive. Doctors are still not sure if it would work as well in other children or adults.
