The disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 has sparked widespread speculation and conspiracy theories, but one aviation expert believes there may be a simple explanation for why the plane has not yet been found: a cover-up by Asian military officials. According to Geoffrey Thomas, editor-in-chief of AirlineRatings.com, Asian military officials may be staging a mass cover-up over missing flight MH370 because they do not want to expose gaping holes within their countries' air defences.

Thomas believes that by hiding the truth about Flight 370, military officials are trying to protect themselves from potential scrutiny and criticism. By covering up the plane's disappearance, they hope to avoid admitting that their countries' air defences were not adequate enough to prevent the plane from going missing.

Thomas also argues that a cover-up would be necessary in order to maintain the illusion of security and safety within each country's borders. By keeping Flight 370 hidden, military officials could avoid potential embarrassment and ensure that their countries remain safe and secure.
