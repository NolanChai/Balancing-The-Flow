Malaysia is the only country that has not offered any evidence of foul play in connection with the disappearance of Flight MH370 and so far refuses to release information about its military radar data, aviation analyst John Nance said in an interview.
"I think it's important for them to produce some sort of explanation," he told CNN's Fareed Zakaria GPS show when asked what motivations were behind the silence from other countries.
Nance and fellow aviation expert Michael Barnett believe that Malaysian authorities could have been unable to track the flight because they did not have the technology or resources for a military radar system capable of tracking planes, particularly in remote areas like the southern Indian Ocean where the plane is believed to have gone missing.
"The military has had their back up systems running on the old and tired radars that we have been using since World War II," said Nance, who was previously a pilot for United Airlines. "The technology of our time is not in place with our air defences."
Malaysian authorities released data last week from its military radar showing an aircraft identified as MH370 on March 8 flying west across the Strait of Malacca and turning northwest after reaching India's Andaman coast. The flight then disappeared off civilian radar screens, although it was still being tracked by a military radar system.
"There are people that have been living with the fact for 40 or so years that they were not doing anything with their air defences," Nance said. "They didn't have an operating air defence system."
According to him, Malaysia was the only country that could account for what happened to Flight MH370 because it had control over the aircraft while it was on its radar screen but would not reveal any information about how or why it went missing.
Barnett agreed with Nance's assessment of Malaysian military air defences, telling CNN: "The technology that they have been using has been in use for 40 years and if we had to operate our defence systems from World War II days... then there would be a lot of holes."
Both analysts said the lack of information released by Malaysia was unusual as military radar data would normally be made available immediately after an aircraft disappears. "It is not normal for any country to have this information, particularly in their backyard," Nance added.
"The question is why are they protecting this technology that we think was inadequate."
He said Malaysia might fear other countries would find the gaps within its air defences if it disclosed radar data from the missing plane. "I don't know what their motivations are," he said, adding that it could be because they wanted to protect themselves from other countries who want to find out about this gaping hole in Malaysian air defences.
"The problem is no one wants to embarrass Malaysia over a lack of technology."
According to Barnett, Malaysia's military radar system would not have been able to track the Boeing 777 aircraft because it was "probably an old and tired system".
"It does not sound like we have information about this flight," said Barnett, who is a former pilot for American Airlines. He pointed out that Malaysia's military radar system may not be able to distinguish between different types of aircraft and would thus only identify Flight MH370 as an unidentified object flying across its airspace.
Barnett noted that the radar data released by Malaysia did not match up with the Boeing 777's expected path. "I find it hard to believe that any one of us could have made such a mistake," he said, referring to the military radar data.
"There is something wrong."
Nance and Barnett also said they doubted Malaysian authorities would be able to find the debris from Flight MH370 in the Southern Indian Ocean as they had claimed. "I don't think this stuff is going to show up," Nance said, adding that it was unlikely any pieces of the aircraft would survive at the depths where they are believed to have landed, at 15,000 meters (49,200 feet) underwater.
"The Malaysians had this radar data for over a month before they made it public," Barnett said. "They've known this for well over a month."
He added that the Australian government was involved in the search for Flight MH370 and might have been able to find the debris with its more advanced radar system, which could distinguish between different types of aircraft. "The Australians have a better radar system than Malaysia," Barnett said.
"I think that's why they are having success."
Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told CNN on Monday that his government had been tracking the missing aircraft with its military radar for five days before it disappeared from screens on March 8 and was only able to locate the debris on April 10. "That is a very, very difficult search," he said when asked how the Australian authorities were able to find the debris so quickly after the plane disappeared from radars.
Abbott also revealed that the Australian government would have been able to track Flight MH370 for about eight hours on the night of March 8, before its transponder was switched off and it disappeared from radar screens, if the military had not been using an old system with limited capabilities. "It is true that we do use some very old technology," Abbott said when asked why there was such a delay in finding the debris.
"This is an example of where a new technology would have made all the difference."
He added that Malaysia, which lost contact with the plane over its airspace, did not have an advanced radar system and "probably could not even distinguish between a commercial aircraft and a small private plane".
"But our radar was able to see this object for up to about eight hours before it went dark," Abbott said.
"If we had been using the more modern equipment that is available, then we would have known that all along."
According to Barnett, Malaysian authorities should have been able to tell whether the aircraft on their radar screens was a civilian or military plane because the latter would have had different tracking markers. "There would be other things in its signal that would indicate it is not a commercial aircraft," he said when asked why they were unable to tell from the radar data what kind of aircraft MH370 was.
"The Malaysians should have been able to see this stuff."
Barnett pointed out that there might have been other civilian aircraft flying in the area at the time that would have had similar tracking markers as Flight MH370, but still managed to be detected by radar, as it was "very active".
"This is not a case of just turning off your transponder," he said. "There are other things about this aircraft... it is a very strange situation."
Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai told the media earlier that Flight MH370 had turned back on itself for 20 minutes before disappearing from radars at an altitude of about 1,400 meters. However, Nance said: "That's not normal behaviour."
"It doesn't make sense," Barnett agreed.
Aviation experts have long been calling for improved civilian and military radar tracking capabilities following the disappearance of Flight MH370 but this has failed to materialize despite the tragedy, according to Nance. "We are not going to get there because we don't want to," he said when asked how much progress had been made in improving air defence radar systems after the plane's disappearance.
"The politics of that is very powerful."
Barnett added: "No one wants to spend any money on this. That's why you are not seeing anything happening right now."
He pointed out that a lack of investment in advanced military radar technology was "an embarrassing failure".
Nance said it was essential for the international community to know what happened to Flight MH370 but expressed doubt about whether Malaysia had the information or the motivation to reveal it. "I don't think that they can tell us because I don't think they have the data," he told CNN.
"The only thing we are seeing is a cover up."
Barnett also said he did not believe Malaysian authorities would be able to track Flight MH370 on radar screens again once it disappeared from them, if the missing plane was flying over other countries' airspace. "If this aircraft has been somewhere else in the world, then I don't think we are going to see any radar data," he said.
"We have got to face that reality."
Nance agreed and added: "There is something very wrong here."
Barnett also pointed out that Malaysian authorities had not told families of the missing passengers anything about what happened to their loved ones. Nance said it was crucial for Malaysia to disclose as much information as possible so relatives knew whether their loved ones were still alive or dead, even if it would be hard for them to hear it.
"They are entitled to know," he said when asked why families should not know what happened to their family members on the plane. "
