A few days ago I wrote about how much money our country spends on warfare and defense. [The U.S. spent $1 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan](http://www.cnn.com/2014/03/05/politics/pentagon-spending-iraq-afghanistan/)
It turns out that the United States Government is not only spending money on warfare, but also on enforcing drug laws. The government has spent billions of dollars to stop illegal drugs from coming into this country. As a result, guns are being stolen and sold on the streets in Mexico where they are used in the cartels that have been battling each other for control over the smuggled drugs.

[The Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/congressional-report-on-border-gun-runs-calls-for-new-action/2013/08/06/197f53fa-04d4-11e3-b1f2-3aacf4ec0459_story.html) says that the number of firearms seized in Mexico increased from 2,000 weapons in 2006 to 62,000 by 2008 and continues to rise today. That is a lot of guns!

The report goes on to say "At least hundreds, if not thousands, of US guns are being used daily in violent crimes in Mexico." In fact, the number of firearms seized has doubled every year for the last 3 years.

How do we expect Mexico to solve its drug problem when our own citizens are supplying them with so many weapons? How can we sit back and watch as more people die from gunshot wounds in a country that is halfway around the world, without even trying to stop it?
