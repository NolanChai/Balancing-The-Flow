The Yezidi people are in peril and are facing an uncertain future. The world needs to act now before it is too late. Please help us by donating today! Your money will go towards helping our people who are suffering due to the genocide committed against them.

We need your support more than ever before as we continue our fight for justice and equality. We hope you can find it in your heart to give whatever amount of money possible so that we may be able to keep fighting this war on behalf of those who cannot defend themselves anymore - letâ€™s not forget about them!
