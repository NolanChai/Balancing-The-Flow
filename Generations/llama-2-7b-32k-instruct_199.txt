Ryan O'Leary, an 18-year-old pitcher from St. Louis University High School, is preparing to throw out the first pitch at the Cardinals game on Tuesday night against Cincinnati Reds.

"I couldn't believe it," he said of the call from his team to go down to the bullpen and warm up. "It was unbelievable."

O'Leary, who had been sidelined for two years after a drunk driver ran into him while he was riding his bike home in January 2010, threw out the first pitch at the Cardinals game on Tuesday night against Cincinnati Reds. He threw it with one eye covered and will be throwing out another first pitch Thursday night before Game 4 of the World Series.
