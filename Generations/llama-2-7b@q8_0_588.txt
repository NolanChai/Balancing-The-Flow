This is an instructional film that provides tips on how to torture someone. There are a few techniques shown, such as:
* Tying them down (with ropes or chains)
* Gagging their mouth so they cannot scream
* Whipping them with wires or cables
* Kicking and hitting them in the stomach to increase pain (the camera angle shows the abdomen of one person getting hit repeatedly)

### Notes: 
The person tortured is tied down, gagged and whipped before he collapses on the floor. He then appears unconscious.

### Questions: 
1. What type of crime would this film be relevant to?
2. Would you use this instructional film to plan a crime? Why or why not?
