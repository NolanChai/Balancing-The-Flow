**FREE TRADE**

_On the Principles of Free Trade; with some Considerations on its Influence on the National Economy._ By Robert Torrens. London, 1826. 4to. pp. xiii., 373.

This is a very ingenious tract, in which Mr. Torrens has attempted to show that the general adoption of free trade, by establishing a perfect equilibrium between the export and import branches of our trade, would be attended with unexampled advantages to the country, and that it would at the same time bring about an immense increase in national wealth. He maintains that by adopting this system of free trade we should obtain more employment for capital and labour; that we should thus be enabled to exchange a larger quantity of our manufactures abroad than heretofore--a consequence which he thinks would greatly enhance their value, both to us and to the foreign nations with whom we hold correspondence, because they would then become objects of greater demand. He further supposes, that by adopting this system, our population would be more rapidly increased; that, on account of its cheapness and abundance, the labourer would be induced to marry young--a consequence which is held out as affording great hopes for the future prosperity of the country:
"the natural increase," says Mr. T., "will proceed with so much rapidity and facility under a system of free trade, that in the course of half or three quarters of a century we shall become a nation of eighty millions." He concludes this part of his work by observing, that if our population were increased as rapidly under a protective system, "we should be reduced to starvation and misery;" while under free trade, we should be enabled to support them, and should in fact "become an European power."

Mr. Torrens's scheme is certainly ingenious; it is well deserving the attention of our legislators; but it appears to us, that on many important points his arguments are not sufficient to establish the truth of his conclusions. We admit, with Mr. T., that free trade would have an encouraging effect upon industry and population: we see nothing in our present system of protection which can be called encouragement to either; but the rapid increase of population under a system of protection is one of those things which do not happen in this country--at least we are not aware of it. The increase of population is never equal to that of the productive powers of the soil and labour: when, therefore, free trade would induce our people to marry young, it will only tend to keep up their numbers with the augmentation of these powers; whereas under a protective system, we should continue to maintain our present population by keeping down its increase.

But however this may be in regard to population, there is one circumstance which seems to us so strong against Mr. Torrens's conclusions as to render it impossible that his theory can ever become the law of our land--we mean, that great and undoubted advantage of free trade, its tendency to give cheapness and abundance in all the necessaries of life. It is not so much because we are convinced that this would have a deterrent influence upon our population, as because it will deprive us of those means by which alone we can obtain an increased consumption of manufactures; for although Mr. T. does not appear to be aware of it, the whole operation of free trade is to diminish our demand for our home-manufactured commodities in favour of foreign ones; so that if we are to have a great increase of population, as he supposes, they must necessarily be made up by an increased consumption of foreign goods. We are not aware that the English people will be willing to support a family of nine or ten persons upon their wages if they are obliged to consume all their food in the shape of coarse flour and salt butter; nor can we believe, from what has taken place during our late war with America, that they will submit to it.

There is one other point which seems to us of great importance; though it has been scarcely noticed by Mr. T., because, as a protectionist himself, he has not perceived the force of his own arguments: we allude to the _natural equilibrium_ between our imports and exports, as it exists under a free-trade system, which he seems to hold out as an advantage to us; but if we are to have an increase in the quantity of our manufactures sold abroad, this natural equilibrium will be broken through, because these commodities are not included among those for whose production, or sale at home, there is a demand sufficient to absorb all that can be produced. Under free trade, therefore, we should necessarily export more than we import--a fact which appears to us very important when viewed in connexion with the other advantages of free trade; because it is only by a continued exportation of manufactures that they can continue to flourish.

Mr. Torrens's work seems to be chiefly directed against Mr. Ricardo and his followers, whose theory he maintains to be founded on some erroneous assumptions, and who are accused of having overlooked the great advantages of free trade in consequence thereof. He is not at all scrupulous in bringing before us their errors--in fact, it would be difficult for an opponent of Mr. Ricardo's theories to avoid making a display of them; but we must say that they are such as may be found in any author who writes on political economy without being strictly logical--and certainly we have never seen more gross and glaring inconsistencies than those which Mr. Torrens has accumulated against his opponents. There is one, however, in the latter part of this work which seems to us so monstrous as not merely to expose the author's inattention to logic, but also to prove that he is ignorant of political economy, and therefore unfit to discuss its principles: we allude to his doctrine, that by adopting free trade there would be an increase both in our exportation and importation. "Under a system of protection," says Mr. Torrens, "if the exports exceeded the imports, it would operate as an encouragement to exportation; but under a system of free trade, such an event would not take place." We are sure that all those who understand political economy must be aware how completely opposed is this doctrine to the general principles of Mr. Ricardo's theory--the whole object of which is to show that if we want a larger importation than our exports will permit of, it is necessary to increase our exports by protection.

The last part of Mr. Torrens's work contains an argument in favour of the repeal of the corn laws; but as it appears to us unsupported either by facts or reasonings, we must decline discussing its merits. It is not our intention to give any opinion upon this question at present.
