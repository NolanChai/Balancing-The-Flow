By Katya Winter . A young woman shed 10st (14 stones) after she was mistaken for her own mother on Facebook. Lauren Thomas, 28, of Llanegryn, shrunk from size 26 to a size 14 after a friend thought an old photo of her mum had been posted as a new one of her daughter. And Miss Thomas has now lost nearly eight stone since she began her weightloss journey two years ago by following the diet advice in the best-selling book, The Fast Diet. Lauren Thomas, 28, who weighed 16st and was a size 26, before she slimmed down to 4st after losing almost eight stone . Miss Thomas, a mother of two, was so distraught at the mistake on Facebook that her husband Richard, 34, also changed his profile picture in sympathy. 'My friend clicked on an old photo of my mum and it showed up as my profile picture,' she said. 'I thought it had been taken down ages ago but she didn't realise.' Miss Thomas is now a size 12-14 after losing weight with the help of the Fast Diet . The next morning her mother, Linda, 63, called to tell her that she'd seen a post on Facebook from a friend in Australia wishing her happy birthday. 'She thought I'd posted it by mistake,' Lauren explained. 'I was mortified and my mum laughed and said "oh you must have changed the profile picture".' The mother-of-two had already been thinking of losing weight when she saw her friend's mistake. She had put on two stone over Christmas 2013, after tipping the scales at 16st and a size 26. 'I didn't want to get any bigger because I wanted my daughter to have a healthy lifestyle,' said Miss Thomas. But when she saw the mistake on Facebook, Miss Thomas decided it was time to take action.

'I went down to a size 22 which I wore for a while but it still felt quite tight,' Miss Thomas said. 'Then my daughter told me about this book called The Fast Diet that was on the telly and said "mum you should try it".' She asked her sister, Leanne, who works as a nurse at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, to get a copy for her and she decided to give it a go. Miss Thomas has now shed nearly eight stone in two years . 'I have never been one to diet,' said Miss Thomas. 'When you start you think I could do this for two days but you can't keep that up forever.' She started by following the 5:2 diet, which she followed strictly every day of the week. The idea is to eat normally five days a week and then on the other two only have around 700 calories for breakfast and lunch with no snacks. Miss Thomas said: 'You're not allowed any food after 6pm but I still found it hard.' 'I am not saying that it worked as fast as it did for me, but what works is the combination of intermittent fasting, exercise and a calorie-controlled diet,' says Dr Michael Mosley in his bestselling book The Fast Diet. Miss Thomas, pictured with her son Charlie, 10, started following the 5:2 diet plan in 2014 after seeing her daughter's book . The mum of two (pictured here with her children) had been on a strict diet since February last year and has lost almost eight stone in total. She has now gone down four dress sizes but said she is going to stick to the diet as it helps her feel more healthy overall . Miss Thomas followed the 5:2 plan for two years, cutting back her calorie intake by eating just one meal a day. 'I would have bacon and eggs for breakfast,' Miss Thomas explained. 'I would try not to eat anything else for the rest of the day but it was hard because I'd want snacks.' She weighed herself every morning before going out on her walks with her husband or son, Charlie, 10, who she said motivated her to keep going. At the end of two years Miss Thomas had lost nearly eight stone and was a size 14 . She followed this routine everyday for almost two years but has now started cutting back on snacks in between meals. 'I still have the odd bit to go,' she added, 'but I am going to keep at it as it makes you feel good about yourself.' The mother-of-two had struggled with her weight ever since having her first son Charlie 10 years ago and said she never wanted to be big in front of him. 'I have been a big girl my whole life,' Miss Thomas told MailOnline. 'My mum was overweight so I was always bigger than the other kids.' The size 26 mum has now slimmed down to a size 14 but still follows her strict diet, pictured here with husband Richard . Now the mum-of-two is hoping that by continuing with her new healthy lifestyle she'll be able to set a good example for Charlie and teach him how to eat well. 'I have always eaten lots of fast food so I am trying to show my kids how you can still enjoy your favourite foods but in moderation,' Miss Thomas said. She is now following a healthier diet plan, where she still sticks to the 5:2 rule for five days of every week and then has normal meals on other two days. 'I do feel better about myself as I look better than ever before,' she added. 'But I am not saying that this will work as fast as it did for me, but what works is the combination of intermittent fasting, exercise and a calorie-controlled diet.' Miss Thomas has also set up her own Facebook page, called My Fast Diet Journey to keep track of her weightloss. The mum now weighs 10st (14 stone) after losing eight stone . She hopes it will help motivate others who are looking to start a diet but have no idea where to begin. 'I don't want people to think that I am bragging about my weightloss,' she said, 'but I just hope it will give some people hope and they can get healthy.' Miss Thomas is now determined to keep up her new lifestyle for herself and her family . To find out more information on the 5:2 diet you can read Dr Michael Mosley's bestselling book The Fast Diet. She said she wants to continue to lead a healthier lifestyle by cutting down snacks in between meals but still following the fasting plan for five days every week . .
