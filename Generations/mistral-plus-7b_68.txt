Scientists have created a device called a “dream catcher” that can read people’s dreams with an accuracy of up to 60%. The dream catcher uses electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor the brain activity of sleeping subjects and decodes patterns in their brain waves to determine what they are dreaming about.

The device has been able to accurately predict a wide range of different types of dreams, including those involving flying, falling, or other scary situations. It has also shown promise in being able to detect nightmares and help individuals who suffer from them. The researchers believe that the technology has great potential for improving our understanding of sleep and dreams, as well as for developing new treatments for sleep disorders and mental health issues related to dreaming.
