A man has avoided a driving ban after claiming he thought he was insured by his wife’s policy. William Henry Welch, 53, escaped punishment for driving without licence because his wife incorrectly told him that he would be covered if he borrowed a friend’s car. The court heard that the defendant had been drinking with friends in Dundee when he was asked to take his wife home. He drove her to their house in Broughty Ferry before returning to the pub where he got behind the wheel of an acquaintance’s Ford Fiesta and drove off without a licence or insurance. However, when stopped by police on the A93 Dundee Road at 1am on July 8 last year, Mr Welch denied driving the car. He claimed that his wife had told him he would be covered under her insurance policy even though he did not have a valid driving licence. Mr Welch admitted he was drunk and failed to provide a breath test but said he was only trying to take his wife home. Sheriff Lorna Drummond fined him £200 and banned him from driving for 18 months after hearing that the defendant had previous convictions for drink-driving and failing to provide a specimen of breath when asked by police.
