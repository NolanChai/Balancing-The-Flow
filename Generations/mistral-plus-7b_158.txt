Libraries should pay authors a fair sum each time they lend out an e-book or writers will go bust. The Copyright (Visually Impaired Persons) Act 2014 gave libraries the right to lend out e-books and audiobooks without having to obtain permission from publishers. This has been seen as a positive step forward for the visually impaired, but it also means that authors and writers are losing out on a potential source of income. The Association of Authorsâ€™ Agents has said that authors should be paid fairly for their work, regardless of whether it is lent out in physical form or digital form. They argue that libraries should pay a fair royalty each time an e-book or audiobook is borrowed, so that writers can continue to earn a living from their work. The government has been urged to ensure that libraries are paying authors a fair sum for every book they lend out.
