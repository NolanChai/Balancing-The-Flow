 Fat Greek Wedding, William Henry Welch, was let off the hook for driving without a license after his wife mistakenly informed him that he would be covered by her insurance when he borrowed a friend's car. The incident occurred in Los Angeles in 2018, where Welch played Nia Vardalos' father on the popular TV show "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." Despite the misunderstanding, Welch was ultimately not charged for the infraction.
