### Explanation:
The original sentence contains two verbs - "would have" and "heard". The first verb refers to a past action that did not take place, while the second verb describes an event that may or may not have occurred in the past. When these two verbs are used together in the same sentence, there is often confusion about which one is the main verb and should be conjugated accordingly.

In the original sentence, the second verb "heard" is the main verb because it describes an action that occurred in the past. Therefore, the correct form of this verb would be "had heard". By changing the verb to its past participle form, we indicate that the event described by the verb has already taken place.

The first verb "would have" is a modal auxiliary verb used to express hypothetical or conditional situations. In this case, it serves as a way of emphasizing the fact that the event did not take place as expected. By changing this verb to its contracted form "would've", we indicate that the past action referred to by the main verb "had heard" was not carried out as planned or expected.

In conclusion, when two verbs are used together in a sentence like this one, it is important to carefully consider which verb is being emphasized and what kind of action is being described in order to choose the correct form for each verb.
