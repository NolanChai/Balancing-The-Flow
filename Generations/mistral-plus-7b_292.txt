Amanda Bynes was placed under a 51/50 psychiatric hold after police were called to her West Hollywood apartment for reports of a disturbance on Tuesday night (May 23). According to TMZ, the actress was taken to a local hospital and is currently receiving treatment. A 51/50 psychiatric hold allows law enforcement officials to take someone into custody and commit them involuntarily for a mental health evaluation. It's not yet clear what prompted the call or the exact nature of Bynes' behavior, but this is just the latest in a string of bizarre incidents involving the former child star. In recent months, she has been accused of throwing a bong out of her car window and starting a fire in someone else's driveway, as well as making racist remarks on Twitter. She also checked herself into a rehab facility earlier this year after being arrested for DUI.
