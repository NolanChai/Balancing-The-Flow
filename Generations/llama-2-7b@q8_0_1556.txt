The question asks whether the criticisms and the praises are of equal measures or not, so I have to answer whether the two statements are correct or incorrect.
I assume that 'criticism' is a noun and means criticism(s). Thus the abstract art has been criticized/critiqued in equal measure for its haphazard use of paint (plural) which means it has been criticised by more than one people or organisation, thus they are correct.
I also assume that 'praise' is a noun and means praise(s), therefore the abstract art has been praised in equal measure for its haphazard use of paint (singular) meaning it was praised by only one person or organisation which makes them incorrect.
Therefore, I have to say that "The criticisms are not in equal measures with the praises."
