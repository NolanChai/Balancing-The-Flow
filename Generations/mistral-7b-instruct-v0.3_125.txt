 It is unfortunate to hear about the loss of life in such a tragic incident. The seven U.S. Marines who lost their lives in the midair collision of two U.S. military helicopters along the Arizona-California border are being remembered and honored. My thoughts are with their families, friends, and fellow service members during this difficult time. It is essential to ensure that all necessary investigations are conducted to prevent similar tragedies from happening in the future.
