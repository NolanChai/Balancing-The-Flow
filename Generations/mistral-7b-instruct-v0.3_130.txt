 It's concerning to hear about the rising number of calls to ChildLine regarding teenagers being distressed after encountering explicit content online. This issue highlights the importance of education, awareness, and the implementation of effective strategies to protect young people from inappropriate online material.

Here are some steps that can be taken to address this problem:

1. Education: Teach children about the risks associated with viewing pornographic content online and the potential emotional harm it can cause. Encourage open conversations about internet safety, privacy, and digital citizenship.
2. Parental Controls: Parents should make use of available parental control tools to limit access to inappropriate content on various devices and platforms. This includes setting up filters, monitoring search history, and using safe browsing modes.
3. Online Safety Resources: Provide young people with resources to learn about online safety, such as the ChildNet International website (www.childnet.com) which offers advice for parents, teachers, and children on how to stay safe online.
4. Reporting Inappropriate Content: Teach children how to report inappropriate content they encounter online. Websites like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube have reporting mechanisms that allow users to flag explicit or harmful content.
5. Collaboration: Encourage collaboration between schools, parents, and law enforcement agencies to combat the issue of online child exploitation and promote a safer digital environment for children.
6. Legislation: Advocate for stricter laws and regulations regarding the distribution and accessibility of explicit content online, as well as penalties for those who violate these rules.
7. Mental Health Support: Offer support to young people who may have been affected by viewing pornographic content, including counseling services or hotlines like ChildLine. Encourage open discussions about mental health and emotional well-being to help victims cope with any negative impacts they may have experienced.
