Kate Moss was unveiling her hotly anticipated collection for Topshop, but there's no rest for the world's most famous supermodel. Aside from her fashion designing duties, Moss is also set to star in a new campaign for luxury watch brand, Tag Heuer. The 38-year-old model has been named as the new face of the brand, and will feature in a global advertising campaign that launches later this year. According to sources close to the brand, Moss was chosen for her "elegance, sophistication and timeless beauty", and will be seen sporting some of Tag Heuer's most iconic timepieces in the campaign. The news comes as no surprise, given Moss's long-standing relationship with the fashion industry, and her reputation as one of the most successful models of all time. With a career spanning over three decades, Moss has graced the covers of countless fashion magazines, walked the runways for top designers around the world, and has even dabbled in acting and music. Despite her success, Moss has always remained humble and down-to-earth, and is widely regarded as an icon within the fashion industry.
