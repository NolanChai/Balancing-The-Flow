 According to a survey by ONS, 16% of men aged between 25 and 54 in the City of London are unattached, making it the highest percentage of unmarried men in any region in England and Wales.

The study also found that women living in London tend to be more successful in their romantic endeavors as they have a higher average income than those in other regions. However, the same study found that men living in the South East had the highest average income among all regions in England and Wales.

It's worth noting that this survey was conducted between 2016 and 2019, so the data may have changed. Additionally, being in a city with more single men doesn't necessarily mean finding love is easier or guaranteed, as compatibility and personal preferences play a significant role in romantic relationships.
