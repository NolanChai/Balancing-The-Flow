 It is important for healthcare professionals to be vigilant and ask the right questions when assessing patients for potential infectious diseases like Ebola. This can help prevent the spread of the disease and ensure that appropriate treatment is provided promptly. The fact that Texas Presbyterian Hospital failed to ask the right questions in the emergency room may have contributed to the delayed diagnosis and treatment of Thomas Eric Duncan, ultimately leading to his death.
