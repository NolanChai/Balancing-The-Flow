Goldberg argued that spanking children is effective and "makes them think" because "I've seen it work." However, fellow co-host Joy Behar disagreed, suggesting that the technique causes more harm than good and should be avoided. Fellow co-hosts Paula Faris, Sunny Hostin, and Candace Cameron Bure also expressed their disapproval of spanking children, with Hostin adding that it is a form of "child abuse" and should be illegal.
