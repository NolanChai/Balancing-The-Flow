 The book, "Edwards: A Last Chance," is written by David O. Barrett, who was Edwards' personal lawyer during his campaign for the presidency in 2008. In the book, Barrett describes Edwards as a man who was willing to do whatever it took to win, including denying that he had fathered a child with Rielle Foley-Mallory, even after DNA evidence came out that proved otherwise.

Barrett also accuses Edwards of being cold and calculating in his political pursuits, saying that the former senator was more concerned with winning elections than with doing what was right. According to the book, Edwards was willing to risk damaging his relationship with his family and friends, as well as with voters, in order to advance his political career.

The book also portrays Edwards as being reckless in his personal and professional dealings, saying that he made a number of questionable decisions that ultimately led to his downfall. For example, the book says that Edwards spent large sums of money on campaign travel and lavish gifts for donors, which was illegal.

Overall, the book paints a picture of John Edwards as a man who was more interested in winning at all costs than in doing what was right or ethical. This could have significant implications for Democrats, who are trying to move past the scandal and move forward with their agenda.
