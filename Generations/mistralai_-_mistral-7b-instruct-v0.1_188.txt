 It's difficult to predict the future with certainty, but it's possible that in 100 years, English fans may look back on Wayne Rooney's accomplishments with a different perspective. Rooney is widely considered one of the greatest players in English football history and holds numerous records, such as being the all-time top scorer for England and Manchester United.

However, it's also possible that in 100 years, there will be other players who have surpassed Rooney's achievements and are considered even greater. It's always difficult to compare athletes across different generations, as the game and technology have evolved over time.

Ultimately, whether or not Wayne Rooney is still remembered in 100 years as one of the greatest footballers of all time will depend on how his accomplishments are viewed in the context of future generations of players.
