# 707: Coolest T-shirt Design Contest

## Description
The principal of the high school is holding a contest for the coolest design on a t-shirt. You are asked to draw a few ideas, and the one with the most votes wins!

## Input Format
You will be given 2 lines in which the first line contains two integers: `n` (the number of designs) and `k`. The second line will contain the `k` designs (each design is separated by a single space). The `i-th` design will begin with an integer, `d[i]`, indicating how many different colours should be used on the t-shirt. This value will be followed by a newline and then the remaining part of the line, consisting only of spaces.

## Output Format:
Print the name of the student who won!
