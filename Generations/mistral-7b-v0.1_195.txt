While some would say that it is inappropriate for these athletes to do so, I believe that it is completely within their rights to do so.  The NCAA has done little for its players and this is the only way that they can get their message out.  If we are going to expect these individuals to take a knee on the field during the National Anthem, then we have to allow them to take a knee in any other manner as well.  It will be interesting to see if the NCAA does anything about this or not.
