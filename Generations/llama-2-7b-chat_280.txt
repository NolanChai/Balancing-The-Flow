The survivor, whose identity was not immediately released, was pulled from the water after the Iranian vessel, the MV Alborz, went down early Saturday morning. The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which is responsible for the Gulf region, said in a statement that the rescue operation was conducted by the guided-missile destroyer USS Porter and the coastal patrol ship USS Port Royal.
