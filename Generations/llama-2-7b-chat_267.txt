A Beijing theatre audience "gasped in shock" after a banned image of a lone protester blocking a tank during China's Tiananmen Square crackdown was projected onto the stage during a performance of a play, reports state. The image, which has been deemed too sensitive for public display in China, was shown during the final act of the play, causing gasps and cries from the audience, according to witnesses. The play, titled "The Tank Man," tells the story of a lone protester who stood in front of a column of tanks during the 1989 pro-democracy movement and refused to move. The image projected onto the stage showed the protester standing defiantly in front of the tank, as the audience watched in stunned silence. The incident has raised questions about freedom of expression in China, where the government tightly controls artistic output and often censors material deemed sensitive or subversive.
