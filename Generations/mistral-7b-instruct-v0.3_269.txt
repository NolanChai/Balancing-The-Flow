 It appears that you've shared an article about a high-ranking female officer in the U.S. Army who admitted to falsifying her military records. However, I'd like to clarify that while I can provide information based on the details provided in the article, I don't have real-time access to up-to-date news or the ability to confirm whether the officer has actually been sentenced to jail.

According to the article you provided, Major General Paula L. Buell, who served as deputy commander for operations of U.S. Army Europe, pleaded guilty to charges that she falsified her military records to make it appear that she had completed a required course in 2011. The article also mentions that her sentencing is scheduled for October 23, 2013, but I must emphasize again that I don't have the ability to confirm whether this sentence was actually carried out or if there were any updates since then.

The article further states that Buell could face up to six months in confinement, reduction in rank, and a dishonorable discharge as potential penalties for her actions. In addition, she may be required to forfeit pay and allowances. The case highlights the importance of honesty and integrity within the military, which are essential qualities for maintaining trust and order within the ranks.
