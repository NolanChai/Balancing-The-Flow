 It's sad to hear about the accidents happening near the family's home. I understand how concerned they must feel about their safety and the safety of others in their community.

It may be helpful for the family to gather evidence to present to local authorities, such as police reports or witness statements, to support their request for a lower speed limit. They could also consider organizing a petition or contacting their elected representatives to express their concerns.

In addition, the family can take steps to improve their own safety and the safety of others around them. For example, they may want to install traffic calming measures, such as speed bumps or traffic circles, near their home. They could also consider installing a pedestrian crosswalk or improving visibility by adding lighting or signage.

Ultimately, it's up to local authorities to decide whether to lower the speed limit in the area. However, by taking action and gathering support from others in their community, the family can help to ensure that they and those around them are as safe as possible on the roads.
