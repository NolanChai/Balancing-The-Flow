To understand this, you must know how to read between the lines and make sense of what they're actually saying when they talk about their feelings (or lack thereof). In this article we look at some common ways that footballers express themselves and what they mean by them!

### Code:
```python
def read_between_the_lines(text):
    # Remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the text
    cleaned_text = re.sub('[^a-zA-Z0-9]', '', text)

    # Split the text into individual words
    words = cleaned_text.lower().split()

    # Create a dictionary to store the word counts and sentiment scores
    word_counts = {}
    sentiment_scores = {}

    # Iterate through each word in the text
    for word in words:
        # Ignore stop words (e.g. 'the', 'and', etc.)
        if word not in stopwords.words('english'):
            # Count the occurrences of the word
            if word in word_counts:
                word_counts[word] += 1
            else:
                word_counts[word] = 1

            # Get the sentiment score for the word using Vader Sentiment Analysis
            sentiment_score = vaderSentiment.polarity_scores(word)['compound']
            if word in sentiment_scores:
                sentiment_scores[word] += sentiment_score
            else:
                sentiment_scores[word] = sentiment_score

    # Calculate the average sentiment score for each word
    for word, count in word_counts.items():
        if word in sentiment_scores:
            sentiment_scores[word] /= count
        else:
            sentiment_scores[word] = 0

    # Return the dictionary containing the word counts and sentiment scores
    return sentiment_scores
```
