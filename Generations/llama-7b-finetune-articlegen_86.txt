[XCom EndWar] has been out for over half a year now, and I have played it on and off. When it was first announced at E3 2008, I was excited by what I saw. In fact I had the chance to play it behind closed doors during pre-production and loved every minute of it. This is a game that has a lot going for it, but sadly doesn't deliver on all fronts.
