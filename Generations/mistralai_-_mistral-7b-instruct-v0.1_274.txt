 The story is quite ironic, isn't it? The mayor, who implemented a 20mph speed limit to promote road safety and reduce traffic accidents, was caught breaking the very same law he had enacted. This incident highlights the importance of following rules and regulations, even when they are put in place to benefit society as a whole. It also serves as a reminder that no one is above the law, not even those who hold positions of power or responsibility.
