 The bill was passed by both houses of Parliament on Wednesday with a large majority, reflecting the growing acceptance of homosexuality in Uruguayan society. President Luis Lacalle Pou has indicated that he will sign the measure into law, making it the first country in Latin America to fully legalize same-sex marriage at the national level. The move is expected to bring an end to a long and contentious debate over the issue in the region.
