I don't think this is the right response for the given prompt, because it doesn't address what I was supposed to write about, which is what the President should do instead. The article gives some advice on how the president can try and get support from Congress, but that's not really an answer to my question.

Instead, I think this response could be useful: "As President Barack Obama channels his inner salesman to pitch military action in Syria, he shouldn't be surprised when he finds a number of congressional doors already closed." The phrase "channels his inner salesman" is a good way of describing how the president is trying to sell a plan that may not have much support. The word "already" indicates that there are already closed doors, which means the president's efforts so far haven't been successful.

The phrase "number of congressional doors" suggests that there are multiple members of Congress who aren't willing to support the plan. This is important because it shows how difficult it will be for the president to get support from Congress, and that he may need to find a different approach.

Overall, this response provides a good summary of the article and also offers some advice on what the President should do instead.

President Barack Obama should not expect that it will be easy to get support from Congress for military action in Syria. The article suggests that the president may have difficulty finding members of Congress who are willing to back his plan, and this is likely because there are many unanswered questions about the proposed intervention.

One issue that is likely to deter some members of Congress from supporting military action is the lack of a clear end goal or exit strategy. The article mentions that "the Syrian regime's willingness to negotiate an end to its use of chemical weapons" has been cited as a reason for the success of the recent diplomatic effort, but it does not discuss what would happen if Assad failed to comply with the agreement.

Another issue is the lack of a clear understanding of how many troops and resources will be needed for the mission. The article mentions that the Pentagon has estimated the cost at around $500 million per year, but it does not provide any specific details about the number of troops or the duration of the operation. This lack of detail makes it difficult for members of Congress to assess the costs and benefits of the proposed intervention.

Finally, the article mentions that some members of Congress are wary of becoming involved in another Middle Eastern conflict, particularly after recent experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. This wariness may make it difficult for the president to garner support from Congress for military action in Syria.

In summary, President Barack Obama should not expect an easy time convincing Congress to support military action in Syria. The article highlights several unanswered questions and concerns that are likely to deter some members of Congress from supporting the president's plan.

Instead, the president should work to address these concerns by providing more information about his plans for intervention and what he expects to achieve through military action. He should also be willing to work with Congress to craft a plan that has broad support and addresses the concerns of all members. This will require the president to engage in diplomacy and compromise, but it may be the only way to get the support he needs from Congress to carry out his plans.

One potential approach could be for the president to work with Congress to craft a resolution that outlines the specific goals and objectives of military action in Syria, as well as the expected duration and costs. This would allow members of Congress to evaluate whether or not they believe that the proposed intervention is worth the cost and

Another potential approach could be for the president to work with Congress to craft a resolution that limits the scope of military action in Syria. For example, the resolution could specify that U.S. forces would only be used to protect civilians from chemical weapons attacks, rather than engaging in a broader campaign against Assad's regime. This could help to address concerns about the potential for another Middle Eastern conflict while still allowing the United States to take action to prevent future use of chemical weapons.

Ultimately, it is clear that President Barack Obama faces an uphill battle in trying to convince Congress to support military action in Syria. However, by addressing the concerns and questions that have been raised by members of Congress, and by working with them to craft a plan that has broad support, it may be possible for him to achieve his goal of protecting civili
