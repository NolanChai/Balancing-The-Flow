[SEGMENT 1 - PRESIDENT OBAMA SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER ON GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS]

President Obama has signed a new executive order aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from power plants. The order, which was announced last month, sets tougher limits on the amount of carbon dioxide that can be emitted from existing power plants.

Under the new regulations, power plants will have to cut their emissions by 30% by 2030, compared to levels set in 2005. The order also includes a plan for states to implement their own emission reduction targets.

The President's move is seen as an effort to combat climate change, as carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse gases contributing to global warming. Supporters of the new regulations say that they will help protect public health by reducing air pollution, while critics argue that the cost of implementing the changes could be too high for some states.

[SEGMENT 2 - STUDENT USING TECHNOLOGY TO RAISE AWARENESS OF CLIMATE CHANGE]

In other news, one student is using technology to bring attention to climate change in a creative way.

Meet [STUDENT NAME], a high school student from [CITY/STATE]. [NAME] has created an app called "Carbon Tracker," which uses GPS technology to track the carbon footprint of everyday activities, such as driving, flying, and eating meat.

By inputting their daily activities into the app, users can see how much carbon dioxide they are emitting into the atmosphere. [NAME] hopes that by making people more aware of their carbon footprint, they will be motivated to make changes in their behavior to reduce their impact on the environment.

The app is currently available for download on [PLATFORM], and [NAME] plans to continue updating and improving it in the future.
