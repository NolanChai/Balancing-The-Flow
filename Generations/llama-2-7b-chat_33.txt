A 22-year-old man who allegedly went on a gruesome murder spree has baffled cops as they try to understand the motive behind the series of brutal killings. According to police, the suspect, whose name has not been released, is believed to have killed at least five people in a matter of hours, leaving a trail of blood and terror in his wake. The first victim was identified as a 75-year-old woman who was found dead in her home early Monday morning. As cops searched for the killer, they discovered three more bodies, including a 28-year-old man and a 3-year-old child. The suspect was arrested later that day after he was spotted by a witness running from the scene of the last crime. Police are still trying to piece together how the suspect went on such a violent rampage, and they are urging anyone with information to come forward.
