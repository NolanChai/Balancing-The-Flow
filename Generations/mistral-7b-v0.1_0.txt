. Three members of the same family who died in a static caravan from carbon monoxide poisoning would have survived if they had had an alarm, a coroner ruled today. . . The two men and woman were found dead at the site on the A10 near Ely, Cambridgeshire, on March 16 last year. . . . A faulty gas pipe in the caravan had allowed poisonous carbon monoxide to leak into the living area, but the family did not have an alarm which would have alerted them. .

### Coroner's conclusion:
. The coroner said that if there had been a working carbon monoxide alarm fitted, the deaths could have been prevented. . The family should have had one installed as part of the safety measures of any caravan site, he said. . Mr Ritchie added: 'In the circumstances of this case I conclude that if they had had an audible alarm it would have detected the presence of carbon monoxide and given them warning to leave the caravan'. . The deaths were accidental but avoidable, he concluded. .

### The family were staying in a privately owned static caravan on the site of a farm.
. It had been used by others before they arrived and Mr Ritchie said they had not been given any advice about safety or the installation of an alarm. . He added: 'I am satisfied that if there had been such a warning installed in the caravan then this accident would have been prevented'. .
