A visibly moved Vin Diesel yesterday visited the site where Paul Walker died in a car crash, 18 days after the actor's tragic death. The actor, who starred alongside Walker in the Fast and Furious series, posted an emotional tribute to his friend on Instagram alongside a photo of him at the scene of the accident. 'I felt like I had to be here,' he wrote. 'It's still so unreal.' Diesel described how he had seen some of Walker's car parts lying around the site and said it was difficult not to feel the actor's presence there. He added: 'As we walked back to the car, I could have sworn I saw your face looking at me from behind a tree. 'I love you brother, this has been so hard.' Walker and his friend Roger Rodas were killed in a horrific crash on November 30 after their Porsche Carrera GT smashed into a lamp post and burst into flames. Diesel paid tribute to his co-star shortly after the news of his death broke, writing: 'I am absolutely speechless. Height of the world.'
