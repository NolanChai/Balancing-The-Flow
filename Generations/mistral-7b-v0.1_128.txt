This is just another example of what happens when people are not trained to use social media correctly. This comment was made on Twitter, which is public and easily accessible by all. As you can see, this tweet has caused some anger among Chelsea fans. If this had been a private message, then there would be no problem, but it's out in the open for everyone to read.

The comment comes off as unprofessional. Terry should have used social media correctly by either deleting the tweet or making it private. He didn't consider that many people would see this and get angry about it. If he had, he could have avoided this situation all together.

Terry is now in a position where he has to deal with the consequences of his actions. The best thing for him to do is apologise and move on from it as quickly as possible. Hopefully he will learn from this mistake and make sure that something like this doesn't happen again in future!
