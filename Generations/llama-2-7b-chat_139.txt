Lukasz Fabianski will miss Sunday's crucial clash against Tottenham Hotspur after the FA confirmed his one-match ban. The Swansea City goalkeeper was found guilty of violent conduct in his side's 2-1 win over Crystal Palace last weekend and has now been punished for his actions. Despite the setback, the Swans will be looking to bounce back from their midweek defeat to West Ham when they take on Spurs at the Liberty Stadium. With Fabianski out of action, fellow goalkeeper Erwin Mulder is likely to start between the sticks against Mauricio Pochettino's men.
