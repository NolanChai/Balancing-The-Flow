* *I think the first thing that struck me when I started reading this book is that it is written in such a way as to make you feel very emotional; there are some serious themes throughout which have been done well. Ally had a really tough time growing up, being made fun of by her school friends and struggling with bullying from the same people.

I also found Ally's relationship with her mum very interesting. She was clearly very close to her mum who was there for her as much as she could be. The book portrays a mother-daughter relationship which is both loving and supportive, but also strong enough that they could disagree on things and not let it ruin their relationship.

In terms of the way the book is written, I really liked how Ally was talking directly to me (the reader) throughout; she felt very honest with me.*
