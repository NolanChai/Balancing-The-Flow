 The emperor penguin has long been known for its extreme shyness and elusiveness to humans and other predators. However, the 'penguin' you are referring to is likely an imposter made by researchers and scientists in a study to understand the social behavior of emperor penguins. 

The study involved creating a life-sized mechanical penguin that mimicked the appearance and movement of an emperor penguin. The penguin was then placed in a group of real emperor penguins, and researchers observed how the other penguins responded to it. The results showed that the mechanical penguin was able to fool the real penguins and even form bonds with them.

While the study was purely scientific and not intended for any practical purposes, it does highlight the importance of understanding and respecting the natural behavior of animals, especially those that are highly sensitive and vulnerable.
