We want to return to our glorious past of being the best Formula One team once more at Barcelona in two weeksâ€™ time. Our boss, Enzo Ferrari, is an absolute perfectionist and he demands that we must be as fast as possible if we are to beat Red Bull Racing who have won each of the last three Grand Prix events.

It was a real tragedy for us at Imola earlier this month because we had such high expectations after showing great pace in testing before the race weekend started and then on the very first day of practice we suffered two huge errors by our team which meant Sebastian Vettel was unable to complete more than 12 laps.

Our drivers were upset at what happened but we are determined to show that we can be strong in Barcelona to restore a bit of pride in our team and give Enzo some joy on his birthday, which happens to fall just a few days after the Spanish Grand Prix.
