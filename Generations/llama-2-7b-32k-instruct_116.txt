Mata's goal came in the 69th minute, as United and Chelsea were deadlocked at two goals each with a little over half an hour to go.  
The goal changed the entire game and put United in complete control of the match.   

When Juan Mata was given offside by referee Jon Moss it sparked outrage on social media, even from Chelsea manager Antonio Conte.

The decision led to calls for the Premier League's refereeing chief Mike Riley and the Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL) to investigate the incident further. 

United are believed to have protested but their protest was dismissed by the PGMOL board as Moss is backed in his decision not to award a goal to Mata when the referee's assistant had signalled for an offside.
