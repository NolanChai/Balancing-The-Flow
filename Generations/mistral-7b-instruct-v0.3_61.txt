 It seems that Chris Keates, the head of Britain's largest teaching union NASUWT, has expressed concern about the use of cameras in classrooms. According to his statement, he feels that the cameras are undermining the professionalism of teachers, likening them to laboratory subjects or "lab rats." This suggests a perception that teachers are being closely monitored and evaluated without sufficient autonomy or respect for their expertise. It's essential to strike a balance between accountability and empowerment when it comes to educators, ensuring they have the resources and support needed to excel in their roles while also maintaining high standards for students.
