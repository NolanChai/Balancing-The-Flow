 It seems there might be a misunderstanding in your statement. Honey naturally contains sugars like fructose and glucose, so when you mix honey with sugar, you're essentially combining similar substances. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is more concerned with ensuring that the honey being sold is pure and authentic, not adulterated or mislabeled. They are taking steps to prevent honey from being diluted with cheaper syrups like high-fructose corn syrup or inverted sugar. This ensures that consumers are getting what they pay for when they buy honey.
