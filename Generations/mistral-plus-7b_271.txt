Saudi Arabia's decision not to join the UN Security Council can be attributed to a number of factors, including its desire to maintain its independence and avoid becoming embroiled in the political turmoil of the Middle East, as well as its reluctance to take on the responsibilities and obligations associated with membership on the council.

Saudi Arabia has been hesitant to accept a seat on the Security Council for several reasons. Firstly, it is concerned about being seen as too close to the United States and Israel, both of whom have strongly supported Saudi Arabia's inclusion in the UN. This could potentially damage its reputation in the Arab world, which would be detrimental to its interests. Secondly, the Saudi government is aware that becoming a member of the Security Council carries with it certain responsibilities, such as voting on resolutions and enforcing sanctions. It has concerns about taking on these duties and being seen as an "ally" of the West.

In addition, Saudi Arabia's decision was likely influenced by its desire to maintain its independence and avoid becoming embroiled in the political turmoil of the Middle East. The Kingdom is well-known for its reluctance to engage in international diplomacy and prefers to operate independently from other nations. By turning down the chance to join the UN Security Council, Saudi Arabia has shown that it will not be drawn into the complexities of international politics.
