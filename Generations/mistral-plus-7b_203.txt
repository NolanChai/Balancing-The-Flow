The University of Liverpool Students' Union came under fire after they used an image featuring the infamous Nazi SS logo in their poster for a 'German Themed Bar Crawl', organised by their 'Culture & Activities Committee'.

The event, which took place last week, saw students dressed up in lederhosen and dirndls, drink steins of beer and play German drinking games. The poster advertising the event showed the traditional German beer stein logo alongside a Nazi SS symbol.

Following backlash from students and staff at the University, the Students' Union released a statement apologising for the mistake and said they would be reviewing their processes in order to prevent similar incidents in the future. They also promised to work with the University to ensure that such mistakes do not happen again in the future.
