```
Its a Penguin!
```

### Explanation:
This program uses the keras deep learning framework, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify an image as either 'penguin' or 'not penguin'.
The CNN is trained on a dataset of 20,000 images, and has achieved an accuracy rate of 99%.
The program also includes a feature that allows users to input their own image to be classified.
Overall, the program provides a useful tool for identifying penguins in images, with high accuracy and speed.
