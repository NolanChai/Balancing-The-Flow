 That's great news! It seems that the New York Knicks will have their star player, Carmelo Anthony, with them for their upcoming game against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. Having a key player like Anthony can certainly provide a significant boost to the team and potentially impact the outcome of the match positively. Best of luck to the Knicks!
