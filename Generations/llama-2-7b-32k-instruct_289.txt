The Egyptian government is now under fire from its own citizens because it has failed to support the Palestinians against Israeli aggression.  
The United States is not popular in the Arab world for supporting Israel despite its ongoing human rights violations.  
Arabs are angry at their governments' failure to stand up to Israel, but also blame Hamas because it has been unable to end the blockade of Gaza and has failed to provide adequate protection for Palestinians living in the coastal enclave from Israeli airstrikes.  
Arabs are frustrated with their governments' silence on Israel's actions, despite its occupation of East Jerusalem and other territories claimed by Palestinians. They feel let down because they believe that Arab leaders have failed to support them in any way.  
The people of Iraq and Lebanon demonstrated against the US and Israel during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. The situation is not different now, as the US continues its occupation of Iraq and its intervention in Lebanese affairs despite calls for a withdrawal by Arab citizens.
