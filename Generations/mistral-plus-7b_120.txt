Kevin Mirallas' injury nightmare continued as he suffered a hamstring injury in Everton's 1-0 win over Hull City on Saturday. The Belgium international was substituted after just 24 minutes, and the Toffees have now been dealt a major blow with Mirallas set to miss up to eight weeks of action through injury.

Mirallas has been one of Everton's most consistent performers this season, scoring four goals in nine appearances across all competitions. However, he has been dogged by injuries throughout his time at Goodison Park and the latest setback is a major blow for Roberto Martinez's side.

The Toffees have already lost Ross Barkley and Seamus Coleman to long-term injuries this season, and Mirallas' absence will be another big concern for Martinez. The Belgian international has been one of the standout performers in Everton's attack this season, and his absence is likely to leave a sizeable hole in their line-up.
