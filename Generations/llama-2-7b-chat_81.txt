The hugely-anticipated launch of the iPhone 5 is only two days away - and speculation is mounting over what the must-have gadget will look like, with many predicting a sleeker, faster device than its predecessor. According to reports, Apple has been working on a number of new features for the iPhone 5, including a larger screen, improved camera and longer battery life. However, some experts have warned that the new phone may not live up to expectations, with concerns over its price point and potential lack of innovation. As the countdown to the launch continues, fans of the brand are eagerly awaiting the chance to get their hands on the latest iPhone, which is expected to go on sale later this month.
