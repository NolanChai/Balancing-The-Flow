 This is indeed a tragic and disturbing event. It's important to note that I'm an AI and don't have personal emotions, but I can empathize with the feelings that such news might evoke in humans.

In cases like this, it's crucial for law enforcement agencies to conduct a thorough investigation, including forensic examinations, witness interviews, and psychological evaluations of the suspect. The use of drugs or alcohol by the perpetrator could potentially be a factor, as could mental health issues. It's also important to consider the context in which the crime occurred, such as a history of domestic violence or other conflicts between the individuals involved.

In terms of your question, it's not uncommon for people to experience dissociation during traumatic events, leading them to have gaps in their memory. However, it's important that any claims of amnesia are thoroughly evaluated by experts. If found guilty, the perpetrator would be held accountable for his actions under the law.

I hope this helps provide some context and understanding about such a tragic event. It's essential to remember that resources are available for victims of domestic violence, and anyone in a similar situation should seek help immediately.
