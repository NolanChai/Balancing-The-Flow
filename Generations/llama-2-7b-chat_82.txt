Arsenal have launched an internal investigation into Nicklas Bendtner's recent behavior after the forward was seen in a nightclub at 3am on a weekday. The club are taking the matter seriously and have warned Bendtner that he will be fined if he does not comply with their rules and regulations.
Bendtner, who has been struggling for form this season, is understood to have attended a nightclub in central London with a group of friends after Arsenal's 2-0 win over Fulham on Saturday. The club's rules prohibit players from partying until Monday morning, and Bendtner's late-night antics have caused a stir among the Arsenal hierarchy.
Sources close to the club have revealed that Bendtner has been warned about his behavior in the past, but he has consistently failed to heed those warnings. The investigation is ongoing and it remains to be seen what punishment Bendtner will face if he is found to have breached the club's rules again.
In a statement, an Arsenal spokesperson said: "The club takes matters like this very seriously and we are currently investigating the situation. We will not tolerate any behavior that undermines the professionalism of our squad."
Bendtner has struggled for form this season, scoring just one goal in 16 appearances for Arsenal. His place in the team is under threat from new signing Yaya Sanogo, who has been impressive in training and could make his debut against Everton on Saturday.
The incident has reignited calls for Bendtner to be sold in the summer transfer window. Arsenal are thought to be open to selling him, but they will only accept a reasonable offer. Bendtner's agent has been in talks with several clubs, but so far no deal has materialized.
In conclusion, Nicklas Bendtner is facing disciplinary action from Arsenal after breaking the club's rules by partying late at night. The incident has raised questions about his future at the club and whether he will be sold in the summer transfer window.
