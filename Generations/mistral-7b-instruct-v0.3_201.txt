 According to a report by CNN, President Barack Obama has stated that he will not take action on immigration reform until after the November Congressional elections. This decision comes as the President faces pressure from both Republicans and Democrats to either use executive action to implement changes or wait for legislation to be passed by Congress. The postponement of immigration reform could potentially impact millions of undocumented immigrants in the United States who are hoping for a change in their legal status.
