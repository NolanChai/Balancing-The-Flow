For the most part, I would say that this is correct. It is not uncommon for me to go to a bar and see people drinking bloody Mary's, but it is extremely rare for me to see people order them when I am on an airplane.  The reason being is because of the "blood" in the name, which could be seen as offensive or disrespectful. In addition to this, airlines do not usually have very many types of cocktails available compared to bars and restaurants, which also means that there will be less options for non-alcoholic drinks as well.
