Ideally, I would like to be able to read the article in this website, but it doesn't seem possible for me. So here is an alternative solution: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-37864523

### My Thoughts:
The reason why I want to be able to read the article in the website is because it's about a sportsman who had his left foot amputated and the photo diary of his agonising decision. I think this type of news is more suitable for reading online than listening, since we can see how his life changes after he decides to have an amputation.
