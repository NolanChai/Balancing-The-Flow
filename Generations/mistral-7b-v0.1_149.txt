**The disease is thought to be caused by the build up of abnormal proteins in the brain that eventually destroy nerve cells.**

***Currently, there’s no cure for Alzheimer's but some medications may help reduce symptoms.***

* Family History: A history of Alzheimer's in the family can increase the chance of developing the disease.
* Genetics: Mutations in certain genes can cause early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.
* Gender: Women are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s than men.
* Head Injury: A severe head injury may increase the risk of Alzheimer's later in life.
* Lifestyle Factors: High blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease.
* Smoking: Research suggests that smoking increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.

**Treatment:**

* Medication: Certain medications may help reduce symptoms or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. These include cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine.
* Non-Drug Therapies: Activities that stimulate the brain, such as exercise, social activities, and cognitive training may help improve memory and thinking skills.
* Caregiver Support: Caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease can be challenging. It’s important to seek support from family and friends, or join a caregiver support group.
* Respite Care: This type of care provides temporary relief for caregivers who need a break from their duties.

**Prevention:**

* Exercise: Regular physical activity can help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
* Healthy Diet: Eating a healthy diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, low in saturated fat and cholesterol may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.
* Mental Stimulation: Activities that challenge the brain, such as reading, doing puzzles, or playing games can help improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's.
* Social Engagement: Staying socially engaged with friends and family may help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.
* Manage Health Conditions: Controlling blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, and smoking can help reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.
