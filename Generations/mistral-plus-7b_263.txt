The reason you crave a bloody Mary or tomato juice more when flying than at other times is because of the pressure and dry air in an aircraft cabin. These can cause dehydration, which can lead to headaches and fatigue. Tomatoes are rich in electrolytes, such as potassium and magnesium, which help to re-hydrate the body. The combination of spices in a bloody Mary can also help alleviate jet lag symptoms by stimulating circulation and relieving stress. In addition, the spicy flavor of a bloody Mary can help mask the taste of recycled air in the cabin.
