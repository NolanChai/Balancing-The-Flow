 That's correct. Glen Campbell, the legendary country singer, was indeed nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2015 for "I'm Not Gonna Miss You" from the documentary "Glen Campbell: I'll Be Me." However, due to his advanced stage of Alzheimer's disease, he may not have been aware of the nomination. It was a poignant moment as the song was written and performed by him as a reflection on his own struggles with the disease.
