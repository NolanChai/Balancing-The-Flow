I am not so sure. I can definitely see the point that people are addicted to their phones but I am not convinced that they would be stressed if the phone ran out of batteries. It is almost like saying that you don’t have your car and are forced to walk instead, or you go somewhere without your TV at home which doesn’t mean that you get stressed.
