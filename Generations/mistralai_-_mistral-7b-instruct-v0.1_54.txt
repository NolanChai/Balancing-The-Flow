A breathalyser app that can automatically post results to Facebook or Twitter has been launched. The app, called 'Breathometer', is designed to provide an accurate measure of alcohol levels in a user's breath, and uses this data to calculate their blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level. Once this information has been obtained, the app will then automatically post it onto the user's social media account of choice. The developers behind Breathometer claim that the app is highly accurate and can provide a reliable measure of BAC levels. However, there are concerns about the privacy implications of such an app, particularly with regards to what information is being shared on social media.
