 The investigation is focused on the case of Kathy Ann Esmonde, who was found dead in her home in 1968. She was believed to have been strangled by a man named Raymond J. Burke, who was convicted of assaulting and killing several other women in the area at the time.
However, new DNA evidence has emerged that casts doubt on Burke's guilt in Kathy's murder. A forensic expert testified at a recent trial that an unknown man's DNA was found on a murder weapon that had been linked to Kathy's case, and that the DNA was not a match for either Burke or his victim's family members.
In hopes of clarifying the situation, investigators exhumed Kathy's body Wednesday in order to collect DNA evidence from her remains. The DNA will be compared to the unknown man's DNA that was found on the murder weapon, as well as DNA from other potential suspects in the case.
The exhumation is a rare and controversial process, and it has been met with opposition from Kathy's family and others who believe that she should be left in peace. However, supporters of the investigation argue that modern science can help bring justice to Kathy's case and potentially clear the name of an innocent person.
