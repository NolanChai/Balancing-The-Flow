By . Judge . Rex Barbas . During a pretrial conference Tuesday, Barbas told attorney James McCarthy to leave his courtroom so he could take a call from another judge. McCarthy refused and instead asked if the judge would like him to stay in the room where he could hear the phone call or not. Judge Rex Barbas did not seem too happy with that response. "Do you want me to kick you out?" Barbas asked McCarthy, who was seated at his desk. Barbas then punched McCarthy in the head as he stood up and walked around behind him.
