As protesters in Gaza clashed with Israeli forces on Monday, Arab citizens across the region took to the streets in solidarity, directing their anger towards their own governments for failing to protect them. Demonstrators held signs and chanted slogans calling for political reforms and an end to corruption, while others vented their frustration at the lack of progress on issues such as economic inequality and social justice. The protests were largely peaceful, but in some cases, violence broke out when security forces tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets. The unrest comes as tensions continue to escalate in the region, with many feeling let down by their leaders and desperate for change.
