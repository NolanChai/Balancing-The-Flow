Rooney has scored more goals for the Three Lions than anyone else. He also holds the record for most appearances (119), and is just 20 goals away from overtaking Bobby Charlton as England’s top scorer of all time.  Rooney is also a true Premier League great, having played in 426 games for six clubs, winning two Premier League titles, the FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield and UEFA Supercup during his career.
