A young mother in Washington state has been charged with attempted murder after authorities say she cut her children’s throats in an attempt to keep them quiet. 31-year-old Katerra Patterson, of Bellevue, was arrested on Wednesday and is being held at the King County Jail. According to police, Patterson allegedly used a box cutter to slice open her children’s necks after they began crying in their car seats while she was driving. The children, ages 2 and 1, were taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Patterson told investigators that she felt overwhelmed by the children’s cries and acted out of frustration. She has been charged with two counts of attempted murder.
