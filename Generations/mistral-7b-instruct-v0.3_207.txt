 That's correct! Brett Lee, the legendary Australian fast bowler, has announced his retirement from Test cricket due to recurring injuries. He has had an illustrious career spanning over a decade, during which he took 310 wickets in 76 Tests and was known for his speed and skill on the pitch. His contributions to Australian cricket will certainly be missed, but fans can still look forward to seeing him play in other formats of the game.
