Investments are the key to good stewardship. They are part of your faith, and are essential for fulfilment of God’s command to “subdue the earth.”

The biblical principle that guides investment is the command to “love thy neighbour as thyself.”

This means using your financial assets not only to do good works in your local community but also globally. Investing internationally has the added benefit of spreading the gospel and reaching non-Christians.

You can also use investments to share your faith with those you work with, and use the money from them as a way to meet people who do not know Jesus.

### Hint:

Investment in ethical businesses will always yield good returns in this world as well as the next.
