Hospital admissions for Crohn's disease in children have more than trebled over the last ten years in England. In 2017/18, there were 345 admissions of patients under 16 - compared with just 97 in 2008/09.

The rise is most pronounced among girls - up from just 25 admissions for the disease a decade ago to 145 last year.

Crohn's, which can cause diarrhoea and weight loss, is one of several forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

The number of children with IBD has been rising across Europe and North America for the past few decades, but experts say the reasons are unclear.

However, they believe that a combination of factors - including genetics, lifestyle and the environment - play a role.

Professor Chris Roberts, clinical director at Crohn's & Colitis UK, said: "The rise in admissions is concerning but not surprising as it has been seen across Europe and North America for some time.

"There are many theories about why this may be happening, including the idea that better diagnosis of the condition may be leading to more admissions."

But he added: "One thing we do know is that children with IBD should have access to specialist paediatric care in hospital when they need it."
