1) **Bonnie** has been downgraded to Tropical Storm status, and will likely pass north of New Orleans this weekend, although rain is possible in southern Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida through early next week.
2) **The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is overseeing the operation,** has given BP a green light to remove its response vessels from the site of the ruptured well on Friday night until Sunday evening.
3) **The sealed cap should be able to withstand a 1-inch rainfall during that time span without being at risk for failure,** NOAA officials said. The area could see rain in excess of 2 inches over the next few days.
4) The move is possible because BP's well containment system includes four layers of protection, and two of those are redundant -- meaning they provide backup to one another. The cap itself has been equipped with a heater that can keep it warm in cold weather (it was installed at 68 degrees Fahrenheit) and will be closed off from the gushing oil by an overlying flange.
5) **A tube called a "riser" runs to the surface, where it connects to the risers on BP's drilling ship, the Discoverer Enterprise.** This allows engineers to pump in heavy mud and cement through those risers to seal off any potential leaks.
6) **Because the cap is open to weather, the heater was installed to prevent it from freezing while the well remains closed. Engineers are still working on plans for when the cap is opened again so that they can reheat it if needed.** The riser will also help engineers monitor any pressure build-up in case of a leak and keep an eye on water levels in the well, which have been slowly rising since the rupture was sealed off more than two weeks ago.
7) **BP is testing other ways to plug the well but they are not as effective as the cap.** They may be needed if the cap does fail at some point in the future, NOAA officials said.
8) **A backup method is called a "diverter." It works like a shower nozzle, diverting any oil that flows up through the well to the surface of the ocean instead of into it.** BP is also testing a second diverter, in case one or both fail.
9) **There are 26 response ships at the site of the well and another nine on standby, said Adm. Thad Allen, coordinator for federal efforts to contain the spill.** The area has been covered by skimming vessels, but more rain could be a problem because they can't operate if their skimmers are covered by water.
10) **A total of 84 response vessels have been mobilized in case they are needed, Allen said.** They include ships that could evacuate people from the Gulf Coast if necessary and ones that carry oil-absorbing booms.
11) The BP well cap is expected to be placed over the well on July 17th.
