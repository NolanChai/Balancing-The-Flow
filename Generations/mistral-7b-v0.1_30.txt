Arturo Vidal's words are not a big surprise, as we already knew about his problems and have been monitoring them closely since he joined our club.

In fact, Arturo Vidal is doing well. We are very satisfied with how he has recovered in recent weeks, but it is true that he is still struggling to feel completely fit. However, he is working hard every day towards being 100% ready for the new season and we have no doubt that he will be back to his best soon.

As for his performance against Bale, we are confident that our medical team is doing everything they can to help him recover quickly and completely. We know how important it is for Arturo Vidal to be fit and ready for the new season and we will do everything possible to make sure he gets there as soon as possible.

In conclusion, we remain optimistic about Arturo Vidal's recovery and are confident that he will be back on the pitch soon, fully recovered and ready to help our team win more trophies this year.
