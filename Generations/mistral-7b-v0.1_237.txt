```python
from twilio.rest import Client

client = Client("ACCOUNT_SID", "AUTH_TOKEN")
message = client.messages.create(to="+19045338079", from_="+12146736904", body="I'm sorry to hear that.")
```

### Explanation:
In this example, we are using the Twilio REST API to send a text message.

First, we create a client object with our account SID and auth token. Next, we create a new message object and specify the `to` number, `from` number, and body of the message. Finally, we call the `create()` method on the message object to send the message.

The `+19045338079` is the phone number that will receive the text message and `+12146736904` is the number that the text message will be sent from. The `body` parameter is the text of the message that will be sent.
