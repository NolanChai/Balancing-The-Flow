Twitter has changed the way people post, comment and interact in a significant way. In my opinion, this change has made the site less useful and enjoyable for users who do not want their time wasted reading countless tweets from non-relevant users. Twitter has also failed to offer more than one option when it comes to customization of an individualâ€™s feed. There is no way for a user to filter out all messages from specific people or topics, which makes the site inefficient and annoying to use. The only thing that I can think of that Twitter could improve on would be the ability to view who you are following without opening each person's profile. As it stands now, you must click on a user's name to see if you are already following them or not. This is an issue because there are so many users and most people only have time to check their feeds at random times throughout the day. Also, if someone follows you and you follow back, they appear in your feed without being added as a person that you are following which can lead to confusion about what accounts are actually worth checking out for new information from them or not. In conclusion, I do not like these changes made by Twitter because it has changed my experience on their site dramatically for the worse and makes me less inclined to spend time there anymore when there are other social networks that offer much more useful functions than just posting status updates every few seconds!
