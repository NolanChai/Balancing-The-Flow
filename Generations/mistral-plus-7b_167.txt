Latin American nations voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to revoke Cuba’s suspension from the Organization of American States (OAS), a move that could pave the way for the return of the Cuban government to the regional body after nearly 50 years.
The vote, which took place at an OAS meeting in Honduras, was widely expected and reflects a growing trend in Latin America toward normalizing relations with Cuba. It also highlights the changing attitudes towards U.S.-Cuban relations as President Barack Obama has sought to improve ties with Havana.
The Cuban government suspended its membership in the OAS in 1962, after the organization voted to condemn the communist revolution and blockade the island nation. But in recent years, a number of Latin American countries have called for Cuba’s reinstatement, arguing that the decades-long freeze is outdated and no longer serves any purpose.
The vote on Wednesday was a resounding victory for Cuba, with all 34 member states voting to revoke its suspension. It marks a major shift in regional politics and will likely lead to increased diplomatic contacts between Havana and the OAS.
