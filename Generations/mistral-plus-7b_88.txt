A builder who whistled in the face of police officers during a Hong Kong protest march was today jailed for six weeks.

Freelance construction worker Hoi-kin Yim, 28, admitted his action at South Kowloon Court on Monday. He was fined Â£3,600 and sentenced to six weeks in jail.

Yim was arrested by police after he made the noise during a pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong last year. Police said that the whistling had caused disruption among fellow officers.

Hong Kong has seen a wave of anti-government protests since Beijing announced plans to introduce new electoral laws for the city, which would allow only people loyal to China's Communist Party to run for public office.
