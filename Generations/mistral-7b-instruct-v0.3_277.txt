 This sentence seems to be a dramatic statement that could potentially be part of a story or narrative. It suggests a near-death experience where a person was saved by something, in this case, the Bible. However, without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact circumstances and the tone of the narrative.

If we were to rewrite this sentence with a bit more clarity for a news article, it might look like this:

"A man narrowly escaped death when bullets intended for his heart were stopped by a Bible he was holding in his chest."
