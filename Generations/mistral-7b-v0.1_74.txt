The source article is from the Daily Mail. It appears to be a well written, factual and legitimate news story based on the information available at the time of publishing. The Daily Mail is not one of the more reputable sources out there, but I don't see anything in this article that would cause me to question the validity of it.

The article has been broken up into 5 paragraphs and each paragraph has a number of sentences. Sentences have been used as the basis for the structure of this analysis. The first paragraph is used as the overall context for the story, the second and third are used to establish who was involved in what happened and where it took place. The last two paragraphs are used to recount how the incident unfolded.

The author has included a number of quotes from people at the scene of the crash to give the story some depth and make it feel more real. A quote is used as the basis for each sentence in this analysis, with the exception of the first which uses the author's own words to set up the context.

The source article includes a number of facts, such as when and where the accident occurred, who was involved and what happened afterwards. These have been used in this analysis to create a list of things that happened during the incident. The order of these events has not been altered, but some information has been removed or rephrased to make the sentences more concise and easier to understand.
