The decision to arm all frontline officers with Tasers is not something that I would support at this time.  While I do agree that there needs to be a stronger force for law enforcement, it seems unnecessary to give every police officer a taser.  Instead, the training and education of police officers should be increased so that they can handle any situation without needing a weapon.
