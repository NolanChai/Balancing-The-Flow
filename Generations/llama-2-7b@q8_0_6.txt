[The answer](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/commentisfree/2017/mar/24/every-police-officer-in-britain-should-be-armed-with-a-taser) by [Simon Woolley](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/simonwoolley):
* A Taser is a less than lethal weapon, and that's great, but what if it is used inappropriately? What if you use the wrong taser setting on someone with epilepsy (the electric shock could cause them to have an epileptic seizure), or a mental health illness? The Taser has been shown by research to be more dangerous than pepper spray when used appropriately, but that's not always going to happen.
* You want your police force to be seen as legitimate and ethical in their actions - arming every officer with an electric weapon could make the public think otherwise.
