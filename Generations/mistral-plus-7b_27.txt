The exhumation of Mary Stauffer’s remains was done in a bid to obtain DNA evidence linking convicted killer Robert Pronge to the murder of the 7-year-old Illinois girl, who disappeared from her family farm in 1963 and whose body was later found in a nearby cornfield.
Pronge, now 80 years old, pleaded guilty last month to killing Mary and was sentenced to serve 25 years in prison. He has been incarcerated since 1974 for the unrelated murder of a 16-year-old girl.
Mary’s remains were buried at a cemetery near the farm, and her family had no objections to the exhumation.
