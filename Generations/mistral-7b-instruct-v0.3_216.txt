 According to a report by human rights groups, over 200,000 children in the United States experienced corporal punishment, such as spanking or paddling, in schools during the last academic year. This practice, while still legal in some states, has been criticized by many for potentially causing harm and violating children's rights. The report calls for a nationwide ban on this form of discipline in schools.
