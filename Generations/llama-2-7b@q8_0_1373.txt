The 34-year-old mum said that she felt "so isolated" after giving birth. She struggles to connect with other mums in the local area and is not able to have a conversation without feeling judged because of how her children behave or how she looks, and that it's hard to make friends as an adult.

Claire told Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langford: "I have so much love for my babies, I don't understand why I can't connect with other mums.
"My daughter is 18 months old now, she can't say a word yet, but people judge me by how she behaves."

She added that she does not feel "attractive", and tries to put on make-up, but cannot find time in her busy day as mum of two. She said: "I don't know why I can't just be accepted the way I am, it hurts my feelings."
