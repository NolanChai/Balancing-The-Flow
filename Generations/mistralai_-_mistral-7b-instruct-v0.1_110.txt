 The incident occurred in the city of Nanchang, Jiangxi province, in China.

According to local media reports, the thief stole a red car from a parking lot and sped off down the street, narrowly avoiding collisions with other vehicles before running into the back of a taxi. The impact caused the thief to lose consciousness for several seconds, but he managed to regain control of the car and continue driving recklessly.

As the car approached a busy pedestrian crossing, it hit several people, causing them to fall to the ground. The thief continued to speed towards the crossing, with the motor screeching as it approached the zebra line. Suddenly, the car skidded to a halt on the crossing, just inches from hitting the pedestrians.

The thief was taken to hospital and later arrested by police. He is expected to face charges of theft, assault, and driving under the influence.

The incident has been widely praised as an example of how technology can be used to prevent accidents and improve public safety. In addition to the zebra crossing sensors that alert drivers when they are approaching a pedestrian area, many modern cars now feature advanced safety features such as automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings. These technologies can help prevent collisions by automatically applying the brakes or steering the car away from danger.
