A couple whose Navy SEAL son was killed in Afghanistan have joined a class-action lawsuit against the government over the release of information about their son. The parents of Ryan Job, 22, say they were not consulted before his identity was released by the Department of Defense following a raid on an al Qaeda compound in Pakistan last month. Their lawyers claim that because the family were not given the option to have their son’s death kept private, it violates their privacy rights under federal law. The lawsuit also claims that releasing the information put the family at risk and caused ‘emotional distress’.
