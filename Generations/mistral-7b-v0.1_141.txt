I am glad that he is running for congress, he deserves a seat after what he did for the citizens of new york city. Itâ€™s time someone takes the spot who cares about others and can make decisions based on the safety of others not just his own. If it was me I would have ran into traffic to get away from that car as fast as possible, I would not have just called the cops.
