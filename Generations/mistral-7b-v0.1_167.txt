There's a lot going on here, and I don't know much about the background. The first thing that struck me was the word "rejected." That's not really what happened. It seems to me that the nations have decided to go around the U.S. in order to reincorporate Cuba into the OAS. I wonder if that's a good idea, or if it will actually be effective.
