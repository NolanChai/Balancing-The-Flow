 The Navy said it received a distress call from the ship, called the "Shahid Beheshti," and dispatched two warships to the area. One of them, the USS Ross, arrived in time to rescue one survivor who was clinging to debris in the water.

The survivor, whose name has not been released, is being treated at a medical facility on the USS Abraham Lincoln, according to a statement from the Navy. The other crew members are still missing and the cause of the sinking remains unknown.
