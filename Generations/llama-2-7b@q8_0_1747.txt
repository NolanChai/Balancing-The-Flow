* Her legs are not long enough to reach the ground, so she walks by leaning heavily on her mother's back legs.

### Explanation:

'Plodding' is a verb that means 'to walk slowly and with difficulty'. But because it doesn't have any object (which verbs normally have) you can use the subject of the sentence to replace the object. Therefore we could write: 'The young cow walks slowly and with difficulty... on her motherâ€™s back legs.'
