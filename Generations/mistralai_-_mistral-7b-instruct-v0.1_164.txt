 Yes, I can tell you more about this. It seems like there is a poster campaign being run in Cambridge to gather information from students. The posters are asking students to come forward with information related to various crimes and offenses that have been committed in the city. In exchange for this information, students are offered cash rewards.

It's important to note that providing information about illegal activities is always a serious matter, and it should only be done if you feel safe to do so. If you have any concerns or fears about coming forward with information, I would suggest contacting a local authority, such as the police or a community liaison officer. They can provide you with guidance and support, and help ensure that your safety is protected while providing the necessary information.
