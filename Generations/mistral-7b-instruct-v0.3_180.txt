 That's correct! The lawmakers of Uruguay have indeed approved a bill allowing same-sex marriages. Once the President signs it into law, same-sex couples will be able to marry in Uruguay. This is a significant step forward for LGBTQ+ rights in the country and a wonderful example of progress towards equality. Congratulations to all those who fought for this important legislation!
