The winger damaged knee ligaments playing for his country in a friendly against France and is now expected to be out until March, ruling him out of the start of Everton's Premier League campaign at Leicester on August 21 . Mirallas was signed by Everton for Â£ 4.5million from Olympiakos in January and went on to score three goals as they reached the Europa League final but he had a difficult start to life at Goodison Park, making only six appearances during an injury hit campaign. He has missed pre-season training because of his involvement with Belgium's World Cup qualifying matches against Estonia and Georgia .
