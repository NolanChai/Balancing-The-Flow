 A street vendor in Times Square is planning to run for Congress, according to a report by CNN. The vendor, known as "Mr. Faisal," told a local news outlet that he plans to run for Congress in the upcoming election and hopes to use his experience to promote safety in the city.

Mr. Faisal came to the United States from Yemen in 2009, and has been working as a street vendor in Times Square ever since. He told CNN that he first alerted police to the smoking vehicle after noticing a suspicious person nearby. When police arrived on the scene, they discovered explosives inside the vehicle, which were later linked to an attempted terrorist attack in Times Square.

Mr. Faisal is now working with law enforcement agencies to promote safety and prevent future attacks. He hopes to use his experience to run for Congress and advocate for stronger security measures in cities across the country.

It is not clear which political party Mr. Faisal plans to join or what specific issues he plans to focus on in his campaign.
