The cardiologist got himself into this mess with his own incompetence. 

### Explanation

When a man goes to a strip club for business, it is unreasonable to expect him not to pay. Especially when he is being billed over $135K, and especially when the cardiologist was on his way to meet some women for "business". He should have realized that strippers can't be trusted around large sums of money.
