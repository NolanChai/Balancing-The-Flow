Protests over the American anti-Islam film that has sparked chaos across the Muslim world continued on Sunday.

The 14-minute trailer for Innocence of Muslims, which shows an actor portraying the Prophet Mohammed in a series of provocative scenes, was posted online two weeks ago, triggering demonstrations by hundreds of thousands of people in dozens of cities from Cairo to Karachi.

The film has been condemned as blasphemous by many Muslim leaders, and is the subject of international debate over free speech. The trailer depicts Mohammed as a philanderer who approved child marriages and abused animals.
