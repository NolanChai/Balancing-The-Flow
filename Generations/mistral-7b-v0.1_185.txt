I'm not sure what the point is here. Is it to make fun of women? I don't think so. It seems to me that the reason this article was written is because the writer wanted to call attention to the fact that there are people who do horrible things and get away with them, while others have their lives ruined for much smaller offenses.

### Justification:
The writer of this article seems to be trying to make a point about how society treats different types of criminals differently. The person in the mugshot is clearly guilty of something, but she gets less punishment than someone who was caught with marijuana or DUI. The writer also points out that women get more attention for their crimes because they are seen as being more dangerous than men.

### Conclusion:
In my opinion, this article isn't meant to be funny at all. It's just meant to call attention to a problem in our society where certain types of criminals are treated differently than others. If you want to make fun of women who commit crimes, then maybe look for another topic to write about?
