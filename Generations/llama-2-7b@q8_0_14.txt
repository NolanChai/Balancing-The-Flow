This is not the first time that I've seen something like this happen in the news! I'm sure you know at least one or two friends who also has had their car break down because of a technical problem and it's always such an inconvenience for them. In this case, however, there are no technical problems with the vehicle...but that doesn't mean we can't help! If you have ever been in this situation before then please share your thoughts on how they could improve their car so they don't get stuck in these situations again.
