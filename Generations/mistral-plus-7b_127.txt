A United Airlines flight carrying an unaccompanied minor was forced to return to Washington’s Dulles International Airport on Thursday night after Chinese authorities raised concerns about the child.

United Flight 830, bound for Beijing, returned to Dulles because of a custody issue involving a 15-year-old boy who was traveling alone, according to United Airlines spokesman Charles Hobart.

The flight’s return to the airport in Virginia came after authorities in China raised concerns about the teen’s travel documents, Hobart said. The boy and his parents were met by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers upon their return.
