The berry season is only a short period but it will be worth your time to get these fresh fruits for a quick batch of jam before they rot on the bushes or in your fridge. This is why we want you to go and collect all these blackberries as quickly as possible, because the more you get the better!
### Solution:
The first thing you need to do is print out this screen from Google Chrome and bring it with you into the field. You should also have a ruler and a pen nearby in case we need some measurements for our instructions.
Now go ahead and collect as many blackberries as you can! You should get at least 100kg, but try to beat our record from last year which was over 250kg of berries. The more you have the better it will taste in your jam later on. Once you are done collecting the berries, return them all to the kitchen.
### Hints:
If you don't know where to start and need some help, then just ask around! There are many people who live close by that also want to go for a walk in nature. Go picking with friends!
