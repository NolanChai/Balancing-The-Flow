A single glance at him and you knew that he was different. He had no arms. He stood up to deliver his pitches from his knees. He wore glasses with two lenses taped together. 
He was an American original, a baseball novelty act on the road for seven decades in the minor leagues. His name was Moe Drabowsky and he threw hard enough -- if you looked past those extra eyes that stared right back at you.

"Moe's not afraid to pitch," said Larry Jaster, his catcher when they were both with the Baltimore Orioles in 1967. "He doesn't worry about himself; he just throws strikes."

In the mid-1980s, when Drabowsky was a coach for the California Angels, pitching coach Dick Bosman had the team watch Drabowsky on film to try and figure out how he could throw with two eyes. The lesson was simple: Don't try too hard.
"Moe is like an artist," Bosman said. "He just has a feel for what the ball does."
