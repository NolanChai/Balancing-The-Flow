 Yes, that's right. Snails are a popular dish in both France and England, particularly in French cuisine. They are typically cooked slowly over a wood fire, which is said to bring out their delicate flavors. While some people may find snails an unusual choice for dinner, they have been enjoyed by humans for centuries and are a staple of French haute cuisine.
