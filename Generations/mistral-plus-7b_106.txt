Ali-Mohamed Mohamud was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder for beating to death his 10-year-old son with a baseball bat. Prosecutors said that the boy, Abdifatah Ali-Mohamed, had been beaten by his father as punishment for not doing his homework. The boy died after being hospitalized from his injuries. Mohamud was arrested and charged with murder in August of this year.

The defense argued that the beating was an accident, but prosecutors presented evidence that Mohamud had a history of abusing his children. The jury found Mohamud guilty of second-degree murder after just one day of deliberations. He faces up to 40 years in prison.
