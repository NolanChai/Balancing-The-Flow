Rush Limbaugh has continued his attack on a student he called a "slut" for her views on contraception despite being ditched by advertisers and called out by the White House.

In an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan, Limbaugh refused to apologize for calling Georgetown Law School student Sandra Fluke a "slut" after she testified in support of health insurance coverage for birth control.

“I am not going to retract or take back what I said,” Limbaugh said. “I’m not going to apologize.”
