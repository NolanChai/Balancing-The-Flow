 The son, Joseph Corson, was convicted of conspiring with his father, William Bin Laden Corson, who was sentenced in 2018 to life imprisonment without parole for providing classified documents to an al-Qaeda affiliate.

Joseph Corson pleaded guilty in March to conspiring with his father to provide information to al-Qaeda's media arm, the Al-Nusra Front, and was sentenced to three years of probation and 100 hours of community service.

"Joseph Corson's actions were a betrayal not only of his country but also of his own family," said U.S. Attorney for the District of Oregon Billy J. Williams in a statement. "This sentence sends a clear message that espionage will not be tolerated, regardless of the motivations or background of the perpetrator."
