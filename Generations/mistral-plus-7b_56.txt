Adam Busby, 42, was arrested by police in Edinburgh last night after he allegedly emailed dozens of death threats to the universityâ€™s students and staff.
The Scottish separatist is believed to have threatened to blow up buildings on campus in revenge for Scotland losing its independence referendum in September.
He allegedly sent a total of 53 emails threatening explosions at Pittsburgh University in Pennsylvania, US. The FBI has opened an investigation into the threats.
