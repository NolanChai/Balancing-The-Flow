 year after being diagnosed with the deadly virus.

Little Isaac Johnson, 12, contracted the disease in the summer of 2015, just as the outbreak was taking hold in Liberia.

He spent several weeks at an Ebola treatment center in the country's capital Monrovia, where he underwent grueling treatments and isolation to prevent the spread of the virus to others.

But despite the hardships of his ordeal, little Isaac never lost his sense of humor and was a constant source of joy for the other patients at the center. He would often break out in dance, cheering up those around him with his infectious energy.

Today, one year later, little Isaac has been declared disease-free and is back home with his family, where he has become something of a local celebrity. His story of resilience and hope has inspired many others in his community to stay strong in the face of adversity.
