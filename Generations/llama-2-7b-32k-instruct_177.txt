üòä I'm not sure how to generate a caption that accurately reflects your feelings without more information. Can you provide me with some context or additional details? Perhaps the location, why you're leaving it, and what you'll miss about it? This will help me better understand your emotions and craft a caption that truly captures them. [/INST]
