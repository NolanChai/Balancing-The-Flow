`The following have responded with "I agree" or "Strongly Agree" (78.6%):`
- [Sue Brewster](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/suebrewster) "I wholeheartedly support this initiative."
- [Gerry O'Brien](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gerryobrien) "This is a great idea and I would love to be part of it. My friend had a baby after a miscarriage (we were both 32). We have been friends for over twenty years now so we are good at dealing with the issues that can arise from this experience."
- [Jules Leigh](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/julesleigh) "I'm very supportive of this initiative - as a 36 year old I had two miscarriages and they were emotionally devastating, particularly the second one after being pregnant for eight months (I was in denial that it could happen again)."
- [Amy Davies](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amydavies) "Absolutely agree - it's not just an idea though, I think the support given to women after a miscarriage is appalling and needs to be addressed by the NHS."
- [Katie Banks](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/katiebanks) "Yes! Would love to do this! My story is similar but with more of an age gap between us - I had my first at 32 after a miscarriage at 39. The latter was harder for me as it felt like we'd come so far and been through so much to have another chance. My husband was very supportive, as were my mum and friends. But the emotional effects are huge - I don't think anyone could fully appreciate this unless they've gone through it."
- [Matthew Tuck](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewwtuck) "Yes, I have been there and would welcome any support that I can offer to help others going through the same experience."
- [Clare Rice](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/clarerice) "I lost my son at 17 weeks due to an underlying condition. We were devastated, and our family and friends rallied round in a really positive way. It was comforting for me to talk about it, but it felt like nobody understood the depths of pain I experienced. The support I received from health professionals was excellent however. I would have loved to speak with someone who had been through a similar experience."
- [Sue Brewster](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/suebrewster) "I think this is an excellent idea. The emotional side of the impact on women who miscarry cannot be underestimated, and it could prove invaluable to support a woman through the whole process."
- [Matthew Tuck](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewwtuck) "Yes. I have lost two children after full term pregnancies. The first was 10 months ago and it's still so raw. Being around people who knew my story helped enormously, even though they had never been through the same process."
- [Sue Brewster](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/suebrewster) "Yes, I am in favour of this initiative - the impact on women can be devastating and many friends of mine have felt that they were not allowed to talk about it at all. This initiative would help those who are left behind to understand more what their partner or friend is going through."
- [Amy Davies](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/amydavies) "Absolutely agree - it's not just an idea though, I think the support given to women after a miscarriage is appalling and needs to be addressed by the NHS."
- [Sue Brewster](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/suebrewster) "I have been through this twice now, first at 29 then again at 40, so I totally understand how difficult it is for women to cope with the emotional and physical side of miscarriage. The impact on your future fertility can also be devastating for those who had already suffered a loss in earlier pregnancies."

- [Sue Brewster](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/suebrewster) "Yes - the emotional side of a miscarriage is very difficult to deal with, and this initiative would help support people through it in a positive way."
