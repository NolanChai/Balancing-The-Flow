* **Barry Eichengreen**:
    * 1) "The Chinese renminbi has become undervalued in recent years, because the Chinese government refuses to allow its currency to appreciate."
        * 2) This is simply false. The appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar was largely driven by capital outflows from China and domestic Chinese demand for dollars (see, e.g., Kyle Bass's excellent presentation [http://www.slideshare.net/KyleBassCapital/the-united-states-of-asia])
        * 3) And even if it were true that the renminbi is undervalued, there are good reasons to prefer an undervalued currency to a higher one (see [http://www.nber.org/papers/w8205.pdf], by me and Ken Rogoff).
* **Nouriel Roubini**:
    * 1) The Chinese renminbi is overvalued against the dollar, because the Chinese government refuses to allow its currency to appreciate. This means that the real exchange rate has appreciated significantly in recent years.
        * 2) As I explain in my op-ed [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/opinion/26roubini.html?scp=4&sq=nouriel%20roubini%20china&st=cse], the dollar is overvalued against the renminbi, because Chinese savings are greater than U.S. savings and China's current account surplus is large.
* **David Wessel**:
    * 1) The real exchange rate has appreciated significantly in recent years.
        * 2) I'm not sure how you can say that when the dollar-denominated price of oil has gone down by half and the dollar-denominated prices of imports from China (and other places) have risen only slightly less than the overall rise in the consumer price index.
* **Jared Bernstein**:
    * 1) I'd say that both statements are true, as long as you define "appreciation" and "overvalued" appropriately. But to be fair, Roubini does qualify his claim by saying that the dollar is overvalued against the renminbi, which is certainly accurate.
* **Lawrence Summers**:
    * 1) The Chinese renminbi has become undervalued in recent years. This means that the real exchange rate has depreciated significantly in recent years.
        * 2) I think the claim that it's appreciating against the dollar is right, but that seems like a fairly technical point and not much of an issue in the bigger picture.
* **Richard Posner**:
    * 1) The Chinese renminbi has become undervalued in recent years, because the Chinese government refuses to allow its currency to appreciate.
        * 2) The real exchange rate has appreciated significantly in recent years.
* **Edward Alden**:
    * 1) The Chinese renminbi is overvalued against the dollar, because the Chinese government refuses to allow its currency to appreciate. This means that the real exchange rate has depreciated significantly in recent years.
        * 2) The appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar was largely driven by capital outflows from China and domestic Chinese demand for dollars (see, e.g., Kyle Bass's excellent presentation [http://www.slideshare.net/KyleBassCapital/the-united-states-of-asia])
* **Joe Nocera**:
    * 1) I don't understand the question.
        * 2) If you mean, are they both correct, then the answer is "no." As Barry has explained, China is not undervalued, and as Richard has pointed out, China does allow its currency to appreciate (to a certain extent).
* **Jerry Bowyer**:
    * 1) The Chinese renminbi is overvalued against the dollar, because the Chinese government refuses to allow its currency to appreciate.
        * 2) The appreciation of the renminbi against the dollar was largely driven by capital outflows from China and domestic Chinese demand for dollars (see, e.g., Kyle Bass's excellent presentation [http://www.slideshare.net/KyleBassCapital/the-united-states-of-asia])
* **Stephanie Flanders**:
    * 1) I'm not sure either statement is true. But if you accept the view that there is an undervalued currency, then Roubini has it right. It's just a question of which one.
        * 2) As Barry explains in his op-ed (http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/26/opinion/26roubini.html?scp=4&sq=nouriel%20roubini%20china&st=cse), it's true that the renminbi is overvalued against the dollar, but it's also undervalued against the euro and most of the major emerging-market currencies. So I don't think Barry can be accused of not understanding the question.
* **Mohamed El-Erian**:
    * 1) Both statements are correct, though the way that each statement is phrased makes it sound as if they represent a "yes" or a "no." The Chinese renminbi is overvalued against the dollar (it has appreciated significantly in recent years), but the real exchange rate (the purchasing power of its currency measured in U.S. dollars) has depreciated significantly in recent years.
        * 2) In addition to Barry and Richard's responses, it would be helpful if David explained why he believes that the dollar is overvalued against the renminbi. I don't think that most economists agree with him, as China continues to accumulate large net capital flows into dollars.
        * 3) Jared's response is also useful because it provides some nuance on Barry's viewpoint.
