 It seems like you've shared a news headline about Nicklas Bendtner being investigated by Arsenal due to some mysterious "bizas." However, the article itself is not provided, so I can't elaborate on the details of the incident.

In general terms, if a professional athlete is under investigation for any kind of misconduct, it could lead to fines, suspensions, or even termination of their contract, depending on the nature and severity of the infraction. In this case, since Arsenal has opened an internal investigation, they are likely trying to gather more information before taking any further action.

It's also worth noting that "bizas" is not a common term in English, so if it was used in the original article, there may have been some translation issues or colloquial language involved. Without knowing the exact context in which the word was used, it's difficult to make an accurate assessment of the situation.

If you'd like more information about this story, I would recommend looking up the full article or finding additional sources that provide more details on the incident.
