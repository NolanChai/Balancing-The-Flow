I think you should have used a regex to match the whole sentence and then split the string in a list of words.

#### 1st:
```python
import re

string = "CNN: Jon Hamm has to have throat surgery, but it doesn't sound like it will keep the actor down for long."

pattern = re.compile("Jon Hamm") #pattern is a regex
words = pattern.findall(string)
```
### 2nd:
```python
import re

string = "CNN: Jon Hamm has to have throat surgery, but it doesn't sound like it will keep the actor down for long."

pattern = re.compile("Jon Hamm") #pattern is a regex
words = pattern.findall(string)
for word in words:
	print (word) 
```
#### 3rd:
```python
import re

string = "CNN: Jon Hamm has to have throat surgery, but it doesn't sound like it will keep the actor down for long."

pattern = re.compile("Jon Hamm") #pattern is a regex
words = pattern.findall(string)
print (words) 
```
#### 4th:
```python
import re

string = "CNN: Jon Hamm has to have throat surgery, but it doesn't sound like it will keep the actor down for long."

pattern = re.compile("Jon Hamm") #pattern is a regex
words = pattern.findall(string)
for word in words:
	print (word) 
```
