* The doctor didn't advise her to delay the surgery as it would be too late. He was just being a coward and scared that he might lose one of his patients if he went for an operation before she gave birth. So in other words, this is just another case of a patient dying because of a doctors incompetence and not their choice. The patient should have known better than to trust her doctor.
* I think that the doctors response was too harsh. If it wasn't for that person's baby she would be dead now, so there is no need for him to treat her like that.
* Well the Doctor didn’t really mean that, but he is just using it as an excuse because of his incompetence. He couldn’t do the surgery on her and if he did then the baby would be dead. It was more of an excuse than anything else. He should have just done the operation before she gave birth, even if there was a slight risk for the baby that it could die.
* I don't think that the doctor's response was harsh, and he did his best to explain things to her but she wasn't listening because she wanted everything her way. She had made up her mind that she didn't want to do anything so she should have just listened to the doctor instead of arguing with him.
* I think it is a little harsh what the Doctor did, as they are meant to treat patients and not judge them. They shouldn’t really be making comments like that on patients. Although I feel for the mother because she has a terminal disease but there isn't much he could do so in some ways you can understand him.
* I don't think it was harsh, as it was his job to tell her not to have an operation. If she didn't listen then that would be her problem and the doctor wouldn’t be blamed for it. She should of listened to what he said to begin with but if she didn't then that is down to her.
* I think the Doctor was too harsh because she could have died anyway as there was a chance she might lose the baby and she may never have been able to have children again.
* In my opinion I feel it wasn’t harsh, as they are just doing their jobs. They can’t help but give the patient what they want if they don’t listen to them or follow instructions then its down to them that they die. However I do feel sorry for her as she was going through a lot of pain and stress at this point in time and it wouldn’t have been easy having an operation on her stomach.
* If the doctor didn't advise her against it then she might not be here now. The doctors have to follow there own rules when carrying out surgery as they can only go by what there is written down. So if he had done this surgery and lost one of his patients, he would lose his job for going against the protocol.
* I think that the doctor’s response was not harsh because it was her decision to do the operation in the first place. It was also her choice whether or not she wanted to do the treatment that was needed so he couldn't really be blamed for telling her what she had done. She should have just listened and maybe then this would never happened.
* I think the doctor's response wasn’t too harsh, as she could have died anyway if there was a chance that she might lose the baby as well. She chose not to listen to him so it wouldn't be his fault if he lost her patient and in some ways you can understand how upset he must of been at this situation because of all the suffering that they were both going through at this point.
* I don’t think its harsh as it is what she wanted in the first place. If she wasn't willing to go for an operation then it shouldn’t have come to that, and if he had done it before her baby was born then there would be a chance that they both could of died. It was all her fault really, but I do feel sorry for her because she is suffering from cancer.
* I think the doctor's response was not harsh as it was just his way of doing things. He wasn’t trying to upset anyone or make them sad when he said that they should wait till after the baby was born and then maybe one day in the future there might be a chance for her to have another operation done on her stomach.
* I think it's harsh, but the doctor is just following his instructions from his bosses because he is afraid of getting into trouble with them if he did something that they told him not to do. It would also be really bad for his career so he has to follow what his boss tells him even if it means putting patients in danger sometimes like this one did by not taking care of himself properly when he got cancer instead of having an operation before things became too late.
* I don't think the doctor was harsh, as she did have a choice whether or not to listen to what he said and do the operation on herself. However, if she didn’t want it then this wouldn’t be happening now because she would still be alive today and she could have had children with her husband in future years.
* I don't think that the doctor was harsh or anything like that but what he said is true as there are some risks involved in doing any operation on a patient who is pregnant. If they do it before then there will be more chance of something going wrong during delivery and if after than there's no guarantee that she won’t lose her child when having the surgery done after giving birth anyway.
* I don’t think he was being harsh, as in some ways you can understand why he said what he did to her. If things didn't go well for her baby then it wouldn’t be his fault because she knew what risks were involved with the operation so there is no excuse from him or anyone else if anything happens during delivery.
* I don't think that the doctor was harsh at all, as he was just giving her the facts about how much of a risk it would be for her to have an operation on her stomach and whether or not it would affect the baby in any way. If she didn’t want him to go ahead with doing anything then there isn't really much that anyone else can do because they know what is best for them when making these decisions so we should just respect their wishes instead of arguing with them about how dangerous this might be for them all along the line until something goes wrong.
* I think the doctor was right to tell her she couldn't have an operation on herself because there would be more risk involved in doing it while pregnant then if he waited till after giving birth so that way everything will work out fine when they have their child and don’t get anything bad happening during delivery either.
* I think the doctor was a little harsh but I also feel sorry for her because she is going through all this pain at the moment and it's not easy having an operation on your stomach especially while being pregnant so that would be really hard if you had to deal with that as well.
* I think the doctor was right in telling her not to have an operation when she knew there were risks involved because this way everything will work out fine for both of them now instead of something happening during delivery which could cause more problems down the line later on if things don't go according to plan like they should be.
* I think that the doctor was right in telling her not to have an operation while she is pregnant because there are risks involved with this kind of thing especially when you do it yourself without any help from someone else so if something happens then at least everything will work out fine now instead of having more problems later down the line.
