 Thousands of people gathered on Sunday in cities across the Middle East, including Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq, to protest against Israel's actions in Gaza. They chanted slogans such as "We are all Palestinians" and "From Cairo to Jerusalem, we stand with Gaza."

The protests were sparked by the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza. The latest round of fighting began on May 10th and has resulted in the deaths of more than 40 Palestinians, including civilians and children.

Many Arab governments have condemned Israel's actions and called for an end to the violence. However, some critics have accused these governments of not doing enough to help the people of Gaza. They argue that the blockade imposed on the territory by Israel and its allies has made it nearly impossible for Palestinians to rebuild their homes, hospitals, and schools after each conflict.

The protests also highlighted the growing frustration among Arab citizens with their own governments, particularly those in Egypt and Jordan. These countries have been criticized for not doing enough to help Palestinian refugees who have fled from Syria and other conflicts in the region.

The situation in Gaza remains tense, with no end to the conflict in sight. The international community continues to call for a ceasefire and for humanitarian aid to be delivered to the people of Gaza.
