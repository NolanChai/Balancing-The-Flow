A mother has shed more than half her body weight for the festive season after being disgusted with how she looked in a family photograph . Sarah Duff, 48, who weighed 23st and had an 18in waist before beginning a crash diet in March last year, is now 9st 7lb. She went from size 22 to 8-10 clothes sizes and said she has never felt so good . Sarah, from Dagenham, Essex, who used to be able to eat up to six bags of crisps a day, says it was the shame of being overweight that drove her to lose weight. She decided to embark on the diet after seeing herself in an old family photograph taken 15 years ago . "I looked awful," she told The Sun newspaper . "In the photo I look so sad and uncomfortable, which is exactly how I felt all of the time." She added: "I never used to care what other people thought. But my kids have grown up in an environment where it's not OK to be fat, because they were made to feel ashamed and embarrassed by me . That was the biggest motivation for me." Sarah now plans to stay slim after Christmas, when she hopes to weigh 9st 3lb. She said: "I can still eat a little bit over Christmas but I'm not going to be eating five pints of ice cream like I used to ."
