**F**

### Explanation:

This is an instance of the _bait-and-switch_ con trick whereby a salesperson lures customers with a low-cost option, then switches them to a more expensive one. In this case, homeowners are being sold on the idea that estate agents will help sell their property for just £100 commission.

But what many people don’t realise is that this is an introductory fee and there may well be other fees and charges involved once the sale has taken place. Estate agents often charge more than 3% to sell a house, which amounts to thousands of pounds in some cases.
