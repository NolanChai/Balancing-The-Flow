 Brian Byers, 31, was arrested and charged with operating under the influence of alcohol, vehicular manslaughter, and leaving the scene of an accident after crashing his relative's car into another vehicle near Interstate 68 in Pennsylvania on September 25th.

According to police, Byers had been driving with a blood alcohol concentration of .19%, almost twice the legal limit, when he lost control of the car and struck a motorcycle driven by David Smith, 47. Smith died from his injuries, while Byers sustained minor injuries.

To cover up the accident, Byers allegedly fabricated a story that he had hit a patch of black ice on the road, which caused him to lose control of the car and crash into the motorcycle. Police say they found no evidence of black ice at the scene of the accident.

Byers also failed to stop at the scene of the accident and fled the area. He was later located and arrested by Sparta police.
