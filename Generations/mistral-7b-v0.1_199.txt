The image above is an example of a common eyepatch.

It's worn by people who have lost vision in one eye (monocular blindness) because they have had that eye removed or have suffered an injury to it.

Eyepatches are also used for cosmetic reasons or as part of costumes and uniforms, but the most common reason to wear them is to cover a damaged eye or protect an injured eye from further damage.
