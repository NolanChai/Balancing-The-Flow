Google has defended its use of personal data to advertise on web pages, saying it is in line with regulations.

### Hints:
- There was no mention of the UKâ€™s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) investigation into Google.
- The CMA launched an investigation into Google's plans to use third-party cookies for advertising after the internet giant said it would phase out its own cookies in 2022.
