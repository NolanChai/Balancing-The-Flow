 It seems you've mentioned two names, Albert Buitenhuis and his wife Marthie, but haven't specified what exactly you need for them or about them. Here are some possibilities based on common uses of those names:

1. If you're asking for information about Albert Buitenhuis and Marthie, I'm unable to provide specific details as I don't have access to personal data. However, if they are public figures or have a notable online presence, you may be able to find more about them through internet research.

2. If you need assistance with a task related to Albert Buitenhuis and Marthie, such as sending an email or making a call on their behalf, I'm afraid I can't help with that either, as it would involve personal information and potentially impersonation.

3. If you want me to generate a conversation between Albert Buitenhuis and Marthie, here's a friendly example:

Albert: "Hey, Marthie! How was your day at work?"
Marthie: "Hello, Albert! It was quite busy today, but everything went well. How about yours?"
Albert: "Same here, but I managed to finish that project I've been working on."
Marthie: "That's great, Albert! We can celebrate with dinner tonight."
Albert: "Sounds like a plan, my love!"
