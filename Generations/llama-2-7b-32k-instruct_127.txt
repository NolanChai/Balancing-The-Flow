A United spokeswoman said that the plane landed at 7: 48 p.m. ET on a precautionary basis after receiving an anonymous tip from someone who called the FBI's hotline, which is "usually reserved for people reporting lost or missing children," CNN reported.
"We are working with local law enforcement to gather more information about this incident and we will have more details as they become available," said United spokeswoman Charity Scribner.
The flight's crew, including pilots and attendants, was questioned by federal authorities in the departure area of Dulles International Airport after returning from Beijing, according to a statement released by the Department of Homeland Security. A government official told CNN that the tip did not come directly from the FBI; instead it came through an intermediary agency.
A source with knowledge of the incident said authorities are treating this case as an abduction investigation. The child is described as 5 or 6 years old, the source said, adding that the child's parents were not in the area to meet the flight when it returned from Beijing.
