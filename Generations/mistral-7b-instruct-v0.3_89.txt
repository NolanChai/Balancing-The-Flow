 It seems like you're sharing a news article about the display of a First World War hero's personal items. Here's how I'd rephrase it for a more conversational tone:

"Steph Cockroft shared some interesting news! Ninety-nine years after his death, the last possessions of 36-year-old Harold Llewellyn Twite are now on public display. Among them are a stopped watch, pipe, and other personal effects that belonged to this World War I hero."

If you'd like, I can also help expand on the story by finding additional information about Harold Llewellyn Twite or provide more context about his life and contributions during the war. Let me know if you need any help with that!
