Obama’s goal of closing Guantanamo will have an impact beyond symbolism and rhetoric. As soon as the order is signed, the transfer process begins, with a whole host of legal and logistical questions that must be resolved. First, do all detainees get released or are some going to face prosecution? Will they go back home to their country of origin if that’s even possible? If they are being sent somewhere else in the world, where will they be housed?

The process can take months and requires a number of logistical steps. The Defense Department must figure out how many detainees remain, what conditions they’re kept in (the 800-cell detention center at Guantanamo has been the subject of numerous lawsuits over poor medical care), where they come from and where they will end up, all while providing an adequate level of security.
