Florida Governor Rick Scott signed this week what could become one of the most controversial bills to come out of Florida in decades . The bill (SB 176) has already been dubbed the "stand your ground" law by gun advocates and critics alike. Supporters say it will protect Floridians from being charged with a crime if they use deadly force, even when they have the option to retreat. Critics call the new law dangerous because it eliminates the duty to retreat in public places as well as private homes when there is a threat of serious harm.  
Governor Scott has said he thinks it's common sense for people to defend themselves with deadly force, but opponents disagree . The NAACP says the law could have repercussions for African Americans . "We believe that the 'stand your ground' bill is racially motivated because of its disproportionate impact on African American communities," said Adora Obi Nweze, president of the Florida State Conference NAACP. She said minorities are often under attack in public places and if this law passes, they may feel their safety is threatened even more .  
The Miami Herald reports that law enforcement officials do not plan to charge Robert Powell after fatally shooting 21 - year - old Trayvon Martin . They believe the new law would protect Powell. Powell says he was attacked by Martin, who threw a punch at him after asking for directions."  
Florida is home to more than nine million people -- many of whom carry guns and many of whom are African American . The state has had some of the most deadly shootings in the country with one particularly infamous incident sparking nationwide protests in 2013 . In that case, George Zimmerman fatally shot Trayvon Martin, a black teenager who was unarmed.  
The police initially arrested Zimmerman on charges of second - degree murder . But prosecutors later dropped the case after they said there wasn't enough evidence to support it.  
A special prosecutor then charged Zimmerman with third - degree murder, claiming he provoked the confrontation that led to Martin's death."
