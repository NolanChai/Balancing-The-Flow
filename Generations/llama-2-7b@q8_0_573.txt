- In order to be able to make requests and receive responses we must have some sort of interface through which we can communicate with the system.

### Input:

- The user makes a request by typing in text (or giving an input) into a box provided by the computer.

### Processing:

- The computer processes these inputs and then outputs information to the user in response to each of the user's inputs.

### Output:
- These can take many forms, including a verbal (e.g., spoken or written) response from an assistant program, as well as visual responses on the screen or the computer's speaker. 

### Example:
- In a chatbot, the user is usually given the ability to type questions and comments into the system, and then the computer outputs responses based on predefined rules. This gives users the experience of conversing with a person through their computer.
