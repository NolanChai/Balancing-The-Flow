 Yes, it is true that Roy Hodgson came under criticism for disclosing Raheem Sterling's statement about feeling tired before the England-Estonia Euro 2016 qualifier. Some people felt that Hodgson should not have made this information public and should have respected Sterling's privacy. Others, however, argued that it was important for fans to know that the player was feeling rested and ready to play at his best. It ultimately depends on one's perspective and how much weight they place on transparency versus respect for privacy in sports management.
