 It seems that California officials are taking action to address prison overcrowding as ordered by the U.S. Supreme Court. They have stated that they will not arbitrarily release 33,000 inmates but will instead submit plans within two weeks detailing strategies to alleviate overcrowding. These plans will be submitted to federal courts for review. This is a significant step towards addressing the issue of prison overcrowding in California.
