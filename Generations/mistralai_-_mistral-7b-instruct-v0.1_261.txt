 Sheffield United fans are divided on whether the club should re-sign Ched Evans, who was released from prison for rape this week. Some supporters feel that Evans deserves another chance and believe he can make a positive contribution to the team, while others argue that he does not deserve the opportunity to play again due to his conviction. The decision will ultimately be up to the club and its management team.
