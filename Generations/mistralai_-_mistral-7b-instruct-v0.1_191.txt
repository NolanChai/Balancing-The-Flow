 Title: US Takes Over Libya

Summary: The United States announced on Thursday that it will take over command of NATO forces in Libya. This move comes after weeks of protests against Muammar Gaddafi's regime and a U.S.-led coalition launching air strikes to protect civilians. President Obama said the goal is to help transition Libya into a democratic government, but some critics say this could lead to a long-term military commitment.
