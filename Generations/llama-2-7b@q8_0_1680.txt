* ... Rolf Harris was convicted of child abuse, the town decided to remove his artwork. The town council in Port Fairy has announced plans to replace Mr Harris's work with that of Australian indigenous artist Nora Heysen, whose father was a leading Australian painter of the 20th century. ...

### Hints:

* ... the artist Rolf Harris has been removed from the public eye.
* ... his artwork will be replaced by someone else's.
* ... Rolf Harris is being forgotten because he was convicted of child abuse.
* ... there is no reference to "removing" anything in Port Fairy, just to replacing Mr Harris's work with Nora Heysen's.
* ... the sentence is constructed as a question: What has begun to wipe Rolf Harris from the memory?
