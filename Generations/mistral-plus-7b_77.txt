Memory loss: Forgetting where you put your keys or someone's name is a perfectly normal part of the aging process and well underway by the age of 40, scientists have said. The study conducted at University College London found that people forget about half the new information they encounter in a day. As we get older we become increasingly likely to experience memory loss. This is because changes occur in parts of the brain involved with storing and recalling memories. Scientists have identified two main types of memory loss: transient or temporary memory loss, which is usually caused by stress; and permanent or long-term memory loss, which is more serious and can be caused by illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease.
