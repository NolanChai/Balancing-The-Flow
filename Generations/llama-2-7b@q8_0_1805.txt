(CNN) -- In his final years before he was assassinated in 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. launched what would become the largest grass roots movement in our nation's history - the Poor People's Campaign, which brought poor Americans to Washington, D.C., and challenged the federal government for jobs, income support, housing, education, health care and voting rights.

The National Day of Service this Saturday is a fitting tribute to Dr. King because it draws on the example set by so many who put their lives on the line to secure better treatment and opportunities for African-American citizens in the South.

Dr. King's dream was always about ending poverty, not just inequality or injustice. And we are still a long way from his vision of the Beloved Community where we are "all tied together" with an undying commitment to "brotherhood," regardless of our race or creed.
