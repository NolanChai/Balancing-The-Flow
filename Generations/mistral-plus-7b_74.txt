The estranged wife of the driver who was at the wheel of a limousine that burst into flames killing five people, has accused him of being 'very reckless' behind the wheel.

Kimberly King said her former husband, Mark Usiak, was a heavy drinker and always pushed his luck behind the wheel.

She told the Daily News: 'He was always pushing it to the edge. He loved driving fast - he would always be going over the speed limit.'

She added that she had filed for divorce from Usiak in February after discovering he had been cheating on her with multiple women.

The 31-year-old driver, who had two young children from his previous marriage, was reported to have been drinking prior to the crash.

Usiak, who worked as a chauffeur for Presidential Limo Service in Brooklyn, is being treated at Staten Island University Hospital for severe burns.
