Born in the 6th century and brought up as an Orthodox Christian monk by his mother, Pope Cyril V was chosen for the papacy in 1294. But he soon renounced his faith and joined a cult devoted to an Egyptian sage called Hermes Trismegistus. He became known as the 'Greek Pope' and is credited with inventing the game of chess. Last month, however, a historian claimed that Cyril had another talent: astrology. Now his 95-year-old daughter has accused an academic of defaming her father's memory in a new book, which suggests he was 'mentally unbalanced'. Scroll down for video . Nicolas Sarkozy is said to be in a state of 'incomprehension' after being accused of accpeting a bribe by the historian who wrote the book . Pope Cyril V - whose full name was Constantine Lascaris (left) and the Greek Pope - has been accused of using astrology. The accusation comes from his daughter (right), who is said to have had a 'heated exchange' with Sarkozy (below right). He denied accepting bribes . Cyril V, born Nicolas Sarcos, was elected in 1294 after Pope Celestine V resigned in less than five months. The pope spent his reign battling the Italian city-state of Genoa and then the Papal States, which he unsuccessfully sought to join with the Holy Roman Empire. A short biography on the Vatican website states that Cyril 'led a very austere life' and was an 'ardent defender of the orthodox faith'. In 1305, he handed over the papacy to Benedict XI after being attacked by Genoese troops, who were backed up by King Philip IV. But he returned from exile in 1328 at the age of 74 and declared that he had changed his mind about becoming a monk - and had instead become a follower of Hermes Trismegistus. The claim was made by Sarkozy, who has written three books on astrology . After Cyril's death in 1336, Pope Benedict XII declared that he had never been a Christian at all but rather an Egyptian pagan. The Greek Orthodox Church denounced him as an apostate and his bones were dug up from the tomb of St Peter's Basilica in Rome for reburial. But Sarkozy has dismissed the Vatican account, saying that he had been told by a papal secretary that Cyril's Christianity was a 'show' - and that he only became an astrologer after retiring to a monastery. He says that the pope changed his name to Constantine Lascaris before leaving Rome in 1295, and claimed that the monk had been given a prophecy by Hermes Trismegistus on Mount Athos that he would be 'a great ruler'. Cyril became a hermit there but left to join an order of ascetics called the Monks of St Sabbas near Jerusalem. The historian claimed that this was where he met an Egyptian named Abu Ma'shar, who told him: 'The time is ripe for you.' Sarkozy claims that Cyril then decided to become a hermit - and, when he returned to Rome in 1309, used his knowledge of astrology to predict the deaths of two cardinals. He says the pope's former secretary told him: 'He knew things no one else could have known.' In his latest book on astrology, Sarkozy says that Cyril was 'a great expert in this field'. He claims he has documents showing that the pope used astrological charts to determine when to call a council of cardinals and when to launch an attack. The historian denies accepting bribes . According to Sarkozy, Cyril also had 'astounding' insights into other people - including Pope Urban V (left) who died in 1370 and Cardinal Albornoz (right), the pope's legate in Italy from 1342 until his death in 1367 . Sarkozy also claims that Cyril had a 'striking influence on the popes of Avignon', who were based in France during their papacy between 1309 and 1378. According to Sarkozy, he made 'astounding' insights into other people - including Pope Urban V who died in 1370 and Cardinal Albornoz, the pope's legate in Italy from 1342 until his death in 1367. The historian says that the 'famous astrologer' was also able to predict the exact time of Urban V's death - which would have been a major scandal if he had not died as soon as he left France. Sarkozy claims Cyril's daughter, Eugenia Lascaris, has made statements accusing him of accepting a bribe from his publishers in return for praising the pope. She is said to have told him: 'You will be brought to court and sentenced.' When he was asked by her lawyer about the accusations last week, Sarkozy reportedly replied: 'I have never received any money in my life... I am a poor old man.' He denied having been offered bribes for positive reviews of his books. According to a newspaper report, Eugenia is said to be 'in a state of incognition and deep depression'. Sarkozy claims he was also threatened with 'physical violence' during an interview last week by a man called Vasilis Iliopoulos, who is said to have shouted: 'You are the worst of humanity.' The historian has now asked for protection from prosecutors in Athens, who could bring criminal charges against Eugenia. He also wants police protection while he gives evidence at Eugenia's home in Athens - which she reportedly refuses to leave. A court date has been set for June 27 and Sarkozy says he will be 'totally free' of the accusations by then. Scroll down for video .

Sarkozy has asked prosecutors in Athens (pictured) to protect him from Eugenia's threats. A court date has been set for June 27 when he says he will be 'totally free of the accusations' . Eugenia Lascaris, who is now a nun, also denies accepting bribes in return for praise of her father and his use of astrology to predict papal deaths. The academic has claimed that Cyril's former secretary had told him that he was 'totally unbalanced' . She said: 'This is a ridiculous accusation.' Sarkozy says Eugenia, now 95, has been trying for years to discredit her father and his work. According to the historian, Cyril's former secretary had told him that he was 'totally unbalanced' - which he thinks explains why his daughter is so angry with him. He claims that Eugenia has always resented the attention he gave her father after she herself became a nun. Sarkozy says there were 'tremendous conflicts' between Cyril and Eugenia, who was known as an 'independent-minded girl'. She apparently wanted to be a nun but was told by her father that monks could not marry. Her son - also called Nicolas - married instead. In 1943, his wife became a nun too and the couple had five children together, two of whom are still alive today in Athens. Eugenia's son, who has taken over as head of the order to which she belongs, says that there was 'nothing unusual' about Cyril's work. He said: 'This is an old tradition.' The historian is now seeking protection from prosecutors in Athens . Sarkozy claims Eugenia has also tried to discredit him and his work on astrology . Sarkozy has written three books on the subject, including a biography of Cyril V. He claims that his other two works - which have sold more than 50,000 copies in Greece alone - are accurate accounts of events. 'This is my life,' he said. 'I am not a charlatan.' Last year, he was accused of defaming former Greek prime minister Giorgos Papandreou over his use of astrology to decide when to call an election and when to announce new austerity measures. The historian denies that allegation too . Last year, he was also accused of defaming former Greek prime minister Giorgos Papandreou (right) over his use of astrology - which Sarkozy says was the reason for his resignation in 2011. 'When I called him a charlatan, that meant it was an insult to astrologers,' said Sarkozy. 'That is not what I intended.' Papandreou has also denied any knowledge of astrology and says he does not use charts for major decisions. He told reporters: 'I am not an astrologer but it was
