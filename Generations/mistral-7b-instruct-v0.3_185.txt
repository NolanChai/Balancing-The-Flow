 It seems like you've shared a news headline from The Daily Mail about a case involving Alicia Gray. However, the information you've provided is incomplete. To provide a more accurate response, I would need more details about the case, such as where it took place, what exactly the charges were, and any other relevant facts.

For instance, if we were to look at this case based on the information given, here's an example of how I might rephrase it:

In January 2014, Alicia Gray pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree sodomy and one count of a related offense in an unspecified location. The specific details about the case are not fully disclosed in the headline you provided.
