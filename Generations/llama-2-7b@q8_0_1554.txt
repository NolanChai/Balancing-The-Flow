(UNSAFE) -- This is an incorrect statement as there are many steps that can be taken to prevent leaked information. The leak of thousands of classified documents was a result of poor security practices and not something that could have been stopped from happening. It's too late to stop the information from being published, but there are still measures that can be implemented to minimize the damage done by this leak.
