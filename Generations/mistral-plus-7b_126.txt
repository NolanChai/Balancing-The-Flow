Arsenal’s financial results for the 2013-14 season, published on Friday afternoon, reveal record levels of ‘free’ cash sitting in the club’s bank account, £173.3m at the end of May, much of which should theoretically have been available - and be available - for Arsene Wenger as a transfer kitty.
However, according to the club’s accounts, only £48.5m was spent on transfers in the 2013-14 season and this is where the controversy arises. The majority of that £173.3m available to spend on players should have been used but hasn’t been. This is where many fans are left scratching their heads because if Wenger was so keen to keep his squad together, why didn’t he use the money at his disposal?
The answer is simple: Arsenal don’t want to pay over-the-odds for players. They believe that they can get by with what they already have and while this may be true in some cases, there are areas of the squad where upgrades should have been made. The likes of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Calum Chambers were brought in, but why weren’t there more new faces?
The problem that Arsenal face is that they can’t afford to pay over-the-odds for players because it would disrupt their business model. They need to keep their costs down and as a result of this, they are often left behind when it comes to the transfer market. It seems like Wenger doesn’t want to break the mould and spend big on new signings but at some point, he needs to take a risk. The squad is in desperate need of an upgrade and if Arsenal don’t make significant investments this summer, they could find themselves falling further behind their rivals.
