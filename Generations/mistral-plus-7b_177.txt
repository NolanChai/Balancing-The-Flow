Most Premier League footballers these days are more than a little guarded. They’re like clams, protecting their pearls of wisdom in the knowledge that any slip of the tongue or momentary lapse of concentration could be costly.

Take Harry Kane, for example. The Tottenham Hotspur striker is one of the most-watched footballers in the world. He’s been through a lot over the past few years – he’s scored goals, won trophies and even led his country to the World Cup semi-finals. Yet despite all this success, Kane remains incredibly guarded when it comes to talking about himself and his career.

He rarely gives interviews, preferring instead to let his football do the talking for him. When he does speak publicly, he tends to stick to short, general statements about his team or the game in general, avoiding any specifics that could be used against him later on. This kind of guardedness is common among top-level professional athletes these days – they’re taught from a young age that every word they say can and will be used against them by their opponents or by the media. So it’s no surprise that Kane and many other Premier League players are so careful with what they say in public.
