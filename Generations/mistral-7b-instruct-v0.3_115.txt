 According to a report from CNN, Texas Presbyterian Hospital admitted that they made mistakes in their treatment of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan. Dr. Daniel Varga, the hospital's chief clinical officer, stated that the hospital fell short in several areas, starting with not asking the right questions during the emergency room assessment. This oversight may have contributed to Duncan being sent home initially, despite showing symptoms of Ebola. The hospital has since implemented new protocols and measures to ensure similar mistakes are avoided in the future. It is important for healthcare facilities to be vigilant and follow proper procedures when dealing with infectious diseases like Ebola to protect both patients and staff.
