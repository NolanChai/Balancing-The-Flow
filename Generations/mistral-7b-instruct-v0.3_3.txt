 It seems like the article you're referring to is about an episode of "Cake Boss" that was pulled from TLC's future screening schedules due to complaints. However, I don't have specific details about the content of the episode or the nature of the complaints since I don't have access to external sources. If you could provide more context or ask a specific question related to this topic, I'd be happy to help further!

For example, if you want to know how often TV shows are pulled from airing due to complaints, or if there are any common reasons for this, I can do some research and try to find answers for you.
