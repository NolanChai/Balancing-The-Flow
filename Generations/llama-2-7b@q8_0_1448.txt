(CNN) -- "Muslim parents have no right to threaten their kids with violence, and they should be prosecuted for making threats," said Ryan Mauro of the Clarion Project, an organization that seeks to combat Islamic extremism.

### Answer:
**Both of them are right!** The Muslim teenager is correct in saying her father threatened to kill her because she converted to Christianity (or any other religion). This kind of violence or intimidation can't be tolerated at all and should be punished.

The CNN reporter is also correct in saying that this doesn't happen often, but it does happen sometimes. For example, the [Clarion Project](http://clarionproject.org) says there are many examples where Muslim parents have threatened to kill their children if they convert to Christianity or any other religion.
