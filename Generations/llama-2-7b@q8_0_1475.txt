In the absence of an overnight delay, Levyâ€™s 73 was his worst score of the week but still good enough for a one-shot lead over England's Sam Horsfield, who signed off with a 68 after recovering from an opening 75.

### Explanation:
Colsaerts and Levy were tied atop the leaderboard after three rounds of the event. Colsaerts fired a 72 while Levy carded 71. Both players had finished two shots ahead of their nearest competitors, meaning that there was no one in sight for them going into the final day.

### Scores:
Belgian Nicolas Colsaerts had a tough time getting up and down on the par-five 18th after finding rough off the tee, leaving him with a difficult second shot. A long putt would have given him an outside chance of a birdie to force a playoff but he missed from seven feet for his final bogey to finish level with Levy at eight under.

### Summary:
The Belgian had been four shots clear on Saturday night after carding the lowest round of anyone in the field, and started Sunday one behind the Frenchman. A birdie-birdie start put him back in front but he was unable to maintain that momentum and dropped back into a tie for second place.
