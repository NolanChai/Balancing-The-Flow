 The report by Human Rights Watch details a horrific incident where a rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) brutally attacked civilians, resulting in at least 321 deaths and the abduction of 250 people, including 80 children. This massacre occurred late last year in an area previously unreported.

The report emphasizes the need for international attention and intervention to address such violent acts against innocent civilians. It's crucial that efforts are made to bring those responsible for these atrocities to justice and ensure the safety and protection of vulnerable communities within the DRC.
