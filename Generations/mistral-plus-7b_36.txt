Sina Weibo, Chinaâ€™s most popular micro-blogging platform, has introduced a VIP paid membership package as part of an effort to monetize its vast community of over 300 million users who currently use the service for free. The new VIP package includes features such as increased character limits, ad-free browsing and access to exclusive content. Users who sign up for the VIP package will also receive a dedicated customer support team and priority access to technical assistance. Sina Weibo hopes that the introduction of the VIP membership will help it generate additional revenue from its user base while providing them with added benefits.
