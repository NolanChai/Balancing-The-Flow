By Steph CockroftThe stopped watch, pipe and other last possessions of a First World War hero have gone on display 99 years after his death. The belongings of 36-year-old Harold Llewellyn Twite, from Shrewsbury, were found in a trunk in the attic of his family's home after he died in action in 1918. The items have been preserved and are now on show at the Shropshire Regimental Museum in Shrewsbury as part of a new exhibition marking the centenary of the end of the First World War.
