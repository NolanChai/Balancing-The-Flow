Jessica Bailey, the 28-year-old who became Britain's most hated woman after posting a selfie of herself in a bikini following breast surgery funded by the National Health Service (NHS), has invited Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to a birthday party... for her NHS-funded boobs.

In an open letter to Mr Hunt, Ms Bailey said that she was happy to celebrate her new breasts with him after he recently made comments about the NHS funding breast implants for "cosmetic" reasons. She wrote:

> Dear Jeremy Hunt,

> I would like to invite you to my upcoming birthday party - for my boobs! As you may know, my boobs are fully funded by the National Health Service (NHS), so it seems only fitting that we celebrate their 1st birthday together. It has been a long and difficult journey for me, but with the help of the NHS I have overcome my insecurity and am now proud to be a woman with new breasts.

I hope that we can continue to work together to ensure that all women have access to the medical care they need, including breast surgery if necessary. Your continued commitment to the NHS is greatly appreciated.
