This is the kind of thing that makes you wonder about whether it's worth having a news site at all. As I was saying to someone earlier, if this had happened in the UK and not in the US then it would be on Page 3 of every national newspaper, which would mean that it might just get onto the front page of most newspapers.

So what is newsworthy about a mayor being caught speeding? Well there are three possible answers:
1) It's unusual for a politician to break the law, but more specifically a politician who was responsible for implementing a law that he himself broke. I would say this is not unusual at all, it's just that most politicians get away with breaking laws without being caught, or if they are caught then the fact that they broke a law isn't newsworthy enough to make Page 3 of every national newspaper, which means that it won't even make the front page of most newspapers.
2) It's unusual for politicians to be punished for breaking the law, but more specifically a politician who was responsible for implementing a law that he himself broke and who is then punished for breaking that law. Again I would say this is not unusual at all, it's just that most politicians get away with breaking laws without being caught or if they are caught then the fact that they were punished for breaking a law isn't newsworthy enough to make Page 3 of every national newspaper, which means that it won't even make the front page of most newspapers.
3) It's unusual for politicians to be punished for breaking the law when there is no evidence against them and they can't afford an expensive legal team. This one I would say is true, but only because I haven't seen many cases where someone has been found guilty without evidence or without a lawyer.

I think this article was probably written by someone who lives in the US and doesn't understand that politicians there are not always held accountable for their actions like they are here in the UK.
