 It sounds like a concerning situation. Here's a potential response that could be given:

"I understand your concerns about the high number of accidents near your home, and I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention. Safety is paramount, and I will certainly look into the possibility of reducing the speed limit in the area. This would require a thorough assessment by our traffic engineers to ensure that any changes made would not create unnecessary congestion or safety hazards for other road users.

In the meantime, I encourage you to stay vigilant and report any further incidents or dangerous driving behavior to the local police department. I will follow up on this issue and keep you informed of any progress or next steps."
