One of the Armyâ€™s highest-ranking female officers is facing jail after she admitted falsifying medical records to cover up an abortion. Lieutenant Colonel Laura Garrison, 43, a battalion surgeon in Fort Wainwright, Alaska, was charged with making false statements and obstruction of justice for telling her superiors that she suffered from a miscarriage rather than having an abortion.
