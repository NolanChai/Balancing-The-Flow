The news comes only days after the BBC broadcast a documentary about the couple . It also comes just months after Hendry told a national newspaper that he wanted to live his life in peace, away from public scrutiny . 
  
 In the documentary it became clear how close Mandy and Stephen had become despite their differences over money . While she was happy to live on 10k a year and spend time with her sons, Stephen would only be content living at home if he earned enough to afford the lifestyle they were accustomed to. She tried to persuade him that they could do without certain luxuries, such as their holidays abroad . But Hendry was determined not to live off his pension and wanted a return of 100k a year, at least. The couple split just months after the documentary was broadcast . Sources say Stephen had become "more obsessed than ever with being rich" following the death of his father in 2016 . He told Mandy that they would have to sell their house and move into a smaller one where he could make savings on the mortgage payments, but she refused. A source said: "Stephen had become more obsessed than ever with being rich after the death of his father last year. He wanted Mandy to take on work as well as him so they wouldn't have to sell their home . But Mandy was determined not to change her lifestyle and it became clear that they were headed for divorce." 
  
 Stephen's new partner is actress Caroline O'Neill, the star of the children's play Annie and her bit cheeky friends. She has been a well-known figure in the Scottish theatre scene since she was just nine years old . The pair met when they were both invited to attend a charity auction at Glasgow's Armadillo Centre two weeks ago . Sources say that Stephen immediately asked Caroline out, and the two of them have been together ever since. It's believed they are now inseparable and are enjoying their new life as a couple despite all the negative press that has come with their split from Mandy. A source said: "Caroline is absolutely besotted with him . He's taken her under his wing, treats her like she was his queen bee, and loves nothing more than showing off to people what he's got." 
  
 Stephen and Mandy first met in 1987 when they were both on the snooker circuit at the time . She was working for a charity fundraising company as a promotions manager and decided that she would pursue him in a bid to find out more about his private life. She became determined not just to win over Stephen, but also his dad Dougie who she befriended too. After the documentary Mandy said of Stephen: "I still love him and have so much respect for what he has achieved in the game . But we simply don't agree on our future." 
  
 Caroline O'Neill is a Scottish actress and singer known for her roles as Annie Warbucks in Annie and Her Bit Cheeky Friends, which ran from 1987 to 1996. She also appeared with Stephen on the BBC show The One Show .
