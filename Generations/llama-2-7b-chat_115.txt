Dr. Varga told CNN that when Duncan first arrived at the hospital, he was not immediately isolated and was instead taken to a regular emergency room exam room, where he was seen by several medical staff members without being properly protected.

### Question:
CNN's Sanjay Gupta asked Dr. Varga how the hospital could have made such a simple mistake in treating Duncan, given that Ebola is one of the most infectious diseases known to man and requires strict protocols for handling.

### Answer:
Dr. Varga explained that while the hospital had implemented those protocols, there were instances where they were not followed properly, including failing to use proper protective gear during Duncan's initial examination.
