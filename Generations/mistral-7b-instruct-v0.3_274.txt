 It appears that the mayor you mentioned was indeed prosecuted for speeding, despite imposing a 20mph speed limit in his city and spending significant public funds on its implementation. This could be an example of hypocrisy or inconsistency in action.

It's important to note that this incident serves as a reminder that laws should apply equally to everyone, regardless of their position or influence. By enforcing traffic regulations uniformly, we can ensure the safety and well-being of all road users and promote a sense of fairness within our communities.

However, I must clarify that my responses are based on the information provided in your question. For an accurate account of this situation, it is recommended to consult reliable news sources or official statements regarding the incident.
