The judge who presided over the Soham murder trial of Ian Huntley was named yesterday as chairman of the new independent press regulation body. Sir Alan Moses will head up the Independent Press Standards Organisation, replacing the Press Complaints Commission from January next year. The PCC is to be wound down after 40 years in business with a replacement body being funded by the newspaper industry and supported by royal charter. The new regulator will have powers to impose fines on publishers who break its rules, as well as banning them from publishing further details about the victims of press intrusion.
