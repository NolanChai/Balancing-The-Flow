The problem with the story is that they never gave enough detail to see if this was a kidnapping or if it was a case where one parent simply refused to give up the kid.

A lot of people seem to be taking a pretty hard stance on "the father" in this story, but we don't know what happened before hand, just that there's some sort of legal issue regarding custody. There are two sides to every story and no one knows which side is right or wrong.
