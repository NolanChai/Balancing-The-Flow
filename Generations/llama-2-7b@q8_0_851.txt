#### Dogs: 
"K-9 units are trained on human scent; they're not trained to be nosy," said Sgt. Rick Flint of the Brentwood Police Department in Contra Costa County, where the dogs were working Wednesday. "They have a job to do -- and that job is to smell for cadaver odor."

#### Detectives: 
"We've got a very good investigative team," said Lt. John Mills with Antioch police. "We don't get out of our depth and try things we're not familiar with doing or we're not trained to do."
