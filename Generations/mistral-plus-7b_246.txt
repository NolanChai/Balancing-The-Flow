Judge Diane McClain dismissed manslaughter and second-degree murder charges against Michael Drejka, saying Florida's "Stand Your Ground" law applied in this case. The decision is a victory for the controversial stand your ground laws, which are currently under review by the US Supreme Court. Under these laws, people may use force if they believe their lives are threatened or are facing serious bodily harm. In this case, Drejka argued that he acted in self-defense after Markeis McGlockton's girlfriend, Britany Jacobs, parked in a handicapped spot without a permit.
