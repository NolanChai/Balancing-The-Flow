United Nations Special Representative to South Sudan David Shearer told CNN the talks will be in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on Thursday and Friday, and he expects that a cessation of hostilities between Kiir's forces and supporters of former Vice President Riek Machar to top the agenda.

"I hope we get them to agree," Shearer told CNN on Tuesday from Juba, South Sudan's capital. "And if they don't, I think that would be a big setback because what that tells you is there are still too many people fighting in the country and it will take longer to bring peace."

The ceasefire will not apply to militias who have been fighting on behalf of Kiir or Machar. Both sides will also hold meetings with civil society groups as part of the discussions, which will focus mainly on security arrangements for South Sudan, Shearer said. (CNN)
