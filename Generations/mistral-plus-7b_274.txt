The mayor of Cambridge, James Palmer, was fined £150 after he was caught travelling at 37 mph in a 30 mph zone. He had previously spent over £2 million imposing a 20mph speed limit across the city, saying that it would improve road safety and reduce pollution. However, he now faces criticism for his hypocrisy after breaking the very rules he championed. Mr Palmer has since apologised for his actions and promised to be more careful in future.
