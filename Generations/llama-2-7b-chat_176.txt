In a recent survey, J.Crew customers expressed their disappointment with the company's decision to cut back on shoe quality without reducing prices. Many customers reported that they had been loyal to the brand for years, but were now forced to seek out higher-quality options at similar price points. The survey results have sparked a heated debate among J.Crew fans, with some defending the company's decision and others calling for a boycott. Despite the backlash, J.Crew has yet to comment on the situation.
