I’m flattered, but I don’t think it’s accurate. XCOM is a fine game that has been around for more than 20 years; its strategy and execution are superb. However, I do not believe I have the right to call my own game an XCOM. If anything, I would love to be known as “the guy who made that XCOM-like game”.
