 The plane, operated by United Continental Holdings Inc., was on its way to Beijing when it was diverted back to the airport in Virginia, about 30 miles outside the nation's capital, said United Airlines spokesman Charlie Hobbs.

The child, who was traveling with a parent and other family members, was taken off the plane and handed over to local authorities, Hobbs said. He did not provide further details about the investigation or the identity of the individuals involved.

Passengers on board the flight were inconvenienced by the diversion, but were given the option to continue their journey to Beijing either on a later flight or through another airport, Hobbs said.

The incident is the latest in a series of high-profile child custody disputes involving United Airlines. In May, a flight from Los Angeles to San Francisco was delayed for several hours after passengers argued about a 2-year-old boy who had been taken away by airport authorities. And earlier this year, a flight from Denver to Houston was delayed for nearly two hours after an argument broke out between passengers over a crying baby.

United Airlines has faced criticism in recent years for its handling of such situations, with some passengers accusing the airline of prioritizing profits over the well-being of children and their families. The airline has defended its policies, saying that they are designed to ensure the safety and security of all passengers, including children.
