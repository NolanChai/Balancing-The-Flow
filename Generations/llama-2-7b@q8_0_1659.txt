### Explanation:

The sentence is in past tense and the main verb 'complained' is in passive voice hence we need a subject-verb pair like 'When artist Nicky Philipps last turned her hand to painting royalty' which is a grammatical error. The correct structure should have been "When the artist Nicky Philipps last turned her hand to painting royalty, Prince Harry complained his hair was ‘too ginger’"
