The family, who have lived in the area for over a decade, say they are fed up with the constant danger posed by speeding drivers and are calling on the local council to reduce the speed limit outside their home. They claim that ten serious crashes have occurred in the past 18 months, including a recent incident where a car hit a tree and burst into flames, leaving two people seriously injured.
