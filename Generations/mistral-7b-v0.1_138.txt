We are in agreement with this recommendation. As has been outlined in other responses, the lack of written guidelines for safe infant sleeping practices is a concern that has been identified by many stakeholders in New Zealand. In 2013, the Ministry of Health undertook a review of safe sleeping practices and released a discussion document to inform future recommendations.

The Ministry of Health recommends that all early childhood education centres have policies and procedures that promote and support infants having an undisturbed sleep in their own cot (unless otherwise recommended by a health professional). These should include:

- The provision of safe sleeping environments including appropriate bedding, mattresses and cots for all children.
- A policy on the use of co-sleeping or sharing the same space with infants and babies.
- A policy on swaddling and the use of sleep positioners.
- A policy on prams and bassinets as safe sleeping environments.
- The development of a safe sleeping space that is separate from where other children are sleeping.
- Practices to ensure that all caregivers are aware of and follow safe sleeping guidelines.

All early childhood education centres should also be able to demonstrate their compliance with these requirements.

The Ministry of Health also recommends the introduction of a nationally consistent training programme on safe sleeping practices for all early childhood education service providers, including those providing in-home care. The training should include:

- Information about how to provide a safe sleep environment for all children, particularly infants and young babies.
- Information about the risks associated with co-sleeping or sharing the same space with infants and babies.
- Information about the risks associated with swaddling and the use of sleep positioners.

The Ministry of Health has also recommended that:

- The New Zealand Qualifications Authority (NZQA) update unit standards to include safe sleeping practices for all early childhood education service providers, including those providing in-home care.
- The Education Council update its requirements to ensure all registered teachers and teachers in training are competent in ensuring safe sleeping practices.
- A nationally consistent approach is taken to the monitoring of compliance with these recommendations.
