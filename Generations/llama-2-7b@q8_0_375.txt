- The pirate was not a very good captain. He didn't have any plans for how to defeat the other ships or where to get the supplies he needed. If you're going to be a good captain, you need to be prepared for anything that might happen on your adventure and have a plan of attack.
- The princess was not very helpful either. She didn't want to help out by cleaning up the ship or doing any other chores around camp; she just wanted to sit there all day eating sweets while her father did everything for her! That's not what being royalty is about--it's about serving others instead of yourself (or at least being helpful).
- The fairy queen wasn't much better either: she didn't want any part in helping out with anything; if you ask me, that makes her lazy too. All these people just wanted things handed to them on a silver platter without putting forth any effort themselves!
