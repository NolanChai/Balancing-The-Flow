This is the solution that I came up with (I didn't think about it for too long and this was my first attempt):

```py
class Solution(object):
    def findHiddenShoppingMall(self, locations):
        """
        :type locations: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: int
        """
        n = len(locations)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n+1)]
        
        for i, l in enumerate(locations):
            # left 
            if locations[i-1][0] == 1:
                dp[i][0]=dp[i-1][0]+l[0]+1
            
            # right
            if locations[i+1][0] == 0:
                dp[i][0]=dp[i-1][0]+(1+locations[i][0])
                
        for j in range(n):
            if not (j < i or j > n - i):
                continue
            
            for i, l in enumerate(locations[:j]):
                # left 
                if locations[i+1-j][0] == 1:
                    dp[i+j][j]=dp[i][j]+l[0]+1
                
            for i, l in enumerate(locations[j:]):
                # right 
                if locations[i-j][0] == 0:
                    dp[i][j]=dp[i][j]+(1+locations[i][0])
        
        return min(dp)
```

### Explain:

The idea is to maintain a two dimensional array with the current location and its 4 directions (up, down left, right). If one of those locations has `1`, it means that there is another shopping mall in that direction. We start from the first location and check each row (`i`) in the second dimension (`j`).

The first step would be to check if we are in the same row as the previous location (`left` or `right`), so we update the value accordingly. If we are not in the same row, then we need to find the direction that has a `1`. We start from the right side and go down.
