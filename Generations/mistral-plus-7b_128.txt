John Terry has revealed that losing close friend and teammate Frank Lampard was one of the hardest moments of his career as they both arrived for preseason training without their long-time partner. The Chelsea captain also expressed his disappointment at seeing his former teammate in a Manchester City shirt, describing it as "bittersweet". Terry said:
"Losing Frank was tough. We had been together for so long and he was such an important part of the squad. It felt weird coming back to preseason without him there next to me. I've known him since we were kids and it felt strange not seeing his face in the dressing room anymore. I still miss having him around."
"Seeing Frank in a Man City shirt is bittersweet for me. On one hand, I'm happy that he found success elsewhere but on the other hand I wish he was still here with us at Chelsea. It just doesn't feel right seeing him wearing another team's colours."
