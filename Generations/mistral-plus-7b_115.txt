Texas Presbyterian Hospital’s handling of the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States has raised questions about how well hospitals are prepared for the disease. In a statement Friday, officials at Texas Health Resources -- which operates Texas Presbyterian -- said that “our hospital fell short” in the care it provided to Thomas Eric Duncan.

Duncan was isolated as soon as he arrived at the hospital on September 28, but he wasn’t diagnosed with Ebola until three days later. He died October 8. In a statement Friday, officials acknowledged that staff “did not act sooner” in Duncan’s case and said they would review their practices to ensure that mistakes aren’t repeated.

Duncan was initially sent home from the emergency room after reporting a fever of 100 degrees, vomiting and abdominal pain. He returned two days later with a higher fever and was admitted to the hospital. A nurse who cared for Duncan contracted Ebola but is now recovering. Two other nurses are being monitored for symptoms of the virus.
