By . . Leicester City goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel showed the ability to execute overhead kicks runs in the family, after he scored a stunning effort in pre-season training. Kasper's dad Peter, 51, is a former Danish international and famously won the Euro '92 title with Denmark against Germany - scoring in the final in Paris - and his son has also impressed the Foxes fans with his overhead skills this summer. The goalkeeper, who is on loan from Leeds, showed he could do it at both ends as he scored a 30-yard thunderbolt after reacting quickest to a loose ball during training in Denmark on Tuesday evening. It was then that Kasper, who has spent the summer with Leicester's squad as they prepared for the Premier League campaign, posted a video of his effort online with the caption: "Dad... you were never better" along with some laughing emojis. It is not the first time Kasper's dad Peter Schmeichel has been caught out by one of his son's stunning strikes, after Kasper scored a superb goal for Leeds in their 3-1 pre-season win over Liverpool earlier this month. Kasper posted that video on Instagram as he captioned it: "I can't believe my dad wasn't prepared for my overhead kicks." Schmeichel's effort was then followed up by Leicester winger Demarai Gray, who scored his own stunner to double the Foxes lead in their 3-1 win over Liverpool.
