    Balotelli has his sights set on winning Euro 2016 and he says that it would be his best moment as a footballer.
    He said, "The goal is to win the World Cup in Brazil this year but my best moment will be when I'll have won the European Championship."
    "It won't happen immediately, so we must begin with the Confederations Cup and then go step by step," he added. "I don't know if I'd say I'm better than Messi or Ronaldo but I am the best striker in the world, they have the others positions."
    Balotelli was banned for three matches last month after head-butting teammate Thomas Vermaelen during training and was then fined an undisclosed amount by Italian football's governing body.
