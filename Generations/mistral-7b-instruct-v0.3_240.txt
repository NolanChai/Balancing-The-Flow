 Title: Outrage as horses banned from participating in World War I Centenary ANZAC Parade in Albany due to safety concerns

It has been announced that horses will not be allowed to march in the World War I centenary ANZAC parade in Albany, Western Australia, due to safety concerns. This decision has sparked outrage amongst equestrians and history enthusiasts alike.

The annual ANZAC Day parade in Albany is a significant event commemorating the departure of Australian and New Zealand troops for the First World War. Traditionally, horses have played a crucial role in the ceremony, representing the cavalry units that were sent off to fight.

However, this year's parade organizers have decided against allowing horses due to concerns about crowd control and the welfare of the animals. This decision has been met with dismay by many who argue that the tradition is an important part of the ceremony and should be preserved.

Equestrian groups have expressed their disappointment and frustration at the decision, stating that proper measures can be taken to ensure both the safety of the crowd and the welfare of the horses. They argue that the historical significance of the horses in the ANZAC Day parade outweighs any potential risks, and that alternatives such as motorized vehicles or mechanized horses should not be considered as replacements.

The decision to ban horses from the World War I centenary ANZAC parade has sparked a debate about the importance of preserving traditions while ensuring public safety. Many are calling for the organizers to reconsider their decision and find a way to include horses in this year's ceremony.

The Centenary of ANZAC is a significant milestone, marking one hundred years since the First World War began. The exclusion of horses from the Albany parade has caused widespread anger and disappointment, with many feeling that the tradition is being disrespected and overlooked.

It remains to be seen whether the organizers will reconsider their decision and find a way to include horses in this year's ANZAC Day parade. In the meantime, equestrian groups are urging the public to voice their concerns and support for the tradition of having horses in the ceremony.
