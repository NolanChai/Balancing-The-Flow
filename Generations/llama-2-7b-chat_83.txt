At least six people were killed and several others injured when a building undergoing demolition collapsed in New York City on Wednesday, officials said. The incident occurred around 10:30 a.m. at the site of the former St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village, according to the Fire Department of New York (FDNY).
The building, which was being demolished as part of a larger development project, suddenly collapsed and came crashing down on top of several workers who were inside, officials said. Emergency responders raced to the scene and found that six people had been killed in the collapse, with several others injured.
"It's a tragic incident, and our hearts go out to the families of the victims," FDNY Commissioner Salvatore Cassano said in a statement. "We are working closely with the Buildings Department and other agencies to determine what caused this building to collapse."
The cause of the collapse is still under investigation, but officials said it may have been related to the building's structural integrity. The incident has raised questions about the safety of demolition sites in New York City, where numerous buildings are being torn down as part of a major redevelopment effort.
