- I'm very pleased to see Steve back. He's one of my heroes and it was hard seeing him take this much time off.
    - I hope he doesn't have to go on another leave anytime soon because I really don't want him leaving Apple again for a while!
- I don't think his medical leave will affect the company too much... he's been sick and recovering, not dead or anything!
