Lassana Diarra has arrived in London for a medical with Queens Park Rangers, hoping to make a sensational return to the Premier League after three years away from the top flight. The French midfielder, who played for Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid during his time in England, is eager to prove himself once again in the division he once dominated.
"I'm feeling good, I'm feeling confident," Diarra told MailOnline exclusively as he arrived at QPR's training ground on Wednesday morning. "I know I still have a lot to give in the Premier League and I'm excited about the opportunity to show that."
