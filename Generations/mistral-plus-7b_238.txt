These photographs show how properties along the Thames have been ruined by river levels reaching a ten-year high on some stretches. The pictures from Surrey come as communities in threatened areas continue to brace themselves for the prospect of further flooding after weeks of heavy rainfall and storms. Many people are currently sandbagging their homes after flood defences were breached last week, leaving more than 600 properties affected by the rising waters.
