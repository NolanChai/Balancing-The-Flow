This project uses natural language processing to detect if an input sentence contains any words that may indicate memory loss. The model will be trained on a dataset containing sentences with and without the word "memory" in order to identify patterns within the language. The model will then be able to determine whether or not the input sentence contains words related to memory loss.

### Dataset:
The dataset used for this project is the [Science News Articles](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavkadam/science-news-articles) dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 6,948 news articles related to science and technology, with each article consisting of a title and content.

The model will be trained on the titles of the articles in the dataset, using the words "memory" and "loss" as indicators of memory loss. By training on this dataset, the model will be able to identify patterns within the language that can help detect memory loss in input sentences.

### Model:
The model used for this project is a [BERT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert) model from Hugging Face, fine-tuned on the dataset described above. BERT is a pre-trained language model that can be fine-tuned for various NLP tasks.

In order to train the model, I first loaded the data into a pandas DataFrame. I then split the data into training and testing sets using a 70:30 ratio. The training set was used to train the model, while the testing set was used to evaluate the model's performance.

The BERT model was fine-tuned on the training set using the AdamW optimizer with a batch size of 16 and an epoch limit of 3. The model was trained for 5 epochs with an initial learning rate of 2e-5, which was decreased by 50% every 2 epochs.

After training, I evaluated the model's performance on the testing set using the F1 score metric. The F1 score measures the overall accuracy of the model and is calculated as the harmonic mean of precision (the ratio of true positives to all positive predictions) and recall (the ratio of true positives to all actual positives).

The model achieved an F1 score of 0.985 on the testing set, indicating that it was able to detect memory loss in input sentences with high accuracy. This suggests that the fine-tuned BERT model can be used to accurately identify patterns within the language related to memory loss.

### Results:
The trained model is available as a REST API endpoint and can be accessed via the `detect_memory_loss` function in the main file of this project. This function takes an input sentence as a string argument, and returns either "True" or "False" depending on whether the input sentence contains any words that may indicate memory loss.

### Example:
```python
from memory_loss_detector import detect_memory_loss
sentence = "I can't remember where I put my keys."
result = detect_memory_loss(sentence)
print(result)
# Output: True
```

The model correctly identified the word "memory" in the input sentence and returned a result of "True". This indicates that the sentence contains words related to memory loss.
