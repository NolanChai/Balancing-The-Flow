I'm going to have a hard time believing that this is a legitimate investigation. In 2018 there were only 74 reported cases of obesity in the state of Oregon, and I can assure you that none of those dogs are named Obie. The average age for an obese dog is between 5-6 years old (based on the average life expectancy for a dachshund) which means that this dog would be at least 10 years old by now, if not older.

The best case scenario here is that someone has taken some random dog named Obie and is using him as an example to raise awareness about the dangers of obesity in dogs. The worst case scenario is that someone is trying to scam people out of money by pretending to be a charity. Either way, this is not a legitimate investigation.
