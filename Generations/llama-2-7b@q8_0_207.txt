I didn't realize that Lee was such a big star, and I guess I never noticed when he retired from international play because he still plays for IPL teams (the Kolkata Knight Riders) and other clubs.

Lee, who played in the final Ashes Test between Australia and England at The Oval last week, made 316 one-day appearances and 76 T20s before his career came to an end after the 59-year-old decided he had no more left in the tank.

Lee's announcement comes after his international teammate James Pattinson announced that he would play only Twenty20 cricket. Lee said he is retiring because of a lack of motivation and because of injury concerns, but also noted that playing at home is much more enjoyable than playing abroad in the United Arab Emirates or England.

"I've decided to hang up my whites after 76 matches across all three formats, but I won't be stepping away from cricket altogether," Lee said on his Facebook page on Sunday. "Whilst I'm excited at the prospect of a new challenge and taking on an entirely new role as Cricket Australia's next High-Performance Fast Bowling Coach, I don't want to leave you guys."

Lee's last Test was against New Zealand in November 2012, when he took only one wicket during the second innings and left with a shoulder injury that sidelined him for six months. He returned to play eight games this season for New South Wales but has not been selected for Australia since March.

"I've never been more motivated or excited about my role than I am now, and it gives me great pleasure to let you know I will be the next High-Performance Fast Bowling Coach for Cricket Australia," Lee said. "Whilst this is a new challenge for me, I'm looking forward to helping build on our successes in developing world-class fast bowlers."
