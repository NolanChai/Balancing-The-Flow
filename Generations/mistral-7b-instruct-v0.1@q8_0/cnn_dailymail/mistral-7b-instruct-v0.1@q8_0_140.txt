3-2 at Ewood Park, ending his long wait for a goal in the knockout competition.

Coutinho was the standout player of the match with three assists and an equalising goal that left the home supporters stunned. He took his tally of assists this season to eight – the most he has provided since joining Liverpool from Inter Milan in January 2013 – and the club’s second-highest scorer of all time.

Henderson, meanwhile, had been struggling with form since being appointed captain but played a vital role in Liverpool’s win. He scored the fourth goal in the first half after a counterattack that cut Blackburn apart, and also provided an assist for the second Liverpool goal.

Blackburn were left to rue their missed chances in a game where they led 2-0 at halftime, with Jordan Pickford making two outstanding saves from Jordan Rhodes’s header and Charlie Mulgrew’s effort. The Rovers also had a penalty saved by James Milner when he equalised the score early on, and it proved to be their downfall.

The Liverpool players and fans were ecstatic at the final whistle, with Coutinho lifting the trophy as the club secured their third FA Cup in eight years. Blackburn’s hopes of a Wembley appearance this season are over but they will take heart from the fact that they gave it everything on the pitch against a much stronger side.
