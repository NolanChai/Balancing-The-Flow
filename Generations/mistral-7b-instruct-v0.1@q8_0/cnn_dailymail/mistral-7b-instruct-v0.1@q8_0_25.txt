a-half years hard labour after being accused of insulting religion in 2016. The former publican was stripped naked and beaten in front of a crowd during his trial.

The British embassy in Yangon, Myanmar, had previously said it would work to secure his release, but this month they wrote to Mr Blackwood’s partner in the UK stating their inability to continue providing support. Mr Blackwood’s lawyers claim the Foreign Office has ‘abandoned him’.

His lawyer, Sappho Aung, told The Telegraph: “They just write and tell us that they cannot continue supporting Phil because he is a British citizen who voluntarily went there.” Ms Aung added that Mr Blackwood has suffered from malaria since being sentenced, and had been denied medical treatment.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: “We are deeply concerned about reports of mistreatment of foreign nationals in Burma, particularly in relation to the criminal justice system. We do not recognise these allegations and will continue to work closely with the Myanmar authorities to ensure that all British nationals are treated fairly and according to the law.”

The Foreign Office has also said it has been unable to visit Mr Blackwood since his conviction, as it does not have permission from the Burmese government.

Mr Blackwood’s case was first brought to the attention of the foreign press by fellow Briton Andrew Wakefield, who was also jailed in Burma for a year after using an image of the Buddha to promote his bar in 2014.
