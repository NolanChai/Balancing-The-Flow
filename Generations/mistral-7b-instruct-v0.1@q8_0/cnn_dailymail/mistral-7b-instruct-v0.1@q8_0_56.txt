forests of Sri Lanka, she finally found her mom, and the two embraced in a heartwarming reunion.

The elephants were separated from their mothers when they were young as part of captivity training for elephant shows and rides. The mother and daughter hadn't seen each other since 2004, but somehow, the mother recognized her child from the distinctive scar on her trunk. They spent several hours embracing and trumpeting, and it was clear that their bond was unbreakable.

The video of the reunion has been shared countless times online, and animal rights activists are hoping it will help raise awareness about the plight of elephants in captivity. Many Asian elephants are taken from the wild as babies and forced to work in tourism, logging, and mining industries, often enduring cruel treatment and separation from their families.

The video is a reminder that even after years apart, the love between mother and child can never be forgotten. It also serves as a call to action for those who care about animal welfare to help end the captivity of these gentle giants.
