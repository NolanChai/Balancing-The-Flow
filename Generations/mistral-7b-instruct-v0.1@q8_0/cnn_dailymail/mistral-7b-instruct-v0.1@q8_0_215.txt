1-0 Champions League win over Real Madrid at the Vicente Calderon stadium, and sources close to the club suggest that Koke is on Mourinho's list of summer transfer targets. The Spain international, who has been compared to Barcelona's Xavi, was the standout player in the game for Atletico, scoring the equaliser with a brilliant free-kick just before half time. Despite interest from other European giants such as Manchester United, Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain, Koke is understood to be keen on a move to Chelsea, where he would reunite with former Madrid teammate Filipe Santana, who is currently on loan at the club from Benfica.
