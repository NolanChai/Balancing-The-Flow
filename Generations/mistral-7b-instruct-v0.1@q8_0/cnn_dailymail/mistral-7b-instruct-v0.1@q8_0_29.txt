Celebrity chef Jose Andres, who is also known for catering for the likes of Oprah Winfrey and LeBron James, said Mayweather prefers lighter meals before a fight, including fish, chicken or turkey with plenty of vegetables. 

He explained: "Floyd doesn't like heavy meat. He doesn't like red meat or anything that is too fatty. He likes to have his meals light because he wants to be able to digest and move quickly. But he also likes spicy food, so I always try to incorporate some spice into the meal."

Andres also revealed that Mayweather has a bit of a sweet tooth and enjoys desserts after a meal, although he is careful about what he eats in order to maintain his physique. 

The chef said: "He loves dessert, but he's very careful because he knows how much he needs to eat to maintain his weight and stay in shape for the fight."

Andres has been working with Mayweather for several years and says the fighter is very particular about what he eats. 

He added: "Floyd is very specific about everything, from the type of fish he likes to how it's cooked. He's very particular and he has a great sense of taste."
