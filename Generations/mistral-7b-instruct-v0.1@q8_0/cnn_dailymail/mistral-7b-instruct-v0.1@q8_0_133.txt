ified on Instagram has a heart of gold and a passion for helping others. His incredible journey from a troubled childhood to becoming one of the most recognizable models in the industry, is nothing short of inspiring.

We caught up with Stephen to chat about his past struggles, how he overcame them and what advice he would give to those going through similar experiences.

Tell us a bit about your childhood.

Growing up I had a pretty tough time. My mum was very young when she had me, and she struggled to provide for me. She did her best but we never really had much. We moved around a lot and never really settled anywhere. It was hard not knowing where we were going to be next.

I started getting into trouble at a young age. I would often skip school and get into fights with other kids. It was just something to do, and it gave me a sense of belonging. But as I got older, I realized that this wasn't the way forward.

How did you find your passion for modeling?

I started getting interested in fitness and bodybuilding when I was around 18. I started lifting weights and taking care of myself better. It made me feel good about myself and gave me something to focus on other than my troubles.

One day, someone approached me at the gym and asked if I would be interested in modeling for a tattoo studio. I had never really thought about it before, but I figured why not? So I started doing some shoots for them and things just took off from there.

You've come a long way since then. How have you overcome your struggles and become the successful model you are today?

It wasn't easy, but I really focused on myself and my goals. I worked hard to stay healthy, both physically and mentally. I also started reading books on self-help and personal development, which helped me to learn more about myself and what makes me tick.

But one of the biggest turning points in my life was when I decided to forgive my mum for everything she had done. It wasn't easy, but it was something I needed to do. I realized that holding onto anger and resentment was only hurting myself.

What advice would you give to someone going through similar experiences?

The first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem. Don't be afraid to reach out for help if you need it. There are people out there who want to help, whether it's family, friends or professionals.

Don't be too hard on yourself either. Everyone makes mistakes, but it's how we learn from them that counts. Try to focus on the positive and surround yourself with good people who will support you.

And finally, never give up on yourself. You are capable of achieving anything you set your mind to.
