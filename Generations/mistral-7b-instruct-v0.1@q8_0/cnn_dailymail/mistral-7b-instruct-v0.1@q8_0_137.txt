United moved level with Manchester City at the top of the table with their 3-1 win at Old Trafford and Cantona, who was watching from the stands as a pundit for Sky Sports, feels they have turned a corner after a difficult period.

“Manchester United are back to being kings of the city,” he said.

“I am very happy because I think this team has the potential to win the league. I really do.”

Cantona hailed Van Gaal’s tactics and felt that United played well in all areas against City, with Edwin van der Sar getting a special mention for his saves.

“The way they play is very impressive,” he continued.

“I like the way they defend, I like the way they keep possession of the ball. They’re playing really, really well.”

United are now three points clear of City and Chelsea, who lost at Stoke on Saturday, and Cantona feels that with Van Gaal in charge, they can go on to win the title next year.

“I think Louis van Gaal is a very good manager,” he added.

“He has a lot of experience and I think he will be able to take this team to the league. It’s going to be really tough but I believe in United.”
