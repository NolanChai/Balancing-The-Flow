Michael Hershko stood frozen in shock as he watched his beloved fall into the water.

Five years have passed since that life-changing moment. Now, Rachelle is a source of inspiration to many. With the support of her family, friends and medical team, she’s learned to adapt to life with a spinal cord injury. In fact, she’s become quite the athlete herself, competing in wheelchair marathons and even winning several awards.

Rachelle is also a devoted mother to her 2-year-old son, Gabriel, whom she adopted with her husband Michael after her accident. Despite everything that has happened, Rachelle remains positive and determined. She continues to push herself harder every day, never giving up on her dreams.

On May 18, 2015, Rachelle will participate in the Chicago Marathon for the third time. This time, she hopes to complete the race in under six hours – a goal that she’s been working towards for months. With the support of her loved ones and the strength in her heart, Rachelle is determined to make this marathon one to remember.

Rachelle’s story serves as a reminder that anything can happen at any moment. But with the right attitude, determination, and love, even the most devastating accidents can turn into something positive.
