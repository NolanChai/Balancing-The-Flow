Manchester United will have to wear Nike kit during their summer tour of the US, despite their world-record deal with adidas. The club are expected to jet across the Atlantic in July for a trip of a similar length and scope to those in 2013 and 2017. It is understood that Nike have already supplied United with the kits for their tour, which is likely to take place ahead of the new season starting in August.

Adidas signed a record-breaking £75 million ($96.7m) five-year deal with Manchester United last year, but sources close to the club believe that Nike will provide the shirts for the upcoming tour, which is not part of the current contract. It is unclear whether this is due to a clause in the original deal or simply because Nike have agreed to supply the kits on a one-off basis.

Manchester United’s tour will see them take on sides such as Real Madrid and AC Milan in front of thousands of fans across the US. The club last played a pre-season friendly against AC Milan in San Diego in 2017, while they faced Real Madrid at Yankee Stadium in New York in 2013.

United will have to wear adidas kit when they take on Tottenham Hotspur and Real Madrid in pre-season friendlies in the US later this year as part of their deal with the German giant.
