wave of positivity’ that he claims is driving a negative culture around exams. He said: ‘We are in danger of turning the very thing we are trying to motivate our pupils to achieve – exams – into something they see as a hurdle to be got over.’

He also claimed that the pressure on students to succeed has led to a rise in mental health issues and stress. Mr Hendrick said: ‘We know there is a correlation between exams and stress, so we are putting more pressure on young people to achieve, which puts them at risk of higher levels of stress.’

Mr Hendrick believes that the emphasis on ‘you can do it’ slogans has led to an expectation that pupils will succeed, regardless of their abilities. He said: ‘When you say things like “reach for the stars”, it’s easy for children to believe that if they don’t reach them then they are somehow letting us down.’

However, Mr Hendrick believes that a negative attitude towards exams could be countered by focusing on the value of learning and development. He said: ‘We need to make sure we have an environment where young people understand that it is not just about exam results – it’s also about personal growth, being part of a community and making a positive contribution to society.’
