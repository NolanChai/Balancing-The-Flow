In a match full of twists and turns, Williams saved a set point in the seventh game of the first set with an ace down the line that landed perfectly in the corner, then converted her third set point in the ninth game for victory in the first set.

It was the fifth straight Fed Cup win for the United States since 2013 and their eighth in a row against Italy. The tiebreaker is scheduled to resume Sunday with Williams facing Sara Errani, who beat Madison Keys in a dramatic three-set match on Friday.

"I'm really happy with the way I played today," Williams said after her victory. "It was very close. I was able to come out on top with some big serves and some big shots."

Williams, who has won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, is playing her first Fed Cup since returning from maternity leave following the birth of her daughter, Olympia. She missed the last two Fed Cups due to injury and pregnancy.

"Being back here with my teammates, it's really special for me," she said. "I love playing for this country."

Giorgi, ranked 67th in the world, put up a good fight and pushed Williams to the limit in the first set. The Italian player won three games in a row in the second set before Williams took control with three straight aces to lead 4-0. She then broke Giorgi's serve twice more to win her fourth title of the year.
