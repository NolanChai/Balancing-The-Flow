420 Cannabis Club has been booming.

The club is located in a strip mall at the corner of Highway 67 and Southwest 18th Avenue. The club sells marijuana to members who have a medical prescription. Members pay an annual fee to join, and then they can buy as much marijuana as they want for $10 a gram.

Impey has been selling pot illegally since 2005, but he says it's all about helping people. He wants to be able to offer his customers the best possible product, no matter what the law says.

"I'm not trying to hide anything," Impey said. "But when you talk to people who have pain and illness, and they tell you that marijuana is helping them, it makes me feel good inside."

Impey says he gets a lot of calls from people who are in pain and looking for relief. He tells them to come see him, and he'll help them get the medicine they need.

"We don't want to cause any harm," Impey said. "But we believe that marijuana is a medicine that can help people who are suffering from conditions like arthritis, cancer, and chronic pain."

Impey says he doesn't keep any records of his customers or their purchases, so he has no idea how many people are coming to the club. But he knows that business is good, and he plans to keep selling marijuana as long as there's a demand for it.
