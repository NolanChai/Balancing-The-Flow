The accident happened on April 20, 2010, when a powerful explosion blew out a blowout preventer in BP's well off the coast of Louisiana, causing a massive underwater fire and releasing more than 5 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. For months, a thick plume of oil spread across the gulf, darkening the waters and killing millions of fish, birds and marine mammals.
As we look back on the anniversary of this disaster, here are five key lessons learned from it:
1. The true extent of the environmental damage is still being assessed. Scientists have discovered that the spill's effects have reached as far as the Arctic Ocean, with oil particles found in seawater and sediment samples taken from areas thousands of miles away from the gulf. The impact on marine life will continue to be felt for years to come.
2. The economic toll was also significant. According to a report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the spill caused an estimated $6.8 billion in damages to fisheries alone. In addition, businesses that relied on tourism and fishing in the gulf suffered major losses. The disaster also had ripple effects on industries upstream from the gulf, such as agriculture and transportation.
3. The cleanup effort was slow and flawed. Many of the methods used to clean up the oil were not effective or safe for workers. The government's response to the crisis was criticized for being slow and disorganized. It took months for a unified cleanup plan to be put in place, and some areas of the gulf remain contaminated today.
4. The offshore drilling industry needs better regulation. Critics argue that the Deepwater Horizon disaster highlights the need for stronger safety regulations and oversight of offshore drilling operations. The accident was caused by a combination of factors, including human error, equipment failure and lax enforcement of existing regulations.
5. The impact on coastal communities will be felt long after the spill is cleaned up. Fishermen who lost their livelihoods in the gulf continue to struggle financially. Tourism operators who rely on visitors to the region have also been hit hard. And for those who live near the coast, the sight and smell of oil-tainted waters will remain a constant reminder of the disaster.
