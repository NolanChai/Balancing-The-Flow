the upcoming FIA Formula E season.

According to Drive eO CEO Oleg Kovalenko, the car will have a top speed of 305 km/h (189 mph) and be able to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just two seconds. That's quicker than the Model S P85D, which can do the same in about 2.4 seconds.

The car will also have a range of around 200 km (124 miles) on a single charge, thanks to its lithium iron phosphate battery pack. In addition, Drive eO is currently working on developing an electric supercharger system that will allow the car to recharge from 0 to 80 percent in just 30 minutes.

While the car is still in development, it's clear that Drive eO is aiming to make a big splash in the world of electric racing. With its impressive performance and range, this new electric race car could be a serious contender in the Formula E championship.
