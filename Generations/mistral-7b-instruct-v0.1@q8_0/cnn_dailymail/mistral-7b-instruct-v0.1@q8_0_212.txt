, jelly beans, gummy worms, chocolates and caramels - will be available at stores across the UK from this month.

"We know that our customers want to enjoy sweet treats without any doubts about the ingredients," said Morrisons' meat director David Blackburn. "That's why we've introduced halal-only pick and mix counters."

Halal foods are prepared according to Islamic dietary laws, which prohibit the use of pork or alcohol. The sweets in Morrisons' new halal selection will be sourced from suppliers who follow these rules.

Morrisons has faced criticism in the past for selling halal meat without clear labeling, leading some customers to complain about being served non-halal products. In response to this, the supermarket introduced a clear halal labeling system in 2013.

"We've listened to our customers and taken steps to ensure that all of our halal products are clearly labeled," said Blackburn. "Now we're taking it one step further with our halal-only pick and mix counters."

The sweets will be available at Morrisons stores across the UK, including those in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
