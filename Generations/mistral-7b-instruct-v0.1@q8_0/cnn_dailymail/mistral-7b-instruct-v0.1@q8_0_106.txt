weke, 32, had already suffered two miscarriages and was desperate for another child when she discovered her husband’s secret in January this year.

Oeweke took her son Joshua to the train station in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, on February 14, where they both tragically died when the train struck them. Oeweke had told Joshua he was going for a walk and she would join him later. However, as she discovered her husband’s secret she snapped and made the decision to end her own life and that of her son. She bought two tickets for the train, but as she stood on the platform with her son in her arms she changed her mind and lay down in front of the oncoming train.

The inquest heard how Oeweke’s husband had been having an affair with a woman in Egypt who was pregnant with his child. He had previously denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted to having sex with her in Cairo in November 2018. Oeweke discovered the truth after finding messages on his phone and confronting him.

Coroner Nicola Quinn said: “It appears that Mrs Oeweke was suffering from severe depression following two miscarriages and the discovery of her husband’s infidelity. She took her own life and that of her son Joshua by laying down in front of a train.” The inquest also heard how Oeweke had been struggling financially due to not being able to work, and had been receiving benefits.

Friends and family members have paid tribute to Oeweke and her son on social media, with many describing her as a devoted mother. Her husband has not been charged with any wrongdoing in relation to the deaths of his wife and son.
