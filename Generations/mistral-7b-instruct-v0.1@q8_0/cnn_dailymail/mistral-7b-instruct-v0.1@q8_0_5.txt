Iyanna is a regular presence at her dad's training camp, and she recently chatted with ESPN's T.J. Quinn.

"It's definitely an experience," she said of being around her dad during his intense preparation period. "I don't know how else to put it. It's a whole different world, you know? But I wouldn't change anything in the world for my dad or anyone I love. He loves what he does and it's all worth it."

Mayweather is known for his grueling training regimen, which often sees him sparring multiple times per day.

"Dad is pretty intense," she said. "He's always pushing himself and others around him. But I wouldn't say he's the only one working hard."

Iyanna also revealed that she has a close bond with her dad, and they are very supportive of each other.

"Dad is my everything," she said. "We talk about everything. Sometimes he'll just come over and sit down next to me and we'll watch TV or just hang out. He's really hands-on with me."

With the biggest fight in boxing history looming on the horizon, it will be interesting to see how Mayweather and Pacquiao perform when they finally step into the ring together on May 2. But one thing is certain - Iyanna will be cheering her dad on every step of the way.
