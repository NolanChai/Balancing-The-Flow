A chilling new jihadi video has emerged on social media, showing a new militia of female jihadis firing machine guns and practising drills in Syria. All of the women are fully veiled, making it hard to identify them but some reports suggest they are Iraqi or Egyptian nationals.
The footage is believed to have been recorded by ISIS-affiliated militias and posted on social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. It comes at a time when there has been a surge in the number of female jihadis being recruited by ISIS, with reports suggesting that up to 50% of new recruits are women.
The video shows a group of around ten women armed with AK-47s and RPK machine guns, as well as rocket launchers, standing in a desert wasteland. They appear to be carrying out a drill on how to fire their weapons and move into position for a potential attack.
The footage has been met with shock and horror by many on social media, who have condemned the recruitment of women into ISIS-affiliated militias. One user on Twitter described the video as "sickening", while another said it was "hard to believe this is real".
It's not clear what role these women will play in future attacks, but there are concerns that they could be used for suicide bombings or other acts of terrorism. The recruitment of women into ISIS-affiliated militias has been a growing concern in recent years, with some reports suggesting that the group is deliberately targeting young women who are vulnerable to radicalisation.
As tensions continue to rise in Syria and the Middle East, there are fears that the number of female jihadis being recruited by ISIS could continue to grow.
