is being attributed to strong winds that caused the barrier to shift off its support.

The family was from Wyoming and had been on a road trip with their baby to visit relatives in Oregon. According to the police, the truck’s driver, the baby’s father, lost control of the vehicle after the barrier hit it. The vehicle crashed into a concrete wall and then caught fire. The three victims were burned to death inside the truck.

The highway where the accident occurred was closed for several hours following the incident as investigators worked to determine the cause of the tragedy. Officials from the Washington State Department of Transportation said that the barrier had been inspected just two weeks prior to the accident, and found to be in good condition. However, strong winds on Monday may have caused it to shift off its support.

The community is mourning the loss of the family, and a GoFundMe page has been set up to help raise money for their funeral expenses. The page has already raised over $150,000 in donations from people across the country who wish to show their support.
