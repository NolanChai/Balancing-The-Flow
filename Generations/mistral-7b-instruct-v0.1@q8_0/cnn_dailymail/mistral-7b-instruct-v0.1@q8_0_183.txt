uting battery experts and investing in research and development related to battery technology.

According to Reuters, Apple is looking for "battery cell engineers" and "electronics materials scientists" to join its battery research team. The company has also reportedly set aside $1 billion for research related to batteries, including $200 million in the last year alone.

Apple's current iPhone models are equipped with Li-Po batteries that can last between 8-14 hours of continuous use, depending on the model and settings. While these batteries offer a significant improvement over older models, they still fall short of the competition. For example, Samsung's Galaxy S5 can last up to 20 hours of continuous use with its Li-Po battery.

In addition to battery research, Apple is also exploring alternative energy sources such as solar power for its devices. The company has patented several methods for harnessing energy from sunlight and using it to charge devices.

Overall, Apple's investment in battery technology suggests that the company is committed to improving battery life on its devices. With the increasing popularity of wearable devices like smartwatches, which require constant charging, battery life has become a critical issue for tech companies.
