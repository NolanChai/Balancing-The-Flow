In the clip titled “Cassie Ho Shuts Down Body Shamers,” Ho takes a break from her usual workout routines and fitness tips to address the hurtful comments that have been left by some of her millions of fans.

“I get comments on my videos all the time, saying I’m too fat, too skinny, ugly, pudgy, just gross,” she says, looking directly at the camera with a determined expression. “And it really bothers me because I try to be positive and inspiring in everything that I do.”

Ho goes on to explain that she has struggled with her body image for most of her life, but has learned to love herself despite the constant criticism and negativity online.

“I’m not going to let these comments get to me,” she says. “I’m going to continue being positive, inspiring, and spreading love. Because that’s what I want this channel to be about.”

In response to the video, Ho has received an outpouring of support from her fans, with many thanking her for speaking out against body shamers and inspiring others to do the same.

“Thank you so much Cassie,” one fan wrote in the comments section. “You are such a strong person and I admire everything you stand for.”

Another added: “I know how hard it is to deal with these kinds of comments, but your positivity is contagious.”
