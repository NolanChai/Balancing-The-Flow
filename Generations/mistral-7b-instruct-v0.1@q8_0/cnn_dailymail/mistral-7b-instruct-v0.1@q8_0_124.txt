and Jane get married before he passed away.

And so on Wednesday morning, with the help of hospital staff, the couple exchanged their vows in what was a deeply emotional ceremony at Torbay Hospital. Corey’s dad Crai held back tears as he read out a poem he had written for his son, while Jane fought to control her emotions throughout the service.

Afterwards, Corey, who has been suffering from cancer since he was just four years old, said: “I am so happy for my mummy and daddy. They have always been there for me and now they can be together forever.”

The couple’s friends and family gathered in the hospital chapel to witness the emotional moment, which was also streamed live on social media so that people from all over the world could watch it.

Corey’s mum Jane said: “This is something that has been so important to Corey. He wanted us to be happy together and now we can do this for him.”

“It was a magical moment for us,” added Crai. “We are overwhelmed with joy at the thought of being together forever. We’re going through this tough time but it makes everything worthwhile.”

The couple were surrounded by a team of doctors, nurses and hospice workers who helped make the day special for Corey. The hospital even decorated their room with balloons and flowers in honour of the occasion.

“The staff at the hospital have been incredible,” said Jane. “They have been so caring and supportive throughout Corey’s illness.”

Corey’s wish was to see his parents happy together before he died, and it brought tears to everyone’s eyes when the couple exchanged their vows in front of a room full of loved ones. It was truly a moment that will be remembered for years to come, and it shows that even in the darkest of times, love can conquer all.
