arse comments during an interview with Piers Morgan, in which he also lashed out at his former boss, the BBC’s director general Tony Hall.
Clarkson said: “I used to be banned from swearing on TV – even though it was a big part of my show. Now that I’m not at the BBC any more, I can swear all I like and I can say things that I couldn’t before.”
The outspoken host added that he would never go back to the BBC, claiming that bosses had been “cowardly” in their handling of his sacking.
He said: “I was never given a chance to explain myself – it was just a case of them deciding they didn’t want me anymore and then running away from any sort of discussion about it.”
Clarkson, 52, was axed from Top Gear in March last year over his behaviour on set. He later launched a legal challenge against the BBC, but this was thrown out after he failed to provide sufficient evidence.
