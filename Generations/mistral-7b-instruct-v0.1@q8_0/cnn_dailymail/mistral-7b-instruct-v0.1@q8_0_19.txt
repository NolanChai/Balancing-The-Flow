Argentine Cambiasso has won the World Cup, Copa America, Champions League and Europa League with his country and former club Inter Milan but is determined to help Leicester survive in England's top flight.

"It would be something special," he said on Thursday after training at the King Power Stadium. "I know it might sound like a cliche but I feel it, especially after what we have been through.

"If we manage to achieve this it will be one of the greatest achievements of my career."

Leicester are two points above the relegation zone with five games remaining and must win all four of their remaining home matches, as well as hope other results go their way, to stay up.

Their next home game is against West Bromwich Albion on Sunday but first they must overcome a difficult trip to Crystal Palace on Saturday, where they will face former manager Alan Pardew.

"It won't be easy," Cambiasso said. "They are a good team with some very good players but we have shown in the past few games that when we play well and stay focused we can achieve anything."

The 35-year-old has been one of Leicester's standout performers this season, making 30 appearances and scoring two goals. He feels the team is capable of more than their current position suggests.

"We have shown in the past few games that we can play better than where we are in the table," he said. "We need to keep focusing on our game, be disciplined and work hard. If we do that I am sure we will achieve our goal."
