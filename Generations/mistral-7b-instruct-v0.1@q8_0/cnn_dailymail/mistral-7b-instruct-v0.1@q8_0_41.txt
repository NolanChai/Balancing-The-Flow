The video, released by Scotland Yard today, reveals how the four burglars worked together to crack open safe after safe using sledgehammers and drills in a high-security vault at Hatton Garden.

Dressed all in black with balaclavas covering their faces, the gang is seen carefully prying open one of the safes before disappearing into the darkness.

In another clip, the same group of thieves is filmed returning to the scene three days later to finish off their raid - this time using a much larger drill to smash through the remaining safes and make their escape.

The footage has prompted outrage from victims who have been left with nothing but empty cases and broken promises from insurers. Some of the jewellery, worth tens of millions of pounds, has never been found and may never be recovered.

Scotland Yard has already launched an internal investigation into how the alarm was ignored and how the thieves were able to carry out their crime so successfully.

But the true cost of the heist is only just becoming clear - with insurers now facing huge payouts to cover the losses suffered by their policyholders.

One insurance company, which does not wish to be named, has already paid out Â£30 million in compensation to victims of the burglary - and expects to have to pay out much more in the coming weeks and months.

The heist has also sparked a huge debate about the role of police in protecting high-value jewellery and other valuable items - with some critics calling for a complete overhaul of current security measures.

It is understood that the police were alerted to the burglary on March 1, when the alarm at Hatton Garden went off. But instead of sending officers to the scene, the force sent an email to nearby forces asking them to keep watch for any suspicious activity.

This decision has been widely condemned by victims and members of the public - who have demanded to know why the police did not take the threat seriously enough to send officers to the scene.

In a statement released today, Scotland Yard said: "We are deeply sorry that we were unable to prevent this crime from taking place. We understand the serious impact this has had on victims and the wider community, and we will do everything in our power to bring those responsible to justice."

The force added that it was working closely with insurers and other organisations affected by the heist to recover as much of the stolen jewellery as possible - but stressed that the chances of recovering any of the missing items were "extremely slim".

Detective Chief Inspector Nick Johnston, who is leading the investigation into the burglary, said: "The scale of this crime is truly shocking and we are working tirelessly to bring those responsible to justice. We will leave no stone unturned in our pursuit of the criminals involved."

The four thieves responsible for the heist - Terry Perkins, Brian Coleman, Daniel Jones and John Lewis - were all arrested on March 3 after a dramatic police raid at their hideout in Enfield, north London. They have since been charged with burglary and are awaiting trial.
