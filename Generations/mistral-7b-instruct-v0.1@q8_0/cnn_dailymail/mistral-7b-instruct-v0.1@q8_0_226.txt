mind on the issue of same-sex marriage, at least publicly.

In a speech to law students at Columbia Law School last week, the Supreme Court justice said that she believes that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry. Ginsburg went on to say that the Supreme Court should take up the case of Obergefell v. Hodges and strike down the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which would effectively legalize same-sex marriage nationwide.

Ginsburg's comments are a significant development in the ongoing debate over same-sex marriage, as she has traditionally been seen as a staunch defender of civil rights and equality. Her public support for legalizing same-sex marriage may have a significant impact on public opinion and political action in the coming months and years.

It's worth noting that Ginsburg's comments come at a time when many believe that the Supreme Court is poised to finally rule in favor of same-sex marriage nationwide. In recent weeks, several key states have legalized same-sex marriage through court rulings or popular referendums, including California and Florida.

Overall, Ginsburg's public support for same-sex marriage represents a significant milestone in the ongoing fight for civil rights and equality. It is likely that her comments will be closely watched by advocates of same-sex marriage, as well as opponents of the issue.
