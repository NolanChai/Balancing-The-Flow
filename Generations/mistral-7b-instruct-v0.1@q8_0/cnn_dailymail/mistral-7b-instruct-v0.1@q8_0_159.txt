ready having a huge impact on California's wildfire season.

These photos from San Bernardino National Forest were taken by KPCC's Brian Watt and show dry trees and underbrush that have been stripped of their foliage due to the drought. The area has already seen one fire this season, the Oak Grove Fire, which burned nearly 7,000 acres and destroyed 16 homes in early June.

California is currently experiencing its driest year on record with some areas receiving less than 8 inches of rainfall so far - a fraction of what they typically receive during the wettest months. The drought has prompted Governor Brown to order mandatory water cuts for cities and towns across the state, but it's also fueling fears about another devastating wildfire season.

As KPCC's John McWhorter reports, experts say the dry conditions, combined with an unusually high number of lightning strikes this year, are setting the stage for a particularly dangerous fire season. In fact, some areas of California have already seen more than 50 percent of their annual precipitation in just the past few weeks - a trend that could make matters even worse if a fire were to break out.

So far this year, more than 270,000 acres have burned across California - far surpassing the normal pace for this time of year. And with the dry conditions showing no sign of letting up anytime soon, officials are bracing for another long and dangerous fire season.
