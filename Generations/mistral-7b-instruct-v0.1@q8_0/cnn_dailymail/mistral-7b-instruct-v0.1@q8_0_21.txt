find is believed to be that of an Inca woman, dating back to the 12th century AD.

The body was found in the town of Chiclayo in the Lambayeque region. The discovery has been hailed as one of the most significant archaeological finds in recent years.

Local reports say the cleaner, who wished to remain anonymous, stumbled upon the box while sweeping the street. Initially fearing it contained a dead body, he carefully opened it and was shocked to find the well-preserved mummy. 

The discovery has sparked a great deal of excitement among archaeologists who say it could shed new light on the lives of the ancient Incas. The mummy is believed to be that of a young woman, possibly of noble birth, who would have lived during the reign of the great Inca king, Pachacuti.

It is also thought that the find could help researchers understand more about the religious and burial practices of the Incas. The body is said to be adorned with intricate gold jewelry and other artifacts. 

The discovery has been hailed as a major breakthrough in the study of the ancient civilization, and experts are eager to examine the mummy in more detail. It will be transported to a museum in Lima for further study.
