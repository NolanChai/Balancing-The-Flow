Lawrence was born in Tacoma, Washington, and his parents migrated to the East Coast from Arkansas when he was young. He painted The Migration series while studying at Harvard University during the Great Depression, an era when African Americans were fleeing the Dust Bowl and Jim Crow laws in the South for the industrial North.

The paintings depict scenes of daily life: people riding on trains, waiting in lines, packing for trips, and settling into new homes. They also show the struggles of poverty, discrimination, and loneliness that many faced during this time.

Lawrence's use of vivid colors and bold text helped to shape the way people thought about and represented African Americans during this period. His work has been exhibited in galleries and museums across the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC.
