The lawsuit filed Monday by John Doe against the university and its president, John Hitt, alleges that he was expelled based on false accusations made by his ex-girlfriend, who had accused him of non-consensual sex in a formal complaint to the university. He is seeking to be reinstated at the school and awarded damages for emotional distress.

In an interview Monday, Doe said that he never had any non-consensual sexual contact with his ex-girlfriend and that the encounter was consensual sadomasochistic role playing.

"I just want the truth to come out," he said. "I want my name cleared."

The lawsuit alleges that Doe was expelled after his ex-girlfriend filed a formal complaint against him in November 2016, accusing him of non-consensual sex and sexual assault. The university's investigation found that there was no evidence of non-consensual sex or assault, but concluded that there were "violations" of the school's sexual misconduct policy because the encounter involved force or coercion.

Doe's lawyer, Elizabeth Lederberg, said her client was expelled without due process, and that the investigation into his case was flawed from the beginning. She alleges that Doe was never informed of the specific accusations against him, and that he was not given an opportunity to challenge them or present evidence in his favor.

"There was no evidence presented against him at all," she said. "He was expelled based on hearsay."

The university's policy on sexual misconduct requires that students who are accused of such offenses be investigated and charged with a violation, regardless of the strength of the evidence against them. If found guilty, they can face suspension or expulsion, as well as other disciplinary actions.

The lawsuit alleges that Doe was never given an opportunity to present his case before being expelled, and that he was never informed of the charges against him or given any details about the investigation.

Lederberg said she believes that Doe's ex-girlfriend is lying about the encounter, and that her accusations were motivated by vengeance or a desire for financial gain. She said there is no evidence to support her ex-girlfriend's claim that the encounter was non-consensual.

"He has been expelled without any evidence at all," she said. "This is about a vindictive woman who wants to hurt him and has been able to do so through this policy."

The university declined to comment on the lawsuit Monday, but said in a statement that it takes sexual misconduct seriously and is committed to ensuring a safe environment for its students.

"GMU conducts thorough investigations into all reports of sexual misconduct, following our policies and procedures," the statement read. "The safety and well-being of our students is our top priority."
