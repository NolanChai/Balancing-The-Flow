20-year-old son died trying to do the same thing I did.

It was the end of July in 2017 when we traveled from Ethiopia to Somalia, then on to Turkey. We had heard about Europe's open border policies and how easy it was for migrants to cross into the continent. We were young and ambitious, with dreams of starting a better life in Europe.

My son and I stayed in a crowded tent near the Turkish coastline, waiting for our turn to board the boats that would take us across the Aegean Sea to Greece. The journey was treacherous: The boats were overcrowded and often capsized in rough seas. Many people drowned, including my son.

I managed to survive the crossing, but I was devastated by what had happened to him. When I arrived in Greece, I found myself in a detention camp. Conditions were horrific: We were given minimal food and water, and there were no toilets or showers. We slept on the floor in dirty, crowded rooms.

Despite the hardships, I felt fortunate to be alive. I knew that many others had not been so lucky, and that my son's death was a sacrifice I would never forget.

After several months in the camp, I was finally released and able to start a new life in Europe. I found work as a cleaner and began to rebuild my life. But my son's memory haunted me every day, and I often wondered what his life might have been like if he had made it across the sea.

I have since met other migrants who have also lost loved ones on their journeys to Europe. Their stories are heartbreaking, but they remind me that we all took the same risk in hopes of building a better future for ourselves and our families.

For me, the journey was worth it. I have a better life now than I did before, and I will never forget my son's sacrifice. But I also know that the risks we took were not without consequences, and that many others have paid an even greater price in their pursuit of a better life in Europe.
