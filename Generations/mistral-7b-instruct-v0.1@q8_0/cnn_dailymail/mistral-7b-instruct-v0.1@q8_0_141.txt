to put his foot down (quite literally) when it comes to one of his favourite indulgences.

According to the Daily Mail, Bolt has banned himself from eating junk food after discovering that his diet was affecting his performance on the track. The 27-year-old, who won eight gold medals at the London Olympics in 2012, had been consuming large amounts of fast food and sugary drinks to fuel his workouts – but he’s now switched to a more balanced diet that includes plenty of lean protein, complex carbs and healthy fats.

“I used to eat whatever I wanted,” Bolt told the Mail. “But after the Beijing Olympics in 2008, when I was injured, I started to pay attention to my diet. Now I make sure I get enough protein to repair my muscles and keep them strong.”

Bolt has also cut back on his alcohol intake, drinking no more than one pint of Guinness per day – which he consumes after a long workout or competition. And when it comes to indulging in his favourite foods, he now does so in moderation.

“I love junk food, especially chicken nuggets and crisps,” he said. “But now I only eat them occasionally as part of a balanced meal.”

So while Bolt may still enjoy the odd burger or fries, he’s made some serious changes to his diet – and it’s paying off. He recently set a world record in the 100m with a time of 9.58 seconds, breaking his own previous record of 9.63 seconds.
