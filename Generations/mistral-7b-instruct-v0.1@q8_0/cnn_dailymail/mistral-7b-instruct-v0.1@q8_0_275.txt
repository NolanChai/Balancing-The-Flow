It doesn't take an expert to understand why people are angry. But many of us also know that there's another side to the story. The IRS budget has been shrinking for years, and the current administration has proposed significant cuts to the agency. That means fewer employees, less technology, and a more difficult time providing the level of service we expect as taxpayers.

But what can you do about it? Here are some suggestions:

1. Contact your elected representatives. Tell them that you're frustrated with the IRS service you've received this year, and ask them to advocate for increased funding for the agency. You might also want to mention any personal experiences you've had with the IRS.
2. Use social media to vent your frustrations. Share your experiences with others on Twitter or Facebook, using relevant hashtags such as #IRSProblems or #TaxpayerFrustration. This can help raise awareness about the problem and put pressure on elected officials.
3. Consider alternative ways to communicate with the IRS. If you're having trouble getting through on the phone, consider trying to reach out to the agency via email or social media. While these channels may not be as effective, they might offer a different way to get your message across.
4. Look into third-party tax preparation services. If you're feeling overwhelmed by the tax filing process, consider hiring a professional to help you out. This can take some of the burden off you and ensure that your taxes are filed correctly.
5. Stay informed about IRS changes. Keep track of any updates or changes to IRS policies or procedures, as well as any news related to the agency's budget. This can help you stay on top of any issues that may affect you in the future.
