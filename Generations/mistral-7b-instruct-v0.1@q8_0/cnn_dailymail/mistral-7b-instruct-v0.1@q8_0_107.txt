of their own social media accounts when the page was taken over by hackers.

The pornographic images were posted on Scooter’s Coffee’s official Facebook page, and appeared to have been put there by a hacker who gained access to the company's computer system through an employee's email account. An unknown number of explicit photos were published, some of which showed nude women and men engaging in sexual acts.

The incident happened after an employee clicked on a link in an email that was allegedly sent by their manager. The employee fell for the scam and unknowingly gave their login credentials to the hackers, who then took over the page. It is unclear when the incident occurred, but it was only discovered after employees noticed the inappropriate content and began to report it.

Scooter’s Coffee officials stated that they immediately removed the offensive material from the page after discovering it, and that they were taking steps to ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. The company has also stated that their email system has been secured, and that they are working closely with law enforcement to identify the individuals responsible for the attack.

The incident has caused a significant amount of embarrassment for Scooter’s Coffee and may have damaged the company's reputation. It is important for businesses to educate their employees about cybersecurity risks and to implement strict protocols to prevent such incidents from happening in the future.
