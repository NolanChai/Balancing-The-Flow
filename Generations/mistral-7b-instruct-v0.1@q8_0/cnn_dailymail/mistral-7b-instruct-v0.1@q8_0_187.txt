sandstorms swept across China, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake and prompting authorities to issue warnings for people to stay indoors.

Residents of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region were hit by an enormous dust storm on Monday that reduced visibility to zero at times and created hazardous conditions on the roads.

"The sandstorm made it very difficult to see anything, we couldn't even make out our own houses," one resident told Xinhua News Agency. "We had no choice but to stay inside."

The dust storm also hit parts of the region in neighboring Gansu province and caused power outages and flight cancellations.

"It was extremely hot today, and a huge sandstorm swept across our village," said another resident. "Everything was covered with sand. It was terrible."

China has experienced several major dust storms this year, but experts cannot pinpoint the cause. Some scientists have suggested that climate change may be playing a role, while others have blamed human activities such as deforestation and mining.

In recent years, massive dust storms have also hit other parts of the world, including Australia, the United States, and North Africa. The phenomenon has been linked to rising temperatures and changing weather patterns.

Dust storms are not only a nuisance but can also pose health risks, as they can carry allergens and pollutants that can cause respiratory problems and other health issues.
