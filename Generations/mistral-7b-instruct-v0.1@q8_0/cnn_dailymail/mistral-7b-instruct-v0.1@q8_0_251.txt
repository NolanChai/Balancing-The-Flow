idi on Monday, December 17, after a four-day hearing during which prosecutors and defense lawyers argued over the charges against him.

The release of Lakhvi has been met with criticism from Indian officials and rights groups who accuse Pakistan of failing to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice. The attack took place on November 26, 2008, when gunmen stormed several locations in Mumbai, killing 166 people and injuring hundreds of others.

The attack was carried out by a group of militants linked to LeT, the Pakistani Taliban, who had been trained in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Indian government has accused Lakhvi of being the overall commander of the operation and has sought his extradition.

However, Lakhvi's release comes as part of a peace process between India and Pakistan which has been underway since 2014. Under the agreement reached in 2015, Lakhvi was to be released on bail after serving ten years of imprisonment, subject to Indian objections.

Lakhvi's release is seen as a significant development in the ongoing peace process, and is expected to pave the way for further talks between India and Pakistan. The two countries have a long history of conflict and tension over issues such as Kashmir, terrorism, and water sharing.
