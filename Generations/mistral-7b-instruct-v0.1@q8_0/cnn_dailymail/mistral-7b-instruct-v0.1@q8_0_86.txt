2019 edition of the tournament, which is set to take place between July 23 and August 10.

Manchester United will play four games during their time in the States, taking on Barcelona, AC Milan, Inter Milan and Real Madrid. The club's first game will be against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in Spain before they head across the Atlantic to face AC Milan and Inter Milan at Yankee Stadium and Soldier Field respectively. Their final game will see them take on Real Madrid at the Rose Bowl.

Chelsea, on the other hand, will play three games during their tour of the United States. They will first face Bayern Munich at Wembley Stadium before heading to the States to take on Inter Milan and New England Revolution. Their final game will see them face Barcelona at Gillette Stadium.

Both teams are likely to use this tournament as an opportunity to give some of their young players more first-team experience, as well as giving their squads a chance to rest and recover before the start of the new season.
