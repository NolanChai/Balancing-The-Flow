In recent years, both Messi and Ronaldo have been linked with a move to Juventus. It's said that Juve would have offered upwards of â‚¬100 million for each player, but their respective clubs - Barcelona and Real Madrid - have always been quick to insist that they will not sell them for anything less than the world record fee.

Speaking to a Spanish newspaper, Ronaldo revealed his admiration for both Messi and Neymar, saying: "I see many similarities between Messi and Neymar. They are great players with a lot of talent, and I think that together they could become something special."

"As for Messi and me playing together, I've always said that it would be a pleasure to play with the best players in the world," Ronaldo added. "If one day the opportunity presents itself, I wouldn't turn it down."
