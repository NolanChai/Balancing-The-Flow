opardy! Show in the US when she was confronted with a message from the family friend accusing her of being ungrateful.
Dawn had spent years trying to conceive and had finally become pregnant with twins. However, after one of the babies died at birth, she had to endure six more miscarriages before finally giving birth to a healthy baby girl.
Despite her grief, Dawn had set aside money for a grave stone for each of her babies who had died. She had hoped to place them on the stone together once they were all buried, but the theft of the funds has left her feeling betrayed and devastated.
In an interview with People magazine, Dawn said: "It was supposed to be a beautiful thing. It was supposed to be a symbol of all the babies I had lost, and now it's just gone."
The family friend, who has not been named, has not yet been charged with the theft. Dawn is urging anyone who knows anything to come forward and help her recover the money.
