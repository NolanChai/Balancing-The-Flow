Thiriez was at the stadium in Corsica to watch Bastia host Montpellier, but he did not make an appearance on the field before kick-off or at any point during the match.

Geronimi, who is also a member of the LFP council, has now called for Thiriez to resign from his role as head of French football.

"I find it unacceptable that the president of the LFP did not come down to shake hands with the players," said Geronimi after the match. "This is a tradition and a symbol of respect towards the players. I think we must ask Frederic Thiriez to step down as LFP president."

Bastia went on to win the match 3-0, but Geronimi's comments have sparked calls for him to resign from his position as Bastia president as well.
