valuables from their pockets as they pass by.

The criminals operate in pairs or small groups and target tourists and affluent Britons, especially around Oxford Street. They have been linked with a string of thefts involving watches, jewellery, cash and credit cards worth millions of pounds.

Detectives said that the pickpockets use sophisticated techniques to avoid being caught by security cameras or police officers. They often work in teams of two or three, with one member distracting their victim while the other steals from their pocket.

The criminals are thought to be part of an international network of pickpockets who operate in major tourist cities around the world, including Paris, Rome, Barcelona and New York.

Officers have been working to improve security measures around Oxford Street by increasing the number of CCTV cameras and patrols. However, some experts believe that it is impossible to prevent pickpocketing in crowded areas like this.
