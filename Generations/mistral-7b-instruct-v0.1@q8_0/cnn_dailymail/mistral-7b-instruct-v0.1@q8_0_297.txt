ook 15 minutes before carrying them out has been jailed.

Andrew Hennells, 28, of Cheshire, posted a message on the social networking site in which he wrote: “So guys here’s the plan,” followed by a list of details about how he intended to rob a Tesco supermarket in Nantwich. The message was posted at 9am on July 19 and Hennells went on to carry out the crime less than an hour later.

He walked into the store, threatened staff with a knife and made off with cash and cigarettes. But his bragging on Facebook allowed police to track him down quickly and he was arrested shortly after the robbery.

Hennells admitted the offence and was jailed for 13 months at Chester Crown Court. Detective Inspector Mike Banks, of Cheshire Police, said: “This case highlights the dangers of posting information about criminal plans on social media. It is not just the victims who are at risk – the police can also use this information to track down and apprehend offenders.”
