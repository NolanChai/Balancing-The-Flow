had seen, were left on the main road through Laxfield and are believed to be from a nearby firm that went bust.

Residents are furious with the mess, which has been building up over several weeks, and fear it could lead to a rise in vermin and health problems. Some have also complained about the smell of the waste, which is said to be so strong that it has put off people from visiting local shops and cafes.

The rubbish includes tyres, pallets, furniture, building materials and other industrial debris. Local resident Mike Adams said: "It's absolutely disgusting what they have done. They are ruining our village. This is the worst I've ever seen it." He added that he had been keeping a close eye on the tippers but had not been able to catch them in the act.

Suffolk Police said they were aware of the problem and working with the county council's waste team to find a solution. A spokesman said: "We are very sorry for the inconvenience this has caused residents. We are taking steps to address the issue as soon as possible." The police have appealed for anyone with information about the tippers, including the identity of their vehicle, to contact them.

Meanwhile, a group of volunteers from the village's community centre is working hard to clear up the mess and restore the area to its former beauty. They are being supported by councillors and other local officials, who have pledged to take action against whoever is responsible for the tipping.
