Ayotte's chief of staff, Jason Stark, said Wihby had been a top adviser and friend to Ayotte, and that he was shocked by his arrest. "We are deeply disappointed and saddened by these allegations," said Stark in a statement.

Wihby worked for Ayotte for more than 10 years and was her chief of staff in the US Senate. He had been charged with soliciting a prostitute on three previous occasions before this latest arrest, but had always managed to avoid conviction, according to the attorney general's office.
