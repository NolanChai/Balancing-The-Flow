ame displays against Luton and Blackpool.

Stoke’s 2-0 defeat to Luton on Tuesday night was their third home game without a shot target after three attempts. And at home, Blackpool have been equally as wasteful – their two shots on target after five attempts is a woeful return. The Premier League bottom club have managed just one shot on target in 27 games, and with 10 matches left they are struggling to maintain their place in the top flight.

Hughes has blamed Jones for Stoke’s home form, insisting the Welshman is not playing as well as he did before being sent off against Tottenham Hotspur in February. But it was a lack of chances that cost them at Kenilworth Road – Luton could have had more goals but missed the target twice from close range.

Stoke have been struggling with injuries and form for much of the season, and their performances at home have been particularly poor. They were also booed off by a small number of fans after their defeat to Luton.

But despite their struggles, Hughes believes his side can still finish in the top half of the table. “We’ve got some good players who are capable of producing good results and that’s what we need to do,” he said. “I think we have the ability to improve our performances at home and I want the players to believe that they can do it, too.”

Stoke’s next game is against Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday – a match which could see them slip out of the top half if results go against them. But Hughes remains optimistic: “I’ve always thought we would finish in the top half,” he said. “But it will take some hard work to do that.”
