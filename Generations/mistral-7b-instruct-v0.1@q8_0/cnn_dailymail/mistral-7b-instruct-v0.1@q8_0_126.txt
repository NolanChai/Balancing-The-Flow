th century gay history: the fight for decriminalisation and equality.

But what exactly did Miliband blubber about? Was he moved by the personal triumph of an individual character? Or was it something more profound, more fundamental to his understanding of the world and the place he occupies in it?

My suspicions are that Miliband didn’t blubber about anything particularly profound at all. I suspect he simply got swept up in the warm, fuzzy glow of nostalgia that accompanies most historical dramas.

And yet, in our current era of political polarisation and cultural fragmentation, surely this is something we should all be celebrating – even if it’s just a good old-fashioned tearjerker about the struggle for equality.
