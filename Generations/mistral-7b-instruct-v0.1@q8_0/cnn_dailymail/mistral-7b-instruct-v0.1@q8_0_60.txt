when he suddenly began behaving strangely. A little while later, officers discovered that the horse's mane had been adorned with the phrase "F*ck The Police".

"It's disgusting," said LAPD officer Mike Salerno. "I can't believe someone would do that to a police animal. They know how much they mean to us and the community." 

Salerno said it is unclear who could have tagged Charly or why, but added: "We take this very seriously and will continue to work with local authorities to find out who did this." The LAPD has also set up a tip line for anyone with information.

The graffiti on the horse's mane was quickly removed, and Charly was taken back to his stable, where he is receiving counseling.
