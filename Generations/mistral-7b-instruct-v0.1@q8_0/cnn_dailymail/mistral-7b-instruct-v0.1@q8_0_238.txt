aught but ropes and his bare hands in a death-defying stunt that took place on Wednesday.

The daring man, who has previously scaled the world’s tallest skyscrapers without safety equipment, began the ascent from the bottom of the tower and worked his way up to the top using just his strength and skill. At times he appeared to be barely clinging to life as he hung precariously over the side of the building, with nothing but air between him and certain death.

But Robert completed the climb in a record-breaking time of eight hours and 10 minutes, using only his own equipment and expertise. The Frenchman said: “I wanted to prove that I could do this without ropes or safety harnesses and I’m glad I managed it. It was incredibly challenging but I enjoyed every moment of it.”

He added: “Climbing is all about mental focus, physical strength and skill. And in the end, it’s always better to be safe than sorry.”

The Cayan Tower is currently the world’s tallest twisted skyscraper, standing at 1,007ft (305m) tall with 57 floors. Robert’s climb was watched by thousands of onlookers who gathered in Dubai to witness the spectacle. The city’s police and firefighters were also present, monitoring the event from a safe distance.
