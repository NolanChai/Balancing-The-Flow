5am on Monday morning on the A1(M) motorway near Leeds, just over six miles from his home town of Bradford.

But instead of stopping, Ali floored the accelerator and sped off down the motorway for almost two minutes, reaching speeds of up to 80mph in a bid to get away. The shocking dashcam footage, taken by a police officer on duty, shows the moment Ali overtakes the marked police car before losing control of his vehicle and slamming into a central reservation barrier.

The impact caused the front windscreen of the police car to shatter, showering the interior with debris. Ali’s car crumpled around him as he was thrown forward through the windscreen and into the barrier. He suffered serious injuries but is expected to survive. The police officer in the passenger seat sustained minor injuries to his wrist and neck.

Ali has been charged with dangerous driving, failing to stop for a police officer and driving while disqualified. He will appear before Leeds Magistrates’ Court on Monday afternoon. Chief Inspector of West Yorkshire Police, Mark Hamilton, said: “This is an unacceptable and reckless way to behave. We are very fortunate that no-one else has been injured as a result of Ali’s actions.”

It is believed that Ali was disqualified from driving last year after being involved in a crash. He had also been on a court order to attend regular appointments with a probation officer after being convicted of burglary.
