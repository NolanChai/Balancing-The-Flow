over his future at Stamford Bridge, which has led to interest from both clubs.

Tottenham are also keeping a close eye on Oscar and are willing to pay around Â£35m for him should he become available, while Arsenal have yet to make any serious bids for him this summer.

The 24-year-old has been with Chelsea since 2010 and is seen as an important part of the team by many at Stamford Bridge. However, his form has not been consistently impressive in recent seasons and he has fallen out of favour with Mourinho.

Oscar is currently on international duty with Brazil and will return to England next week. It remains to be seen whether Mourinho will give him another chance to prove himself at Chelsea or if he will be sold to make way for other players.
