> “strengthen our counter-terrorism laws and improve the sharing of intelligence”

Mrs May announced new powers for police to detain suspects and access their phones without a warrant, as part of a package of measures in response to the Manchester attack. However, the Home Secretary warned that the government would not be able to enact these changes if Parliament was tied up with debates over Brexit.

> “The last thing we want is for there to be an extended period of uncertainty during which terrorists can continue to plot and plan their attacks against us.”
>
> “It will be absolutely essential that we are able to pass the legislation necessary to strengthen our counter-terrorism laws and improve the sharing of intelligence, without delay or hesitation.”
>
> “I urge all parties to work constructively together to ensure we can get this through Parliament as quickly as possible.”

Theresa May also called on MPs to support her call for an independent review into the Manchester attack.

> “We must ask ourselves, what can be done to prevent such attacks in future? And what changes do we need to make to our laws and our society?”
>
> “We cannot allow fear to dictate our actions, or compromise our values. We must stand united against terror and work together to ensure the safety of our citizens.”

Theresa May has been under pressure from MPs, including Conservatives, to call for a general election. The Home Secretary’s comments on the need for new anti-terror laws could add weight to calls for an early poll.
