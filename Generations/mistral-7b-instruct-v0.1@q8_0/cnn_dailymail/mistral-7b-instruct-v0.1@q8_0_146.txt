, has suffered from PTSD and anxiety attacks since being subjected to bullying at school.

Tracy claims the council failed to act on her numerous complaints about the bullying, despite evidence of it occurring in the classroom. She has taken legal action against Hounslow Council after it refused to investigate her allegations further. Tracy said: "I don't know what more I need to do before someone listens and takes this seriously. My daughter has suffered enough as it is."

Tracy's lawsuit claims that her daughter, who has been diagnosed with autism, was targeted by bul bullies at Feltham Junior School in Hounslow, west London. The council said it takes all allegations of bullying very seriously and that it has no record of any complaint being made about Tianni's experience at the school. However, Tracy says she sent numerous emails and letters to the school and the council, detailing her daughter's experiences with bullying.

Tracy said: "Tianni was subjected to horrific bullying at the hands of several other children in her class. She was constantly belittled and laughed at, often in front of the whole classroom. The school failed to take any action, even though I provided them with evidence of what was happening."

The council said it had no record of any complaint being made about Tianni's experience at the school. It said: "We do not have any evidence to support the allegations made by Ms Stratton. We take all allegations of bullying very seriously and we work closely with schools to ensure that they are safe and supportive environments for all children."

Tracy has also launched a petition calling for an independent investigation into the council's handling of her complaints, which has been signed by more than 900 people.
