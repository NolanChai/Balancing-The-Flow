The CYG-11 uses a unique rotor configuration that allows it to take off and land vertically like a helicopter, but also provides lift for conventional flight once airborne. It's powered by four Rolls Royce BR700 engines, which provide 32,000 pounds of thrust. The aircraft can carry up to 36 passengers and has a maximum range of over 1,500 miles.

China Southern Airlines plans to use these planes for short-haul flights, with the ability to land on water in addition to traditional runways. It could be a game changer for air travel in places like South China Sea, where there are no long runways available.
