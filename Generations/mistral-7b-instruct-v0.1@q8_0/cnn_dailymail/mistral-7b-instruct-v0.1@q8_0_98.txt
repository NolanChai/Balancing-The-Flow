Manchester City are planning to table a mega-bid for Raheem Sterling on the day the transfer window reopens. The reigning Barclays Premier League champions have made the Liverpool forward a primary target in their summer transfer plans, and are willing to pay upwards of £50m to secure his services. City’s interest in Sterling has been growing steadily over recent months, with Pep Guardiola keen on adding pace and creativity to his attacking line-up. The England international has been in excellent form for Liverpool this season, scoring five goals in all competitions and providing three assists. Despite their interest in Sterling, City are prepared to face competition from other clubs, including Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea. It is understood that Liverpool are reluctant to sell the 20-year-old, but may be tempted by a significant offer if it matches their valuation of the player.
