after his death in the Swiss Alps.

Scott-Howell, 18, from St. Marys, Ontario, Canada, had been on holiday with his parents and younger sister when he fell down a steep cliff while skiing at the resort of Aletsch.

The exact circumstances of the fall are not yet clear, but police are investigating and have said that it appears to be an accident. The victim's body was found by local mountain rescue teams after they received a call from Scott-Howell's sister at around 10pm on Tuesday night.

Scott-Howell was known to be an experienced skier, but the area where he fell is extremely steep and dangerous, and even experienced skiers can struggle to navigate it safely. The resort has closed down temporarily while investigations continue, and local authorities have warned visitors to stay away from the area.
