# "Mature, Nous" - Ronald Koeman Calls For Players To Show Respect And Class After Victor Wanyama's Future In Doubt

RONALD KOEMAN called for Southampton players to show maturity and respect after Victor Wanyama's future at the club came under question.
The midfielder, who has been out since last April following a serious knee injury, has not yet agreed an extension on his current contract with Saints, which expires in 2021.
It is understood that the club are keen to tie Wanyama down for a new deal, but talks have stalled so far with the player and his representatives.
Koeman, who signed Wanyama for Â£35 million from Celtic in January 2016, was keen to stress the importance of treating the midfielder with respect during negotiations.
He said: "We can't forget that Victor has played for us for three years now and has been a very important player for this club. He has helped us win titles and he has shown maturity and nous on the pitch.
"That's why it's important for everyone involved to treat him with respect and show class in their dealings with him."
Wanyama's absence due to injury has left Saints short of options in midfield, with James Ward-Prowse currently the only senior player available to fill the position.
Koeman added: "We need our players back as soon as possible. We know that injuries have been a problem for us this season but we can't control that. What we can control is how well we manage those injuries and make sure we are prepared for any eventuality."
Saints host Everton at St Mary's on Sunday in what could be a pivotal game for their top-four aspirations.
