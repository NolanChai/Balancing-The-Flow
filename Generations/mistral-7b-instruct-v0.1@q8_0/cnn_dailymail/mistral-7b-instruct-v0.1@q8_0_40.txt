He also became the first player to make more than 500 appearances in all competitions for the Catalans, breaking a record held jointly by Messi and Xavi's former teammate Andres Iniesta.

With his 14th assist of the season in Barcelona's 3-0 victory over PSG, Xavi also broke his own club record for assists in all competitions. He now has 157 assists in all competitions, surpassing the previous record of 156 held by Messi.

"I am very grateful to my teammates and coaches for giving me so many opportunities to play," said Xavi after the match. "I have always tried to be a good team player and to help my team in any way I can."

Xavi's career at Barcelona began in 2008, and he has become synonymous with the club's tiki-taka style of play. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of all time, and his retirement from professional football in 2014 marked the end of an era for the Catalans.

Despite retiring at the age of just 35, Xavi has remained involved with Barcelona in various capacities. He currently serves as the director of soccer development for the club, overseeing the youth academy and working closely with head coach Ronald Koeman to develop the next generation of Bar√ßa stars.
