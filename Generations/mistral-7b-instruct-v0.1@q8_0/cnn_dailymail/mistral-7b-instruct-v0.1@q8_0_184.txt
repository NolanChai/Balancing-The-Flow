launching from the Vostochny Cosmodrome on July 18th.

The malfunction caused the spacecraft’s engines to fire uncontrollably, sending it into a spin that has now reached an alarming speed of 35 revolutions per minute. The agency is now working around the clock to try and regain control of the spaceship before it collides with other objects in orbit or falls back to Earth.

According to Roscosmos spokesman Vladimir Ustinov, the spacecraft’s autopilot system has been activated to try and slow down its speed, but so far, this has had little effect. The agency is now considering a number of options to regain control, including remotely shutting down the engines or using a thruster to counteract the spin.

The cause of the malfunction is not yet clear, but investigations are ongoing. If Roscosmos is able to regain control of Progress M-27M, it will mark a major achievement for the agency, which has recently been hit by a number of high-profile failures. However, if the spacecraft continues its spin out of control, it could pose a serious danger to other objects in orbit and to the crew of the International Space Station.
