The body of a girl who vanished on her fifth birthday while playing at a Texas marina has been found in the water nearby. Fiona 'Kitty' Carroll was at Kemah Boardwalk Marina as her father worked on his boat. She disappeared from her family, leaving behind only her shoes and jacket.

The search for Fiona took place over 10 days with hundreds of volunteers searching the marina, boats, and surrounding areas. The water was initially calm but a storm passed through last week and the area became rough.

Several divers were deployed to search the bottom of the lake and finally found the body on Monday afternoon. Her father said he was devastated by the loss of his daughter, who loved swimming in the ocean and playing with fish.

Fiona's disappearance has led to an outpouring of support from the community, with donations coming in for her family to help cover funeral expenses. Her father says he will never forget the joy she brought into his life.
