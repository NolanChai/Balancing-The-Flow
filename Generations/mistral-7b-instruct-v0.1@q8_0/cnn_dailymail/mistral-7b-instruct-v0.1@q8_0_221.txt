on Friday evening, features a fictional interview between Clarkson and BBC head Tony Hall.
In the show, the pair sit down to discuss the fallout from Clarkson’s attack on the producer – which led to his suspension by the BBC and subsequent departure from the show Top Gear. However, in the sketch, Hall insists that the attack was “blown out of all proportion”, while Clarkson argues that he only did what any “red-blooded male” would have done.
Clarkson also jokes about his relationship with the BBC’s in-house security guards and the fact that he has a key to the building, suggesting that he is now “essentially a house-guest”. Meanwhile, Hall tries to sell Clarkson on the idea of becoming a “reality TV star”, with the comedian apparently interested in taking part in Celebrity Masterchef.
The sketch was filmed at the BBC’s White City studios in London and is written by Jon Macks and Rick Kirby, who are also behind W1A’s previous episodes. It will be broadcast on BBC Two at 10.35pm on Friday evening.
Clarkson’s assault on the producer last March led to an outpouring of public support for the junior member of staff, who was later hailed as a “hero” by Prime Minister David Cameron. Clarkson has since returned to TV with his own show on Amazon Prime, while the BBC has replaced him with Matt LeBlanc on Top Gear.
