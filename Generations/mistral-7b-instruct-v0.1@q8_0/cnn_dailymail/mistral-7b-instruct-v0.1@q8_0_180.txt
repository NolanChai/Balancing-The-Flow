10 O'Clock Live, recorded himself performing a bizarre ritual he claims will bring him "good luck" in the coming year.

In the video, which has been viewed more than four million times on YouTube, Limmy can be seen holding a knife in one hand and the spider in the other. He then proceeds to slice off its legs one by one before letting it scuttle across his face. Throughout the clip, he repeatedly says "bring me good luck" as the spider crawls over him.

At one point, he even takes a bite out of the spider's body and chews on it before spitting it back out again. The video ends with Limmy holding up the now-legless spider in front of his face and declaring "I am ready for whatever this year brings me."

One viewer has described the clip as "disgusting," while another called it "completely insane." Some have even suggested that Limmy could be suffering from a psychological condition.

It's unclear what prompted Limmy to perform such a bizarre ritual, but he has a reputation for pushing boundaries and shocking audiences with his off-the-wall humor. He has previously posted videos of himself wearing a mask made out of human skin and eating raw fish in front of a live audience.

Despite the controversy surrounding the clip, Limmy's fans have praised his bravery and creativity. "This is pure genius," one commentator wrote. "Limmy is an absolute legend."
