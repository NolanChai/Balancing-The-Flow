ton on licence to attend an appeal against his conviction for the murder of Linda Smith in 2003.

Kerr, now 49, was rearrested at a hotel in Sheffield, where he had been staying with a woman who was not named in court documents. He was due to appear before Hull Crown Court on Monday but was remanded in custody until the case resumes next week. Kerr was jailed for life in 2003 for the murder of 45-year-old Ms Smith, from Hessle, near Hull. She died after being strangled and her body was found hidden in a cupboard in a flat in St Andrewâ€™s Quay, Hull, where Kerr was staying at the time.

The appeal against his conviction was heard last month but he was again found guilty of murder. After the verdict, Judge John Thackray QC ordered that Kerr be released from prison on licence to attend an appeal hearing in November. But after being warned to stay in Hull and not leave the city without permission, he fled.

During his absence, police launched a manhunt and put up posters offering a reward for information leading to his capture. Kerr was arrested at a hotel in Sheffield and taken back to Hull. No details were given of the woman who had been staying with him.
