Rory McIlroy put the golf clubs away as he battled with Fifty Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan to promote new football concept Circular Soccer. McIlroy was filmed battling with fellow Northern Irishman Dornan at a sports field in Los Angeles, California, and was seen wielding a ball rather than a golf club as he took part in the game. The video, which has gone viral, shows the pair going head-to-head in the bizarre football match, where players have to kick the ball into the center of the pitch without allowing it to touch the ground. McIlroy was seen struggling to get the hang of the game, but eventually managed to kick the ball into the center of the pitch, with Dornan conceding defeat.

During the match, McIlroy and Dornan were both dressed in full football gear, with the former wearing a shirt that read "Team McIlroy." The video has been praised for its humor and creativity, as well as its promotion of Circular Soccer. The game is designed to encourage players to use their imagination and think outside the box, as they work together to keep the ball in play without letting it touch the ground. It also aims to promote a healthier and more sustainable lifestyle, as players are encouraged to use their bodies in new and innovative ways.
