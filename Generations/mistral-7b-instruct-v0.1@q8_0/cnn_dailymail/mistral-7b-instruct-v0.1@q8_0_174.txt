wipes, was discovered during routine maintenance work. It took four days to remove the monstrous blob using high-powered jet hoses.

The 'fatberg' weighed a staggering 10 tonnes - as much as two double-decker buses - and measured an astonishing 40 metres long, 20 metres wide and 2 metres deep.

It was discovered in a sewer underneath one of London's most exclusive streets - Mayfair - which is home to some of the world's richest residents including billionaires David Beckham and Roman Abramovich.

The fatberg formed when fats and wet wipes were flushed down the toilet and mixed with sewage, allowing it to solidify into a hard, sticky substance that is extremely difficult to remove.

Workers had to use high-powered jet hoses to blast away the congealed mess, which was so thick it stuck to the walls of the sewer like molten lava.

The fatberg was removed in four days, with workers working around the clock to ensure that the disruption to traffic and residents was minimised.

Thames Water, which is responsible for maintaining London's sewers, said the removal of the fatberg was a 'major achievement'.

A spokesman said: "This was a significant operation, given the size of the fatberg and the complexities of working in a busy urban area.

"We are committed to keeping our customers' sewers clean and free from blockages, which can cause flooding and other problems."
