Navinder Sarao, 36, made the bold claim in October last year, when he had already started selling short-selling contracts on US stocks, which effectively bet against their rise in value. He was reported to have earned £100 million from the practice over a period of four years.

But his actions sparked a global financial crisis after an algorithm he used began making trillions of dollar orders at lightning speed, causing stock prices to plummet and wiping billions from investors' portfolios.

In the end, Mr Sarao was arrested by US authorities and extradited back to Britain where he faced charges over his role in the crash. He was cleared of criminal wrongdoing in February this year but is still facing a civil lawsuit brought by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

It's understood Mr Sarao has since retired from trading after being banned from the stock market for life. The incident has sparked calls for greater regulation of high-frequency trading, which involves buying and selling shares at breakneck speed using complex algorithms.

Mr Sarao, who was born in India but raised in Hounslow, west London, has never spoken publicly about his role in the Wall Street crash.

It's unclear how much of the £100 million he earned is still within his reach. He is believed to have lost a significant amount of his fortune during the stock market turmoil.

A spokesman for Mr Sarao said: "We can confirm that Navinder Sarao has retired from trading and is no longer involved in any form of financial activity."
