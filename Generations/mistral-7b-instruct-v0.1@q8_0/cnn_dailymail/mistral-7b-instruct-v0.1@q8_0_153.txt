ury as Liverpool and Chelsea recorded wins on Saturday, leaving them six points behind with two games left to play. Pellegrini knows that victory at Selhurst Park will not be enough if City are unable to take advantage of results elsewhere this week, but he believes his team can still pull off the seemingly impossible.

"It's clear that we have a tough task ahead," said the Chilean manager. "But I think we have shown in previous seasons that when things seem like they are not going our way, we manage to find some strength and make a push towards the end of the season. It will be very difficult, but we need to keep believing in ourselves." Pellegrini admits City have struggled badly in recent weeks, losing four of their last five games in all competitions. But he is hopeful that his side will show the determination and resolve needed to pull themselves out of this slump.
