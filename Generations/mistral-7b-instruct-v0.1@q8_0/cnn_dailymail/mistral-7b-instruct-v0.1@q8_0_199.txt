of Mount Sharp, confirming that the rover is still active and healthy.

NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission landed Curiosity in August 2012, and it has been exploring Gale Crater and Mount Sharp ever since. The image taken by the MRO shows Curiosity's shadow cast by the bright sun, indicating that it is tilted towards the sun. This is a common feature of the rover as it moves across the Martian surface.

"Itâ€™s always thrilling to see our robots on the surface of another planet," said Michael Tropper, MRO mission manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. "This image confirms that Curiosity is still hard at work exploring the mysteries of Mars."

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been orbiting Mars since 2006 and is currently more than 54 million miles (87 million kilometers) from Earth. It serves as a key communications relay station for other Mars missions, including the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission, which began studying the upper atmosphere of Mars in October 2014.

"The MRO is an incredibly valuable asset to our Mars exploration efforts," said MAVEN principal investigator Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado Boulder. "It has provided us with a wealth of data about the Martian surface, and its communications capabilities have allowed us to interact with Curiosity and other Mars missions."

The MRO continues to capture detailed images of the Martian surface, including this stunning panoramic view of Gale Crater taken in December 2015.
