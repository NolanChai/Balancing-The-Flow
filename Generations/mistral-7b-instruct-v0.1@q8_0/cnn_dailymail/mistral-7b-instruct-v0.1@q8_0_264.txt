Robert, who fought on the D-Day landings and survived two torpedo attacks, shared his incredible experiences with young brothers, Alex and Sam, who are fascinated by naval history.

The twins were invited to meet Robert, who lives near their home in Portsmouth, England, after their father found a letter he had written to their grandfather.

"It was such an honor to meet him," said Alex, who has already begun researching the war with his newfound knowledge.

"We couldn't believe what we were hearing - it was like being transported back in time," added Sam, who is particularly interested in naval aircraft.

Robert, who has just celebrated his 89th birthday, said he was thrilled to meet the young boys and share his stories with them.

"It's always a pleasure to talk about the war," he said. "But it's even more special when you get to hear how your actions have inspired others."

As they listened intently, Robert recounted tales of the battles he fought, including his role as a radio operator on board the HMS Devonshire, which was sunk during the Battle of the Atlantic.

"It was a terrifying experience," he said. "But we managed to save ourselves and most of our crew thanks to the quick thinking of our captain."

Alex and Sam were fascinated by Robert's experiences and asked him countless questions, eager to learn more about life in the navy during World War II.

"We learned so much from Robert," said Alex. "He showed us that history is not just something you read about in books - it's something you can experience firsthand."

Sam agreed, adding: "It was an unforgettable day that we will always treasure."
