old also believes he is capable of playing another World Cup, although he admits it will be tough given his age.

Carlos has been working in the Brazilian football setup since he retired from international football in 2011 and he was part of the coaching staff that helped take Brazil to the semi-finals of the last World Cup in South Africa in 2010. He is currently an assistant coach at Flamengo, one of Brazil's biggest clubs.

"I am not saying I will be the manager of Brazil one day but I am very happy working with the national team because it is my country," he said. "I think if you work in football, you have to have a big ambition and you need to dream. I want to help the next generation of players reach their potential."

The defender, who won three World Cups for Brazil, says coaching has been much easier than playing at the highest level. "As a player, the pressure is very high because you have so many people watching you," he said. "But as a coach, it is much easier because you are working with players and you can help them overcome their problems. I am very happy to be a coach because it allows me to share my knowledge of football with the next generation."

Carlos admits that his age will make it tough for him to play another World Cup but he says he still has what it takes to compete at the highest level. "I think you can never say never in football," he said. "If I am still fit and healthy, I could play another World Cup. But I have no doubt that there are many players out there who are just as good as me and I will be happy if they get the chance to play for Brazil."
