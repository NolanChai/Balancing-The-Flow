cherty have been told to pay up by April 30th every year since 2016 following a lengthy investigation into their offshore tax schemes.

However, the group have yet to comply with the demands, despite being given multiple reminders. Insiders claim that the trio have not made any payments towards their debt and have not engaged in discussions with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) about finding a way to repay the money owed.

A source told The Sun: “There has been no dialogue with the taxman for years now. They have just completely ignored him and continue to live their lavish lifestyles without paying their dues.”

The news comes after it was revealed that Take That’s former manager, Jonathan Dickinson, had also still not paid his share of the £20million tax bill after being ordered to do so last year. The source added: “Jonathan is another one who has just ignored the demands and continues to live his life without any care in the world.”

When contacted by the Daily Mail, a spokesman for Take That said: “We have no comment on this matter.”

However, a HMRC spokesperson told The Sun: “We can confirm that Mr Barlow has not paid the outstanding tax bill and is subject to an ongoing investigation. We cannot disclose any further details at this time.”

The group’s failure to pay up could lead to legal action being taken against them. HMRC has previously warned that those who fail to comply with its demands could face interest charges and even imprisonment if they refuse to pay.
