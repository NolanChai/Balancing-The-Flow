ame all too real.

Hayleigh Mcbay, aged 18, from Elgin, in Moray, claimed she planned to fake her own death and leave a message for her beau on the website of popular US soap opera, General Hospital. But as she lay in her bed, pretending to be dead, she received a call from her boyfriend David Clarke, who had also been taken in by the April Fools' Day hoax.

The cruel pranker, who also went on to make it seem like her family were unaware of her supposed demise, said: "I thought I would have the last laugh and tell everyone David was dead. But when he called me I couldn't believe it!

"It was hilarious at first but then it became too real when I actually got the call from him."

She added: "I don't know if I should be angry or embarrassed. It's a bit of both really."

Hayleigh, who was trying to keep a low profile after her elaborate prank, said she is still trying to piece together what exactly happened.

"It's been really weird," she said. "I went to bed and when I woke up I got the call from David. But it wasn't until then that I realised there was no message on General Hospital."

The hoax was only brought to light by the show's fans, who noticed a lack of usual plot developments and dialogue.

Hayleigh, who is a fan of the show, said: "I just couldn't believe it. It's been running for over 50 years so I thought they would have something big planned. But there was nothing."
