and bomb-making instructions in his UK flat.

Dr Faris Al-Khori, 62, from London had accumulated a "significant" cache of chemicals and was found guilty of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life or property.

Al-Khori, who fled to the UK following the civil war in Syria, had been collecting the materials for several years and police discovered them during a search of his two-bedroom flat.

The hoard included chemicals such as nitrates, sulphur, potassium chlorate and hydrogen peroxide, which could be used to make deadly bombs, according to prosecutors.

Alongside the explosives were found written recipes for making devices and instructions on how to assemble them.

Detective Chief Inspector David Heaton of Scotland Yard's Counter-Terrorism Command said: "This man had a significant cache of highly dangerous chemicals and was actively researching and acquiring the materials needed to make deadly bombs."

Al-Khori had been under police surveillance for several months before officers raided his home in October 2019.

Officers discovered the hoard of explosives and bomb-making equipment hidden away in a cellar, as well as in various rooms throughout the flat.

In addition to the explosives, officers found documents detailing Al-Khori's plans for using the materials to commit acts of terrorism.

Prosecutors said that Al-Khori had been researching bomb-making techniques and studying the work of other extremists.

Al-Khori, who has not yet been sentenced, denied any involvement in terrorism or illegal activities.

It is unclear what motivated him to collect the explosives or why he was storing them in his flat. However, police believe that he may have planned to use the materials for personal gain or as a bargaining chip in political negotiations.
