27, who signed for a world-record Â£85m in 2013, was an unused substitute against Atletico as Real Madrid lifted their fourth successive Champions League title.

Bale had been on the bench in all of Real's previous five matches since Zinedine Zidane replaced Rafael Benitez as manager at the end of March. But despite not starting, he has still made an impact on the pitch. In 43 minutes against Atletico, he was fouled twice and dispossessed once - all in dangerous areas.

But it is clear that Zidane doesn't see Bale as a regular starter - he has started just five of Real's 17 league games this season - and the Welshman looks set to continue his role as a game-changer from the bench.
