Desperate parents admit son's head can never be fixed, they'd rather he died - Daily Mail Online

A man has been jailed after driving the wrong way on a dual carriageway and causing a crash that killed a 62-year-old motorist.

Michael Leary, 47, from Houghton-le-Spring, County Durham, was travelling in the wrong direction on the A190 at Durham City Centre when he collided with a silver Toyota Camry being driven by John Gale, 62. The collision happened around 6pm on Monday and Mr Gale died from his injuries.

Leary pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and was sentenced to three years in prison.

Police officer Darren Smith said: "This collision highlights the importance of always following the correct direction of travel on our roads."

"It is also a stark reminder of the devastating consequences that can occur as a result of driving under the influence of alcohol."

Leary's solicitor, Graeme Hoggarth, said his client had been struggling with alcoholism and depression for some time.
