The incident occurred last Friday at Butchers by the Bridge in Woollahbaalaa on the city's north shore.

Belinda Bartholomew, 24, is seen on CCTV footage, with her boyfriend Aidan Guerra looking on, trying to buy a chicken from a display window in the butcher shop.

Butcher Nick Chin told The Daily Telegraph that Belinda became "out of control" and "violent" when he refused to sell her a chicken for the same price as his online store.

He allegedly told her she was being "ripped off" by the butcher in charge, who was trying to flog her a bigger bird.

But Belinda disputes the butcher's version of events, telling The Daily Telegraph that Chin tried to scam her by selling her a chicken that was far smaller than what he had advertised.

"He tried to rip me off," she said. "I asked him to give me the same size as his online store and he refused."

She allegedly became frustrated when Chin's assistant, who was trying to sell her the larger bird, also refused to give it to her.

"When I went to the counter to pay, he started arguing with me," she said. "I kept asking for a bigger chicken and he just kept saying no."

Belinda allegedly tried to pay with cash but was refused because Chin's store didn't take it.

"It was such a ridiculous situation," she said.

Chin, 26, has denied any wrongdoing. "I don't know why this is becoming such a big thing," he said. "They wanted a bigger chicken and I couldn't give them one because we didn't have one available."

He also disputed Belinda's claim that he tried to scam her. "There was no scamming involved," he said.

The incident has sparked a heated debate on social media, with some people supporting the butcher's actions and others accusing him of being aggressive towards the woman.
