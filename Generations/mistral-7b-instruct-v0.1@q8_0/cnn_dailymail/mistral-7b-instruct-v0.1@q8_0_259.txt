Ancelotti has been rotating his players in recent weeks with the Copa del Rey semi-finals against Barcelona starting next week, but Bale has not featured since coming on as a substitute in the 0-0 draw at Villarreal last weekend.

"Bale will not be in the squad for the Eibar game. He needs a rest," Ancelotti told a news conference. "We have had a lot of games in a short period and we need to give him some time off."

Real Madrid, who are second in La Liga, are looking to bounce back from their recent 2-1 defeat to Barcelona in the Clasico. Eibar, who are eighth in the table, have not won in their last four league games.
