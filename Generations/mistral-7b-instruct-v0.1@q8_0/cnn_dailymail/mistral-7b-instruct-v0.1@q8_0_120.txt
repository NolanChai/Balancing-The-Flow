When the bomb went off, Steve Woolfenden thought he was still standing. That was because, as he lay on the ground, he was still holding the handles of his son's stroller. He pulled back the stroller and saw his son's legs flailing. Woolfenden thought it was just a bad trip on the sidewalk. Then he realized that he had been hit by something and that there were other people running away from the scene.

It took him several seconds to understand what had happened. He felt his leg hurt, but then he heard someone say "bomb." That was when he realized that he had been struck by an improvised explosive device (IED). Woolfenden tried to get up, but he could only limp away from the scene.

"It was chaos," he said. "People were running in every direction and there was smoke everywhere." He saw a man who looked like he had lost a leg and another who was bleeding out on the ground. "I knew it was a serious situation, so I just kept moving as fast as I could to get away from the scene," Woolfenden said.

Woolfenden's son, Alex, was unhurt in the stroller. "When he got out of the stroller, he looked a little scared, but otherwise he was fine," Woolfenden said. "He just wanted to get away from all the chaos and smoke."

The bombing took place at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, near Copley Square. It killed three people, including a young boy, and injured hundreds others. As the city reels from the attack, Woolfenden is grateful that his family is safe. He says he will never forget the fear he felt that day, but he also knows that life goes on.

"We're all just trying to get through this together," he said.
