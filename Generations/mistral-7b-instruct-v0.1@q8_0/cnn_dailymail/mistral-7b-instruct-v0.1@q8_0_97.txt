Kazi Islam, 18, pleaded guilty at Old Bailey to conspiracy to commit terrorism.

His co-conspirator Harry Thomas, 19, admitted manslaughter and attempted murder after being sentenced for possession of firearms with intent to endanger life in March last year.

Prosecutors said that Islam sent Thomas texts telling him to buy parts for a bomb and gave him instructions on how to make it. Thomas then went on to kill four people at the Methodist Central Hall in London, including his own father, before shooting and injuring a fifth person.

The Old Bailey court heard that Thomas had learning difficulties and was vulnerable to being taken advantage of. Prosecutors said that Islam knew this and exploited it to carry out the attack.

The court also heard that Islam had previously shown an interest in terrorism and extremist groups, but had not been involved in any previous terror plots.
