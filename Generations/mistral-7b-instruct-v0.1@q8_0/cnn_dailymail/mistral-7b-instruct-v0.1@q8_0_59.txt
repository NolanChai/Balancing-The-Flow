11-8 underdog by Las Vegas oddsmakers, but Pacquiao insists he can emerge victorious and cement his place among history's greatest fighters.

"If it's not for my family, I'd be dead already," Pacquiao, who has suffered from blood clots and other health problems in the past, told the Daily Mail. "This fight is for me to win. I have to make sure that when I fight, I fight like it's my last fight, because if I don't win this one, I might never get another opportunity."

Pacquiao, who has won 56 of his 70 career fights and holds a world title in five weight classes, knows he faces an uphill battle against Mayweather. The American, who has never lost in his pro career, has been widely regarded as the best fighter of his generation for years, and has often mocked Pacquiao's supposed weaknesses.

But Pacquiao is determined to prove doubters wrong and show that he still has what it takes to be a dominant force in the ring.

"I'm not underestimating him," Pacquiao said of Mayweather. "But I'm confident in myself, and I know I can win this fight."
