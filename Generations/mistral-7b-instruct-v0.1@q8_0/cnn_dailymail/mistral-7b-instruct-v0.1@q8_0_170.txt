screamed as the plane plummeted more than 6,000 feet in less than two minutes and was forced to make an emergency landing at Bakersfield International Airport in California. The plane was operating on a United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles when the incident occurred.

According to a passenger who witnessed the event, the cabin pressure dropped suddenly and the plane began to plummet rapidly.  “Everybody started screaming,” said the man, whose name has not been disclosed. “We were all praying.” The sudden loss of pressure is believed to have been caused by an explosion in one of the aircraft's engines. 

The pilot managed to regain control of the plane and make a safe emergency landing at Bakersfield International Airport. All 75 passengers on board survived the incident, but several were reportedly injured and taken to hospitals for treatment. The cause of the engine explosion is still under investigation, but SkyWest Airlines said it was likely due to a mechanical malfunction. 

The incident has raised concerns about the safety of commercial air travel. In recent years there have been several high-profile plane crashes and incidents that have led to increased scrutiny of air travel safety measures.  SkyWest Airlines, which is a regional carrier owned by United Continental Holdings, said it was cooperating fully with authorities investigating the incident.
