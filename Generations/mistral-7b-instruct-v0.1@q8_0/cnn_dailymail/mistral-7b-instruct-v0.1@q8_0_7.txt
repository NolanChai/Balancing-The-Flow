57-year-old British man, who had previously been associated with ISIL but left the group before the Syrian civil war began, performing surgery on children and young men injured in the fighting.

Dr Mohammad Hussaini, an Australian Muslim, is shown in the video wearing a surgical mask, performing amputations and suturing wounds on a row of patients lying on hospital beds. The ISIL-controlled area's flag can be seen in the background of the footage.

The video's narrator says that "today, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has established its own health service in Syria" and that Dr Hussaini is one of its surgeons. The narrator also emphasizes that the ISIL-controlled area has better medical facilities than those in the rest of Syria.

The Australian government has condemned the video and called for it to be taken down. "ISIL's propaganda campaign, which includes this latest video featuring Dr Hussaini, is nothing more than a desperate attempt to distract from their horrific record of violence and terror," Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said in a statement. "This video highlights once again the callous disregard ISIL has for innocent human life."

The video was posted on ISIL's official media channels and can be accessed online. It is believed that the patients featured in the footage are ISIL fighters or their families, who have been injured in the fighting in Syria.
