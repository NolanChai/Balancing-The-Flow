Dortmund this summer, and a move to Bayern is being strongly considered.

"Klopp is a good candidate," Beckenbauer told Welt am Sonntag. "He's got experience, he's got a great team spirit and he's very competitive."

The German coach has been linked with a return to his homeland following his departure from Liverpool in the summer of 2018. While Guardiola has been Bayern's head coach for the past two seasons, the club is expected to replace him at some point this year.

Beckenbauer added that he believes Bayern should be looking to win the Champions League next season and that Klopp could help achieve this goal.

"He's a great trainer and has a lot of experience with winning trophies," Beckenbauer said. "I don't see why Bayern wouldn't consider him."

However, Bayern has not yet confirmed any interest in signing Klopp. The club is expected to make a decision on Guardiola's future at the end of the season.
