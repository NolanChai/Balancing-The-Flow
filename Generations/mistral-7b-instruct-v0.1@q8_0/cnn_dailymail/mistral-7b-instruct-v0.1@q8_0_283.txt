ripoor, the city that had been the stage for the first of the new millennium's most iconic moments, and surrounded by the very people who had helped him to secure those victories, he knew that it was time to move on.

It is hard to overstate the impact of Italy in the 1990s. Under the guidance of Ancelotti, they won four of the five World Cups contested between 1990 and 2006, and their dominance of the sport was unassailable. Yet, despite their continued success on the field, the foundations had begun to crumble in the years leading up to the turn of the millennium. It was a time when the world of football was changing rapidly, and Italy, like many other nations, struggled to keep pace.

Ancelotti, however, was always one step ahead of the curve, and he knew that it was time for a change. The first World Cup victory in 1990 had been built on an unwavering defensive resolve, but by the mid-1990s, teams like Brazil and Argentina were beginning to exploit Italy's reliance on a solid backline. It was clear that the old ways would not be enough to secure another world title.

So, when Italy won their second World Cup in 1994, Ancelotti began to implement a new strategy. He had seen first-hand how effective possession football could be, and he knew that if Italy were to remain at the top of the game, they needed to adopt this style. It was a bold move, and one that would ultimately prove successful, as Italy went on to win a third World Cup in 1998, and a fourth in 2006 under the stewardship of another legendary coach, Marcello Lippi.

But it was not just on the field that Italy was changing. Off the pitch, there were signs that the country was becoming increasingly divided. The rise of the far-right and the growing discontent among the working class were reflected in the increasingly violent football matches that took place in the streets of cities like Naples and Rome. It was a dark time for Italian football, and Ancelotti knew that change was needed.

The solution, he believed, lay in promoting a sense of national unity through the sport. He began by organising a series of friendly matches against countries that had never before played Italy, with the aim of showcasing the best of Italian football to a new global audience. These games were designed to be as inclusive and accessible as possible, with ticket prices kept low and stadiums filled with fans from all walks of life.

It was not an easy task, but Ancelotti was determined to succeed. He understood that Italy needed a new direction, and he believed that football could play a pivotal role in this process. Through his efforts, he helped to promote a more positive image of Italy to the world, while also helping to bridge the divide between different communities within the country.

As the years passed, the impact of Ancelotti's vision became increasingly apparent. The rise of Italian football in the 1990s and early 2000s helped to foster a sense of national pride and unity, and it played a significant role in shaping the country's identity. It was an era of great success on the field, as well as off it, and it was one that Ancelotti will always be remembered as a key part of his legacy.

But it was not just Italy that benefited from Ancelotti's vision. As he continued to work with some of the world's greatest players, he helped to revolutionise the way that football was played and understood in Europe and beyond. His innovative tactics and forward-thinking approach to the game inspired a new generation of coaches, and his influence can still be felt today, more than two decades after he first began to shape the future of Italian football.

So, as Ancelotti stood on that stage in Madripoor all those years ago, surrounded by the people who had helped him to achieve so much success, he knew that it was time to move on. He had been a part of something truly special, and he was proud of everything that they had accomplished together. But he also knew that there would always be new challenges to face, and new opportunities to make a difference in the world of football.

And so, with a heavy heart, he said his goodbyes and set off on the next chapter of his incredible journey. He would go on to win numerous titles with some of Europe's biggest clubs, as well as helping Italy to reach the quarter-finals of the 2006 World Cup. But it was his work in shaping the future of Italian football that would remain his greatest legacy, and he will always be remembered as one of the most important figures in the history of the sport.
