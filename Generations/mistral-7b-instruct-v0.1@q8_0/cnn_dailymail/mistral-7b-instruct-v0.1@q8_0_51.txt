“For me, he [John Terry] has been the standout,” Carragher said. “I think he’s been fantastic for Chelsea this year.”

Terry, who joined Chelsea from West Ham United in 2004, has won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, and two Champions Leagues during his time at Stamford Bridge. He is also the club’s all-time top scorer with 28 goals.

“He’s been the best defender in the league for a long time now,” Carragher added. “I know he’s had a few injuries and criticisms over the years, but when you look at his stats and his performances on the pitch, he’s head and shoulders above anyone else.”
