ared as the antitrust agencies prepare to launch a formal review of the deal that could face significant scrutiny.

The cable giants are scheduled to meet with the DOJ on Monday to present details of their proposed acquisition, including the divestiture of some assets, sources told Bloomberg. The meeting is part of an informal process that may pave the way for a formal antitrust review by the Justice Department.

The two companies announced plans to merge last month, a deal that would give them control over 70% of the US cable market and give Comcast a foothold in the broadband market. The merger has sparked concerns about reduced competition and higher prices for consumers.

Shares of both companies have fallen since news of the merger was announced, with Time Warner Cable shares falling almost 20% and Comcast shares dropping around 7%.
