aggled rope at the Scout camp in Chamonix.

A post on the GoFundMe page set up to help pay for Jake’s funeral read: ‘Jake was an inspiration to so many people, a bright light that shone too short a time. He died doing what he loved, helping others to achieve their potential and making this world a better place.’

An inquest into Jake’s death opened yesterday and heard how the young man from St Neots had fallen while leading an experienced climber on a beginner’s climb at around 10am. The victim, who had been working as a climbing instructor at the centre for several months, was wearing a helmet but it is understood he did not have a harness on at the time of his fatal fall.

The inquest also heard how Jake had suffered from mental health issues in the past and that he had been undergoing therapy before his death.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Jake’s friend Simon Smith said: ‘Jake was so full of life and energy – it’s just such a tragic loss. He was always up for a challenge and loved climbing. He was a fantastic instructor who inspired so many young people.’

The Scout Association issued a statement yesterday saying: “We are deeply saddened by the tragic death of Jake Shaw, a volunteer climbing instructor who was working at one of our international centres in the Swiss Alps. Our thoughts are with Jake’s family and friends at this difficult time.”

The GoFundMe page for Jake’s funeral has raised more than £30,000 from people wanting to pay their respects to the young man.
