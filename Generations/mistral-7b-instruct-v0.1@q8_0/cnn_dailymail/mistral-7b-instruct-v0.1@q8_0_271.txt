England skipper Robshaw is seen in several photos soaking up the sun, playing beach volleyball and drinking cocktails as he celebrates his 25th birthday with Kerslake. The England team are due to meet up for their first training session of the year on January 3rd at Twickenham.

The pictures emerged after Robshawâ€™s friend, former England hooker Steve Thompson, shared them on Twitter. The 24-year-old has been married since July and is currently away on honeymoon with his wife Samantha.

Robshaw is believed to have taken some time off from international rugby to focus on his studies and spend time with his family during the off-season. He returned to action in November, helping England win the Autumn Internationals series.
