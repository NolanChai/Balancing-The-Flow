The number of pregnancies on board ships and submarines has become such an issue that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has had to put together guidelines on how to deal with them. One guide even includes details on the best time for sailors to 'get lucky' if they want to avoid pregnancy while at sea.

According to official figures, there were 21 pregnancies on board ships and submarines in 2017 alone - although this is thought to be an underestimate due to some sailors not declaring their pregnancies.

The MoD has faced criticism over its handling of pregnancies on board ships, with some sailors claiming that they have been unfairly removed from duties or subjected to long waits for medical assistance.

However, the MoD insists that it takes all pregnancy-related issues seriously and provides comprehensive support to pregnant sailors. It also points out that the number of pregnancies on board ships and submarines is relatively low compared to the overall size of the armed forces.

In response to the FOI request, an MoD spokesperson said: "The health and wellbeing of our personnel is of utmost importance to us. We have robust processes in place for supporting pregnant sailors, including providing access to medical care and appropriate accommodation."
