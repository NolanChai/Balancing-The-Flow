The new Terminal 3 at Beijing International Airport is so massive that it could hold 90 Boeing 747s at once. The airport will be able to handle up to 15 million passengers annually - double the current capacity.

"It's a dream come true for me, and I'm very proud of my country," said Lin Zhenqian, one of the airport's ground staff who has been working there since it opened in 2008.

Beijing International Airport is currently China's busiest airport, serving both domestic and international flights. The new terminal aims to accommodate the growing number of Chinese tourists traveling abroad.

"With Terminal 3, we aim to provide a better experience for passengers by offering more facilities, faster boarding times, and a wider variety of shops and restaurants," said Zhang Xiaoming, general manager of Beijing Capital International Airport.

The airport will also have a dedicated transportation hub, allowing travelers to get around more easily and quickly. It is expected to boost the local economy as well.

"Beijing International Airport is not just an airport; it's a gateway for China's economic development," said Zhang. "By serving more tourists, we can promote Chinese culture and help more people understand our country."
