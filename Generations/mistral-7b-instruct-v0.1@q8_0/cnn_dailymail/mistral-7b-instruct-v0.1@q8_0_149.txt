uck into the big book for Lent. And let me tell you: It is an intense read.

There are parts where the language can be hard to follow, and sometimes you feel like you're being beaten over the head with it. But then there are these beautiful moments when God shows up in a burning bush or speaks to Moses on a mountaintop, and you realize how much power is contained within those ancient words.

As I delved deeper into the Bible this Lenten season, I realized something that I hadn't thought about before: The Bible is not just a collection of stories, it's a story -- one that spans centuries and connects us all together. It's a narrative that tells us who we are, where we come from, and where we're going.

And that story isn't just told through the words on the page, but also through the actions of the people within it. From Abraham to Jesus, each character plays an important role in shaping the story of humanity. They make mistakes, they experience triumphs, they have moments of doubt and fear, but ultimately, they follow God's will.

And that's what I think Lent is about: Following God's will. It's a time to set aside our distractions and focus on what truly matters in life. It's a time to fast, pray, and give back to those in need. And it's a time to remember that we are all part of this bigger story, and that we have the power to shape its outcome.

So, as I continue to read the Bible this Lenten season, I'm also trying to apply these lessons to my own life. I'm focusing on being more intentional about my actions and decisions, and I'm trying to be a better example of Christ for those around me. It won't always be easy, but I believe that if we all do our part, we can make this world a better place.

And maybe, just maybe, by living out the story of the Bible, we can bring a little bit of heaven to earth.
