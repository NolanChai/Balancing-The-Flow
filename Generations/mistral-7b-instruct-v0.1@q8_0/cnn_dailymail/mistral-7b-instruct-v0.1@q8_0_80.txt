na Vogel, who was traveling to the UAE with her husband last month, arrived at Abu Dhabi International Airport and found that her bag, which contained her mother's ashes, had been lost by the airline.

Vogel told CNN that her mother passed away in November, and she and her husband were trying to bring her remains back to the US for a final resting place in their family plot.

"It was supposed to be the final step of a long journey," Vogel said. "And now we're left with nothing."

She says the airline has been unhelpful, and that she's spent countless hours on hold trying to get her bag back.

"It's just an absolute nightmare," Vogel said. "We've tried everything â€” filed police reports, contacted the airline multiple times, talked to customer service representatives who claim they don't know anything about it. It's like we're just chasing shadows."

The UAE government has strict rules regarding the handling of human remains, and Vogel says she's worried that her mother's ashes will be lost forever if they can't find the bag.

"It's just devastating," she said. "I feel like my mom is still missing, even though she passed away months ago. And now we're faced with the possibility of losing her completely."

Vogel says she's trying to stay hopeful that she'll be able to reunite with her mother's ashes, but it's been a difficult journey so far.

"I just keep praying," she said. "I don't know what else we can do."
