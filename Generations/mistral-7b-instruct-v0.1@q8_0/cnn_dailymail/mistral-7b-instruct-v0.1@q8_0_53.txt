trauma on July 5 after a violent altercation with an older boy in a park in White Rock, British Columbia, according to the coronerâ€™s report released on Monday.

The postmortem examination found that Bonneau died of multiple injuries caused by a heavy blow to his head and body. The boy who killed him had gone to the police station with cuts on his face and hands and claimed that he was defending himself against Bonneau, who had attacked him first. 

According to witnesses, Bonneau had been playing with other children in the park when the older boy approached him and demanded that he hand over his toy car. When Bonneau refused, the older boy punched him repeatedly, knocking him down and causing him to lose consciousness. He was found lying unconscious on the ground by a passing stranger who called an ambulance.

Bonneau's death has caused shock and anger in the community, with many people calling for tougher laws and stricter penalties for child murderers. The boy who killed him has been charged with second-degree manslaughter and is scheduled to appear in court next month.
