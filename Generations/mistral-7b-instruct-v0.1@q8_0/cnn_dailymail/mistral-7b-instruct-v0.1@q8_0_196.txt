reported are more likely to be infested with mould, which can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air, causing a range of symptoms including headaches and hallucinations.

The study was conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, who looked at data on hauntings from over 1,000 locations in California. They found that buildings built before 1940 were more likely to be haunted than newer constructions, and that these older buildings were also more likely to be infested with mould.

"Mould can grow on damp surfaces, so it's not surprising that it's more common in old buildings," said study lead author Dr. Benjamin Sessa. "When mould grows, it releases volatile organic compounds into the air. These can trigger a range of symptoms, including headaches, hallucinations and even anxiety attacks."

The researchers say that these symptoms are often confused with those caused by paranormal activity, leading people to believe they have seen ghosts when what they are actually experiencing is mould exposure. "If you think you've seen a ghost, it's possible that you're just reacting to the effects of mould," said Dr. Sessa.

To help identify mould in buildings, the researchers developed a new tool called the Mouldy Ghost Detector, which uses sensors to detect VOCs in the air. The device can be attached to any surface and will alert users when it detects high levels of VOCs, which could indicate that mould is present.

"This tool could help people identify mould in their homes and workplaces, allowing them to take steps to reduce exposure and improve their health," said Dr. Sessa. "It's important to remember that mould can be dangerous, but it's also treatable if you catch it early."
