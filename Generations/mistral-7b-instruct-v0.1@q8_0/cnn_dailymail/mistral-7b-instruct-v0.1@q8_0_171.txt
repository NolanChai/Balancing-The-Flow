lette Hayes, 24, from Chesterfield, Derbyshire, spoke out after hearing how her boyfriend Richard, 23, had boarded the doomed flight at Bristol Airport in England.

Paulette said she was devastated by his death but understood why he would want to make the switch. “I don’t blame the co-pilot for what happened,” she added. “It must have been such a difficult decision for him.” Richard, an engineering student at the University of Exeter, had initially planned to fly from Gatwick Airport to Turin. But he changed his flight after hearing about delays and decided to leave from Bristol instead.

“He told me he’d switched flights because it was quicker and cheaper,” Paulette said. “I know he didn’t have much money left and we were struggling to pay for everything at the moment. Richard always put others before himself.”

Paulette, who had been with Richard for three years, arrived in Turin last night to identify his body and pay tribute to him. She was too distraught to speak to the press, but posted a tribute on Facebook.

“I am absolutely devastated,” she wrote. “Richard was my best friend, soulmate, everything I’ve ever had and loved in life. He was the best person anyone could have asked for.” She added: “He would not want me to be sad or alone. So I will keep his memory alive and cherish all the amazing moments we shared. Rest in peace darling Richard.”

Richard’s parents, Jane and David Hayes, are also staying in Turin, where they met Paulette for the first time. They said their son loved flying but had been struggling financially after his university course ended. They were due to fly back to England today with Richard’s body.

The co-pilot of the doomed plane, 47-year-old Andreas Lubitz, shot himself in the head and crashed the Germanwings flight into the Alps in a tragic suicide.
