altreatment in the past for allowing their children to roam around unsupervised, but they believe their style of parenting is best for the kids.

"We want to teach them how to be responsible human beings," Danielle Meitiv said. "They'll never learn if we always bail them out."

The couple has been criticized for leaving their children ages 7 and 9 alone in a park at night, but they say their kids know how to fend for themselves.

On Sunday, the children were playing with a group of friends when police officers arrived and ordered them to come home. The officers also confiscated bikes they had borrowed from friends, saying it was against their parents' permission.

The Meitivs are now planning on suing Montgomery County Police Department for maltreatment and wrongful detention of their children. They believe the officers are harassing them and targeting them because of their unconventional parenting style.

"We didn't do anything wrong," Danielle Meitiv said. "The only thing we did wrong is to trust our kids."
