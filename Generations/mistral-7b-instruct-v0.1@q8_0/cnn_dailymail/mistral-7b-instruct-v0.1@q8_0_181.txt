will fill the void. They still haven’t lost a trophy under Diego Simeone, who has been instrumental in building this team into one of Europe’s strongest sides. And yet, there is something different about them.

They are not afraid to spend money. It was a bold move when they bought Antoine Griezmann for €80m but it paid off. The Frenchman was key in their UCL run in 2016 and has continued to be an important player for the club since then. Atletico’s front office have proven they are willing to spend what is necessary to improve the team, as seen with the signings of Diego Costa and Thomas Partey. They may not have as much money as their big-spending neighbours Real Madrid and Barcelona but they know how to use it effectively.

They still haven’t won a major trophy in four years and the pressure to do so is only growing. Simeone has always been very clear that winning trophies is what he wants for this team and he is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve that goal. The addition of Vitolo will give them another attacking option, with Diego Costa still a work in progress after his return from injury. Fans are excited about the new signing as they believe he will bring energy and pace to their attacks, something they have lacked at times in recent seasons.

The defence has always been Atletico’s strong suit and it remains so. They have one of the best defensive records in Europe and they know how to shut teams down. Griezmann played a huge role in that last season, scoring crucial goals in big moments such as the 93rd-minute equaliser against England in the World Cup. They will need to rely on him again this season, along with the likes of Koke and Filipe Luis, who have been at the club for many years.

There is a lot of talk about Atletico’s transfer policy and how it compares to other top clubs in Europe. They may not be able to compete financially with their big-spending neighbours but they know how to build a strong team without breaking the bank. The addition of Vitolo shows that they are willing to spend what is necessary to improve the team, while also being smart with their transfer business. They have proven time and time again that they can compete at the highest level and win trophies, regardless of their financial situation.

Atletico Madrid supporters are excited about this season because they know their team has what it takes to win trophies. The addition of Vitolo will give them another attacking option and help them take on any opposition that comes their way. With Griezmann, Diego Costa, and Thomas Partey leading the charge, there is no reason why they can’t challenge for major silverware once again.
