...r,' says Clare.

"It's been an incredible journey for us. It's not something you ever want to go through. But we've got through it together, and the fact that our family has grown stronger is a testament to everything we've been through. We're so grateful for all the love and support from our friends and community."

Clare had breast cancer surgery in 2017 when she was almost 34 weeks pregnant with her fifth child, Elijah. After the surgery, she gave birth to a healthy baby boy two weeks later. She then went through chemotherapy while nursing her newborn son. 'It was quite a challenging time,' she admits. 'But it's something that you learn how to cope with and manage when you have children. I think the key is having a support system and being kind to yourself.'

"I just wanted to be there for my kids and make sure they were okay. And even though we had some tough days, we always managed to make it through. We had a lot of faith in ourselves and our doctors, and we knew that we could do this together."

Clare's husband, Matt, was also a huge support during her journey. 'Matt has been amazing throughout this whole thing," says Clare. "He's always been my rock, and he's always been there to pick me up when I've felt down. He's been an absolute champion and inspiration for all of us."

Today, Clare is feeling better than ever. She has finished chemotherapy and is back to doing what she loves â€“ spending time with her family and running her business. 'We feel so lucky to be where we are today," says Clare. "I think it's important for women to know that they can get through anything, no matter how difficult it may seem. And the fact that there is now more support available to women going through breast cancer means that more and more people will be able to overcome this disease."
