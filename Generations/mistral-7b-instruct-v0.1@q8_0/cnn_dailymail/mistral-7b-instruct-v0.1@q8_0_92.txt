yard by their owners when the thief, dressed all in black, snatched them up and dashed away.

The incident occurred on Monday morning, April 29th, on Waverly Avenue in West London. The distraught owners were left with nothing but tears and regret after the theft, which has sparked a warning from police to keep an eye out for suspicious individuals in the area.

Owner Sarah said: “I just went out to feed them and when I came back they were gone. I couldn’t believe it. They are both my babies and have been with me since they were little.”

The pets, who are valued at around £700, were last seen in the company of a man wearing all black clothing and carrying a backpack. The thief had managed to evade capture despite police being alerted and patrolling the area.

As the search for Marley and Mitzy continues, Sarah has pleaded with members of the public to keep an eye out for any suspicious activity in the area. She said: “Please be careful and keep your pets close by. I can’t bear the thought of losing them again.”
