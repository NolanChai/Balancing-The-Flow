Online travel agencies Expedia and TripAdvisor have teamed up to launch an augmented reality (AR) app that lets you take virtual tours of top tourist destinations around the world. 

Dubbed "Expedia AR Tour," the app uses your phone or tablet's camera to superimpose interactive 3D models, videos and images onto real-world surroundings. Users can move around the virtual environment, zoom in and out, and even interact with certain elements. 

The app currently features 12 destinations, including Paris, Barcelona, Tokyo, London, and Sydney. Each location offers multiple experiences, from visiting famous landmarks to exploring local markets, trying traditional foods or simply taking in stunning views. 

"Expedia AR Tour is an exciting way for travelers to experience destinations before they book their trips," said Dustin Hansen, senior vice president of Expedia's Brand Marketing Group. "By providing a virtual tour, we hope to inspire and educate travelers about what each destination has to offer."

"We're thrilled to be partnering with Expedia on this innovative project," said Steve Kaufer, founder and CEO of TripAdvisor. "Our combined expertise in AR and travel content makes for a truly immersive and engaging experience for users."
