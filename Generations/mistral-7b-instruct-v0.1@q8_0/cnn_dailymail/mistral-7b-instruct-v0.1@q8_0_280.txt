The stripper school operated out of a mansion owned by one of its instructors, who was described as a ‘sexy’ Egyptian woman. It cost students $95 a day for classes taught by a variety of strippers from around the country, some of whom were just starting their careers and others had been working in the industry for years.

The school offered everything from beginner pole dancing to advanced lap dancing, and also provided courses on how to become a stripper’s personal assistant or bartender at one of the many strip clubs in the area.

But the school was operating undercover, with only a few students aware that they were attending classes inside a mansion belonging to one of their instructors.

It wasn’t until last night that the secret was exposed when police raided the mansion and arrested several people involved in the operation, including the Egyptian woman who owned the mansion and the strippers who taught there.

The raids were sparked by a tip-off from one of the neighbors, who had heard loud music coming from the mansion at all hours of the night, as well as shouting and laughter.

Police found several people in the mansion, including the Egyptian woman and several of her students, all of whom were arrested on charges of operating a stripper school without a license.

The Egyptian woman is believed to be in her mid-30s and has been operating the stripper school for several years. She is also said to own a number of other businesses in the area, including several strip clubs.

It is not yet clear how long the stripper school had been operating from inside the mansion, or how many students attended classes there.
