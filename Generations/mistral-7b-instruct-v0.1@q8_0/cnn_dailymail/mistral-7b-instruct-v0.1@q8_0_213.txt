Junction State Correctional Facility in Walpole, Massachusetts, last week, after he was found not guilty of first-degree murder but convicted on five other counts related to Odin Lloyd's death.

Hernandez, 27, had been wearing his No 81 Patriots jersey when he committed the murder two years ago. He then shot himself in the head while in jail awaiting trial. His conviction for the second-degree murders of two men in Boston, Massachusetts, in 2013 is still being appealed.

The number was given to Hernandez by the prison authorities, who are responsible for assigning prisoners a unique number based on their inmate status and medical needs. The number includes the prisoner's name, his date of birth and other identifying information.
