10-page lawsuit against his former fiancé alleging he is entitled to the fertilized eggs as he had agreed to be a co-parent in their future children.

Vergara and Loeb began dating in 2014, with Loeb proposing to her just a year later. The couple were both excited about starting a family together and decided to freeze Vergara’s eggs in preparation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment.

However, their relationship broke down in late 2018, and they called off their engagement. Loeb claims that during their marriage, Vergara had agreed to allow him access to the fertilized eggs in case something happened to her.

In his lawsuit, Loeb says: “Vergara had previously agreed that any children resulting from IVF treatment using her frozen eggs would be jointly owned by both parties.”

But Vergara is adamant she has no obligation to give Loeb access to the eggs. She claims that they were only intended for her use and that she never signed a legal agreement giving him permission to access them.

The lawsuit is expected to drag on for months, with both parties fighting over ownership of the frozen eggs, as well as any future income generated from their sale or use.
