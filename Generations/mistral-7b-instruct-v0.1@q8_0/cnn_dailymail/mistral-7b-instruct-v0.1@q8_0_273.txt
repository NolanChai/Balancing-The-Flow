her for parking in what she believes is a designated handicapped space, the woman says she's been following all the rules.

"I have a prosthetic leg, and I need the space," said Christine Boudreau, who has been parking in the designated spot for more than 15 years. "It's not a choice, it's a necessity."

Boudreau has received numerous notes, some of which are so angry that she has stopped reading them. "I don't know what their problem is," she said. "If they have an issue with me parking in this spot, I ask them to speak to me directly. It's not fair."

The woman says she has been trying to find a parking space closer to her home for years but hasn't had any luck. "I don't want to be seen as taking advantage of the situation," she said. "But I need that spot to get in and out of my car safely. It's not easy."

The notes left on Boudreau's windshield are unsigned and often use derogatory language, making her feel uncomfortable and frustrated. "It's hurtful," she said. "I don't need that kind of negativity in my life."

Boudreau has tried to speak with the person who is leaving the notes but hasn't been able to catch them. She hopes that the situation will be resolved soon and that the person will understand her situation. In the meantime, she will continue parking in the designated handicapped space, knowing that she is doing what's right for her and others like her.
