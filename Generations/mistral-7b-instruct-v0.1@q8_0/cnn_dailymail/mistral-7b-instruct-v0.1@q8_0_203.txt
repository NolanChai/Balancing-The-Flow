360-degree views of Earth using a high-definition camera mounted to a helmet. The video is so clear that it looks like you're really there - and you can explore every inch of the ISS like never before.

The footage offers a unique perspective on the Earth below, showing how tiny our planet looks from 250 miles up. You can see the swirling clouds of Hurricane Matthew, the vast expanse of the Sahara desert, and even the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. The video is also a fascinating look at what life is like in space - the astronauts seem to effortlessly float around the ISS, moving from one module to another with no obstacles or gravity to slow them down.

If you want to feel like an astronaut yourself, just put on your VR headset and immerse yourself in this incredible 360-degree video experience. It's like nothing you've ever seen before - and a reminder of how small we really are.
