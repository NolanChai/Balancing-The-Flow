romatosis type 1 (NF1), and has spent most of his life feeling self-conscious about his appearance. But now, he's become an advocate for the disease and is helping others who suffer from it to feel less alone.

Heslip has undergone multiple surgeries over the years to remove tumors, but they always come back. He now wears a mask to cover up some of his facial tumors, which have been described as looking like pebbles. Despite his physical appearance, Heslip is an outgoing and friendly person, and he said he has never had any trouble making friends.

However, he has struggled with feelings of isolation and loneliness due to his condition. He felt like no one could understand what it was like to live with such a rare disease. That all changed when he started attending support groups for NF1 patients.

"I realized that I wasn't alone," Heslip said. "There were people who understood what it was like to have this condition and feel the way I do."

Heslip now volunteers at these support groups and helps others navigate their own journey with NF1. He has also become an advocate for the disease, speaking out about the need for more research and awareness.

"I want people to know that there are people like me out there who are living with this condition," Heslip said. "We may look different, but we're just as capable and worthy of love and acceptance as anyone else."
