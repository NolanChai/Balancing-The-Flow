zed for his surgery, Malakai can only open his eyes briefly before falling back asleep, unable to focus on anything in the room except for a white light that shines above his bed. But even when he is awake and alert, the brightness of the hospital lights overwhelms him, causing him discomfort, anxiety and pain.

Malakai's parents, Jonathan and Kelsey, are exhausted but determined to make their son as comfortable as possible. They have spent countless hours researching ways to dim the lights in his room to create a calmer and more peaceful atmosphere for him. The hospital staff, however, has refused to accommodate them, citing safety concerns and the need to keep a constant watch on patients.

The situation has become so dire that Jonathan and Kelsey have turned to social media and crowdfunding platforms in an attempt to raise awareness about their plight. They hope that by sharing Malakai's story and reaching out to those who may be able to help, they can one day bring a little bit of light into their son's life.

"It's like being in the dark all the time," Jonathan said. "We just want him to be comfortable and relaxed so he can focus on getting better."

Kelsey added: "We know that it may not be possible for him to see or hear, but at least we can try to make his surroundings as peaceful as possible for him."
