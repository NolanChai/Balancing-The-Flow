feeling down after losing out to Saracens at Twickenham last weekend, but the prop is determined that the setback will only spur them on towards a top four finish.

"It was tough to take," he said. "We put so much effort into it and to come up short in such a big game, especially after we had got ourselves back into it, was hard to swallow. But I think it can be a driving force for us. We're all really disappointed with how things went, but we have to use that as motivation to push on this season."

With Bath currently eighth in the table, they will need to finish no worse than fourth if they are to qualify for the play-offs. With two games in hand over fifth-placed Worcester and three over sixth-placed Harlequins, they have a chance to move up the ladder. Watson is optimistic that with their talent and hard work, Bath can still achieve their goal.

"We've got some really good players here, and I think we can do it," he said. "We just need to keep working on our game and improve in certain areas. We know where we need to get better, so it's up to us to put the work in and make sure that happens."

Bath will have a chance to bounce back when they host Newcastle Falcons at The Rec next Saturday (March 10). Watson is looking forward to getting back out there and playing his part. "I love playing at home, so it'll be great to get back in front of our fans," he said. "We just need to make sure that we put on a good show and get the win."
