In a video titled “How I Got Kylie Jenner Lips,” Benjamin Hirsch uses a lip suction cup along with an array of lip balms and glosses to give his lips a larger, more plump appearance. And while the results are not exactly as dramatic as those seen in some of the horrifying before-and-after photos circulating around social media, Hirsch’s transformation is certainly noticeable.

Hirsch starts off the video by applying lip balm to his lips, and then uses a suction cup to pull them upwards and create a vacuum that causes the lips to puff up. Next, he applies a thick layer of gloss over his lips, which helps to give them a fuller appearance as well.

After applying a few additional layers of lip balm and gloss, Hirsch finishes off by running a finger across his lips to create a natural-looking crease. The result is a noticeable increase in lip size, although it’s not quite as dramatic as the effects seen in some of the more extreme cases of suction cup use.

While Hirsch’s tutorial may provide some tips for those looking to get a larger, plumper pout, it’s important to note that using a suction cup or any other extreme beauty method can have serious side effects on your lips and overall health. If you’re looking to boost your lip size, it’s always best to stick with more natural methods like using a hydrating lip balm or gentle exfoliation.
