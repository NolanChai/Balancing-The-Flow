in nine months, having been axed from the England squad last January following a fallout with the team management that led to him being sent home from Australia during the Ashes.

"It was great to get back out there," he told Sky Sports News. "I'm feeling really good and I'm really looking forward to playing for Surrey this season."

Surrey, of course, is where Pietersen made his name as a young player and where, having been brought out of retirement by the county last year, he played in some Twenty20 Blast matches. But he has not appeared for them since May, following his estrangement from the England team.

"There have been a few people who have tried to contact me and see if I was interested," he added, "and I've just felt like it's right time for me to come back."

It remains to be seen whether England will ever select him again â€“ at least in the Test team. But Pietersen has not ruled out a return to international cricket altogether, insisting that he still harbours ambitions of playing for England again in some capacity.

"I don't think you can ever say never," he said. "I think anything is possible when it comes to my career."
