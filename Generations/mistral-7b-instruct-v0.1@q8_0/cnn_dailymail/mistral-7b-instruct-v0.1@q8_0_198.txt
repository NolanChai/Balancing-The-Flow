The intelligence agency issued a joint statement with police, MI6 and the GCHQ surveillance agency warning that terrorist groups may seek to use disillusioned or vulnerable workers as suicide bombers in Britain, according to The Telegraph.

MI5 has increased security measures at nuclear power stations and other high-security sites following the attack, which killed 150 people and left a further 290 injured when Lubitz hijacked the Germanwings flight from Barcelona to Munich on Tuesday.

The agency issued its warning after analysing intelligence gathered from across Europe, where the threat of terrorist attacks by disillusioned young men has risen in recent years.

The statement, entitled “Security Threat Assessment: Suicide Attacks in the UK”, said: “There is a risk that terrorists may seek to use suicide bombers who are disillusioned with life or have been radicalised online. This could include individuals from the public and private sectors.”

It added: “Motivations for such attacks could include revenge, religious extremism and ideological views. We are taking all necessary steps to protect the public against this threat.”

The alert follows a wave of terror attacks in Europe by young men who have been inspired by ISIS, including the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris in January.

Lubitz, 27, killed himself after locking out the co-pilot of Germanwings flight 9561 and taking control of the plane. The attack was a rare case of a commercial airline being hijacked for terrorist purposes.

The attack sparked widespread outrage and disbelief around the world, with many people questioning how such an attack could have occurred in Europe, which is considered a safe haven from terrorism.
