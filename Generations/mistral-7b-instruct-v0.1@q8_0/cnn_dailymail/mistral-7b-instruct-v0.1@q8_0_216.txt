"A Midsummer Night's Dream." "Romeo and Juliet." "Hamlet." For centuries, these plays and three dozen more by William Shakespeare have formed history's most heralded literary canon. But now they face new challenges as a global study group of theater professionals, teachers and academics seeks to re-imagine the Bard's works for contemporary audiences.

The initiative is part of the Globe Theatre Trust, a London-based nonprofit dedicated to preserving the original Globe Theatre in England where many of Shakespeare's plays were first performed. But the trust also seeks to keep his legacy alive in other ways.

One way is through its annual international conference, which brings together experts from around the world for workshops, discussions and performances of reinterpreted Shakespeare. Last year's conference focused on "Shakespeare and Migration," and featured a diverse slate of performances that included an adaptation of "Hamlet" set in modern-day Japan and a rendition of "Othello" performed in Urdu.

The idea behind these reinterpretations is to make Shakespeare's work relevant for contemporary audiences by placing it in new contexts and exploring different interpretations of his characters and themes. The conference also offers a platform for emerging theater artists and students to showcase their own adaptations and contributions to the global Shakespeare legacy.

But the trust's efforts go beyond the conference. It also supports local theater groups in countries such as Argentina, China and Brazil in creating their own Shakespearean productions and providing training for local actors and directors.

For example, in Argentina, the group Teatro del Barrio has adapted "Macbeth" into a street performance that incorporates modern-day politics and social issues, while in China, the Shanghai Theatre Academy has produced an adaptation of "The Tempest" set in a Chinese courtyard.

In Brazil, the company Cia das Artes has created a performance of "Henry V" that draws on Brazilian history and culture, and the group Teatro da Coruja in Chile has adapted "Twelfth Night" into a contemporary ballet.

These reinterpretations reflect the global impact of Shakespeare's work and its ability to inspire creativity and imagination across cultures and generations. And they underscore the importance of keeping his legacy alive for future generations of theater artists, educators and audiences.
