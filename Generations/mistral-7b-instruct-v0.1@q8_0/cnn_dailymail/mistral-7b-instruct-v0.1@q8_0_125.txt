47-foot boat tender, after spending several hours in life jackets in the water.

The crew had been sailing out of Penobscot Bay when the ship lost power and began to sink around midnight Thursday. One of the crew members managed to send a distress signal using a flare gun before abandoning ship. The Coast Guard was alerted and responded quickly, sending two boats to the scene.

"The crew did a fantastic job of trying to save the boat," said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Brandon Webb. "They were in the water for an extended period of time and they were very fortunate that we were able to get there in a timely manner."

All nine members of the Liana's Ransom are safe and being transported to Portsmouth, New Hampshire. The Coast Guard is investigating the cause of the power failure.
