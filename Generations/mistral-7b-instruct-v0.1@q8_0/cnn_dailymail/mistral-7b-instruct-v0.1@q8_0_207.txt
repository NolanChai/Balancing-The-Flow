was back in 2008 when he made headlines, not for his royal duties but for a rather peculiar personal affair.

It all began when the king, whose real name is Goodwill Zwelithini kaZulu, announced on national television that he was divorcing his first wife of more than 40 years. The announcement came as a shock to many South Africans, given that the couple had four children together and had always been seen as the epitome of a happy family.

The king cited "incompatibility" as the reason for the divorce, but it soon became clear that there was more to the story than met the eye. Within days of the announcement, rumours began circulating about an affair with a much younger woman - a member of one of his royal rivals' families no less.

The scandal quickly escalated, with many South Africans questioning the king's judgement and character. Some even went so far as to call for his removal from the throne, given his seemingly erratic behaviour and questionable personal life.

Despite the backlash, however, the king refused to comment on the rumours or speculate about his private life. Instead, he continued with his royal duties, attending various ceremonies and events as he has done for decades.

In the years that followed, the king's personal life became the subject of even more scandal and speculation. He was accused of multiple affairs and even of fathering a child out of wedlock, although he never confirmed or denied any of these rumours.

It is perhaps this history of scandal and controversy that has led some to question the king's judgement and leadership abilities - particularly in light of the recent violence against foreigners which has erupted on South Africa's streets.

Whether or not the king played a direct role in sparking the violence remains unclear, but it is clear that his personal life and behaviour have left many South Africans questioning his leadership abilities and his place in the country's history.
