vine, California women, who both work at Google, have known each other for almost five years — and say their friendship was strengthened by the discovery.

"It's crazy to think about how many people we could have met in that time and not realized how much we had in common," Branigan told People magazine. "But I think our friendship has always been based on more than just physical similarities. We both share the same values and sense of humor, and we’ve been through so much together."

The two women first met at a work event in 2016, where they bonded over their love for reality TV shows like The Bachelor and Survivor. They quickly became inseparable, spending most of their free time together. It wasn't until earlier this week that they discovered their striking resemblance — which they say has only made their friendship stronger.

"It’s been an interesting journey, and I think it’s brought us even closer," Geaney said. "We can now appreciate the unique bond that we share, knowing that there’s no one else in the world quite like us."
