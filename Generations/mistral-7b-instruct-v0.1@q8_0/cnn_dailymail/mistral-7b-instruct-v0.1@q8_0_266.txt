uck in their side, and the duo could be the answer to their prayers.

City were thrashed 5-0 by Liverpool in last season’s Champions League quarterfinals, with Henderson in particular playing a pivotal role. The Reds midfielder has been in excellent form for England and Liverpool this campaign, but there are rumours that he could be tempted by a move to the Etihad Stadium, where he would be reunited with former teammate Raheem Sterling.

As for Wilshere, he was once considered one of the brightest prospects in English football. However, injuries and inconsistent form have blighted his career in recent years. Nevertheless, City are willing to take a risk on the talented midfielder, who has shown glimpses of his former self this season for Arsenal.

While these signings may not be the splashy additions that some City fans were hoping for, they could provide much-needed stability and leadership in the engine room. With Vincent Kompany likely to retire at the end of the season and Fabian Delph yet to fully recover from injury, the team needs more quality and experience in midfield.

Of course, these signings are purely speculative at this stage, but they do provide an interesting insight into City’s thinking. Pep Guardiola has shown a preference for players who can play in multiple positions, so it could be that Henderson and Wilshere are viewed as versatile options who can fill in wherever needed.

Either way, it seems that the champions are set to prioritise English talent in their recruitment this summer. With the Premier League title now out of reach, they will need to focus on rebuilding and reinventing themselves for next season.
