However, if consumed in excess, they could lead to allergies or weight gain. The best way to eat peanuts is raw, as boiling or frying them can destroy their health benefits, said Dr. Yoshihisa Yamamoto of Kyushu University School of Medicine.

“Consuming peanuts without the skins and raw is the best way to get the maximum benefit,” he added. “This is because the skins of peanuts contain an enzyme called aflatoxin, which has been linked to several types of cancer.”

Aflatoxins are toxic substances that can be produced by fungi that infect peanut plants. They have been shown to cause liver damage, lung cancer and other health problems, and the World Health Organization recommends that people limit their consumption of aflatoxin-containing foods.

“However, not all peanuts are contaminated with aflatoxins,” Dr. Yamamoto said. “In Japan, the government has set strict standards for aflatoxin levels in peanuts, and most commercial products meet these requirements.”

Peanuts are also a good source of protein, fiber and heart-healthy fats, making them an important part of a healthy diet. But people who are allergic to peanuts should avoid them altogether, as even small amounts can cause severe reactions in some individuals.
