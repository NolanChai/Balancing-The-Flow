to compete in the pageant, which will take place over four days in the capital city Astana in early November.

The contestants will undergo a series of tests including physical fitness, military discipline and teamwork exercises. The winner will receive a cash prize and a promotion. The Miss Army competition is part of a wider attempt by the Ministry of Defence to boost recruitment levels in the armed forces, which currently stand at around 250,000 soldiers.

However, critics have accused the military of using sexualised images in an attempt to attract more recruits. "This is not about promoting women's rights, it's about promoting a sex object," said human rights activist Marina Tsvetkova. "It is a vulgar and immoral way to promote the army."

Despite concerns, the Kazakhstani government has defended the competition as a means of raising awareness about the contributions women make to the military. "The Miss Army pageant is an opportunity to showcase the talents and abilities of our female soldiers," said Defence Minister Nurzhan Zhambekov. "We are proud to have such capable and professional women serving in our armed forces."

However, some soldiers have expressed their disapproval of the competition, fearing it could undermine morale and discipline in the armed forces. One soldier, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "This is not what we joined the army for. We should be focused on our duties, not on trying to win a beauty pageant."
