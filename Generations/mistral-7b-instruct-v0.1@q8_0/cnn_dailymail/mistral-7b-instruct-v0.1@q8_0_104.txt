al is struggling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

Campbell recalls the day in 2004 when she was deployed to Iraq. She had just turned 19 when her Humvee hit an improvised explosive device. She remembers seeing bodies fly through the air, and feeling herself thrown from the vehicle. She woke up in a hospital with a gash across her stomach, which had been caused by shrapnel from the blast.

Her injuries were so severe that doctors told her she would never be able to have children. But Campbell refused to accept their prognosis, and underwent multiple surgeries to repair her damaged organs. She even moved across the country to seek out a specialist who could help her conceive.

And then, after years of trying, Campbell became pregnant. Her daughter Lexi-River was born in 2018, and Campbell felt an overwhelming sense of joy and relief wash over her. But as she and her husband, Michael, celebrated their daughter’s first birthday, Campbell knew that things were far from easy.

“I have PTSD,” she said. “And sometimes it feels like I’m just hanging on by a thread.”

Campbell struggles with nightmares, anxiety, and depression, and often finds herself triggered by loud noises or sudden movements. She also experiences flashbacks of the explosion that killed her friends and left her injured.

“It’s hard to explain to someone who has never been through it,” she said. “But sometimes I feel like I’m back in Iraq, and there’s nothing I can do to get away from it.”

Campbell knows that she needs help to manage her symptoms, but she also fears the stigma associated with PTSD. She worries that others will judge her or think she’s weak for seeking treatment. But she also knows that she can’t keep living like this.

“I don’t want my daughter to grow up thinking that it’s okay to be scared or sad all the time,” she said. “I want her to know that there’s hope, and that with the right support, we can overcome anything.”
