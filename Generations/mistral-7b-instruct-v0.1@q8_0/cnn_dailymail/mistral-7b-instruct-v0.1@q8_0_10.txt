ents, blankets and first aid kits towards those caught in the crush were published today by the Hillsborough Family Support Group. The group are asking people with memories of that day to come forward and share their experiences.

“We know that there were so many brave individuals who risked their own safety to help others,” said Margaret Aspinall, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group. “These images have been shared with us by a family member but we would love for anyone who remembers or has photos of people helping in the aftermath to come forward. We want them to be recognised and thanked.”

The disaster killed 96 Liverpool fans and injured hundreds more as they tried to escape through the turnstiles at Sheffield Wednesday’s stadium. The families of the victims have been campaigning for justice ever since.

“We want people to know that we still remember and that their bravery will never be forgotten,” said Margaret Aspinall. “We also hope that by sharing these images, it will help us identify those who were there and who can help us rebuild the picture of what happened.”
