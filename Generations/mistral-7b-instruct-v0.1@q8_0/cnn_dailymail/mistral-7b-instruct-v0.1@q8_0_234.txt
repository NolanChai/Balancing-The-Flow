redged.

The pool, which sits just off the rocky platform at Bondi Beach, was closed for its annual maintenance routine and is expected to re-open next month.

The dredging process involves a machine that sucks up sediment from the bottom of the pool and deposits it onto the shore.

While the pool is closed, visitors can still use the outdoor showers and toilets which remain open.

The Icebergs Club was founded in 1928 by former Australian water polo captain Dick Cavill and has since become an institution on Bondi Beach.

It's worth noting that dredging is not a new phenomenon at Bondi - the pool was first built in 1927, and since then it has been regularly maintained through dredging.
