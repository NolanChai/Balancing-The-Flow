queals of delight from children were heard as they took part in the annual event held at the Fairview United Methodist Church in Waterloo, where participants would don masks and wade into a mud pit with pigs for fun.

But the event has been under scrutiny in recent years after animal welfare groups stepped up their campaign against it. According to the Daily Mail, people who took part in the wrestling matches were sometimes seen punching and kicking the animals in order to win. Some participants even used sticks and ropes to tie down the pigs before they started fighting. 

One witness described the event as 'really violent' and said that some of the pigs looked 'terrified'. Another participant admitted that he had taken part in the event, but that he only did it to win the bets placed on who would win. 

The church has now issued a statement saying that the event 'no longer aligns with our values and beliefs' after receiving numerous complaints about animal welfare. The decision was made by church leaders after a thorough investigation into the event. 

"We deeply regret any harm that may have been caused to these animals during our pig wrestling fundraiser," the statement reads. "It is never our intention to cause pain or suffering to any creature."
