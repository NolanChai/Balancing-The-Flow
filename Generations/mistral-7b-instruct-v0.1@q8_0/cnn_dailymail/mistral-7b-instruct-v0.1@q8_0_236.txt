FC Copenhagen last weekend, which ended in a 2-2 draw.

Agger's ban will be served in the next two Danish Superliga matches, against AC Horsens on May 9th and Randers FC on May 16th. The decision was made by the league's disciplinary committee after reviewing footage from the game.

Agger has had a tumultuous season so far, with numerous injuries keeping him out of action for much of it. However, he has been in good form in recent weeks and played 90 minutes in both of Brondby's last two games.
