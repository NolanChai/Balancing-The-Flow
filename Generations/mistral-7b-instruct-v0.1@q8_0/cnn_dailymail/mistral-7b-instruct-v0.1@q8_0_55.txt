seen on October 24, 1998 and her body has never been found.

The search for Ms Steel’s remains began again earlier this year after new evidence came to light which suggested she may have been murdered by a jealous lover, Stuart McPherson. McPherson, who was also a landlord, is believed to have had an affair with the victim before killing her and burying her in his back garden.

But after two weeks of digging up the garden at McPherson’s home in Hilton, near Ely, there was no sign of Ms Steel’s body. Detective Inspector Andy Rollinson said they would not give up on finding Ms Steel’s body and that he had a “high level of confidence that we will find something.”

McPherson is still being held in custody on suspicion of murder but has not yet been charged.
