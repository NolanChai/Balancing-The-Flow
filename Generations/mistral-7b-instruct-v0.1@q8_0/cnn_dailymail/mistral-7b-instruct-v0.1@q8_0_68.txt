zone. Here’s what I think will happen:

- Everton and West Ham have been in good form of late but I feel they’ll struggle to hold onto their current positions, especially with some tough fixtures ahead.
- Crystal Palace are struggling to find their rhythm, they’ve had some good moments but not enough consistency, and their next few games (vs Watford, Liverpool, Man City, Chelsea) will be telling.
- Hull City and Bournemouth have had decent seasons so far but I think they’ll struggle in the coming weeks, especially if they can’t get past Newcastle, Stoke, and West Brom respectively.
- Leicester are a bit of an unknown quantity for me, they’ve had a great run of form but they’re still not out of danger yet, especially with some tough games against Man City, Arsenal, and Chelsea coming up.
- Sunderland have been in the bottom 3 all season and I think they’ll stay there despite beating Middlesbrough last weekend, they have a tough run of fixtures (vs Manchester United, Tottenham, Chelsea, Liverpool) to finish off their season.
- West Brom are hanging on by a thread and their next few games (vs Crystal Palace, Arsenal, Man City) will be crucial for them to stay up.

The relegation battle is wide open but I think it’ll be between Hull City, Bournemouth, Leicester, Sunderland, and West Brom. The bottom 3 will most likely be decided by goal difference at this point.
