their enclosure and are already starting to develop distinct personalities.

According to a zoo spokesperson, the baby gorillas have been doing really well since their arrival. "They’re both strong and healthy," said the spokesperson, "And they’ve started to show off their unique personalities already." One of the babies has been nicknamed 'Charlie' while the other is known as 'Luna'.

Their mother, Mira, gave birth to Charlie on January 26th and Luna followed just two days later. Both babies weighed in at around five pounds. Mira is an experienced mom and has been taking care of her newborns with the help of the zoo’s staff. The baby gorillas will continue to be closely monitored by the zoo's veterinary team as they grow and develop.
