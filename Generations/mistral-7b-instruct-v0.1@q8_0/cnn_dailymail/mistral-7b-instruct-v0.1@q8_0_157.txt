ields too much power in Westminster and threatened to leave the EU if Scots vote No. He also accused Labour of failing to protect the country from terrorism.

David Cameron has been campaigning for a No vote in the Scottish independence referendum, which will be held on September 18. The Prime Minister argued that a No vote is 'in the best interests of Britain' and warned that Scots have just 11 days left to make their decision. He also claimed that SNP leader Alex Salmond and his nationalist party do not want Scotland to succeed as an independent nation, but rather seek to undermine Britain.

Cameron said: "The SNP want a No vote so they can carry on using their power in Westminster to hold down the rest of the UK. They don't want Scotland to succeed as an independent nation. The choice is yours - do you want Scotland to be stronger by staying with the UK, or weaker by being part of it?"

The Prime Minister also criticized Labour for failing to protect the country from terrorism and said that the SNP would not allow this to happen if Scotland gains independence. He claimed: "We have a responsibility to keep our country safe. We must be able to stand up and say: 'If you want to attack us, we will fight back.'"

Cameron's comments come as polls show that the Yes campaign for Scottish independence is gaining momentum. A recent YouGov survey showed that the gap between the No and Yes vote has narrowed to just six per cent, with 42 per cent saying they would vote No compared to 36 per cent who said they would vote Yes.
