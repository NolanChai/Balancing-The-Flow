irfield in the England and Wales Cricket Board’s (ECB) preliminary squad match against West Indies A at the University of Sussex earlier this week.

The 32-year-old was scheduled to have scans on Thursday, but he has since tweaked his hamstring again while bowling in a net session and is now set to miss Friday’s second practice game between England A and West Indies A at the County Ground, Hants.

Finch signed for Yorkshire last summer and played eight matches for the club, including the Royal London Cup final, which the team won in August. He scored 209 runs across his eight games, with a top score of 87 not out against Kent.

Finch said: “I’m really disappointed to have had to withdraw from the squad so soon. I was feeling great and looking forward to getting involved in the first team this summer.

“It’s frustrating but hopefully it won’t take too long to get back to full fitness. Yorkshire are a fantastic club with some very talented players, and I can’t wait to be part of that when I’m fit again.”

Finch is currently the vice-captain of Australia, having played 74 Tests and 91 ODIs for the national side. He missed the 2015 World Cup due to injury but returned in 2018 to help lead Australia to victory.
