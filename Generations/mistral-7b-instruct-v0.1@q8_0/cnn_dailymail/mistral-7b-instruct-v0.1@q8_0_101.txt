The letter, written by Tim O'Brien, is published in The Age today and implores the President to spare the men's lives, saying that their deaths would be a "tragic waste" of potential.

In his letter, Mr O'Brien writes:

"I am deeply moved by your decision to grant clemency to the 72 Indonesian prisoners who have been on death row for more than 10 years. The lives of these men will now be spared and they will be reunited with their families. They are not the same as Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, but this is a positive step forward."

"It saddens me that you have not yet granted clemency to Andrew and Myuran. I ask you to reconsider your position. These men are not the monsters they were once portrayed to be. They are good men who have been punished unjustly for a crime they did not commit."

"The death penalty is a cruel and inhumane punishment, and its application is often based on flawed evidence and biased justice systems. The death penalty is a tragic waste of potential. It deprives the world of artists, writers, musicians, scientists, poets and other creative thinkers."

"Andrew and Myuran are such talented men. They have enriched our lives through their art and literature. Their deaths will be felt deeply throughout Australia and around the world."

"Please show mercy to Andrew and Myuran. Show that Indonesia is a compassionate and progressive nation, not one that clings to outdated and barbaric practices."

The letter concludes with an impassioned plea for the President to reconsider his decision:

"Please, Joko Widodo, show us all that you are a leader who values humanity and compassion above all else. Please, grant Andrew and Myuran clemency before it is too late."

In a separate message, former Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has also called on Mr Widodo to spare the men's lives.

"I urge President Joko Widodo to reconsider his decision to execute Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran," Mr Rudd said in a statement yesterday.

"Andrew and Myuran have served more than 10 years in prison for a crime they did not commit. They are good men who have been punished unjustly."

"The death penalty is a cruel and inhumane punishment, and its application is often based on flawed evidence and biased justice systems. It deprives the world of talented individuals and their contributions to society."

"I urge the President to show mercy to Andrew and Myuran, and grant them clemency before it is too late."
