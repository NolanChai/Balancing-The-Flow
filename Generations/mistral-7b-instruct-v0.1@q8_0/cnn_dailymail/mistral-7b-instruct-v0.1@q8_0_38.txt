­Glasgow’s Royal Concert Hall to appeal for support from voters north and south. But Mr Miliband faced ridicule from nationalists after he said his party had never been pro-independence. 

The poll by YouGov for the Sunday Times showed the SNP has a six-point lead over Labour in Scotland, with just 34 per cent of voters saying they would back the Reds if an election were held tomorrow. Mr Miliband’s bid for support from Scots comes as the Conservatives have also pledged to boost funding for Scottish schools and hospitals. The Tories have promised an extra £1 billion over the next five years for health and education in Scotland, which is more than the SNP has said it will spend over the same period.

Mr Miliband’s speech was seen as a desperate bid to win back support from voters after Labour suffered dismal losses in the local elections. The YouGov poll found that 51 per cent of Scots would vote SNP, with just 34 per cent backing Labour and 17 per cent supporting the Conservatives. Mr Miliband’s attempt to woo Scottish voters was met with scepticism by nationalists after he said Labour had always been pro-union. 

SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said: ‘Labour has been consistently anti-Scottish and anti-independent throughout its history. So it’s rather rich of Mr Miliband to claim that Labour supports Scotland.’ The SNP won 30 out of 39 Scottish seats at the last general election, while Labour finished in third place behind the Tories and Lib Dems.
