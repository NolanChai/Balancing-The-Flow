facing off for the WBC World Heavyweight Championship in what will undoubtedly be one of the biggest fights in boxing history, but their success has not come at the hands of just their own skills and determination. Both fighters have had the unwavering support and dedication of their family and loved ones to help them reach the pinnacle of their respective sports.

For Mayweather, that support comes from his mother, father, and sister. His mother, Deborah, has been by her son’s side throughout his entire career, serving as both his manager and advisor. Floyd credits much of his success to his mother’s guidance, telling ESPN.com that “She always knew what to do and when to do it.” His father, Roger, was a former professional boxer who taught Floyd the fundamentals of the sport. And his sister, Rosalind, has been his closest confidant and emotional support throughout his life.

Pacquiao’s family, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated. He comes from a large, extended family in the Philippines, with many siblings, cousins, and aunts and uncles all living together in the same household. His mother, Dionisia, has been a constant presence in his life, both as a homemaker and as a fierce advocate for her son’s career. Pacquiao has credited much of his success to his mother’s love and support, telling ESPN.com that “She is the best mom in the world.” Pacquiao’s father, Ricardo, was also involved in boxing, albeit as a trainer rather than a fighter. He is known for his strict training methods and has been a major influence on his son’s career.

Both fighters have had their fair share of ups and downs throughout their careers, but they have always managed to rise above the challenges and continue to excel in their sport. And while their individual skills and abilities are what have brought them to this point, it is their families who have been the driving force behind their success.
