The union representing staff at Windsor Castle has announced plans for industrial action following a pay dispute with the Queen’s officials. The union claims that the ‘ridiculously low’ wages of its members are not enough to cover their living costs. It said that wardens, who include footmen, ushers and yeoman warders, have not had a pay rise in two years and have suffered cuts to their allowances and pensions.

The union has called for a one-day strike on March 23rd, with staff refusing to carry out duties such as giants’ shoulder poles and banners at royal ceremonies and events. It said that the Queen’s officials have refused to negotiate over pay and allowances, despite the union presenting evidence of rising living costs and wage freezes for other staff in the public sector.

The union has also accused the Queen’s officials of failing to provide adequate support and resources for staff during the coronavirus pandemic. It claimed that many staff were left without personal protective equipment (PPE) or access to testing and have had to take unpaid sick leave.

The Queen’s officials have denied any wrongdoing and said that they are committed to paying their staff a fair wage. They added that any industrial action would be deeply disappointing and could undermine the Queen’s reputation and the importance of Windsor Castle as a national symbol.

It is not clear how many staff will take part in the strike or what impact it will have on royal ceremonies and events.
