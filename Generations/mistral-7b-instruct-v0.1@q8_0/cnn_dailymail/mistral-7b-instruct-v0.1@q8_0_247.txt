y walk 200 metres to be allowed to park at Waverley station was caught out by CCTV cameras. Gregory, a former Royal Engineer, pleaded guilty to fraudulently using an Accessible Car Parking Permit in order to park his BMW 518i in the designated bay at the railway station on November 7 last year.

In a statement the court heard how the prosecution had seen Gregory’s car parked on three occasions when he was not disabled and able to walk much further.

The prosecution also presented evidence that Gregory had taken part in several marathons and cross country events, and regularly walked over five miles at a time.

At his sentencing hearing, Gregory admitted he knew the badge would allow him to park in designated areas but he did not want to pay for parking at Waverley station and would have parked elsewhere if he had not had the badge. He was fined £795 and ordered to pay costs of £168.
