he asked Siri several questions about gay people, including "What do you think of gays?" and "Do you support homosexuality?" Each time, the virtual assistant responded with what sounded like Russian for "I don't support that".

Apple has since apologised to anyone who was offended by the responses and said Siri would be updated to give a more appropriate reply. The company said in a statement:

"We deeply regret any offense this may have caused. We take our responsibility to our users seriously and weâ€™re constantly working to improve our services. Siri is designed to provide accurate information, but it doesn't always know the right answer to every question. Our team of experts work on Siri daily to make it better. As part of that effort, we recently discovered an issue with some responses regarding sensitive topics such as sexual orientation. We apologise for this and want to assure our users that we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind."

The incident has been widely condemned by LGBT rights groups around the world, who have called on Apple to be more vigilant in monitoring its virtual assistant's responses.
