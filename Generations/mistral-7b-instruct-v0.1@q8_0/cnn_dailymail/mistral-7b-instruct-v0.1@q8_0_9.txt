The girl, whose identity has been kept secret to protect her, wrote a heartfelt message in English that she hopes will reach her teacher, who she believes is her only hope of escaping the forced union.

"Please help me," the letter reads. "I don't want to marry this man. He is much older than me and he has no respect for me. I am not happy with this arrangement."

The girl's family, who live in a remote village in India, have promised her hand in marriage to a wealthy businessman who is 20 years her senior.

But the young girl is determined to fight back against what she sees as an unfair and unjust tradition. She has been studying hard in school in the hope of one day securing a better future for herself.

"I want to become a doctor," the letter continues. "I have worked very hard to achieve my goals, but my family does not understand this."

The girl's teacher, who she refers to as "auntie," has been her biggest supporter throughout her young life. She hopes that her teacher will be able to help her in her time of need.

"Auntie," the letter concludes. "Please help me. I don't want to marry this man. He doesn't love me and he doesn't respect me. Please help me find a way out of this."

The girl's plight has touched the hearts of many in India, who have been quick to offer their support and encouragement. Some have even offered to pay for her education so that she can achieve her dream of becoming a doctor.
