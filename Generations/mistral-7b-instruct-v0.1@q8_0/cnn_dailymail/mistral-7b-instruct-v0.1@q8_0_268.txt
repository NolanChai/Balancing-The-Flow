ar Pradesh, has been growing her hair for 21 years, and it now measures an incredible 8 feet 6 inches (264 cm) long.

Smita’s hair growth journey began when she was just 10 years old, after her mother cut off all of her hair to donate to a temple. However, this act left Smita devastated and determined never to cut her hair again. Over the next decade, her hair grew at an astonishing rate, thanks in part to her careful routine of washing and conditioning it every day.

In 2018, Smita was awarded India’s longest hair by the Limca Book of Records, a local version of the Guinness World Records. She is also a recipient of several other awards for her hair, including one from the Allahabad Hair Club and another from the Uttar Pradesh Hair Styling Federation.

However, Smita’s ultimate goal is to become an official Guinness World Record holder. To achieve this, she must first surpass the current record holder, who measures 8 feet 4.5 inches (256 cm) long. Smita is confident that with continued care and dedication, she will be able to achieve this feat and cement her place in history as the longest-haired woman in the world.
