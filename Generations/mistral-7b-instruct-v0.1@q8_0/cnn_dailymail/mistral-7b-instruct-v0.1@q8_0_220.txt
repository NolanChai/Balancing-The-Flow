fisherman Ahmed Bin Lamin is seen at the mercy of French authorities after his vessel was intercepted off the coast of Sardinia on Saturday. He was charged with manslaughter following the gruesome discovery that 170 people had perished in the cramped ship, which was packed far beyond its capacity and had run out of fuel and water days before. It is believed the true number of victims could be much higher than those confirmed so far due to the difficulty of accurately counting bodies in such a large group. Lamin is currently being held in a detention centre in Toulouse, France. He faces trial next month and could potentially receive life imprisonment if convicted.
