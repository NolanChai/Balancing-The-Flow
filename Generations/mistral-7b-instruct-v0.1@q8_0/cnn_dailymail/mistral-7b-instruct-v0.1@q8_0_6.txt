underland’s visit to the Emirates Stadium on Saturday and has been keeping a close eye on his progress. Wenger said: “Walcott is still feeling a little bit down and frustrated because he didn’t play for England. Of course he was disappointed that he wasn’t selected, but I don’t think it will have any impact on him.” He added: “I am worried a little about his confidence, but we are working hard to get it back. Theo has had a great season so far and it would be wrong for us as a team to give up on him at this stage of the season.”

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned about the mental health of winger Theo Walcott after the player was overlooked for England’s World Cup squad. Walcott was left out of Roy Hodgson’s 23-man squad, which sparked anger and disappointment from fans and pundits alike.

Wenger believes that Walcott’s confidence has taken a hit as a result of the snub and he plans to have a chat with the player before Arsenal’s next game against Sunderland on Saturday. The Gunners boss said: “I am concerned about Theo’s confidence, but I don’t think it will have any impact on him. He has had a great season so far and we are working hard to get his confidence back.”

Wenger added that he is impressed by Walcott’s performances this season and believes he has been one of Arsenal’s standout players. However, the manager also acknowledged that there is still room for improvement in the player’s game. He said: “Theo needs to work on his decision-making and finishing. He has scored some great goals this season, but he has also missed some chances that could have made a big difference. We are working with him on those areas, but I am happy with what he is doing so far.”
