10-point gap over the second-place hosts - but Ramsey insists the outcome of the match is far greater for his team and their survival bid.

He said: "We need three points more than Chelsea and I think it's a massive game for us to get them. If we win, we take a huge step towards staying in this division. It's not just about beating Chelsea or stopping them winning the league - it's about what this means for our club."

Chelsea will have one eye on Manchester City's match with Sunderland later today, knowing that they need to win their game to ensure they maintain a 10-point gap over City. Ramsey admits the Blues are a good team but believes his side can pull off an upset.

He said: "They are one of the best teams in the country and they've got some fantastic players - but we believe we can beat them. We have our own strengths and we have to use them."
