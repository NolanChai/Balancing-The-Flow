ountain in Princes Street Gardens with a whisky and soda, while her grandfather played darts with his pals at the nearby Royal Scots Club.

The retired teacher’s love of life has seen her travel around the world, trying new experiences, from bungee jumping off a bridge in New Zealand to taking a dip in the Dead Sea in Jordan.

She also loves to entertain guests, whether it be hosting a karaoke party or a wine tasting event. However, Pat’s passion for socialising can sometimes see her wake up at 1am and collapse on the sofa – although she insists she doesn’t regret a moment of it.

Her love life has also seen her have three husbands over the years – all from different countries – but she admits there was only one who really captured her heart.

She said: “My first husband was from Spain, he was a fantastic dancer and we had a whirlwind romance in Barcelona, but it didn’t last long. My second was from Australia and we had a son together, but things just didn’t work out.

“But my third husband – he was Scottish and I met him while I was travelling. We started to date, had a few holidays together and eventually got married. He was the love of my life.”

Pat is now single again but she refuses to dwell on it, saying: “I’m very happy living my life alone. I enjoy my freedom and have no regrets about what’s happened in the past.”

And while she may not be as traditional as her grandparents were, Pat knows they would still approve of her lifestyle.

She said: “Granny and Grandad would probably think it was all a bit bonkers at times, but they would also say I’m living life to the full.”
