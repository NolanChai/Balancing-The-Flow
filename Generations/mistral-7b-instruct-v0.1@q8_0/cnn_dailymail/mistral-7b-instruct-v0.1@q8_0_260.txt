d Simon, 24, who is thought to have inherited his father's wealth, was arrested on suspicion of abduction after police raided his father's home in London. The waitress, who has not been named, is said to have disappeared from the VIP room of a London nightclub, where Simon was reportedly a regular visitor.

A friend of Simon's, who asked not to be named, said: "We are all really worried about him. He has never been in any kind of trouble before and we can't believe he would do anything like this." The friend added: "He is very quiet and reserved but he does enjoy going out to clubs and socialising with friends."

Simon's father, who is thought to be worth around Â£50 million, has not commented on the matter. He made his fortune in property development and has a reputation as one of London's most successful entrepreneurs.

The waitress, who had been working at the club for only a few weeks, went missing after finishing her shift just before 2am on Saturday morning. It is believed she was last seen leaving the VIP room, where Simon was said to have been with several other guests.

Police are searching for the woman and appealed for anyone with information to come forward. They also confirmed that Simon had been arrested in connection with the disappearance.
