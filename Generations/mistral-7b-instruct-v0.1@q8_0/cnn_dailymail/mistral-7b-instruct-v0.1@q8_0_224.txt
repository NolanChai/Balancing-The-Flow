ou spend time with him you can’t help but feel your spirits lighten. Lauda has raced cars like a madman, he has been brutally honest about his past battles and he has made an art of living life in the fast lane.

But today there are no races to be run, no lap times to be shaved off, no championships to be won. Just Niki Lauda, at peace, in his own world. His home is a modest, whitewashed farmhouse in the hills above Rust, in southwestern Germany, not far from where he grew up. It has an entrance flanked by two stone cherubs and a wooden gate that creaks open to reveal a neatly tended garden. Inside, the house is filled with treasures of all shapes and sizes.

When you enter Lauda’s living room you are greeted by a stunning view of the Swiss Alps, a huge painting of a red Ferrari F2001 racing through a tunnel and a wall adorned with framed photographs of his famous battles with Ayrton Senna in 1989 and 1991. There is also a collection of motorbikes, cars, watches and trophies that would make any petrolhead swoon.

Lauda’s home is a testament to his life’s work and his love for the sport that has given him so much. He spent many years racing Ferraris in Formula One, but it was his time with McLaren, where he won two world championships, that stands out most vividly.

“McLaren is special,” says Lauda. “It is like a family, and the team is very close. I had a great time there and we did some amazing things together.”

But it was not all fun and games. In 1976, during the Monaco Grand Prix, Lauda suffered horrific burns to his face after a fiery crash on lap two. He spent weeks in a coma and had to undergo numerous surgeries before making a full recovery. The accident left him with a permanent scar and a newfound respect for life.

Lauda’s story is one of survival, courage and perseverance. And it is a reminder that even in the face of adversity there is always hope.

“I never thought I would be able to race again after my accident,” says Lauda. “But I worked hard and slowly regained my strength, both physically and mentally. It was not easy, but I proved everyone wrong.”

And he proved them wrong on the track, too. After returning to racing in 1978, Lauda won another world championship in 1979 with Ligier, before joining McLaren again in 1982 and winning his second title in 1984. In 1985 he returned to Ferrari and finished third in the championship behind Senna and Alain Prost. But their epic duel in the Italian Grand Prix is one of the most memorable moments in Formula One history, with Senna pushing Lauda to the limit in a race that was as close as it was brutal.

“I remember every moment of that race,” says Lauda. “It was so intense and so difficult, but it was also an amazing experience. I knew Senna was a great driver, but we never really got on. We were both very competitive, but in the end we had respect for each other.”

Senna won the championship that year, but Lauda’s performance was enough to earn him the title of Formula One driver of the year. It was a fitting tribute to a career that had been filled with triumphs and setbacks, heartbreak and joy. And it was a reminder that even in the face of fierce competition and adversity, there is always room for respect and camaraderie.

Lauda retired from racing in 1987 and has since become a respected commentator, businessman and philanthropist. He has also become an inspiration to many, with his story serving as a testament to the indomitable human spirit and its ability to overcome even the most insurmountable odds.

“I feel very lucky to have been able to do what I loved for so long,” says Lauda. “But I also know that there are millions of people out there who can achieve great things if they only believe in themselves and work hard enough.”

Lauda’s life is a shining example of what it means to be a true champion, both on and off the track. His spirit, his courage and his love for life make him one of the most beloved and respected figures in Formula One history. And as he sits in his garden, surrounded by the beauty of the Swiss Alps and the memories of his incredible career, you cannot help but feel a sense of wonder at the life that has been led, and the legacy that will endure long after the final chequered flag has fallen.
