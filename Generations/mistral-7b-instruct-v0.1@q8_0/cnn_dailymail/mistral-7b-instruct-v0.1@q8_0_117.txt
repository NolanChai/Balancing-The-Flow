earing up the note - which was sent to journalists and MPs before the 2015 general election - was an 'honest mistake', but his opponents branded his behaviour as 'irresponsible'.

"It is deeply concerning that Ed Balls has dismissed the impact of Labour's economic mismanagement as a joke," said Tory MP Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson. "This is a clear demonstration of his contempt for the public who suffered as a result of Labour's policies."

Mr Balls had earlier defended tearing up the note, saying he had not intended to keep it and did not have any intention of referring back to it during the general election campaign. He has since apologised for any 'distraction' caused by his actions.
