our finish while also locked in a battle for the League Cup – this is undoubtedly one of the biggest games of the season so far.

The question, therefore, is not whether or not fans will be able to get tickets for Sunday's match – with United and City both selling their allocation at face value, that was never really an issue. No, the real test will come when it comes to getting into Old Trafford itself. As one of the world's biggest stadiums, United have struggled in recent years to accommodate all those who want to see their home games, with several fans being turned away from recent matches due to overcrowding.

Given this problem, United have made some changes for Sunday's derby. Firstly, they are offering a free shuttle bus service from Manchester Piccadilly station to Old Trafford – which should help reduce the number of cars on the road and ease congestion around the stadium. Secondly, they have set up additional entry points at the South Stand and the Stretford End – which will hopefully allow more fans into the ground without causing too much overcrowding.

Of course, none of this will be much use if there are still not enough tickets to go around. United have sold out their entire allocation for Sunday's match, with City also selling out their allocation at the same time. This means that – unlike in previous seasons – there will be no 'away fans' in attendance at Old Trafford on Sunday. Instead, both sets of supporters will be united in their passion for their respective clubs – and in their desire to see Manchester United emerge victorious.

So, with the gates wide open and an electric atmosphere expected inside the ground, what can we expect from Sunday's Manchester derby? Both sides have been in excellent form so far this season, with United currently sitting fourth in the Premier League table while City are just a point behind in fifth place. However, City have been particularly impressive in recent weeks, winning seven of their last nine games in all competitions to climb back into the hunt for a top-four finish.

United, on the other hand, have struggled somewhat in recent months – with no wins in their last three Premier League matches and a draw in the FA Cup replay against West Ham United. However, they did put in an excellent performance in their 2-1 win over Chelsea last weekend, with Paul Pogba and Romelu Lukaku both playing key roles in the victory.

Given this form – and the fact that both sides are so evenly matched – it is difficult to predict the outcome of Sunday's derby. However, one thing is clear: no matter who wins, there will be plenty of drama to unfold at Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. Whether it's a thrilling 2-2 draw or a nail-biting 1-0 victory for either side, the Manchester derby promises to be an unforgettable day out for all those who are lucky enough to be there in person. So, if you're one of the thousands of fans who will be making their way to Old Trafford on Sunday, get ready for an afternoon that you'll never forget!
