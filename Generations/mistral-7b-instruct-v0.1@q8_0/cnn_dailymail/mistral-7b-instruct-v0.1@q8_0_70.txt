, which marks another milestone in his life sentence of life imprisonment with no parole.

On this day, we stand in solidarity with Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan as they continue to be held in aÂ Bali jail, serving out their sentences for drug smuggling. The Bali Nine were caught attempting to smuggle heroin into Australia from Indonesia in 2005.

The pair have been in and out of prison over the years, but since 2010 they have been held together in a special section of Bali's Kerobokan Prison. They have not seen each other for almost 8 months due to restrictions put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has made it difficult for them to communicate with their lawyers and families.

Their sentences were handed down on April 27, 2006, after they were found guilty of trafficking nearly 3 kilograms of heroin into Australia. They were sentenced to life imprisonment with no parole, a punishment that sparked controversy and outcry around the world.

As Sukumaran marks his birthday in prison, many are calling for him and Chan to be granted clemency or released on compassionate grounds due to the pandemic. However, the Indonesian government has maintained that they will not be released anytime soon.

Despite their situation, Myuran and Andrew continue to maintain their innocence and have never wavered in their belief that they are innocent of the charges against them. They have also remained steadfast in their fight for justice, using their time behind bars to advocate for drug reform and human rights.

As we celebrate Myuran's birthday today, let us also take a moment to reflect on his struggles and the many others who are incarcerated due to drug-related offenses. We must continue to work towards a world where drugs are treated as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice problem, and where those who are struggling with addiction can receive the support they need to lead healthy and fulfilling lives.
