, where resources are scarce and opportunities few, a trip to an amusement park might be nothing more than a dream.

That was until the arrival of DreamWorld, Pakistan's first-ever theme park, which opened its doors on June 17th, 2016 in the city of Islamabad. DreamWorld is the result of a partnership between local and international investors, with a mission to provide children living in the country's slums with a chance to experience the magic and wonder of an amusement park.

"Pakistan has a young population, with around 65 percent of the country's population under the age of 25," says Asad Mahfuz, CEO of DreamWorld. "Unfortunately, many children in our slums have never even been to a cinema or a shopping mall, let alone an amusement park. We wanted to change that."

DreamWorld covers more than 80,000 square feet and features a variety of rides and attractions, including roller coasters, water rides, and interactive play areas. The park is divided into several themed zones, each with its own unique atmosphere and experiences. For example, the "Fantasy Land" zone features rides inspired by classic fairy tales, while "Adventure Land" offers thrilling experiences for more adventurous types.

In addition to the rides and attractions, DreamWorld also offers a variety of food and retail options, as well as educational workshops and shows designed to teach children about science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).

"We want to create a space where children can learn, have fun, and be inspired," says Mahfuz. "We believe that every child has the potential to achieve great things, and by providing them with access to quality education and entertainment, we can help them on their journey."

While DreamWorld is still in its early stages, it's already making a big impact on the lives of children living in Pakistan's slums. For many, a visit to the park is more than just a fun day out - it's a chance to escape the harsh realities of their daily lives and experience something new and exciting.

"For these children, DreamWorld is more than just an amusement park," says Mahfuz. "It's a symbol of hope, a reminder that anything is possible if you work hard and believe in yourself."
