For years now, environmentalists have accused agricultural operations in the delta of pumping so much groundwater that they’re depleting underground reserves at an alarming rate. But many farmers here say that’s not true — they’re simply trying to survive in the face of a historic drought and rising water bills.

The conflict has been fueled by fears about the delta’s future, as well as by distrust between rural and urban communities. Some environmentalists worry that if the region doesn’t receive enough water, it could collapse into a giant saltwater marsh, while others worry that without agriculture, the region won’t be able to generate enough money to pay for essential services like schools and hospitals.

As tensions rise, some people are calling for tougher water restrictions on farmers, while others say that would only harm local economies. The battle lines are clearly drawn, and it’s not clear who will win.
