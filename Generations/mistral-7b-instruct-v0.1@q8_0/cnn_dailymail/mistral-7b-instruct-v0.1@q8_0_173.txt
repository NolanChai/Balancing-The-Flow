errily swimming in the same direction, avoiding predators as they travel together. It's been proved that the group behavior can increase their survival rate and give them a better chance of evading attacks from hungry sharks.

The images were captured by marine biologist James Pritchard off the coast of Australia. He said, "I was fortunate enough to witness this beautiful and intriguing school of fish as they swam together in harmony, seemingly unaffected by their predators." The group behavior of these fish is known as 'flocking'. They work together to keep watch out for predators, communicate with each other and share food.

Flocking behavior has been observed in many animals including birds, insects, and even whales. Scientists believe that this strategy helps them to survive in dangerous environments where the odds of survival are slim.
