iley-Serres’ mother, Lisa Serres, broke down in tears as she described how the death of her 14-year-old daughter had left her feeling ‘shattered’.

Lisa said she suffered from ‘PTSD’, nightmares and flashbacks following the incident on September 29 last year. She said: ‘I can’t even look at the spot where my daughter was killed without thinking about it. I can’t even go to school with her friends because it brings everything back up again.’

The court also heard how Lisa had been struggling financially and emotionally since the death of Liberty, who died when she was hit by a car driven by drug-driver Christopher Ashcroft in Pembroke, Dorset. Liberty’s father, David Serres, had not been present in the courtroom.

Lisa said: ‘I don’t know how we are going to keep going. We were just an ordinary family and now this has happened. It’s like we have been ripped apart.’ Ashcroft, 32, was jailed for 13 years and four months after being found guilty of death by dangerous driving while under the influence of drugs.

Judge Timothy Rose told the court: ‘The impact of Liberty’s death on her family will be felt for years to come. The mother, Lisa Serres, has had a very difficult time dealing with this tragedy, and she has suffered greatly. She has also had dark thoughts about ending her own life at the spot where Liberty was killed.’
