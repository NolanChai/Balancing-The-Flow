icetag on the French goalkeeper.

Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has identified Lloris as his top target for the summer transfer window. He wants to replace David de Gea, who is being courted by Real Madrid, and sees the Tottenham stopper as the ideal replacement.

But Levy, Spurs’ chairman and chief executive, has already indicated that he will not sell Lloris on the cheap. And reports suggest he plans to price United out of a move for the 32-year-old.

According to The Athletic , Tottenham have set their sights on £100million for De Gea if Madrid do come with an offer. They want to recoup as much money as possible and are not prepared to let Lloris go for less than £35million.

United already face stiff competition from Arsenal for De Gea and the possibility of losing him for nothing in a year’s time has only added to their desperation to sign a new goalkeeper.

And they fear Levy will try to use United’s need as leverage to drive up the price of Lloris, who is under contract until 2024 and earns £150,000-a-week at Spurs.
