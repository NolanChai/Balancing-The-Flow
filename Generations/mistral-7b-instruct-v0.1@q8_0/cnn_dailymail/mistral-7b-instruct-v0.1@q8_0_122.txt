Niall Horan, a member of the boy band One Direction, has joined Rory McIlroy on Wednesday as his caddie during the Masters Par-3 Contest at Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia. This is not the first time that Horan has served as a caddy for McIlroy; he previously did so at the 2014 British Open, where they finished third.
