San Francisco police have arrested three suspects in connection with the death of an elderly woman who was found dead inside her home in the Inner Sunset neighborhood. The suspects, two men and a woman, were allegedly involved in the theft of jewelry and other valuable items from the victim’s home before fleeing the scene.

The victim, identified as 72-year-old Alice Johnson, was found dead inside her home on Monday morning by a neighbor who had called police to report a suspicious activity. Investigators believe that the suspects broke into the home through a window and stole jewelry, electronics, and other valuable items worth tens of thousands of dollars before fleeing the scene.

The three suspects were arrested later that day near the crime scene. Two of them are being held on charges of grand theft, burglary, and possession of stolen property, while the third is being held for conspiracy to commit a crime. It’s not clear at this time what led them to break into Johnson’s home or why they chose to target her specifically.

The police department said that they are still investigating the case and are working to determine the motive behind the burglary. They also thanked the public for their assistance in identifying the suspects and helping to apprehend them quickly.
