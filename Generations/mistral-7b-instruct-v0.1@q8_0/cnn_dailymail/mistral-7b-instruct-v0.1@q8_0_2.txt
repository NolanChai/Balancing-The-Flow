ion is calling for his resignation.

The union says Christie's actions were "disrespectful" to teachers and students across New Jersey.

The governor has been at odds with teachers unions since taking office in 2009. He's implemented reforms that have reduced teacher's benefits, tenure protections and salary caps, among other things. And he's cut funding for public schools by more than $1 billion over the past five years.

But Christie's confrontation with Mrs. Kennedy-Zimerman took things to a new level. The governor accused her of lying about her salary - she said she makes $70,000 a year, but records show she gets paid $97,000. He also questioned her job performance, saying he didn't think she was doing a good enough job teaching her students.

"It's disrespectful to the entire profession of education in this state," said Mary Beth Whitehead, the president of the New Jersey Education Association. "The governor has always been hostile towards teachers, but tonight he crossed a line."

Whitehead says she's never seen anything like it in her 30 years working as an educator.

"I think that if he had any decency at all, he would resign," she said.

Christie's office didn't respond to requests for comment.
