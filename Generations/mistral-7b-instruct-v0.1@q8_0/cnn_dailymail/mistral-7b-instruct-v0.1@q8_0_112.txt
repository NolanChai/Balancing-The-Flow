Chelsea were made to work hard for their three points against Stoke at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but Eden Hazard starred for Jose Mourinho's team.

He slotted Chelsea ahead in typically composed fashion to send the home fans wild and set the tone for a thrilling 3-2 victory that keeps Chelsea's top-four hopes alive.

Hazard has been in fine form all season and was once again the standout player for Chelsea, with his goal taking him to the top of the Premier League scorers list on seven goals.

"Eden is one of our best players," Mourinho said after the match. "He's been playing really well since the beginning of the season. He's got a great talent and he's working hard to be at his best."

Stoke, despite being held to three points, will feel they should have come away with more as Chelsea struggled to keep them at bay for much of the game. However, Hazard's goal was a crucial moment in the match that gave Chelsea the edge they needed to secure their victory.
