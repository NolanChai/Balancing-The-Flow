igrini’s future at the club has been called into question. But Pearce, who was part of the management team that led City to their first Premier League title in 2012, believes it would be a mistake to sack the Chilean manager. “Manuel is a good manager and he should be given the time to turn things around,” said Pearce. “It’s not just about winning games, but also about keeping players motivated and focused. If you keep changing managers, you never give players the chance to settle down and perform at their best.”
