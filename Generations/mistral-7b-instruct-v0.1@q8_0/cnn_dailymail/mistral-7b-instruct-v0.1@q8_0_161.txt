17 months old when their father gave one of his livers to their sickly older brother. The organ was too small for Phuoc, leaving Binh with nothing left but a failing kidney, which eventually failed completely last week.

She was rushed to University Health Network in Toronto where she received a new kidney and liver. Her father, Quoc Nguyen, told reporters he is overjoyed that his daughter has been saved and hopes that one day they can be reunited with their brother, who is now living in America. The transplants took place last week at University Health Network.

The familyâ€™s tragic story began three years ago when Binh, Phuoc, and their 5-year-old brother Quang were all suffering from the same genetic condition called Hemizygous Deletion of 17p13. The condition left them with severe kidney damage and caused liver failure in their brother.

Their father, a hardworking construction worker, donated his liver to his son after he turned 6 years old. The liver was too small for Phuoc, but it gave Quang the chance to receive a new liver and save his life.

Phuoc received a kidney transplant from her father two years later, but the damage to her organs was so severe that she still needed dialysis. Binh, who was always smaller than her twin sister, did not need a liver transplant, but her failing kidney eventually failed completely.

The family had hoped to be reunited in Canada, where they lived for a time before moving to the United States with their brother, who is now living in California. However, the pandemic made it impossible for them to return home, and they were forced to stay in America.
