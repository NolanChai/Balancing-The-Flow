Barcelona won 2-0, with Lionel Messi creating one of the goals with a superb run that saw him weave past five players. But it was the other Brazilian, Neymar, who really caught the eye as he led the line and tormented PSG’s defence.

The crowd went wild whenever he got hold of the ball – and so did the opposition. But PSG failed to keep up and were left struggling to contain the little wizard.

“Neymar is the best footballer in the world,” Messi said after the game. “He has done it for a long time and I am very happy to play with him.

“I am not saying that he is better than me, but he can do things that I cannot.”
