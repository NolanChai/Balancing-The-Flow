They found bodies scattered throughout the auditorium, some still clutching their ticket stubs. The sounds of screams and gunfire echoed through the theater even as they arrived.

One officer testified that he crawled over the bodies of two people, one of whom was holding a gun, as he tried to get a better view of what was happening from his vantage point outside the building.

"It was horrible," said Officer Daniel Ferry, choking back tears. "It was like something out of a nightmare."

Ferry and other officers described how they rushed to secure the area after receiving a call from a concerned theater employee around midnight Friday. They found the front doors unlocked and no one inside to stop them.

"We came in here and started looking for suspects," said Officer Samantha Moser, who was the first on the scene. "We didn't have any idea where he was or anything like that."

Moser said she searched the theater with another officer, but they found no sign of anyone inside. That's when they heard gunshots and screams coming from the auditorium. They rushed in just as the shooting was ending.

"The only thing we could see was a man in a red vest sitting on the floor in the middle of the theater," Moser testified.

Moser, along with Officer Scott Morrison, ran toward him and ordered him to stand up. James Holmes, dressed in red and holding a semi-automatic weapon, complied and began to surrender.

Ferry arrived next and saw Holmes with his hands raised. "He looked scared," Ferry said.

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Holmes, who is accused of killing 12 people and injuring more than 50 others in the attack. Defense attorneys have said their client is mentally ill and not criminally responsible for his actions.

The trial continues Thursday, with testimony from a theater manager who described how Holmes purchased tickets for Friday's screening of "The Dark Knight Rises" in advance.
