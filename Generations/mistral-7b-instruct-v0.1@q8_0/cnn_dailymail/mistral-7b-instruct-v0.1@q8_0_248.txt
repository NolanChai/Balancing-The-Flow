regime - a time when humans lived alongside wolves.

The discovery, made by Spanish archaeologists, challenges long-held beliefs about how early humans coexisted with predators.

"It was believed that early mankind could not have survived if there were big carnivores," said archaeologist Jose Manuel Nogueral. "But this woman's grave shows us that they could and did live alongside these animals."

The woman, who has yet to be given a name, appears to have been a member of a small tribe that roamed the area. She was likely killed by wolves while gathering food in the wilderness.

Her grave is located within a cave system known as La Finca de la Tierra Mora, which contains several other ancient human burial sites dating back to around 20,000 BC.

"The presence of wolf bones in the area and traces of their DNA also supports the idea that wolves and humans lived together," said Nogueral. "We can't imagine how they must have coexisted."
