An Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto was forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland last night after an 87-year-old woman caused a disturbance on board.

The pensioner, who was travelling with her husband, had been drinking heavily during the journey and was behaving in a disruptive manner, according to eye witnesses.

Air Canada said in a statement that the decision to divert the flight was made for the safety of everyone on board. The aircraft landed safely at Shannon Airport just before midnight.

Passengers were informed of the diversion and given the option of continuing their journey on a later Air Canada flight or rebooking with another airline. All passengers were accommodated with meals and hotel vouchers.

The elderly woman was escorted off the plane and taken to a local hospital for treatment, while her husband continued his journey to Toronto without further incident.
