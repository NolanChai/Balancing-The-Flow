... ...but it was impossible to do so when you are this close to one of the most dangerous animals on Earth.

Within seconds, she began charging towards me, snorting and grunting all the way. My only hope was that my ranger, a seasoned professional who had spent his entire life in Africa working with these behemoths, would do something to stop her. He quickly grabbed hold of her horn, trying to pry it free. But the rhino didn’t seem to care that she was attacking me and instead focused her attention on the man trying to take her horn from her.

It was then that I realized what I had to do. Without hesitation, I punched the horn out of the rhino’s face. The sound was deafening and I could hear her grunting in pain as she stumbled backwards, still trying to attack me. But by this time my ranger was on top of her, wrestling the horn away from her mouth and shouting at me to run.

I did what he said, sprinting back towards the Land Rover just as the rhino began charging again. I dove inside the vehicle, slamming the door shut behind me and locking it. My ranger followed suit, slumping into a seat with a heavy sigh of relief. We sat there in silence for what felt like an eternity until we were sure the danger had passed.

It was only then that we looked at each other with a mixture of fear and admiration. We had faced down one of the most dangerous animals in the world together and come out alive thanks to our quick thinking and bravery. For me, it was an experience I would never forget.
