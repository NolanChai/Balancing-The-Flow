42 of the Rossoneri's 61 passes, as the hosts were unable to take advantage of numerous opportunities to claim victory in a tightly contested match.

Sampdoria opened the scoring in the third minute with a stunning volley from Christian Pavón that left Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma rooted to the spot, but a quick response from the home side saw them draw level just two minutes later through a powerful header from Çalhanoğlu. The rest of the first half was dominated by Sampdoria, with Milan yet to attempt a shot on target after 45 minutes.

The second half began in much the same vein, as the visitors continued to dominate possession and create chances, but were unable to break down a resolute Milan defence. A brilliant piece of play from De Jong in the 71st minute saw him intercept a Sampdoria pass and unleash a powerful drive that flew past goalkeeper Emiliano Idiakez, leaving the visitors stunned.

With just six minutes remaining on the clock, Milan had a golden opportunity to claim victory, but Alessandro Gennaro's late equaliser forced the home side to accept a point. Despite their disappointment at not securing all three points, Milan will take great encouragement from their ability to come back from two goals down and salvage a draw in what was a fiercely contested match.
