– with some even exceeding the daily recommended intake of salt.

Research from Action on Salt, an initiative by the UK’s Food and Drink Manufacturers Association, has revealed that many popular lunchtime options are high in salt, saturated fat, sugar and calories. The study found that 79 per cent of pasta salads and 65 per cent of sandwiches surveyed exceeded the maximum recommended intake of salt for an adult’s entire day – which is just one teaspoonful (5 grams).

Some high-street pasta salad options contained enough salt to cover an adult’s recommended daily intake in just one serving. A Tesco Finest Chicken Fajita Salad, for example, contains 3.7 grams of salt – almost double the recommended maximum.

A spokesperson from Action on Salt said: “Many lunchtime options might seem like a healthy choice, but the reality can be very different. We urge people to check the labels and choose lower salt alternatives when buying ready-to-eat meals or salads.”

It’s not just lunchtime options that are high in salt. Many breakfast cereals, processed meats and ready-meal dinners also contain high levels of sodium – meaning it can be difficult to achieve a balanced diet without exceeding the recommended daily intake of salt. The World Health Organisation recommends reducing salt intake by 50 per cent to help prevent high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.
