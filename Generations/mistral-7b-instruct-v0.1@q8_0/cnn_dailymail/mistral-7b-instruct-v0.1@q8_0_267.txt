ng sex has fallen by almost 20 per cent over the last decade, while smartphone ownership has risen dramatically.

Dr Ian Kerner, a relationship psychologist and author of The Sexual Revolution, said technology may be playing a role in the decline in sexual activity. He told The Telegraph: "We have to consider that sex is becoming more and more scarce for many couples today. This could be due to factors like stress, lack of time together or just not feeling up to it.

"However, the rise of smartphone use could also be contributing to this. When we are in the middle of doing something with our partner, such as having sex, we can easily check our phones and get distracted by social media or emails."

The average couple in the UK is now having sex less than twice a week, down from 2.4 times in 2010, according to research by the University of Edinburgh. The study, which involved 500 men and women aged between 18 and 49, found that fewer than one in 10 people were satisfied with their sex lives.

Dr Kerner added: "It is important for couples to make time for sex in their relationship, as it can be a powerful tool for maintaining intimacy and emotional connection. It may also be helpful to put away electronic devices during this time."
