ystanders (NASMB) and the National Action for Police Accountability (NAPA), two grassroots organizations that advocate for an end to police brutality.

The protest began at around 7pm in Times Square, where participants chanted slogans such as "I can't breathe," "No justice, no peace," and "The cops are our enemies." The march then proceeded north along Broadway before turning into the streets of Harlem, where some protesters broke windows and stole merchandise from nearby stores.

Police officers used pepper spray to disperse the crowd, resulting in several injuries among both protesters and officers. At least five people were reportedly hospitalized after being hit by police batons or falling during the melee.

As the night wore on, more arrests were made as police attempted to clear the streets of Harlem. By early Wednesday morning, at least 34 individuals had been arrested for various charges, including burglary, riot, and disorderly conduct.

The protest comes in response to several high-profile cases of police brutality against black Americans in recent months, including George Floyd in Minneapolis, who was killed by police on May 25, and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, who was shot and killed by police in March.

"We are here tonight because we refuse to tolerate another instance of police brutality against a black person," said NASMB spokesperson Angela Rye. "The time has come for us to take action and hold those responsible accountable."
