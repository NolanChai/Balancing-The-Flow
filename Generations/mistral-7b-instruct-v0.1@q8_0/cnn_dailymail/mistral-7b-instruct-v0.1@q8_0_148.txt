Polo Club, based near Windsor, had hoped to sell products featuring the royal coat of arms, but was forced to abandon the project after the Duchess of York threatened legal action against the club on behalf of her husband, former king Andrew.

The duchess owns a rival polo club in Ascot and had accused the Royal County o Polo Club of trademark infringement when it announced plans to launch its own accessories line last year. She argued that the use of the royal coat of arms without permission was likely to cause confusion with her club, which also bears the royal emblem.

The duchess’s legal action prompted the Royal County o Polo Club to abandon its plans and instead opt for a generic design featuring the club’s own crest. However, the club continued to sell accessories with the royal coat of arms embroidered on them, which had been designed before the duchess’s legal threat.

The club had argued that it was entitled to use the royal coat of arms under the principle of “fair use”, which allows limited use of a trademark for purposes such as parody or criticism. However, the court found in favour of the Duchess of York, ruling that the Royal County o Polo Club’s use of the royal emblem was likely to cause confusion and dilution of the Duke’s goodwill associated with the coat of arms.

The club is now considering whether to appeal the ruling, but for now it has been forced to remove all products featuring the royal coat of arms from its website and retail outlets.
