was found floating in the Hunter River on Sunday morning following a massive storm that hit the region overnight.

The community is mourning the loss of Anne and her family is devastated by her death. She was well-known and loved in the area, having lived there for many years with her husband and three children. Her great-grandchildren were visiting from overseas at the time of her death.

Itâ€™s unclear how long Anne had been missing before she was found, but her car is believed to have washed away while crossing a causeway on the river. Police have launched an investigation into the incident, and it is unclear what caused her car to go off the road and into the water.
