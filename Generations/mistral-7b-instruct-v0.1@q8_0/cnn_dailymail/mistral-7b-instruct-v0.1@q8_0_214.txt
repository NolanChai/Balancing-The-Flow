58-year-old from North Carolina who has been skydiving and bungee jumping for decades. But he takes his stunts to new heights by attempting the world record-breaking feat at an air show in Las Vegas on Saturday.

The stunt was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and required Gobitaca to jump from a helicopter that was hovering 30ft above the ground. He then had to clear the car, which was driven by a professional stunt driver, and land safely on a nearby ramp. To complete the feat, he had to jump in mid-air while the car approached him at full speed – all without any protective gear or safety harnesses.

Although Gobitaca landed safely, his stunt sparked outrage from some members of the audience who believed it was too dangerous and disrespectful to the sport of racing. Some even accused him of attempting to steal the limelight from other performers at the show. However, others praised Gobitaca for his bravery and skill, calling him a true daredevil.

Gobitaca’s stunt may have broken several world records, but it also highlighted the dangers of extreme sports and the importance of proper safety protocols. The FAA has since issued a warning to other performers, reminding them to prioritize their safety above all else.
