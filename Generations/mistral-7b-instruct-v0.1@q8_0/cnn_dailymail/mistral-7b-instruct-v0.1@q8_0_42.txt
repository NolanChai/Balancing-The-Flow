, central defender, attacking midfielder and winger to strengthen their squad ahead of next season.

"I would like them to do more business," Henry told Sky Sports News. "They are going into a tough competition next season. If they want to be serious about challenging Manchester City and Chelsea, they need to do something.

"We have been talking for months about buying a goalkeeper and a central defender, but we still haven't signed anyone," he added.

Henry also expressed his disappointment that Arsenal have not yet made any moves in the transfer window, with only Alexandre Lacazette being signed so far.

"Arsenal need to be more active in the market," he said. "They have been waiting too long for players to come on board. They need to sign some good players, especially in the back line."

The former striker also highlighted the importance of signing a top-quality winger to complement Alexis Sanchez and Theo Walcott, who have both shown signs of aging recently.

"They need a new winger as well," Henry said. "Alexis has been with the team for quite some time now, and Theo is not getting any younger either. They need someone fresh to come in and provide competition."

Despite these concerns, Arsenal are expected to continue their pursuit of top-quality players this summer. They have already expressed interest in signing Monaco goalkeeper Alphonse Areola and Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathis, among others.

It remains to be seen whether the club will be able to make enough signings to satisfy Henry's expectations, but one thing is certain - they will need a strong summer if they are to compete for the Premier League title next season.
