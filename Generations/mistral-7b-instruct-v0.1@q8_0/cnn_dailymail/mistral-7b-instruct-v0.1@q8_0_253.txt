out for the two Australian men who were sentenced to death in Indonesia over drug trafficking offenses. 

The pair were found guilty under Indonesia’s harsh drug laws which carry mandatory execution by firing squad for anyone convicted of smuggling more than five grams of heroin or cocaine into the country. Despite protests from their home government and human rights activists around the world, they have been denied clemency.

Chan and Sukumaran were given 14 days to make final preparations before being taken to the execution site in the remote island of Nusa Penida on Tuesday morning. They were handcuffed, blindfolded and taken to a small wooden platform where they were shot at close range by an Indonesian soldier who fired six shots each into their legs, arms, chest and head.

The gruesome images of their executions were broadcast live to millions of viewers across Indonesia, in what was described as a brutal display of the country’s draconian drug laws. The government has defended the execution method, saying it is a humane way to carry out the death penalty. However, critics say that the use of firing squads is more likely to cause pain and suffering than other methods such as hanging or lethal injection.

The executions have sparked widespread outrage, with many people condemning the use of the death penalty as a violation of human rights. Protests were held across Indonesia, calling for an end to capital punishment. The Australian government has also expressed its deep concern over the executions and called on Indonesia to reconsider its approach to drug offenses.

The executions have also raised questions about the effectiveness of drug laws in deterring drug trafficking. Many argue that the death penalty is not an effective deterrent, and that alternative measures such as education and treatment should be used instead.
