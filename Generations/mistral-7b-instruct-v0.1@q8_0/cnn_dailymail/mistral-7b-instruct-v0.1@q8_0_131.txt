In a matter of days, both Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas and Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana found themselves under fire from gay rights advocates and businesses for signing bills that allow businesses to deny services to same-sex couples on religious grounds.

First, Beebe tried to walk back his decision, telling a local radio station he had "misunderstood" the bill's intent when he signed it into law. He said he had thought the law only applied to marriage ceremonies and not other services. But that explanation was quickly refuted by legal experts who pointed out that the bill applies to any service or accommodation, regardless of whether it's related to a wedding.

Beebe then tried a different tack, issuing an executive order that he said would protect gay and lesbian couples from discrimination in state-funded services. But his order was immediately challenged by lawyers for the American Family Association, who argued that it didn't go far enough and would still allow businesses to deny services to gay couples on religious grounds.

Pence, for his part, has been more adamant in defending the law he signed, which is similar to one in Mississippi. He has repeatedly said that the bill protects religious freedom and allows business owners to act according to their beliefs. But critics say that such protections should not come at the expense of civil rights for gay couples.

The furor over these bills comes as the fight for marriage equality continues to spread across the country, with many states passing laws legalizing same-sex marriage in recent years. The backlash against these religious freedom bills suggests that there is a growing divide between those who support such measures and those who see them as an attack on civil rights.

In the end, it remains to be seen how these laws will play out in court. But for now, they have already sparked a heated debate about the balance between religious freedom and civil rights, and raised questions about what it means to be truly inclusive in a society that values diversity and equality.
