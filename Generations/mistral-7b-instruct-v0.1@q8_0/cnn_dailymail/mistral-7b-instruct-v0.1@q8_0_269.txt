on their desktop screens labeled "Press Me". The results so far have shown that most people simply cannot help but press the button even when told not to.

According to an article over at New Scientist, there are good psychological reasons why we can't resist the urge to push buttons, especially when they are clearly labeled as such. The article goes on to explain the concept of "button bias" and how it affects our behavior, stating that our brains have a hard time processing abstract concepts, so when presented with something concrete like a button, we tend to gravitate towards it.

This is all quite interesting stuff and certainly makes you wonder just how much control we really have over our actions at times. What do you think? Could you resist the temptation to press the button if placed in a similar situation? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.
