gies containing illegal drugs. He also shares photos of himself partying with strippers and driving fast cars.

Little is known about the young man - he never posts his name or any identifying information about himself. But the images he shares are graphic and violent. And they are wildly popular among young people who see them as a glamorous portrayal of gang life.

The boy's account, @LilCuzinJimmy, has more than 60,000 followers - many of whom are teenagers themselves. Some of his posts have been liked or retweeted tens of thousands of times. He even has a dedicated fan base who call themselves 'Jimmy Crew'.

But the authorities are taking notice. Last year, the FBI launched an investigation into the boy's activities. They say he is too young to be involved in gang activity and they want to know who is behind his account.

For now, @LilCuzinJimmy remains active on Twitter, posting photos of himself and his friends living what appears to be a dangerous and violent lifestyle. But many worry that these images could inspire others to follow in his footsteps.
