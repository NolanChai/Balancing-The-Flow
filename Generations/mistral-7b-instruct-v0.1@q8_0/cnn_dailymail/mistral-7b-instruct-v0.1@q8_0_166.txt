United have struggled in recent years to adapt to the rigours of the English summer, with players often appearing fatigued at the start of the season as they attempt to shake off the effects of their World Cup and Euro 2016 commitments. However, Van Gaal believes a four-game tour of the United States will provide his squad with the perfect opportunity to acclimatise to the demands of the new season.

The Dutchman explained: "We have decided on a four-game pre-season tour in America, starting in New York and finishing in Los Angeles. This is a short and sharp tournament that will allow us to get used to the time difference, the heat and humidity, and the different surfaces we'll encounter along the way.

"I believe this will give us an excellent chance of hitting the ground running when the season starts, as we won't be affected by any jet lag or fatigue issues that can sometimes occur during longer tours."

United are set to play four friendly matches on American soil, facing MLS sides Chicago Fire, New England Revolution, Philadelphia Union and Seattle Sounders. The tour will begin on July 16th and conclude on August 2nd, with United returning home to face West Ham United in their first competitive fixture of the season on August 7th.
