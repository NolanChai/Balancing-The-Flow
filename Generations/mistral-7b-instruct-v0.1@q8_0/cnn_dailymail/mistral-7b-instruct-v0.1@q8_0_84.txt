Shapiro, known for his legal representation of Michael Jackson and OJ Simpson, among others, recently sent the boxing champion a framed photograph of himself with Pacquiao’s late father, Ben Pacquiao. It is said that the image was signed by Shapiro and inscribed: ‘To Manny, the greatest fighter I have ever seen.’

The gift has touched Pacquiao deeply, who is known to be close to his family despite his success as a professional boxer. “My father always believed in me,” Pacquiao said. “And now that he’s not with us anymore, this gift from Mr Shapiro reminds me how much I owe to him and my mother.”

Pacquiao has already won 57 of his 60 professional bouts and is widely regarded as one of the best boxers in history. Mayweather, who boasts an unblemished record of 48-0, presents Pacquiao with perhaps the biggest challenge of his career.

The two fighters are set to meet in a Las Vegas ring on May 2, and tickets for the event have already sold out. The fight is expected to generate a massive amount of revenue, both from ticket sales and pay-per-view viewership.
