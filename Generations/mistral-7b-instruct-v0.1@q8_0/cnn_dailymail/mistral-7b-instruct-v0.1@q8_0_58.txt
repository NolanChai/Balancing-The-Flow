A seven-year-old British boy has fallen 160ft to his death from a cliff in the Alps after becoming separated from his family on a skiing holiday.
Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left behind his family, who were staying at a hotel near the village of Obergurgl, Austria. They searched for him for hours but were unable to find him until they found his body at the foot of the cliff.

Carwyn's family, from South Wales, had been on the skiing holiday with friends and had been staying in a hotel near the resort for several weeks. According to reports, Carwyn was last seen with two friends near the top of the mountain. He had gone off to retrieve his gloves when he became separated from them and lost his way.

The boy's father, Kevin Scott-Howell, said: "We were devastated when we found out what happened. We can only imagine how scared he must have been."

Carwyn was reportedly due to start school in September. His death has shocked the local community and condolences have been sent from the UK by the Foreign Office. The boy's family is expected to return to Wales tomorrow for his funeral.
