urtle beach on Raffles Hilton is just like looking at a painting by Turner or Monet. It’s impossible not to fall in love with this place.

The Maldives, like every paradise, has its downside. But we only noticed it once, and it wasn’t because of the country itself but because of some careless tourists. They were drunk and rowdy, spoiling the serenity of a peaceful island. We decided not to let them ruin our experience.

We spent most of our days on turtle beach, swimming in the warm Indian Ocean and sunbathing on the soft white sand. At night, we’d walk along the shore, watching bioluminescent plankton lighting up the water like a magical display. The sea was calm and tranquil, unlike the stormy seas back home.

One day, while exploring the nearby islands, we encountered some local fishermen. They were kind enough to invite us on board their boat for a sunset fishing trip. We eagerly accepted their offer and spent an evening casting lines into the clear blue waters, chatting with them about life in the Maldives.

As the sun set, we returned to our resort feeling grateful for this beautiful country and its friendly people. It was a truly unforgettable experience that left us longing to come back again. The Maldives truly is a slice of paradise on Earth.
