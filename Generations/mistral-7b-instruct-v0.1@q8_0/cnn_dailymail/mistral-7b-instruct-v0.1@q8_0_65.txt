home will stimulate memories and trigger feelings of familiarity, comfort and happiness.

The initiative, called Memories for Dementia, was inspired by the 1946 film 'It's a Wonderful Life', in which the protagonist's loved ones visit him after he has fallen asleep, recounting happy memories from his past to lift his spirits.

The experiment involves recording short videos of family members, friends, and caregivers saying messages of love and encouragement to the residents of the care home, who suffer from Alzheimer's disease or other forms of dementia. 

Residents will be shown the videos on a specially designed digital player in their rooms. The idea is that the sight and sound of familiar faces and voices will help stimulate memories and promote feelings of connection and well-being.

The experiment, which costs around $25,000 to implement, was launched by a New York-based charity called the Alzheimer's Association.

"Memories for Dementia is a simple but powerful idea that has the potential to make a real difference in the lives of people living with dementia," said Elizabeth Blackwell, associate director of care and support programs for the Alzheimer's Association in New York. 

A similar program was launched in 2015 in Australia, where it was found that residents who received personalized videos showed signs of improved mood, reduced agitation, and increased social interaction with staff and fellow residents.

In New York, the initiative is being rolled out at the Care Home on Amsterdam Avenue, where 30 residents will participate in the program. The digital players will be installed in their rooms, and a training program will be provided for staff to ensure that the videos are shown in a way that maximizes their impact.

The success of Memories for Dementia will be evaluated through regular assessments of resident's mood, behavior, and level of engagement with the program. The results will then be used to determine whether the initiative should be expanded to other care homes in the area.
