ation that includes business leaders and academics, and will meet with Cuban President Raul Castro and other officials. He will also tour several provinces, including Havana, Matanzas, and Villa Clara.

Cuomo said in a statement that the trip will allow him to learn more about Cuba and its people, as well as explore potential areas for cooperation between the two countries. "As the first New York governor to visit Cuba in more than 50 years, I am excited to experience this unique culture and share ideas on how we can work together to build a better future for both our nations," he said.

The delegation includes representatives from several major companies, including Marriott International, PepsiCo, Citigroup, and Cisco Systems. They will meet with Cuban officials to discuss trade, investment, and other economic issues. The trip is expected to generate millions of dollars in new business opportunities for the U.S., which has a long history of tension with Cuba.

The visit is seen as an important step towards normalizing relations between the two countries, which were severed in 1960 after the Cuban Revolution. Obama's easing on travel and trade restrictions was aimed at opening up new markets for American businesses and promoting greater cultural exchange between the U.S. and Cuba. However, there are still many obstacles to overcome, including differences in political systems, human rights concerns, and ongoing tensions over U.S. military activities in the region.
