amped its mark on future royal events, including that of Princess Charlotte's daughter Princess Eugenie, who recently got married in Windsor Castle.

Princess Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank were married surrounded by a stunning floral display - similar to the one that adorned the royal couple's nuptials almost seven years ago. The decorations included white peonies, lavender, ivy, roses and hydrangeas, arranged in a delicate, romantic style.

The Royal family is known for their love of flowers - particularly roses, which symbolise love, passion and devotion, and are often used to decorate their homes. But what's interesting about the floral choices of Eugenie and her brother Prince Harry (who married Meghan Markle in May 2018) is that they seem to be taking inspiration from William and Kate's wedding day.

The peonies, lavender and ivy that featured so prominently in Princess Eugenie's wedding were all also used at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011. And the roses that adorned the royal family's homes in Windsor Castle are believed to be a nod to the stunning bouquet of red roses, white peonies, ivy and myrtle that Kate carried on her arm when she married William.

So it seems that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have left a lasting impression not just on their own family but also on the royal family as a whole. Their beautiful wedding day - and the flowers that were an integral part of it - will continue to inspire future generations of royals for years to come.
