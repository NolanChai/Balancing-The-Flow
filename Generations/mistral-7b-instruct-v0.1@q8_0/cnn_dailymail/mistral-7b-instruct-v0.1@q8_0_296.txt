Trindade, 23, went missing from her flat in Telford, Shropshire, on April 16 and has not been seen since. Her body is believed to be buried somewhere in the area, but its exact location remains unknown.

An industrial meat grinder was found at the home of Mark Davenport, 43, in connection with the disappearance of Adriana Trindade. The grinder was discovered in a bedroom cupboard and has raised suspicions that the woman’s body may have been ground up. The police are also investigating the disappearance of three other individuals – two men and one woman. It is believed that all four people may have been killed by Davenport, who has a history of violent crime.

Davenport was arrested on April 21 and is currently in custody. The police are carrying out searches in the surrounding areas in an attempt to locate Adriana’s body. They have also issued an appeal for witnesses to come forward with any information that could help with their investigation.
