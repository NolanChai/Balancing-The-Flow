end have been considering selling him.

Liverpool have already been linked with a number of strikers, including Edinson Cavani and Mario Mandzukic, but Immobile could be an attractive option for Jurgen Klopp due to his pace, skill, and goal-scoring ability. The 26-year-old has scored seven goals in all competitions for Dortmund this season, although only two of those have been in the Bundesliga.

Liverpool are currently second in the Premier League, just three points behind leaders Manchester City, and Klopp is looking to strengthen his squad ahead of a busy upcoming schedule. The Reds will face Bournemouth, Stoke City, Chelsea, West Ham United, and Leicester City in their next six games, and it is likely that they will need to bring in at least one new player to help them maintain their title challenge.

Immobile could be a useful addition for Liverpool as he would provide some much-needed competition for Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane up front. The Reds have relied heavily on the pair this season, with Salah scoring 14 goals and Mane netting 12 in all competitions. However, Immobile could provide some much-needed depth to the team's attacking options, as well as some added pace and skill on the counterattack.

Liverpool are believed to be willing to pay around Â£60 million for Immobile, which is a significant fee given that he has only scored seven goals in all competitions this season. However, if he can prove his worth and help Liverpool win the title, it could well be worth the investment for Klopp and the Reds.
