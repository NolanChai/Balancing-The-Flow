8cm x 6cm egg ever – weighing just 4g.

The tiny egg is about half the size of an ordinary hen’s egg, and has a unique shape that resembles a bird’s eye. Shannon, from New York state, discovered the egg in her chicken coop while feeding the hens last week. “I was like ‘wow, this egg is really small,’” she said. “I don’t think I’ve ever seen an egg that small.”

Shannon and her friend Rachel have been keeping chickens for two years and have a flock of eight hens. They were thrilled to find the tiny egg, and they are hoping that it will help them set a new record in the Guinness Book of Records – the current smallest egg on record weighs 7.8g.

However, Shannon said she doesn’t think the egg is actually the smallest ever laid by a chicken. “I know there are people out there who have found smaller eggs,” she said.

Shannon and Rachel plan to submit their discovery to Guinness for consideration, but they know it may be a long shot. The book receives thousands of submissions each year, and only a small fraction of them make it into the final edition.
