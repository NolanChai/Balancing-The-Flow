tions, faced growing calls for a judicial review after she announced last year that Janner would not face charges because there was no "sufficient evidence" to secure a conviction.

However, she warned today that anyone who disagrees with her should bring their case to court rather than making baseless claims in the media.

Ms Saunders, speaking at an event in London, said: "It is for the courts to decide whether the decision was right or wrong and if there is a challenge then it should be done through that process."

She added: "There are those who will make allegations and criticisms without going through the proper channels. There may be a legitimate concern about this case, but they need to do it in the proper way."

Ms Saunders' decision not to prosecute Lord Janner, the former children's minister, was met with anger by victims of his alleged abuse. But she insisted that her decision was based on "a careful review" of all the evidence.

She said: "It is a matter of making sure we have sufficient evidence to secure a conviction. That is the duty we owe as prosecutors."

Ms Saunders also emphasised the importance of respecting due process and avoiding publicity in cases that may be sensitive or difficult for victims.

She added: "We need to ensure that every victim, whether it's an adult or a child, has access to justice."

But Ms Saunders acknowledged that some of the criticism directed towards her was valid and that she needed to learn from it.

She said: "I have spoken with victims and their families about this case. I understand why they were frustrated and disappointed."

Ms Saunders also announced that a new team will be set up to deal specifically with complex child abuse cases. The team, which will consist of senior prosecutors and experts, will work closely with police forces and other agencies to ensure that every case is treated with sensitivity and care.
