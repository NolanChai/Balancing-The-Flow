According to Coastguard spokesman Graeme McLaren, these boats were made from pieces of furniture found on the beach, including chairs and tables, wooden planks and even an old refrigerator.

"What was most concerning was their lack of proper safety equipment - such as life jackets or flares," he said. "We've had several incidents in the past where people have gone out onto the water in homemade boats with little to no protection."

The group was eventually found and taken ashore safely, but the incident has prompted a warning from the coastguard to always be aware of the dangers posed by these types of boats.

"While it might seem like fun to build a boat out of household items, it's important to remember that the water can be unpredictable and dangerous," McLaren said. "It's crucial to ensure you have proper safety equipment and training before venturing out onto the water."
