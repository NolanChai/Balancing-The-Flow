It was founded in 2015 and operates in California, where cannabis is legal for medicinal use only. To begin with it delivered medical cannabis to patients but now also offers recreational cannabis to anyone over the age of 18 who has signed up on its platform. It operates in around 30 cities throughout California and delivers the drugs within a short time frame, often within minutes.

Customers can choose from a range of strains of cannabis, edibles and vapes, with prices starting at $15. The service also offers a ‘Recommended’ feature that suggests products based on user preferences. Eaze is currently valued at around $1 billion and has raised $275 million in funding.

The app allows customers to pay for their purchases securely using a credit card, debit card or e-wallet. It also enables them to rate the quality of the product they receive and leave feedback for other users. Eaze takes responsibility for ensuring that its products are of high quality and safe to use, by testing them in an independent laboratory.

Despite the convenience offered by Eaze, there have been concerns raised about the impact it could have on public health. Some worry that it could increase the use of drugs among young people and lead to an increase in accidents and other negative consequences. There are also questions about the regulation of such services, with some arguing that they should be subject to the same rules as alcohol retailers.

Despite these concerns, Eaze has become a popular service among many Californians, providing them with a quick and convenient way to get their hands on cannabis. As the legalization of recreational cannabis spreads across other states in the US, it is likely that services like Eaze will follow suit, offering similar services to users elsewhere in the country.
