# The Heart of the Matter (Dana Sorenson)

The Heart of the Matter: A Dana Sorenson Book (The Heart of the Matter Book 1)

Eva is a brilliant, driven medical student who doesn’t believe in love. She has seen too much loss, and her heart has been broken too many times to allow herself to be vulnerable again. But when she meets Dr. Kai Lundquist on her last clinical rotation before medical school graduation, everything changes.

Kai is a charming, handsome doctor with a passion for science and a talent for making Eva laugh. He’s also a troubled man with a dark past that has haunted him for years. As he opens up to Eva, they form an intense bond that neither can resist. But their love is tested when a terrible accident leaves Kai critically injured and in a coma.

As Eva struggles to come to terms with her feelings for Kai, she’s also faced with the possibility that he may never wake up from his coma. And if he does, will he remember her? As she navigates through this emotional turmoil, Eva discovers a side of herself that she never knew existed, and learns the true meaning of love, sacrifice, and the power to heal.
