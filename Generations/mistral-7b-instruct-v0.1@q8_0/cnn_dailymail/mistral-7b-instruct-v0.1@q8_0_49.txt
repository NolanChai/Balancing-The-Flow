Alcaraz, 31, has been a key figure since signing from Villarreal three years ago and was named in the UEFA Europa League team of the season last season. He has just one year left on his contract, however.

Distin, 34, has also been a stalwart at Goodison Park since arriving from Birmingham City in 2011 but has yet to agree an extension on his current deal, which expires in 2016.

"We'll have conversations with them both," Martinez said. "What we need to do is make sure we are in a position to keep them if they want to stay and continue to be important players for us. That's the way it has always worked at Everton. We have good relationships with our players and we like to talk about their futures. It's about making sure everyone feels comfortable and valued."

Martinez added: "We need to make sure they can still perform at the high levels they are capable of, whether that means signing new deals or exploring other options. We don't want to keep players who aren't playing to their maximum potential or giving their best for the team."
