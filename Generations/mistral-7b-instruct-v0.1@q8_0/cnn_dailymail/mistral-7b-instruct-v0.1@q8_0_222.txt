The first photos of Sarah Stage’s healthy newborn baby boy have been released. The 30-year-old lingerie model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles had come under fire during her pregnancy for her strict, no-fat diet and intense exercise regimen that she continued right up to the day she gave birth.

Stage had said on social media that she ate nothing but chicken breast, brown rice, and green beans throughout her entire pregnancy. She also refused to gain any weight, claiming that she only wanted a “healthy baby.”

Critics accused Stage of promoting an unhealthy lifestyle for pregnant women and potentially harming the health of her baby. But on Wednesday, Sarah posted photos of her newborn son to Instagram, showing him off in a tiny diaper with his eyes closed and his head resting on his arm.

In the caption, she wrote: “Our little man is here!!! He’s 7 lbs 14 oz, 5’8” inches tall and perfect! We are so blessed and cannot wait to spend every moment with him!”

The post received over 900,000 likes, but many commenters expressed their concerns about her diet and exercise habits during pregnancy. One user wrote: “I’m sorry, but this is not a healthy lifestyle for a pregnant woman.”

Others praised Stage for her dedication to her fitness routine and healthy eating habits. They noted that she had clearly taken good care of herself during her pregnancy and that the health of her baby was more important than anything else.

It’s worth noting that while Stage’s strict diet and exercise regimen may have contributed to her overall fitness level, it is not recommended for pregnant women to maintain such an intense workout routine or eat an extremely low-calorie diet without consulting a healthcare professional. Every pregnancy is unique, and individual needs can vary widely depending on various factors such as age, medical history, and lifestyle habits. It’s important for pregnant women to work with their doctors to develop a safe and healthy plan that meets their specific needs.
