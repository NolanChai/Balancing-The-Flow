iled bystanders on Westminster Bridge, holding up their phones to capture pictures.

It was not long before the first man with a megaphone appeared, his booming voice ringing out: "Welcome to London's Westminster Bridge, the world-famous bridge where history is made!" He was followed by another, waving a Union Jack flag and shouting out: "Get ready to witness a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Don't miss it!"

The third megaphoner was a young man with dreadlocks who began chanting "Come on, Harry, come on, Harry!" as he waved a banner bearing the face of Prince Harry. The fourth was a group of students dressed in royal attire, holding up signs that read "Welcome to the Royal Family" and "Join us at our secret VIP party tonight."

As the sun began to set, the crowd swelled, with more than 100 people now gathered on Westminster Bridge, all hoping to catch a glimpse of the royal family. One by one, they stepped out of their vehicles, waving and smiling as they made their way towards St James's Palace.

The Duchess of Cambridge was the first to arrive, looking radiant in a stunning blue dress and matching heels. She was followed by the Duke of Cambridge, who looked every inch the royal gentleman in his dark suit and tie. Prince Harry and Princess Eugenie were next, their faces lit up with excitement as they made their way towards the palace.

The crowds erupted in cheers as the royals approached, each one shaking hands with the crowds before making their way inside the palace gates. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were the first to enter, followed by Prince Harry and Princess Eugenie, who looked absolutely stunning in her flowing white dress and delicate lace veil.

As the royal family made their way inside, the crowd outside continued to sing and cheer, each one hoping for a glimpse of the couple's wedding day. It was clear that no royal event would be complete without them, but this time it was not just about the wedding - it was about bringing people together to celebrate the joy of love.
