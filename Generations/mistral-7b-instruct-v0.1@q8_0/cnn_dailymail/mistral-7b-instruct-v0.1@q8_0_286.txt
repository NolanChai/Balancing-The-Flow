for the longest duration of intercourse among pandas.

It was a happy union for the pair, who have been together since they were one year old and have had three cubs together. Their long-lasting session has sparked fascination from animal lovers around the world.

Lu Lu, whose name means 'the pearl' in Chinese, is eight years old and weighs around 120kg, while Zhen Zhen, which means 'the golden panda', is six years old and weighs around 70kg.

Their lovemaking session, which was recorded by scientists from the National Research Institute of Animal Husbandry in Hebei Province, has also been dubbed 'a milestone in animal behaviour' as it has not been seen before among pandas.

The average mating session between pandas lasts just 15 to 45 seconds. It was previously thought that pandas only mated for a few minutes at a time, and only once a year. However, this new record-breaking session has shed light on their love lives and could lead to further research into their mating habits.

Animal lovers have been quick to praise the pair's performance, with many hailing it as 'the ultimate display of panda passion'.

Dr Li Zhiyong, who led the research project, said: "We are glad to report that Lu Lu and Zhen Zhen successfully mated during this session. We were not able to confirm whether this was their first mating session of the year or not, but we did observe that they were both very active during the process."

The scientists also noted that Lu Lu had been unusually active beforehand, displaying a range of playful behaviours such as scratching and rubbing against his mate. Zhen Zhen, meanwhile, had been more sedate but equally active in their lovemaking session.

Lu Lu and Zhen Zhen are just two of the many pandas in captivity in China. There are currently around 1,800 pandas in the wild and a further 1,700 in captivity, mainly in breeding centres. Pandas are an endangered species due to habitat loss and poaching, with conservation efforts ongoing to protect them.
