England against India in November 2013, but his comeback has been delayed due to a persistent elbow injury, which kept him out of all Test cricket for almost two years.

England had already lost their skipper Alastair Cook and opening batsman Adam Lyon to injury, and now Trott joins the list of absences as Australia prepares to bowl England out for the second time in a row at Headingley.

In the morning session, Australia made steady progress as they reduced England to 158-4 after 70 overs. The English batsmen had yet to score a half-century, and Australia captain Steve Smith declared that he was happy with their bowling so far. "We've got some good lines and lengths," he said. "I think the guys are very confident in their ability to get wickets."

However, Trott was given an opportunity to prove his worth when he came in at number five, replacing Ian Bell. He had a chance to score some runs before lunch, but failed to do so as he edged a James Anderson delivery through slip for just one run. After a brief partnership with Gary Ballance, Trott was caught by Brad Haddin off a Stuart Broad delivery for just three runs.

England are currently struggling to keep up with Australia's pace, and their hopes of avoiding another defeat in this series seem slim.
