Police spokesman Sergeant Maha Nambi said that two men had been arrested for their roles in the robbery, which took place on Tuesday night at the Lobatse Shopping Centre near Gaborone, Botswana’s capital city.

Arulchelvam was driving a van containing three other men when he saw the thieves, who were armed with guns and knives, attempting to rob a nearby shop. In an attempt to intervene, Arulchelvam chased after them, leading them on a high-speed chase through the streets of Gaborone.

During the chase, Arulchelvam lost control of his van and crashed into a tree. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. The other three men in the van were injured but managed to escape.

In addition to Arulchelvam’s death, two other people were also killed during the robbery. A shopkeeper who tried to stop the thieves was shot and killed by one of the robbers, while another man who was caught in the crossfire was also killed.

Sergeant Nambi said that the two men arrested for their roles in the robbery were aged 27 and 30 and had been on bail for previous theft-related charges. They are currently being held in police custody, pending further investigation and court proceedings.
