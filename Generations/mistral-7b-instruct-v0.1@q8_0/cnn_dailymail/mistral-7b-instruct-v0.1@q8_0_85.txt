r first year of life.

Our study found that the average cost of buying clothes for a newborn is £2,861. By contrast, parents spend £1,884 on clothes for their second child in their first year. This means that parents spend 35% less on clothing for their second child compared to their first.

With babies growing at such an incredible rate, it’s not surprising that the cost of buying clothes for newborns is higher than for older children. But even when accounting for the fact that our newborns are around six months old and need more clothes, our findings still suggest that parents are spending significantly less on their second child.

The fact that there is a considerable financial difference between what parents spend on their first and second child could be down to a number of factors such as lack of awareness about the cost of baby items or simply not having the same level of excitement for their second child. Whatever the reason, it’s important that parents remember to budget appropriately for all of their children, regardless of their age or position in the family.
