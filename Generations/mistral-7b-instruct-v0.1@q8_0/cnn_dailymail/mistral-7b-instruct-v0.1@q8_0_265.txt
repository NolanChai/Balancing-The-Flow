But in death, he became something more: a martyr for racial justice, a symbol of resistance against the brutality of the police. The memory of George Floyd, a black man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police officers on May 25, has come to dominate the summer of 2020 in the United States and around the world.

The protests that followed his death have become a global movement calling for an end to police brutality and systemic racism. Floyd’s name is now synonymous with the fight for equality and justice. He has been hailed as a hero by many, including former President Barack Obama and NBA star LeBron James.

And in his death, he has brought a new sense of urgency to an ongoing struggle that has persisted despite moments of progress. The protests have led to tangible changes in some cities, including the removal of Confederate statues and increased funding for schools in historically black neighborhoods. But much more needs to be done, activists say.

Floyd’s death has also raised new questions about the role of police in American society. As protests have raged on, many have called into question the very existence of modern-day police departments, which were first established to enforce the institution of slavery.

In an era of rapid change and growing awareness about the need for racial justice, Floyd’s death has become a catalyst for activists seeking to reshape America in more just and equitable ways. For those who have been fighting against systemic racism for years, Floyd’s death was a moment that brought their cause to the forefront of the national conversation in a way that hadn’t happened before.

But for others, it was an introduction to a movement that has been brewing for decades. The protests have inspired new generations of activists, who are determined to continue fighting for change long after the current moment has passed.
