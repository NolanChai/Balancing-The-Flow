and washed herself off in the club's toilets after she was allegedly assaulted by the Arsenal player last Saturday night.

The incident took place at the exclusive London club, Maddox Club, where Lennon and his teammates were celebrating their victory over Stoke City on the final day of the Premier League season. The young waitress, named as Paloma Popova by MailOnline, was working on the night at the club's upscale restaurant, when she allegedly became involved in a heated argument with Lennon and his group of friends.

"I went to collect his drink, but he grabbed my hand, pushed me against a wall and slapped me across the face," Paloma claimed. "His friend then ripped my top off as he continued to assault me."

Paloma added that she tried to fight back against Lennon's attacks, but he was too strong for her. She managed to escape the VIP suite after getting help from another member of staff and ran to the club's toilets, where she washed herself off before leaving the premises.

Lennon has not yet been arrested or charged over the alleged assault on Paloma, but he has denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman for the player said: "Aaron can confirm that there was no physical contact between him and the young woman at Maddox Club."

The incident has sparked a debate about the treatment of women in nightclubs and bars by men, with some people calling for greater awareness and education around such issues. Some have also called for stricter laws and penalties for those who are caught assaulting women.

Paloma's alleged ordeal has been widely condemned on social media, with many expressing sympathy for her and calling for justice to be served against Lennon if he is found guilty of the charges.
