armac, sending a shower of debris across the runway and into surrounding buildings.

The photo shows the twisted metal from one of the wheels scattered across the runway in front of the aircraft, which is parked next to the wreckage. The plane had been carrying 182 passengers and crew when it landed hard on the tarmac.

The cause of the landing was later determined to be a failure of one of the plane’s engines. A spokesperson for East Midlands Airport said that there were no injuries reported in the incident. “Emergency services are working to clear up debris from the runway and surrounding areas following an engine failure during the landing,” the statement read.

The photo was released as part of an investigation into the incident, which is expected to continue for several weeks. The plane’s crew was praised for their quick thinking in handling the emergency situation.
