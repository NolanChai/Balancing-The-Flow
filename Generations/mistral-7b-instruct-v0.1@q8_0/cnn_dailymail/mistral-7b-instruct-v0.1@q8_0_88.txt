avolta was taken aback by the contestant's response, which prompted him to quickly correct it and cut the segment short.

The question in question was: "What is the average number of zits on a teenager's face during puberty?" The contestant responded with, "I don't know. I think it's like 50 or something." However, this answer was met with shock and confusion from both the host and audience members, who were clearly taken aback by such an inappropriate response.

Travolta quickly cut to a commercial break before returning to the stage to correct the contestant's answer. He explained that the average number of zits on a teenager's face during puberty is actually around 16, not 50. The contestant seemed embarrassed and apologetic for their mistake, but the incident left many viewers feeling uncomfortable and disturbed.

Many took to social media to express their disgust with the contestant's response, calling it disrespectful and inappropriate. Others defended the contestant, arguing that they may have simply misspoke or given an incorrect answer without realizing the implications of their response.

Regardless, the incident serves as a reminder of the importance of appropriate language and behavior, especially when discussing sensitive topics like puberty on a public platform.
