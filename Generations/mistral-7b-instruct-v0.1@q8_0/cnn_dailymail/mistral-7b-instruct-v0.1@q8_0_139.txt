isbane court when she attacked the man, who had been snapping pictures of her for a newspaper article. The 28-year-old pleaded guilty to two charges of having sex with an animal, which is illegal under Australian law.

During sentencing, Judge David Reid described Driscoll's behaviour as 'disgusting', 'depraved' and 'offensive'. He handed her a jail term of six months and ordered she be placed on the sexual offenders register for life. The court heard that Driscoll had been having sex with the dog, a dalmatian named Spike, on a number of occasions over several weeks in 2015. It was only discovered when neighbours reported smells coming from her apartment and police were called to investigate.

Driscoll's defence lawyer said his client had been suffering from mental illness at the time of the offences and was 'deeply ashamed' of what she had done. But Judge Reid told Driscoll that the law did not take into account any excuse for her behaviour, which he described as 'abhorrent'. He also ordered her to pay a $1000 fine. As she left the courthouse, Driscoll attacked the photographer and threatened to throw him out of the building, before pushing him into the street and hitting him over the head with a bottle.
