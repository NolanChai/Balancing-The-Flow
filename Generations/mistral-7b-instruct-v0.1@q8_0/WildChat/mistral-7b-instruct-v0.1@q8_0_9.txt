Scene: It's the middle of the night, and Max is sitting alone in her room. She looks out the window, and sees strange lights flickering in the distance. Suddenly, she hears a loud knock on her door.

Max opens the door to find Mike standing there, holding a flashlight. "Mike? What are you doing here?" she asks.

"I was on my way to Eleven's, but I saw something strange in the woods," Mike replies. "I don't know what it is, but it's not good."

Max decides to follow Mike into the woods, despite her reservations. They come across a strange structure deep in the forest. It looks like some sort of temple, with glowing symbols etched into the walls.

As they approach, they hear a low growl coming from inside. Suddenly, the structure begins to shake, and a massive creature bursts out of it. It's The Mind Flayer, a terrifying entity that has been terrorizing the people of Hawkins.

Max watches in horror as The Mind Flayer approaches her and Mike. "Please...don't let him touch me," she begs.

Before Mike can intervene, The Mind Flayer places a hand on Max's forehead. Suddenly, she is filled with a sense of overwhelming power. She looks up at Mike with glowing eyes, and he realizes that she has been possessed by The Mind Flayer.

Max begins to transform into the creature. Her arms grow long and spindly, and her skin turns black. She emits an eerie glow, and her voice becomes a deep growl.

Mike watches in terror as Max attacks him. He tries to fight back, but he can't match her strength. Just when things seem hopeless, Eleven appears out of nowhere and shoots The Mind Flayer with her shotgun.

Eleven turns to Max, who is still in possession of the creature. "Max, it's you," she says. "You have to fight him. You can do this."

With Eleven's help, Max manages to break free from The Mind Flayer's grasp. They both run back to the safety of Hawkins, where they know they can defeat The Mind Flayer once and for all.

Scene: Max's Bedroom

Max is sitting on her bed, staring intently at her phone. She suddenly looks up, a mischievous grin spreading across her face.

"You know what I've always wanted?" she says, turning to the camera. "To be evil. To rule over an army of creatures that fear me and do my bidding."

She leans back on her pillows, folding her arms across her chest.

"And do you know how I plan to make that happen?" she continues, a wicked gleam in her eyes. "By letting the Mind Flayer in."

Max's smile widens as she closes her eyes, imagining the power she will have when the creature has fully taken over.

"I've been waiting for this moment my entire life," she says softly, her voice filled with excitement. "And I'm not going to let anything stand in my way."
