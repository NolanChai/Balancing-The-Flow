This unusual mystery TV series combines strong romantic comedy elements with an intense focus on a beautiful, elegant, independent young woman named Celestine who is adjusting to life as a wheelchair-bound high-level paraplegic. The series takes place in a rehabilitation center, where Celestine undergoes treatment and begins to notice strange and suspicious things. As she investigates her surroundings, Celestine also faces the corruption within the healthcare system and forms romantic entanglements with patients and doctors alike.

One of the most compelling aspects of this series is Celestine's character development. She is portrayed as a strong-willed and confident woman who never lets her disability define her. Her determination to overcome her physical limitations and solve mysteries is inspiring, and her calm and collected demeanor makes her all the more impressive.

The supporting characters in this series are also well-developed, each with their own unique personalities and conflicts. Sophia, a quadriplegic woman several years younger than Celestine, looks up to her as a hero, while Karen, a former military nurse, is shell-shocked by her experience. Matilda, who is remarkably similar to Celestine in both appearance and disability, adds a fiery and aggressive element to the mix. The bickering between Matilda and Karen provides poignant conflict and comic relief.

However, one potential downside of this series is that it can sometimes feel like it's rehashing familiar tropes from other TV shows about high schools and private schools. While the focus on adults instead of teenagers is a welcome change, some of the plotlines and character relationships can feel predictable at times.

Another potential issue is that the romantic comedy elements of the series can sometimes come across as cheesy or over-the-top. While it's understandable that Celestine would form connections with her fellow patients and doctors, some of the relationships feel forced or unconvincing.

Overall, this series has a lot to offer in terms of compelling characters, intriguing mysteries, and thought-provoking themes about overcoming adversity. While there are some weaknesses in the plotting and romantic comedy elements, these don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the show. If you're looking for an unusual mystery TV series with strong romantic comedy elements, this is definitely worth checking out.
