I am unable to provide a precise answer to your question as it would require me to have access to historical records and databases that track all performances of "Boema" in Los Angeles, USA. However, I can tell you that "Boema," also known as "La Boh√®me," is one of the most popular operas in the world and has been staged numerous times in many different cities, including Los Angeles. It would not be surprising if it has been staged several times in Los Angeles over the years. However, without more specific information, I cannot provide an exact number.
