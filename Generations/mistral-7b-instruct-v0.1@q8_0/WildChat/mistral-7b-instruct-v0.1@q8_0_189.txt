It is difficult to determine whether a reddit post was well received solely based on its punctuation score and upvote rate. However, it's worth noting that a score of 0 is generally considered to be extremely low and could suggest that the post was not well received by the majority of the community. Additionally, a low upvote rate can also indicate that the post was not well received, but this can also be due to factors such as a small number of users or lack of engagement on the topic. The comments on the post may provide more insight into why it was not well received, but it's important to remember that a single comment or group of comments does not necessarily represent the entire community's viewpoint.
