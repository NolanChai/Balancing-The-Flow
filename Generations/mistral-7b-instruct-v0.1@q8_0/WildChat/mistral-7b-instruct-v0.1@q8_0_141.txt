The six financial projections, also known as the "six statements of cash flows," provide a comprehensive picture of a company's liquidity and solvency. They are:

1. Operating Activities Statement - shows how much cash the company has generated or consumed in its normal business activities.
2. Investing Activities Statement - shows how much cash the company has spent on investing in assets, such as property, plant, and equipment.
3. Financing Activities Statement - shows how much cash the company has received from or paid out to its owners (equity) and creditors.
4. Statement of Shareholder's Equity (Balance Sheet) - shows the changes in ownership through equity financing activities, such as stock sales or dividends paid.
5. Statement of Retained Earnings - shows how much cash the company has retained from its profits and losses over time.
6. Cash Flow Statement Summary - provides an overall view of the company's cash flows by combining the operating, investing, and financing activities statements.
