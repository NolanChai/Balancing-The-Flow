To clarify, you are inquiring about the information on annual statements and cross-referencing it with CCMS. It is important to note that there may be variations in the average size of the production process when compared to the data in annual statements.

Please note that the information provided in your annual statement may not be accurate as there could be discrepancies between the stated and actual production size. I will check with CCMS to ensure that the data is up-to-date and accurate.
