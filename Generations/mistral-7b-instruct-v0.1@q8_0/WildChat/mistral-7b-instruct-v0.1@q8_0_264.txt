No, a mother's love for her children does not automatically disqualify her from being a narcissist. Narcissism is defined by a range of traits that include an excessive need for admiration, attention, and approval from others, often at the expense of others' needs and feelings. It does not require a lack of affection or love for one's children or anyone else. It is possible for a mother to have a narcissistic personality disorder while also genuinely loving her children. It is important to remember that everyone can exhibit certain traits at times, but this does not necessarily mean they are a full-blown personality disorder. It is always best to seek the guidance of a mental health professional if you suspect someone may have a personality disorder or other mental health condition.
