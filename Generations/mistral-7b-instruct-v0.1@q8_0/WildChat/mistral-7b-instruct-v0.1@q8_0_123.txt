It's great to hear from you, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. It sounds like you've been able to connect with a supportive community through the We4A programme and that it has helped you grow as an entrepreneur. I appreciate the example of how attending events like the Nyayo Mums soko event was able to generate sales for your business and introduce you to new contacts who could be helpful in your line of work. It's inspiring to hear about the diverse group of women entrepreneurs you've met through the program and how they are all working towards making a positive impact in their communities.

"Good afternoon everyone,

I'm here today to talk about my experience with the We4A programme. When I first started using the programme, I had no idea what I was getting myself into. But now that I have been using it for a while, I can't imagine life without it!

One of the things I love most about We4A is how easy it is to use. The interface is straightforward and intuitive, and I was able to start using it right away. And the best part? It's constantly being updated with new features and improvements, so I always have access to the latest tools and technologies.

But what really sets We4A apart is the community of users. Everyone is friendly and supportive, and there's always someone available to help if you need it. It's great to be part of such a collaborative and inclusive group.

Overall, I highly recommend We4A to anyone looking for an easy-to-use, powerful, and community-focused platform for their business needs. Thank you for your time."

Hello everyone! My name is [PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON], Co-Founder of Inspcorp, a research-based technology transfer startup that develops difference-making technologies, and Eco Blocks and Tiles, a green technology company that manufactures high-quality and affordable building products using various mixed post-consumer waste materials. I am also a PhD scholar in hydrology and water quality, and mother of 3 adorable little ones. I'm honored to be here today as a fellow 2021 and a We4A member since March this year.

When I joined the program, I was feeling a bit rusty and out of shape after my maternity leave, but the community of fellow women entrepreneurs that We4A provided me with made me feel welcomed, supported, and confident once again. The first event I attended was the day of Celebrating Women 2023 at the Radisson Blu, where I sold home d√©cor items, Swahili snacks from the coast, and flyers for my upcoming rainwater harvesting technology launch, all while being surrounded by amazing women who offered me warm tea and even introduced me to potential business partners.

We4A has given me so many opportunities to network with like-minded women entrepreneurs without fear of judgment or inadequacy. The program has provided me with valuable events such as the Nyayo Mums soko event, where I sold my items and met people who could potentially partner with me in the future. Through these events, I have learned that showing up is crucial for the growth of our businesses, as it amplifies our voices, our innovations, and our business impact.

I am grateful for the women in this program, like Sarah from Nyeri, Rose from Kisumu, Maureen from Nairobi, Hellen from Nyeri, Linda from Nanu, and Mwanaisha who runs an online clothing store. These women are doing amazing things, and I am honored to be a part of this community of women entrepreneurs.

Thank you, Tracy and Nikita for your unwavering support and for organizing the logistics, even during the heat. Thank you to the entire team of GIZ and We4A for thinking about us women entrepreneurs and creating opportunities for us to show up, network, learn, and grow.
