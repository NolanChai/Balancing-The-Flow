It looks like you are running a Node.js application using the Express framework, and are trying to install the "express" package as a dependency in your project. You have successfully installed the package with the latest version and there were no vulnerabilities found. The server is now listening on port 3000 and ready to accept requests.

It looks like your server is running and listening on port 3000, but the error message "แ��ยังได้" suggests that there may be an issue with your code or configuration. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure that your `server.js` file is located in the root directory of your project and that it has the correct contents for starting your Express server. You can verify this by running `node server.js` again and checking the output to make sure that your server is starting correctly.
2. Check for any syntax errors or typos in your code by running `npm lint` or using a code editor with built-in error checking.
3. Make sure that you have all of the necessary dependencies installed by running `npm install` again. You can also try uninstalling and reinstalling your dependencies by running `npm uninstall express`, followed by `npm install express`.
4. If none of the above steps work, you may want to consider posting more information about your error message and the specific steps you've taken to troubleshoot the issue on a forum or chat room for Node.js developers.
