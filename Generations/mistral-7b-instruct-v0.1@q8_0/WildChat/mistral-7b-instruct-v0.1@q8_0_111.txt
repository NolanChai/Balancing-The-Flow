Necrohemoth: "What is it?"

Archeogiana: "I think...something...is wrong with me."

Necrohemoth: "You're right. I'll check on you."

(Necrohemoth goes over to Archeogiana and examines her.)

Necrohemoth: "Your eyes are turning green, but it seems like there's nothing else wrong with you."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "I wonder what could cause this?"

Archeogiana: "Maybe...the Sculk-elemental Blacksight. He's known for his ability to manipulate colors and energy."

Necrohemoth: "We need to find him."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Agreed. Let's split up and search the area."

(The group splits up to search for Sculk-elemental Blacksight.)
