They will be asked to complete a short quiz or worksheet that tests their knowledge and comprehension of the lesson material. Additionally, students will be assessed based on their participation in class discussions and their ability to present information about a specific country or city within the Balkans.

The number of tokens used by my responses depends on how long they are. I can generate text of arbitrary length, but longer responses tend to use more tokens. If you have a specific response in mind that you would like me to analyze for token usage, please provide it and I'll be happy to help.
