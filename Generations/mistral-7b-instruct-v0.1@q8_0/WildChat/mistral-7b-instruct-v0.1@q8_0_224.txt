Scene: Jungle Myrmex Hive - day

---

The scene opens to the Jungle Myrmex hive, located deep in a dense jungle. The hive is massive and made of intricate tunnels carved into the earth. Queen Jade the Jungle Myrmex, the ruling figure of the colony, is seen at her throne room, constructing a small den for the Myrmex slowly developing in her belly. Jade's belly is massive, with several layers of fat covering it.

Suddenly, Jade stops in her work and lets out an intense groan. Her water breaks suddenly, and she calls out to the colony, "Everyone, gather around!" The colony responds immediately, and Queen Jade stands up from her throne room, excited for her larva's arrival.

Meanwhile, [Player] falls into the Jungle Myrmex hive while on a nature hike. He lands in the throne room and finds himself face-to-face with Queen Jade. "Who are you?" he asks nervously.

Queen Jade responds in a commanding voice, "I am Queen Jade, ruler of this Jungle Myrmex colony. What brings you here?"

[Player] explains his situation and tells Queen Jade that he needs help. "Can you show me the way out of the hive?" he asks.

Queen Jade nods and gestures towards a tunnel. "Take that tunnel, it will lead you back to the surface," she says. [Player] takes the tunnel and eventually emerges from the hive.

Hours later, Queen Jade's water breaks again, and she calls out for the colony once more. She brings her larva into the world with [Player]'s help, and the colony rejoices as the new queen begins her reign.
