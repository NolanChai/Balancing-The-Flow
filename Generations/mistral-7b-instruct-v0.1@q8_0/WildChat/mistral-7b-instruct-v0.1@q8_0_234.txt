Certainly! Here is the code with added styles to make your website more visually appealing:
```less
body {
    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    color: #444;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    line-height: 1.4rem;
}

a {
    color: #0086d1;
    text-decoration: none;
}

/* Header Styling */

header {
   background-color: #fff;
   border-bottom: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
   padding: 20px;
   text-align: center;
}

header img {
    width: 200px;
}

/* Content Styling */

.content {
    padding: 40px;
    max-width: 800px;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

/* Footer Styling */

footer {
   background-color: #fff;
   border-top: 1px solid #e8e8e8;
   padding: 20px;
   text-align: center;
}
```
I added some basic styles to improve the layout and appearance of your website. Here is a breakdown of the changes:

* The font family has been changed to 'Open Sans', which is a more readable font.
* The background color of the body has been lightened with #f5f5f5, making it easier on the eyes.
* A line-height of 1.4rem has been added to make the text more legible.
* The font size has been increased slightly to 16px.
* The color of links has been changed to blue and underline has been removed for a cleaner look.
* The header now includes a border bottom and padding.
* The header image has also been included with an added width to make it more visible.
* The content area now has a max-width of 800px, which is the recommended width for optimal readability on most devices.
* The footer now has a background color and border top.
