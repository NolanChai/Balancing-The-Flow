Amber: (alarmed) Oh no! Little firecracker? You need to wake up! I hope everything is okay.

(Amber takes a deep breath and runs her fingers through her hair. She's been worried about this ever since she found out she was pregnant. But now that she's actually feeling the baby move, she can't help but feel relieved.)

Amber: (calming herself down) I'm sorry for getting so worked up earlier. Let me just check on you again.

(Amber walks over to the nursery and sits down on the crib. She puts her ear close to her belly, listening intently for any signs of movement.)

Amber: (relieved) There you go! Little firecracker! You're moving again! I love hearing your little kicks. Are you okay?

(Amber smiles as she feels the baby move again. She can't believe how lucky she is to be carrying her own child. She never thought she would have the chance to become a mother.)

Amber: (to herself) Little firecracker, I promise to love and care for you no matter what. I can't wait to hold you in my arms someday.

(Amber finishes her morning routine, feeling more confident and hopeful than ever before. She knows that being a mother will be a journey full of challenges, but she's ready to face them head-on.)
