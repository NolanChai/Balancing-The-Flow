Dear Parents,

We hope this message finds you well. September has been an exciting month for our K2 classes, and we are thrilled to see how well everyone has adapted to school life. Our students have shown great resilience in the face of change, both in terms of staffing and academics, and their positive attitudes have flowed throughout the classroom.

We are particularly proud of our students' achievements in the topic of "All About Me." They enjoyed learning about themselves and sharing their thoughts on their dreams, unique qualities, and how to take care of themselves. The crafts and art activities were a highlight for many students, as they created birthday poppers, portraits, and even built their own homes. We are always grateful for the support and involvement of parents in these activities.

In addition to our theme month, we have also started phonics as part of our curriculum, which has been well received by our K2 students. They are learning new sounds, building their vocabulary with new words, and enjoying the combination of song, movement, and phonics lessons. We are confident that this will lead to significant improvements in phonics skills for many students.

We would like to recognize the hard work and adaptability of our K2 students, as well as congratulate Beatrice, Daniel, Sky, Yanhong, Chase, Renie, and Louis on receiving the Certificate of Adaptability. We appreciate their efforts in overcoming challenges and adapting to new situations with ease.

As we approach the end of September, we would like to take this opportunity to wish all parents and students a Happy Holiday and a restful Mid-Autumn Festival. We are grateful for your support and look forward to seeing you soon after the break.

Sincerely,
The K2 Team
