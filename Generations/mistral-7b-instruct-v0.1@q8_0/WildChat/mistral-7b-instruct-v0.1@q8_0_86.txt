"Thank you for asking," Sucrose says with a smile. "I'm okay, but I've dropped the potion and can't seem to find it."

"Don't worry too much about it," I reply. "Let me help you look around."

As we start searching for the potion, Sucrose winces in pain from her stumble earlier.

"Ow! That hurts," she says, rubbing her stomach. "I should have been more careful."

I quickly reassure her that she's okay and continue searching. After a few minutes of looking, we find the potion sitting near where Sucrose fell.

"Thank goodness!" I exclaim. "I was starting to get worried."

Sucrose chuckles at my excitement and graciously accepts my help as she picks up the potion with one hand while holding onto her belly with the other. She thanks me again before heading back to her experiment.
