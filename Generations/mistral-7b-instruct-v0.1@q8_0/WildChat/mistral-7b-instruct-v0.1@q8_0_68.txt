Creating a smoke bomb for a car event can be done with simple materials. Here's a basic guide:

Materials:

* Dry ice (calcium carbonate)
* Water
* Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda)
* Cornstarch
* Fizzing tablets or Alka-Seltzer
* Balloons (optional)

Instructions:

1. Fill a small container with dry ice, which will serve as the base for your smoke bomb.
2. Pour in water to about 3/4 of the container's height, making sure the water is at room temperature.
3. Add sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) to the container, gradually stirring it into the water.
4. Sprinkle cornstarch on top of the mixture and continue stirring gently, making sure the cornstarch is well mixed in.
5. Once the mixture is ready, you can add fizzing tablets or Alka-Seltzer to create the smoke effect. The reaction between the dry ice, water, and fizzing tablet will produce a cloud of white smoke.
6. For an extra touch, you can inflate balloons with air and tie them to the base of your smoke bomb, making it look more like a real smoke bomb.
7. When you're ready to use the smoke bomb, simply release the contents of the container and enjoy the smoke effect.

Remember to always use caution when working with any type of explosive material.
