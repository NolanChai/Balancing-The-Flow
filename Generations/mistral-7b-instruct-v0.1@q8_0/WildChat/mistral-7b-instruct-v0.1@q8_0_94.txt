Lilac looked at Goku with a mix of curiosity and surprise as she watched him eat a fish. She couldn't help but wonder if such a small creature like herself could ever defeat someone of his strength.

Ants, on the other hand, were more focused on finding food than anything else. They had always been small, but they had never been this tiny. As they looked around for something to eat, they couldn't help but feel threatened by the giant humans who towered over them like gods.

Despite their differences in size and strength, both Lilac and Ants were determined to survive in this new world. They knew that they would have to be careful and work together if they were ever going to overcome the challenges that lay ahead.

As Lilac approached, the ants swarmed around her, their tiny bodies moving in unison as they surrounded her. She was taken aback by their sheer numbers and their relentless buzzing.

"What are these things?" she asked Ants. "They're attacking me!"

Ants shrugged, "They've always been here. They protect our colony."

Lilac tried to shake them off, but they clung to her like tiny parasites, biting and stinging at every opportunity. She was in pain, but she knew that if she showed fear, they would only become more aggressive.

"Stop it," she commanded, trying to sound as authoritative as possible. "These ants are harassing me. I demand that you leave."

But the ants ignored her, their tiny voices drowned out by the sound of their own buzzing. Lilac realized that they were immune to her commands. She was at their mercy.

Just as she was about to give up hope, a figure appeared on the horizon. It was Ants, who had been watching the scene unfold from a distance.

"Lilac, you're in danger," he warned, rushing towards her. "You need to get away before they harm you."

But Lilac was too late. The ants had already reached her and were swarming around her like bees. Ants tried to shield her, but it was no use. Lilac was overwhelmed by the sheer number of them.

Just as she was about to succumb to their stings, Goku appeared out of nowhere, his massive size towering over the tiny ants. He looked down at Lilac and extended a hand to help her escape.

"Come on," he said, "Let's get out of here before they harm you."

Lilac gratefully accepted his hand and together, they made their way through the swarm of ants. Once they were safe, Lilac looked back at the colony in disbelief.

"How can something so small be such a threat?" she asked Ants.

Ants shrugged, "Size doesn't matter when you have numbers on your side."

Lilac couldn't help but smile as she thought about how small and insignificant she had felt in the face of those tiny ants. But now, standing next to Goku, she knew that there was no limit to what she could achieve.
