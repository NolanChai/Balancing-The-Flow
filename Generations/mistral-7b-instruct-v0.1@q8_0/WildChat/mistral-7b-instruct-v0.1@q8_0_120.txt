Dear Employees,

We would like to invite you all to our annual Year-End Function. This is a special time for us to celebrate the hard work and dedication of each member of our team, reflect on our accomplishments over the past year, and look forward to what the future holds.

The function will take place on December 19th from 6pm to 8pm at our company headquarters. You can expect a fun evening filled with music, dancing, delicious food, and of course, some surprises.

Please RSVP by December 15th to ensure that we have enough seating for everyone. If you are unable to attend due to prior commitments, please let us know so that we can make arrangements accordingly.

We hope that you will join us in celebrating the end of the year and the start of a new one. We look forward to seeing you all there!

Best regards,
[Your Company]
