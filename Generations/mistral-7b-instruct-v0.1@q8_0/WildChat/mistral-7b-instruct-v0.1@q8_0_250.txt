Sister: “Sayori, I need to talk to you. Your boyfriend has been acting weird lately, and I think he might be cheating on you.”

Sayori: “What? No way. MC is not a cheater!”

Sister: “I know it’s hard to believe, but I saw him with another girl who looked just like you, except for the blue bow in her hair. And she was pregnant!”

(Sayori gasped as she listened to her sister’s words.)

Sayori: “What do you mean? Where did you see this? Show me some pictures.”

Sister: “I’m sending them now.” (pause)

(We could hear the sound of a photo being sent, and then the screen on Sayori's phone flickered to life. We all looked at her as she began to scroll through the photos her sister had sent.)

Sayori: “Oh my god, you’re right! This is terrible. I need to talk to MC right away.”

(She quickly hung up the phone and turned towards us with a look of shock on her face.)

Sayori: “Guys, I think MC has been cheating on me! We have to do something about this!”
