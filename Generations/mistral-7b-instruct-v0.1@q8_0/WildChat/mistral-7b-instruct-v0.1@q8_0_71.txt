B.) Treatments are randomly assigned to subjects within each block.

In a randomized block design, subjects are grouped into blocks based on a predetermined characteristic, such as age-group. Within each block, treatments are randomly assigned to subjects, ensuring that any observed effects are due to the treatment and not to other factors, such as age-group. Therefore, option B is true for the randomized block design of the experiment.

To calculate this probability, we need to consider all possible outcomes of tossing the die repeatedly until blue lands faceup, and count the number of outcomes in which the player tosses the die at least 2 times.
Let's first consider the total number of possible outcomes. Since each face is equally likely to land face up, there are 8^n possible outcomes for n tosses of the die. In particular, there are 256 possible outcomes for two tosses of the die (since 8*8=64 and 64*64=4096).
Now let's count the number of outcomes in which the player tosses the die at least 2 times. These include:
- Tossing the die twice and getting blue on the second toss
- Tossing the die three times and getting blue on the third toss
- Tossing the die four times and getting blue on the fourth toss
There are 3 such outcomes, so there are 3 possible outcomes in which the player tosses the die at least 2 times.
Therefore, the probability that a player will toss the die at least 2 times before blue lands faceup is 3/256 = 0.0012 or about 0.12%.

Without knowing the specific problem, it is difficult to provide a detailed solution. However, I can give you an overview of some common statistical techniques that may be used to solve problems like the one described.

1. Descriptive statistics: This method involves summarizing and describing data using measures such as mean, median, mode, range, variability, skewness, kurtosis, and graphical representations. It can help you understand the characteristics of your data and identify patterns or trends.
2. Hypothesis testing: This method is used to test a hypothesis (an educated guess) about a population parameter based on sample data. You will need to choose a significance level, determine the appropriate test statistic, and compare it to a critical value obtained from a distribution table. If the test statistic falls outside of the critical value range, you can reject the null hypothesis.
3. Regression analysis: This method is used to investigate the relationship between two or more variables. It can help you predict one variable based on another or determine how well two variables are related.
4. Analysis of variance (ANOVA): This method is used to compare group means and test for differences between groups. It can help you identify significant differences among different groups, such as differences in attitudes or behaviors.
5. Cluster analysis: This method involves grouping data points into clusters based on their similarities. It can help you identify patterns or structures within your data.
6. Factor analysis: This method involves identifying underlying factors (variables) that explain the observed variability in a set of variables. It can help you identify underlying causes of behavior or attitudes.
7. Survival analysis: This method is used to study the time until an event occurs, such as death or disease onset. It can help you understand the probability of surviving or developing a certain condition over a given period.

These are just a few examples of statistical techniques that may be useful in solving problems like the one described. The appropriate method will depend on the nature of your data and the research questions you want to address.
