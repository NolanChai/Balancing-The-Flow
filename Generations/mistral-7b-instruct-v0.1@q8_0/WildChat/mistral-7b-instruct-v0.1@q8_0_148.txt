Maggie was not your average nanny. She was a mischievous woman with magical abilities who loved to put children in their place. Her thickly diapered toddler boy, Timmy, loved her to bits, but she could be strict when the need arose.

Timmy was a cute but fussy child who would often test his nanny's limits. He would try to pull off his diaper and run around the nursery, or he would refuse to eat his vegetables. But no matter what, Maggie always had a solution.

One day, Timmy decided to take matters into his own hands. He grabbed a toy car from the corner of the nursery and started driving it down the hallway. Maggie was quick to respond and chased him down, swatting him with her paddle as she went.

"Now stop that, you little rascal!" she scolded. "You know better than to run around with a toy car."

Timmy blushed and felt more babyish than ever. He knew he had been wrong and apologized to his nanny. From that day on, he promised not to push his limits so much anymore.

Maggie was happy to see her little charge learn from his mistake. She continued to use her strict discipline and magical abilities to keep Timmy in line. Time-outs with his nose in the corner, swats to the seat of his diaper, and long sessions in his jolly jumper were all regular events in his life under her care.

The nursery walls were decorated with tittering decals that sang hypnotic nursery rhymes. Timmy loved these songs and would often sing them to himself while playing with his toys.

Despite the occasional tantrum, Timmy secretly craved his nanny's firm discipline. He knew she was doing what was best for him, and he loved her for it. Maggie was like a darker Mary Poppins, and Timmy was lucky to have such a wonderful and strict nanny by his side.
