I'm not aware of an "ISpyWithMyLittleEye" in Geometry Dash. It is possible that this may be a custom or user-made version of the game, and the specific editor layers used may vary depending on how it was created.

There are many ways to learn English as a second language, but the most effective way depends on your individual learning style and goals. Here are some general steps you can take:

1. Set goals: Determine why you want to learn English and what level of proficiency you want to reach. This will help you stay motivated and focused on your goals.
2. Choose a learning method: There are many options for learning English, including online courses, textbooks, language schools, or taking private lessons with an instructor. Choose the learning method that works best for you.
3. Practice regularly: The key to learning any new skill is to practice regularly. Set aside time each day to study and practice your English skills. You can use resources like podcasts, videos, or online games to improve your listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.
4. Immerse yourself in English: Look for opportunities to use English in your daily life, such as watching TV shows or movies, listening to music, or reading books written in English. This will help you become more familiar with the language and improve your understanding of its nuances and idioms.
5. Practice speaking: Speaking is one of the most important skills to develop when learning a new language. Try to practice speaking with native speakers as much as possible, either through online language exchange programs or by finding a language partner in your local community.

Remember that learning a new language takes time and effort, so be patient with yourself and don't give up if progress seems slow. With consistent practice and dedication, you can achieve your goals and become proficient in English.
