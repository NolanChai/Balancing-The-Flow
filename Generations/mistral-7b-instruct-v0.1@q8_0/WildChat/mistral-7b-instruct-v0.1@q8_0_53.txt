Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics, which governs the behavior of particles at very small scales, to perform calculations. In traditional computers, information is stored in bits, which can be either 0 or 1, but in quantum computers, information is stored in quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent a combination of 0 and 1 simultaneously. This allows quantum computers to perform certain types of calculations much faster than classical computers. For example, they are able to solve problems that would take a classical computer a very long time to solve.
