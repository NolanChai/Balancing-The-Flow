Mission Title: "Respectful Men"
Location: Las Venturas
Description: The player receives a call from Big Smoke, who wants to know if they are willing to take part in a deal involving some high-end vehicles. The location for the meet is at the Los Santos airport, but the catch is that the player must arrive by boat.

Once the player arrives at the airport, they will be met by a group of armed men who will escort them to a nearby dock. From there, they will board a private yacht and be taken to a secluded location in Las Venturas.

Upon arriving at the destination, the player will meet with Big Smoke, who introduces them to his new partner, Terry Crews. Terry is an ambitious businessman who wants to buy some of the player's high-end vehicles for his own collection. The player is initially hesitant, but Big Smoke convinces them that Terry is a respectful man who will treat them fairly.

The player is then shown around Terry's estate, which includes a massive garage filled with exotic cars. Terry explains that he wants to purchase some of the player's vehicles to add to his collection, and offers a substantial sum of money in exchange. The player is tempted by the offer but has concerns about dealing with someone they don't know well.

Terry then invites the player to join him for a ride in one of his cars. The player is initially wary, but as they drive around Las Venturas, Terry proves to be a respectful and courteous person. He shares stories about his past and his aspirations for the future, and the player begins to see him in a new light.

The mission ends with the player deciding to sell their vehicles to Terry. They return to the airport with Big Smoke and board the yacht once again. As they make their way back to Los Santos, the player reflects on their experience with Terry and realizes that he is indeed a respectful man. The player arrives back at the airport feeling satisfied with their decision to do business with Terry.
