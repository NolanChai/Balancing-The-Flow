The error message indicates that the installation of backend dependencies via pip subprocess is not running successfully and the exit code is 1. The problem might be caused by a system issue or some conflicts with other packages.

To solve this issue, you can try the following:

1. Updating pip to the latest version:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```
2. Uninstalling all previously installed packages and then reinstall them:
```
pip uninstall dotenv distribute
pip install dotenv=0.0.5 distribute
```
3. Using the `pip cache repair` command to fix any broken dependencies in your pip cache:
```bash
pip cache repair
```
4. Checking for any conflicting packages and resolving them using the `pip check` command or manually removing them if necessary.
5. If none of these steps work, you can try creating a new virtual environment and installing all required packages inside it:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Set up your environment variables using .env file
load_dotenv()

# Create a new virtual environment
os.system("python3 -m venv env")
os.chdir("env")
os.system("python3 -m pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt")
```
Remember to replace `requirements.txt` with the actual file name containing your project's dependencies.
