To optimize the given query, you can try the following suggestions:

1. Indexing: Make sure that you have indexes on the columns used in the WHERE clause or JOIN conditions to speed up the query execution time. Specifically, adding an index on the "meta\_product\_is\_active" column of the "catalog\_categoryproduct\_mv" table and the "url" column of the "catalog\_category" table can help improve the performance.
2. Filtering: Instead of using a subquery to filter the category\_categoryproduct\_mv table, you can include the filter condition in the JOIN clause directly. This will reduce the number of rows that need to be processed and make the query more efficient. For example:
```vbnet
SELECT 
    cat_url || separator || alt_url,
    (
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) AS "__count" 
        FROM 
            "catalog_categoryproduct_mv" 
            INNER JOIN "catalog_metaproduct" ON (
                "catalog_categoryproduct_mv"."meta_product_id" = "catalog_metaproduct"."id"
            ) 
            INNER JOIN "catalog_categoryproduct_mv" T4 ON (
                "catalog_metaproduct"."id" = T4."meta_product_id"
            ) 
        WHERE 
            ("catalog_categoryproduct_mv"."category_id" = (
                select id from catalog_category
                where url = cat_url
                and meta_product_is_active = true
            )
            AND T4."category_id" = (
                select id from catalog_category
                where url = alt_url
                and meta_product_is_active = true
            ))
    )
FROM alt_catalog
```
3. Caching: If the data does not change frequently, you can consider caching the results of this query to avoid repeating the same database operations every time the query is executed. There are many caching solutions available for different programming languages and databases that you can use to implement this.
4. Limiting the number of rows: If the result set is very large, you can consider adding a LIMIT clause to limit the number of rows returned by the query. This will reduce the amount of data that needs to be processed and improve performance. For example:
```bash
SELECT 
    cat_url || separator || alt_url,
    (
        SELECT 
            COUNT(*) AS "__count" 
        FROM 
            "catalog_categoryproduct_mv" 
            INNER JOIN "catalog_metaproduct" ON (
                "catalog_categoryproduct_mv"."meta_product_id" = "catalog_metaproduct"."id"
            ) 
            INNER JOIN "catalog_categoryproduct_mv" T4 ON (
                "catalog_metaproduct"."id" = T4."meta_product_id"
            ) 
        WHERE 
            ("catalog_categoryproduct_mv"."category_id" = (
                select id from catalog_category
                where url = cat_url
                and meta_product_is_active = true
            )
            AND T4."category_id" = (
                select id from catalog_category
                where url = alt_url
                and meta_product_is_active = true
            ))
    )
FROM alt_catalog
LIMIT 1000;  -- limit the number of rows to 1000
```
