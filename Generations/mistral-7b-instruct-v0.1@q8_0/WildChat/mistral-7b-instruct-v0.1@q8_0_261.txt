Once upon a time, there was a young woman named Paige Kwon-Broderick, who grew up in Seoul, South Korea. She was always curious about her father, as she had never seen him before. Her mother, Kwon Kyung-sook, had taken her and moved to San Francisco, California when Paige was just a teenager.

One day, while searching through old family photos, Paige came across a picture of herself with her father's last name on it. She knew that this must mean he was Jewish and Irish like her mother, but she also knew that he had a different name and possibly another family.

After some investigation, Paige discovered the truth: Matthew Broderick was indeed her father. Her mother had an affair with him while working as a waitress in New York in the 1990s. In order to avoid any scandals involving him, Kwon Kyung-sook left the US and moved back to South Korea.

Paige was shocked by this revelation but also curious about meeting her father. She decided to travel to New York to meet him at his apartment. When Matthew finally saw her, he was emotional because he had no idea that he had a daughter and had no relationship with her mother.

They spent the day getting to know each other and learning about their shared heritage. Matthew was amazed by Paige's Korean-American identity and how much he had missed out on knowing his daughter.

In the end, Paige and Matthew formed a close bond, and she learned that being mixed is not something to be ashamed of but rather something to embrace and celebrate. They both realized the importance of family and forgiveness, and they made a promise to always support each other in their journeys.
