The businesswoman woke up with a start, feeling disoriented and confused. She looked down at herself and was shocked to see that her ample breasts had been replaced by a flat chest. As she stared at the reflection in the mirror, she realized that she had also grown a male bulge and was now a femboy.
Feeling both terrified and intrigued, she pulled on a sundress that seemed to have appeared out of nowhere. She walked around her apartment, taking in the new version of herself. She couldn't help but feel a twinge of sadness as she realized that her rivalry with her female coworker had come at a great cost.
As she continued to explore this new form, she came across a note on her bedside table. It read: "I hope this helps us put our differences aside. Love, your rival." She couldn't believe what she was seeing. Her rival had employed a witch to change her appearance in an effort to end their longstanding hatred. And now, it seemed that they were going to be married.
As she looked down at herself once again, she couldn't help but feel a sense of attraction to her new self. She wondered if this was what it felt like to be a woman. But as she thought about it, she realized that being a man had given her the strength and confidence she needed to succeed in business. She wasn't sure if she could give up that part of herself.
As she walked out into the world dressed as a femboy, she couldn't help but feel a sense of curiosity and excitement. She knew that this was going to be a journey like no other, and she was eager to see where it would take her.
