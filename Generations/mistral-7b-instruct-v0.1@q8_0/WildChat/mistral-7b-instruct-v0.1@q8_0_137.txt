The Richter scale is a subjective measure of the magnitude of an earthquake. It is based on the amplitude of seismic waves observed at a specific location, but it does not take into account the actual energy released by the earthquake or its effects on the Earth's surface.

The Mercalli intensity scale is also subjective and is used to describe the severity of ground shaking caused by an earthquake. It is based on the effects experienced by people and structures, but it does not take into account the actual energy released by the earthquake or its physical properties.

On the other hand, the seismic moment scale is an objective measure of the energy released by an earthquake. It is calculated based on the area of the fault that ruptures and the average slip on the fault. This scale provides a quantitative measure of the amount of energy released by the earthquake.

The magnitude scale used in seismology, such as the moment magnitude scale (MMS), is also objective and is based on the energy released by the earthquake. It takes into account both the size and shape of the rupture and provides a quantitative measure of the energy released. However, like the Richter scale, it does not take into account the specific effects felt by people or structures in different locations.

Sure! Here are the most commonly used seismic scales, divided into objective and subjective scales:
Objective Scales:
1. Richter Scale - This is a logarithmic scale that measures the amplitude of seismic waves. The formula for the Richter Scale is: R = log10(A/A0), where A is the amplitude of the seismic wave and A0 is the reference amplitude (usually 0.01 m/s).
2. Mercalli Intensity Scale - This scale measures the intensity of seismic waves based on their effects on people and structures. The formula for the Mercalli Intensity Scale is: I = log10(A/A0) + 3.2, where A is the amplitude of the seismic wave and A0 is the reference amplitude (usually 1 m/s).
Subjective Scales:
1. Perceived Seismic Intensity Scale - This scale measures the intensity of seismic waves based on human perception. The formula for the Perceived Seismic Intensity Scale is not well-defined and can vary depending on individual experience and cultural background.
2. Shake Map Scales - These scales are used to visualize the seismic activity at a particular location. There are several shake map scales in use, including the Mercalli Shake Map (MSM), the California Earthquake Scale (CES), and the Moment Scale for Seismic Hazard Analysis (MASHA). These scales use different methods to calculate the magnitude of seismic waves, but they are generally based on objective measurements.
