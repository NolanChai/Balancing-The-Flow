It's possible that the Female Snow Golem was confused because her appearance had changed over time, and she didn't recognize herself. Alternatively, it could be a reference to the idea of time travel or alternate timelines, where the Snow Golem's appearance may have changed depending on what version of reality is being observed.

It's also worth noting that the Female Snow Golem's dress resembles the Snow Golem's body, but her sleeves are different from the sticks that the Snow Golem has for arms. This could suggest that the Female Snow Golem is a unique version of the Snow Golem with her own set of physical characteristics.

In any case, the appearance of the Female Snow Golem may be related to your desire for a new helper in some way, whether it's providing inspiration or motivation for you to create your own version of a helper character.
