Girl 1: "Hey, uh, how are you doing?"
Girl 2: "I'm fine, I think. Uh, what did you do today?"
Girl 1: "Oh, nothing much. Just went out for a walk and then I went to the store. But, um, I got really drunk."
Girl 2: "Uh, how long have you been drinking?"
Girl 1: "I don't know, maybe an hour or two. It's pretty good though, right? Uh, the alcohol makes me feel so happy and relaxed."
Girl 2: "I can see that. But, um, are you sure you should be drinking alone like this?"
Girl 1: "What do you mean? I'm not drunk or anything. Uh, I just had a few drinks with my friends. It's no big deal."
Girl 2: "Well, okay, if that's what you want to do. But, um, maybe you should slow down a bit and drink some water."
Girl 1: "Uh, water? What the hell is water? I don't know why I would want to drink anything except alcohol!"
Girl 2: "Okay, okay. If that's what you want. But, um, just be careful. Don't drink too much or you might regret it later."
Girl 1: "What do you mean 'regret it later'? I don't understand. Uh, this is the best feeling ever!"
Girl 2: "Okay, okay. If that's what you think. But, um, just remember to drink responsibly and be safe."
Girl 1: "Uh, okay. Thanks for the advice. Uh, I'm going to go to bed now and get some sleep. Good night!"
