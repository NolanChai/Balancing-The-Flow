It sounds like you are writing a story about a club of high school girls who discover that one of their members has been cheating on them with his own twin sister. The girls are upset and confront MC, the member in question, about what they've found out. They all agree to talk to him peacefully and calmly and try to understand why he did what he did. MC explains that his twin brother is going through a tough time and doesn't like socializing, and that he didn't want to betray his trust by telling anyone about the relationship. The girls are relieved to hear this and apologize for jumping to conclusions. They all agree that they've learned a valuable lesson about communication and not judging others too quickly.
