I always prioritize clear, accurate, and legible documentation of nursing information. I understand the importance of upholding patient confidentiality in accordance with the patient code of rights and privacy act guidelines. During my time on the unit, I frequently utilized software applications such as Medi-Map and Vcare for medication administration and documentation purposes. After each use, I carefully logged out from these platforms to protect patient confidentiality.

One day, while under the supervision of my preceptor, I conducted a blood sugar level check for a resident and administered the required insulin as per the instructions in Medi-Map. The blood sugar level was within normal limits after the procedure. I then recorded the details in the patient's electronic file with date and time, and obtained my preceptor's counter signature to ensure accuracy. This documentation will provide future reference and protect patient privacy.

In my clinical placement, I have consistently prioritized patient confidentiality by not disclosing their details outside of the clinical facility. When encountering situations where family members inquire about patients, I promptly pause the handover process to address their concerns before resuming the transfer of care. Additionally, during nursing handovers, I ensure that patient privacy is maintained by discontinuing endorsing when anyone enters the nurses' station and securely returning the handover sheet to a safe location within the station. Preserving patient confidentiality is crucial for providing quality care and maintaining trust between patients and healthcare providers.

During a recent interaction with a resident, I had the opportunity to explain the significance of taking Levodopa in her treatment regimen. I informed her that Levodopa plays a crucial role in replenishing her dopamine levels, which addresses and potentially alleviates the symptoms she experiences, such as tremors, stiffness, and slow movement. I also discussed the potential side effects of the medication and how it contributes to the improvement of her overall health condition.

To ensure that my explanation was comprehensive, I took the time to answer any questions the resident may have had about the medication. I explained that the medication works by blocking certain enzymes in the brain, allowing dopamine levels to increase and improve symptoms. I also emphasized the importance of taking the medication as ordered under the supervision of her preceptor.

The resident expressed her understanding of the information provided and thanked me for my explanation. I was glad that I could provide her with a clear understanding of her treatment and help her make an informed decision about her medication.

During my medication rounds, a patient refused to take all his morning medications. He was particularly agitated and non-compliant with food and medications. I decided to give him time and space to calm down. Later on, I explained the need for taking the medication on time, how it helps his conditions and the possible consequences if he did not take them. I understood that it was within his right to refuse medication, and this was informed to my preceptor. I documented his refusal to take his medication, handed it over to the next shift, and reminded them to update with the GP when he is available.
