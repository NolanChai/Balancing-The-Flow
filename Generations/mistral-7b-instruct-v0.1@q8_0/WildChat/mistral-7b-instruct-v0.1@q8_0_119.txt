"What are you doing here? I thought you were supposed to be at home with your baby," Collei asked Nilou, who looked disheveled and exhausted.

"I wanted to see how the performance was coming along," Nilou replied weakly.

As the team continued to investigate, they noticed a flashback of Nilou giving birth to Indigo. In the vision, Nilou was on stage, dancing gracefully as she gave birth to her daughter. But something went wrong - Indigo seemed to be crying and struggling to breathe.

"I didn't know what to do!" Nilou cried out in tears. "I thought I could handle it, but I couldn't."

Kaveh and Alhaitham quickly sprung into action, using their Dendro magic to soothe Indigo and help her breathe more easily. But as they worked, they realized that Nilou was still in labor.

"We need to get you to a hospital," Kaveh said sternly. "You can't be giving birth on stage like this."

Nilou nodded slowly, wiping away tears from her eyes. "I know. I'm sorry. I didn't mean for any of this to happen."

As the team helped Nilou and Indigo out of the theater, they couldn't help but feel a sense of relief that everything had turned out alright in the end. They knew that Nilou would have to take it easy for a while, but they were happy to see her smiling and holding her new daughter close.
