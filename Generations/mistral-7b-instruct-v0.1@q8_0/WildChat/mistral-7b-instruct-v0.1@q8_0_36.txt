Valefor: (worriedly) “Mindy, are you okay? What happened?”

Mindy: (still crying) “I heard your screech and decided to investigate. But as I was flying towards the source of the sound, I lost control and crashed here.”

Valefor: “Oh no! You’re injured?! I’ll take you inside and make sure everyone else is okay too.”

Mindy: (suddenly stops crying) “Wait a minute. What happened to you? Why were you screaming earlier?”

Valefor: “I was feeling sick and couldn’t wake up the others, so I tried using my power to screech. But then I accidentally hurt one of them.”

Mindy: (concerned) “What sickness are you experiencing?”

Valefor: “I don’t know. Ifrit said he sensed a disturbance in the ambient energy here. Maybe that’s what’s causing it.”

Mindy: “We need to get everyone together and figure out what’s going on. It could be contagious.”

Valefor: “Agreed. Let’s go back inside and see if we can find the others.”
