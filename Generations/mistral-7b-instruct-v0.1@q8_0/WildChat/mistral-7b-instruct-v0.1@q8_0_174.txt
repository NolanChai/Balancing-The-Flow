In essence, the Orientalist discourse is predicated upon a particular power dynamic that allows the West to construct and sustain reductionist representations of the East. By exercising control over the Orient's representation, the West positions itself as the observer, imbued with the authority to discipline by defining what the East is and is not. The "power/knowledge" nexus, which posits that the production, dissemination, and control of knowledge serve as primary agents of power, is reminiscent of the Panopticon, wherein the West becomes the observer, the bearer of the power-laden gaze, determining the Eastern identity, norms, morals, and interests. This gaze reifies "a grid of intelligibility that legitimates specific research as objective knowledge."
