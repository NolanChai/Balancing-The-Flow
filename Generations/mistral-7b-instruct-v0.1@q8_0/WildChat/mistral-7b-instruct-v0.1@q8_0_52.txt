It is possible that "Demon Slayer" faced criticism over Tanjiro's hanafuda earrings due to the heightened sensitivity surrounding Japan's history with imperialism and colonialism. The Rising Sun flag, also known as the Nissh≈çki, was used by the Japanese government during the Meiji Restoration, a time of significant cultural and economic change in Japan. While it may have been an intentional design choice on the part of the author and illustrators of "Demon Slayer," some viewers may have found it to be disrespectful or offensive.

On the other hand, "Golden Kamuy" may have been able to avoid controversy despite its use of the Rising Sun flag due to a few factors. Firstly, the series takes place during the late 19th century, a time when Japan was still a relatively isolated and homogenous society. The use of the flag may have been seen as less politically charged in this context. Additionally, the show's focus on themes such as survival, camaraderie, and redemption may have helped to mitigate any potential negative reactions to the use of the flag.

Yes, you are correct. "Golden Kamuy" also portrays Japan's colonization of Sakhalin as a positive development for Japanese characters and a negative one for Russian ones, while the Russo-Japanese war is depicted in a favorable way towards Japan.

The lack of controversy surrounding this plot point may be due to several factors. Firstly, the story is set during a time when Japan had already established its dominance over much of Asia, and its colonization of Sakhalin was seen as a necessary step for maintaining its power. Secondly, the series focuses on a small group of characters who are more concerned with their personal lives than politics, which may have contributed to a lack of attention given to this issue.

However, it is worth noting that the portrayal of Japan's occupation in "Golden Kamuy" has been criticized by some fans for perpetuating historical revisionism and whitewashing Japan's role in colonizing Asia.
