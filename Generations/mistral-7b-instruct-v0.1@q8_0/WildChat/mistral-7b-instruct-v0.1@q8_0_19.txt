To estimate the number of chocolate chips in the bag, we need to divide the total mass of chocolate chips and the bag by the mass of one chocolate chip. 
We know that the total mass of chocolate chips and the bag is 2041 grams, and the mass of one chocolate chip is 31 grams. So, we can set up the equation:
(Mass of Chocolate Chips + Mass of Bag) / Mass of Chocolate Chip = Number of Chocolate Chips
(2041 g + 67 g) / 31 g = 65.48
We round to one decimal place, giving us an estimated number of chocolate chips in the bag of 65.

To find out how many crackers are in the box, we need to subtract the mass of the box from the total mass of the crackers and box. 
924 grams (total mass) - 328 grams (mass of box) = 616 grams (mass of crackers) 
Now, we can use the mass of one cracker to find out how many are in the box. We know that the mass of one cracker is 24 grams. 
616 grams (mass of crackers) / 24 grams (mass of one cracker) = 26.5 
However, since we cannot have a fraction of a cracker, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are approximately 27 crackers in the box.
