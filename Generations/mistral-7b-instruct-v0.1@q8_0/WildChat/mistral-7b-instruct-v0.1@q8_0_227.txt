(Suddenly, Sayori's water breaks and we rush out of the hospital to find Monika waiting for us at the entrance.)

Monika: “I can’t believe it! Sayori, you’ve given birth!”

Sayori: “I know! I couldn’t wait any longer. Our daughter is here!”

(We hug and congratulate each other before rushing back inside to see our newborn daughter.)

MC: “She’s so small and fragile…” (picking up my daughter)

Natsuki: “I can’t believe I’m an aunt!” (smiling at the baby)

Yuri: “Welcome to the world, little one.” (kissing the baby)

(As we admire our daughter, Sayori looks over at me and grins.)

Sayori: “Thank you for bringing us together, MC. I’m glad we have this family now.”

MC: “I couldn’t agree more, Sayori. We’re going to make the best memories with our daughter together.” (smiling back at Sayori)
