As the girls continue to search for their missing friend, Monika's expression changes from concern to fear. She begins to panic and breaks out into a hysterical fit.

Sayori: (trying to calm her down) "Monika! It’s okay! We just need to keep looking for Yuri!"

Natsuki: (also trying to calm Monika) “Yeah, we’ll find her! Just take deep breaths and don’t worry.”

Despite their efforts, the girls continue to search the entire house without finding any signs of Yuri. As they exit the house, they notice a note on the front porch that reads:

"I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Something came up and I had to leave suddenly. Please don’t worry about me, I’ll be back soon."

Monika: (teary-eyed) “Thank god…at least she’s okay.”

Sayori: (smiling) “I guess that's all we can ask for now. Let’s just go home and wait for her to come back.”

Natsuki: (nodding) “Yeah, let’s just go back to the clubroom and wait for Yuri to call us back.”
