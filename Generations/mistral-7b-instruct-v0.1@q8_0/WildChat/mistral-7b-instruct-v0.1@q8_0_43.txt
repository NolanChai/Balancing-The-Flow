To send a spoofed HTML email using C and SMTP, you can use the `mail()` function in C along with an SMTP server.

Here is an example of how you might use `mail()` to send a spoofed HTML email:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int main() {
    // Set up SMTP server information
    const char *smtp_host = "smtp.gmail.com";
    const int smtp_port = 587;
    const char *username = "your-email@example.com";
    const char *password = "your-password";
    const char *from_address = "your-email@example.com";
    const char *to_address = "recipient@example.com";

    // Set up email message information
    const char *subject = "Spoofed HTML Email";
    const char *body = "<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>";

    // Set up socket and connect to SMTP server
    int sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
    memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr));
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(smtp_port);
    inet_pton(AF_INET, smtp_host, &server_addr.sin_addr);
    connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr *)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));

    // Set up authentication with SMTP server
    fprintf(stderr, "AUTH LOGIN\r\n");
    send(sockfd, username, strlen(username), 0);
    fprintf(stderr, "PASS %s\r\n", password);
    send(sockfd, password, strlen(password), 0);

    // Send email message to SMTP server
    char msg[512];
    snprintf(msg, sizeof(msg), "MAIL FROM: %s\r\nRCPT TO: %s\r\nDATA\r\n%s\r\n. ", from_address, to_address, body);
    send(sockfd, msg, strlen(msg), 0);

    // Close connection and exit
    close(sockfd);
    return 0;
}
```
Note that this code uses Gmail's SMTP server and requires you to have enabled "Allow less secure apps" in your Gmail account settings. It also sends the email message as plain text, so it will not be formatted as an HTML email. If you want the email to be formatted as an HTML email, you can use the `sendmail()` function instead of `mail()`.

It's important to note that any type of testing, whether it's for a school or job application, personal growth, or just curiosity, should be conducted in an honest and ethical way. Here are some tips to help you prepare for your test:

1. Determine the purpose of the test: Knowing the purpose of the test can give you an idea of what to expect and how to approach it. If it's a school exam, you may need to review specific topics or concepts. If it's a job application, you may need to prepare for questions related to your qualifications and experience.
2. Create a study plan: Once you know the purpose of the test, create a study plan that fits your schedule. Allocate enough time to cover all the material, but don't cram too much. Make sure to take breaks and get enough sleep before the test.
3. Review and practice: Review the material thoroughly and practice answering questions or completing tasks related to the test. This will help you feel more confident and reduce anxiety.
4. Use a variety of resources: There are many resources available to help you prepare for a test, including textbooks, study guides, online quizzes, and practice exams. Use a variety of resources to get a well-rounded understanding of the material.
5. Stay positive: Testing can be stressful, but try to stay positive and focused on the task at hand. Remember that tests are just one part of your performance, and they don't define you entirely.

Overall, the key to preparing for a test is to approach it in a thoughtful and ethical way, while also maintaining a positive attitude and staying organized and diligent in your preparation efforts.

It is possible to detect a spoofed email by analyzing the following:

1. Sender Address: Verify the sender's email address, as it may be a fake or misspelled version of the legitimate sender's email address. Check the domain name as well, as it could be similar but not identical to the real sender's domain.
2. Subject Line: Analyze the subject line for any signs of spoofing, such as inconsistent formatting or unusual phrasing.
3. Email Body: Scan the email body for any suspicious content, such as links to malicious websites, unusual attachments, or requests for sensitive information.
4. URLs: Check the URLs in the email for typos, as they may be redirecting you to a malicious website that looks legitimate but is actually designed to steal information or harm your computer.
5. Email Headers: Examine the email headers for any inconsistencies or unusual details, such as sender location or time zone differences.
6. Attachments: Scan the attachments for any suspicious files or file types that may be malicious in nature.
7. Language and Grammar: Check the language and grammar of the email for any errors, as they could be indicative of a spoofed email sent by an unskilled sender.
8. Reply-To Address: Verify the reply-to address, as it may also be fake or misspelled.
9. Spam Filters: If the email is flagged by your spam filter, it could indicate that it was likely a spoofed email. However, this is not foolproof and some legitimate emails may also be flagged by spam filters.

It's important to note that no single method can guarantee that an email is legitimate, but by analyzing these factors, you can reduce the likelihood of falling victim to a spoofed email.
