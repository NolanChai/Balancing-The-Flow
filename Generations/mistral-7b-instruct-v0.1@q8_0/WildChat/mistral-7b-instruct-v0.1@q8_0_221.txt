Yuri: "I'll play too!" She said with a grin. "But if I have to dare someone, it better not be you, Monika." 

Natsuki: "Hmm... I might join in as well. But only if it's truth." She crossed her arms tightly across her chest.

Kai Sakura: "Oh my gosh, guys! I can't wait to see what kind of dares you all come up with!" She clapped her hands together excitedly.

Emiya-senpai: “I’ll also participate.” He said calmly as he leaned against the wall. “However, if I must choose between truth and dare, I would prefer truth.” His expression remained neutral despite his words.

MC finally arrived and everyone stood up to greet her. Monika hugged her tightly while Sayori waved at her from across the room. Natsuki gave MC a cold nod before turning away. Emiya-senpai bowed respectfully. Yuri giggled as she saw his serious demeanor contrasting with his playful personality.

After some small talk, they began playing Truth or Dare. The game lasted for hours, each person taking turns coming up with creative and sometimes embarrassing dares. At one point, Monika dared Sayori to sing a song about her love for Sachiko. Sayori happily accepted the challenge and belted out a heartfelt ballad about their friendship.

As the night went on, tensions began to rise between Natsuki and MC. Several times, Natsuki refused to answer truth questions, insisting that they were too personal or invasive. MC grew increasingly frustrated but tried not to show it in front of the others.

Eventually, MC decided to end the game and call it a night. As everyone packed up their things, Yuri approached Monika hesitantly.

Yuri: “Monika…can I ask you something?” She asked softly.

Monika looked at her curiously. Yuri took a deep breath before continuing.

Yuri: “Why did Natsuki refuse to play Truth or Dare? It seemed like she was holding back.”

Monika sighed deeply.

Monika: “I don’t know, Yuri. She’s always been a bit guarded. I think it has something to do with her past.”

Yuri nodded thoughtfully. She knew that Natsuki had experienced some traumatic events in the past, but she had never asked for details. Maybe now was the time.

As the others left the clubroom, Yuri lingered behind, determined to get answers from Monika.
