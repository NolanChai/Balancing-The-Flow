ScoAR is a new business model that combines the concept of "social commerce" with the idea of "renting." In this model, individuals rent out items or services that they have to offer on a social platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or LinkedIn. For example, a person might rent out their car for an hour or a day to someone in need of transportation. They could also rent out their skills, such as photography, tutoring, or design work, to individuals who are looking to hire a freelancer.

The advantage of ScoAR is that it allows individuals to earn extra income by leveraging the social connections they have on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. It also provides an opportunity for people who may not have access to traditional employment opportunities to make money. Additionally, ScoAR can help promote community building and trust among users, as people are more likely to use services or rent items from someone they know and trust.

Overall, ScoAR represents a new way of thinking about how individuals can earn money in the gig economy, while also leveraging social connections to build a sense of community and trust among users.

Your strength is subjective and can vary depending on what you consider to be a strength. Some people might consider physical strength, while others might consider emotional or intellectual strength. What do you think your strength is?

Some common interview questions that may help to assess an individual's strengths and weaknesses include:

Strengths:

* Can you give an example of a task or skill for which you feel confident in your ability?
* What are some skills that you have developed over time, and how have they helped you in your work or personal life?
* How do you handle challenges or problems that arise when working on a project?

Weaknesses:

* Can you identify an area where you struggle with difficulty, and what steps have you taken to improve in this area?
* What are some areas in which you may not have as much experience as others, and how do you compensate for this when working on a team or taking on new tasks?
* How do you handle criticism or constructive feedback about your work?

A good internal auditor should possess the following strengths:

1. Strong analytical skills: They should have a keen eye for detail and be able to identify areas of weakness in processes and controls.
2. Communication skills: They must be able to communicate their findings effectively to management and staff members.
3. Attention to detail: Internal auditors must be meticulous when reviewing financial records, processes, and policies to ensure accuracy and compliance.
4. Adaptability: They should be able to adapt to changing business needs and adjust their approach accordingly.
5. Problem-solving skills: They need to be able to identify problems, analyze them, and propose solutions.
6. Professionalism: A good internal auditor must maintain a high level of professionalism and ethics in all their work.
7. Project management skills: They should be able to manage projects effectively, plan and execute audits, and manage resources efficiently.
8. Knowledge of accounting and finance: They should have a strong understanding of accounting principles, financial reporting standards, and audit procedures.
9. Ability to work independently: Good internal auditors must be self-motivated and able to work independently or as part of a team.

Internal audit weaknesses can be attributed to a variety of factors, including:

1. Inadequate training and experience: An inexperienced or undertrained internal auditor may not have the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively conduct an audit.
2. Lack of resources: A lack of budget, staffing, or equipment can limit the scope and effectiveness of an internal audit function.
3. Insufficient independence: An internal auditor who is too closely tied to the organization's management team may be less likely to identify potential weaknesses or areas for improvement.
4. Outdated processes: If internal audit procedures are not updated regularly, they may become outdated and ineffective.
5. Focus on compliance rather than risk: An internal auditor who is focused solely on ensuring compliance with regulations and standards may overlook potential risks that could impact the organization's operations or financial performance.
6. Limited scope: Internal audit functions may have a limited scope or focus, which can limit their ability to identify potential weaknesses or areas for improvement.
7. Ineffective communication: An internal auditor who is unable to effectively communicate with stakeholders, including management and staff, may not be able to effectively conduct an audit or identify potential weaknesses.
