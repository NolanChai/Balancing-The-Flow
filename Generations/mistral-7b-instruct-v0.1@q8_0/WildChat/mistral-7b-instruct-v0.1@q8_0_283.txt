Title: "The Little Wolf Dog's Chess Championship"

Summary:

One month after winning the G City Invitational Tournament, Charles emerged victorious and trended on social media for hours. On the day of his victory, William messaged Joseph on WeChat, commenting on how Rose could have easily won if she had participated in the competition. Joseph responded by questioning why Rose did not participate and accused William of being a meddlesome mother-in-law. However, to his surprise, William replied that Rose was not feeling well lately, so they replaced her.

On August 10th, it was Rose's birthday, and Karen came by early in the morning to celebrate with her. As they went grocery shopping at a supermarket near Rose's apartment, they bumped into William. Feeling awkward, Rose blushed and nodded in response to his question about school being out.

William had always been friendly with Rose and had called her "a sweet and sticky little darling" all her life. However, Joseph could no longer bear to hear it and told William to stop saying it. William ruffled Rose's hair, smiled, and invited her to come over if she got bored later. He promised to cook her favorite crab tofu. Karen, who was annoyed by William's actions, pulled Rose away and gave him a cold stare.

When they arrived at Karen's parents' home, Rose felt nervous as they stared at her intently. Karen assured her that their home could be considered her own and introduced her to her parents, Xu Mama and Father Xu. However, Rose felt uncomfortable as the couple surrounded her, despite Xu Mama trying to appear friendly by offering her some fruit from the fruit bowl.

Karen then intervened, turning on the TV to distract the couple. She mentioned how she often talked about Rose to her parents and how fond they were of her. Xu Mama chimed in, saying that they loved to talk to kids. They eventually settled on watching a cartoon, but Rose felt out of touch with the modern world, living a life that seemed incompatible with those around her.

Father Xu questioned why Rose had left the Mason family to go to Japan, and Rose instinctively stood up to leave. Karen urged them to hold off, afraid of giving away too much information. Father Xu's frustration peaked as he yelled that they must wait for him to die before they could reveal the truth.

Rose was frightened by the outburst and quickly fled the scene, not even bothering to tie her shoelaces. She selected the 29th floor in William's apartment building, despite her unease about Joseph. As she waited anxiously for someone to answer the doorbell, Rose felt some peace of mind being near William, who she believed was Joseph's subordinate.
