The name "Hermanubis" is attested once outside of Egypt, on an inscription from Dion in Macedonia dated to the imperial period (22). The form of the name there, Ἑרمα-νούβιοϲ, is not known from Egypt. It is believed that this form is related to a cult of Hermanubis attested in Thessaloniki, which was set up by a cultic association of Hermanubis on behalf of certain individuals. Additionally, a statue of the god from the Sarapeum of Carthage suggests that the cult enjoyed some popularity outside its original home in the Roman period.
