True. The USDA has jurisdiction over plant pathogens and pests, so it is responsible for investigating genetically engineered crops that involve transgenes or genetic elements derived from plant pathogens. The agrobacterium method used for delivering transgenes relies on a bacterium that can transfer DNA between plants.

False. While the USDA does regulate certain aspects of genetically engineered crops, it is not solely responsible for their investigation. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also has jurisdiction over certain aspects of genetically modified organisms, including food safety. Additionally, other regulatory bodies such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) may also be involved in the regulation of genetically engineered crops depending on their potential impact on the environment.
