The seismic scale is a standardized logarithmic scale used to quantify the intensity of earthquakes. It uses whole numbers, with each unit representing a 10-fold increase in amplitude of the seismic waves produced by an earthquake. The most commonly used scales are the Richter scale and the Mercalli scale, both of which have been standardized globally.

The magnitude scale, on the other hand, is also used to quantify the intensity of earthquakes but uses a different unit. Instead of whole numbers, it uses the logarithmic scale with base 10, meaning each unit represents a 10-fold increase in amplitude of the seismic waves produced by an earthquake. The most commonly used magnitude scales are the Richter scale and the Mercalli scale.

Both scales are objective, as they are based on standardized measurements and calculations that can be replicated by anyone with access to the necessary instruments. However, it is important to note that there may be some differences in how these scales are applied in practice, particularly when comparing earthquakes of different sizes or measuring their effects in different regions.

Subjective Seismic Scales:

1. Mercalli Scale - This is a simple numerical scale that assigns a value to the perceived intensity of an earthquake based on various physical effects observed during or after an event. The scale ranges from 0 (no effects) to 9 (catastrophic effects). It was developed by Harry Fielding Reid in 1938.

Formula:
MS = I + Ln(A/a) + Ln(P/p) + W

Where:
MS = Mercalli Scale value
I = Intensity index (0-5)
A = Amplitude of the ground shaking (in meters)
a = Characteristic acceleration (0.032 m/s^2)
P = Peak ground acceleration (in m/s^2)
p = Characteristic peak ground acceleration (0.2 m/s^2)
W = Wavelength of the seismic wave (in meters)

1. Richter Scale - This is a logarithmic scale that measures the amplitude of seismic waves and assigns a value to each event based on the ratio of amplitudes. It was developed by Charles Richter in 1935.

Formula:
R = ln(A2/A1) + B

Where:
R = Richter Scale value
A1 = Amplitude of the preceding seismic event (in meters per second)
A2 = Amplitude of the current seismic event (in meters per second)
B = Offset value (a constant used to account for differences in recording equipment and other factors)

Objective Seismic Scales:

1. moment magnitude scale (Mw) - This is a measure of the size of an earthquake based on the energy released during the event. It was introduced by Harry Fielding Reid in 1938.

Formula:
Mw = log10(Mo)

Where:
Mw = moment magnitude scale value
Mo = Moment of the earthquake (in Nm)

1. Mercalli intensity index (MI) - This is a measure of the perceived intensity of an earthquake based on various physical effects observed during or after an event. The scale ranges from 0 (no effects) to 9 (catastrophic effects). It was developed by Harry Fielding Reid in 1938.

Formula:
MI = I + Ln(A/a) + Ln(P/p) + W

Where:
MI = Mercalli intensity index value
I = Intensity index (0-5)
A = Amplitude of the ground shaking (in meters)
a = Characteristic acceleration (0.032 m/s^2)
P = Peak ground acceleration (in m/s^2)
p = Characteristic peak ground acceleration (0.2 m/s^2)
W = Wavelength of the seismic wave (in meters)
