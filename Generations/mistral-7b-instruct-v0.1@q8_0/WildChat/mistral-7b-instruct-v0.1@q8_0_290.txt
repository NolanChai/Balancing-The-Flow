Natsuki: "I can't believe MC is really gone. He was such an important part of our group."

Monika: "Yes, he was. But I think it's time for us to move on and remember the good times we had with him."

Yuri: "I agree. We should focus on being there for each other and supporting each other through this difficult time."

Himari: "I'll miss MC so much. He was like a big brother to me."

Kohana: "He always looked out for me too. I'm glad he's in a better place now."

(The girls all nodded in agreement and shared some memories of MC that they cherished.)

Sayori: “I just want to say thank you, all of you. For being there for me during this difficult time. And for always remembering MC too.”

Monika: "Of course, Sayori. We're here for you. And we'll never forget MC.”

Yuri: "We'll make sure that his legacy lives on through us, okay?"

Natsuki: “Yes, we will."

(The girls all hugged and cried together as they mourned the loss of their dear friend.)
