Freedom Planet and Naruto are two popular anime series. In this scene, Naruto is singing a heartfelt song about his feelings of pain and sadness, which is symbolized by the song's ending. As the song ends, Kurama speaks up and asks what Naruto has to say.

Naruto responds with a soft smile on his face, indicating that he feels relieved and happy now that his emotions have been released through the song. The whole restaurant starts clapping when the song ends, and some people think that Naruto is crying, but he is actually smiling.

It seems that in this scene, freedom and happiness are linked together, as Naruto is able to express his feelings of sadness and release them through music, ultimately leading to a feeling of freedom and joy.
