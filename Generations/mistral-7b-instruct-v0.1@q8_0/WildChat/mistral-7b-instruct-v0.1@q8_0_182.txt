James, the player character in the Streets of Rage style game, finds himself at the Night Club as his next mission. The level consists of waves of enemies that he must defeat to progress.

The first wave includes Bouncers, with possible names of Tommy, Vincent, and Doug. James starts off by using his punches to attack them. Tommy uses a Haymaker to knock James back, but James quickly recovers and hits him with a Shoulder Tackle, sending him flying out of the ring. Vincent uses a Bodyslam to take James down, but James is able to get up just in time to dodge a Shoulder Tackle from Doug. James then lands a Bodyslam of his own, knocking Doug out cold.

The second wave includes Pole Dancers, with possible names of Scarlet, Jessica, and Nicole. James uses his kicks to take them down, starting with a Spinning Kick that sends Scarlet flying across the ring. He then hits Jessica with a Headscissor Takedown, taking her out of the fight. Finally, he lands a Headscissor Choke on Nicole, choking her until she taps out.

The third wave includes Strippers, with possible names of Destiny, Nicky, and Alexia. James uses his hip attacks to take them down, starting with a Hip Attack that sends Destiny flying across the ring. He then hits Nicky with a Straddle Takedown, taking her out of the fight. Finally, he lands a Bodyscissor Choke on Alexia, choking her until she taps out.

The boss at full life is Club Owner Christiano Valentino, who uses a 3 Punch Combo to take James down. James uses his punches to dodge the first two punches, but falls to the ground after the third punch hits him. He gets back up just in time to dodge a Shoulder Throw from Christiano, but is then hit with a Handgun Shot that knocks him out.

At 50% life, Twin Secretaries named Ying and Yang join the fight. James uses his punches to take them down, starting with a Jumping Kick that sends Ying flying across the ring. He then hits Yang with a Triangle Choke, taking her out of the fight.

After defeating the twin secretaries, James is able to take down Christiano with a well-timed punch, ending the level and moving on to his next mission.
