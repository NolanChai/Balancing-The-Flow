False. Investigation of genetically engineered crops was not initially the responsibility of the USDA, but rather the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA has jurisdiction over the environmental risks associated with genetically engineered crops and has been responsible for reviewing their safety before they are allowed for commercial use in the United States. The USDA's role is primarily to regulate the interstate movement of live plants, including those that have been genetically modified.
