The thousand years refers to the time of prosperity and triumph of the Christian faith, during which the dragon is restrained. It is not intended to be taken literally as a specific number, but rather symbolically for a long period of time in God's eyesight. The idea of the thousand years was borrowed from Jewish tradition, where it was believed that the righteous would revive and never return to the dust during this time. John uses this tradition to describe the coming prosperity of the church, incorporating it into his description of the end times in the book of Revelation.
