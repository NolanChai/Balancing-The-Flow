Here is some sample code in C# for creating a PowerPoint application:
```csharp
using Microsoft.Office.Interop.PowerPoint;

// Create a new instance of the PowerPoint application
Application powerPoint = new Application();

// Open a presentation
Presentation presentation = powerPoint.Presentations.Open("presentation.pptx");

// Get the active slide and set its title
Slide slide = presentation.Slides[1];
slide.Shapes["Title"].Text = "My Title";

// Save the changes to the presentation
presentation.Save();

// Close the PowerPoint application
powerPoint.Quit();
```
Note that this is just a simple example and you can use the PowerPoint object model to perform more advanced operations, such as adding shapes, charts, tables, and animations to your presentation.
