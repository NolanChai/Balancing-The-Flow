Sayori: “What? Why am I here? I don’t need a baby, I already have one.”

Nurse: “I’m sorry to tell you, but we had to induce labor for Kohana. She's giving birth, and the baby is in distress. And since you were with her during the ride over here, it’s possible that you could be a carrier of something that might harm the baby.”

Sayori: “What? How did this happen? What does that even mean?”

Nurse: “It means that your genetics could be a factor in the baby’s health. And since you’re already pregnant, we need to take steps to make sure that your baby is healthy too.”

Sayori: “I don’t understand. I didn’t do anything wrong. I don’t have any genetic conditions that I know of.”

Nurse: “I’m sorry, but this is something that we can’t take chances with. We need to make sure that you and your baby are both okay. And, Kohana needs you now more than ever.”

Sayori: “Okay… I guess I understand. But what does this mean for me?”

Nurse: “We’re going to need to do some genetic testing on you to see if there are any risks or anything that we should be aware of. And, once the baby is born, we’ll need to keep a close eye on him too. But, don’t worry, Sayori. You did nothing wrong, and we’ll do everything we can to make sure that your baby is healthy.”

Sayori: “Okay… I guess I just need to trust in the doctors and be strong for Kohana and her baby.”

Nurse: “That’s right. And remember, you have a support system here with all of us, as well as Kohana and her family. We’ll be here for you, every step of the way."
