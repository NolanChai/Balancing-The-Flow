Mindy: (rubbing her eyes) “Valefor, are you alright? I was so worried about you!”

Valefor: “I’m not feeling well, but it looks like I’m not the only one. You must have been caught in that screech.”

Mindy: (nodding) “Yeah, I fell off the ledge and landed here. I’m okay though, just a little shaken up.”

Valefor: “Let me help you get up. We should all be checked out by Ifrit.”

(Valefor helps Mindy to her feet and they both make their way back into the cavern.)

Ifrit: (surprised) “What happened out there, Valefor? Why is Mindy injured?”

Mindy: “I fell off a ledge while trying to catch myself after Valefor’s screech woke me up.”

Ifrit: (nodding) “Well, I should check her injuries. But first, we need to figure out what caused Valefor to feel sick.”

Bahamut: “I can sense a disturbance in the ambient energy here as well. It’s possible that someone or something is causing this affliction.”

Valefor: (nervously) “It could be me. Maybe I’m not who I thought I was.”

Ifrit: “Don’t be ridiculous, Valefor. You’re still the same aeon you’ve always been. It’s more likely that there’s some sort of magical or mystical force at play here.”

Mindy: (whispering) “Maybe it has something to do with the other aeons sleeping in the cavern. What if we’re being watched?”

Valefor: “That’s an interesting idea, Mindy. But why would someone or something watch us? And how could they hurt us?”

Bahamut: (pauses) “It’s possible that there is a dark force within the cavern that seeks to consume us all. Perhaps it’s feeding off of our energy and power.”

Ifrit: “That would explain why Valefor feels sick. But how do we stop this darkness? And what will happen to the others if they’re not awakened soon?”

Valefor: (determined) “We need to act quickly. Let’s all come together and use our powers to defeat this threat.”

(The aeons gather around each other, determined to face the darkness and protect themselves and their world.)
