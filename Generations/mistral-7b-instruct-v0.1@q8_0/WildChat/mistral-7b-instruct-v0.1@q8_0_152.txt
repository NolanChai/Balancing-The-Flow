August 10th was a special day for Rose as it was her birthday. Karen had planned to celebrate with her by going grocery shopping and then visiting her apartment. They took the elevator from Rose's underground garage to go to the supermarket. While in the lift, they bumped into William, who lived in the same neighborhood as Karen.

William greeted them warmly and asked about school being out for the day. He knew that Rose was a chess fan and offered to cook her favorite crab tofu if she got bored later. Karen seemed annoyed by William's actions but pulled Rose away from him and led her to her parents waiting outside their home.

Xu's parents welcomed Rose with open arms, but Rose felt uncomfortable as they surrounded her and looked at her intently. She tried to withdraw her hand when Xu's mother stuffed some fruit into it. Karen then intervened and sat next to Rose, distracting the couple by turning on the TV.

As Rose watched cartoons, she felt out of touch with the modern world. She was nineteen years old but spent most of her time playing chess, making Karen feel ashamed of her own discipline. Father Xu then asked about Rose's education and her age, causing Rose to become uneasy.

When Father Xu questioned why Rose left the Mason family to go to Japan, Rose felt uneasy and instinctively stood up to leave. Xu Mama tried to explain their intentions, but Karen urged them not to reveal too much information. Father Xu became frustrated and yelled at Rose, causing her to flee the scene.

Rose found herself lost in the vast neighborhood and turned to William's apartment for help. She rang the doorbell, but no one answered. She hesitated for a moment before deciding to enter the apartment on her own.

As she entered, she saw a messy living room filled with chessboards and books. She realized that this was William's home, not Joseph's subordinate's. Rose felt relieved and took a deep breath before walking back out into the hallway, unsure of what to do next.
