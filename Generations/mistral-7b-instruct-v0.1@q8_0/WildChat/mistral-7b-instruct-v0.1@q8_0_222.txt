The issue with the code is that the variable `$value_title` is not being set properly. It seems like you are trying to access the `title` element within the `url` element, but it is not a child element of the `url` element in the XML file structure.

In your code, the XML structure looks like this:
```xml
<urlset>
    <url>
        <loc>https://www.softonic.com/content/117201-812643/</loc>
        <news>
            <title>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</title>
        </news>
    </url>
    <!-- other urls -->
</urlset>
```
To access the `title` element, you need to access it directly from the parent node:
```php
$value_title = $latest_from_softonic->title[$i];
```
Also note that you are trying to access an array in your print\_r statement using the variable name `$value_title`. This is likely causing an error. You should use `print_r($latest_from_softonic)` instead.
