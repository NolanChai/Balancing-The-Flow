```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

# Initialize the WebDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path="C:\\PATH\\TO\\chromedriver.exe")

# Navigate to the URL of the webpage you want to interact with
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# Find the element using CSS selector
element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "//p[normalize-space()='Social Media Growth Hacker']")

# Click on the element
element.click()
```

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Set up the Selenium driver and navigate to the website
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
driver.get("https://example.com")

# Find the element using CSS selector and click on it
element = WebDriverWait(driver, 10).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.CSS_SELECTOR, "//p[normalize-space()='Social Media Growth Hacker']")))
element.click()
```

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://www.example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

social_media = soup.find('p', attrs={'class': 'normalize-space()':'Social Media Growth Hacker'})
print(social_media)
```
This code uses the requests library to get the HTML content of a website using its URL, and then uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML into an object that we can search. The `find()` method is called on this object with a search query (in this case, a regular expression) to find all the elements in the HTML that match the search criteria. The code will print out the first element it finds.

```python
# Use explicit wait with expected conditions to find XPath without waiting for clickability
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
import time

def get_xpath(element, timeout=10):
    WebDriverWait(driver, timeout).until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.XPATH, element)))
    return element.get_attribute("outerHTML")

# Example usage:
element = "//p[normalize-space()='Social Media Growth Hacker']"
xpath = get_xpath(element)
print(xpath)
```
Note that this code does not use `ElementToBeClickable` expected condition since we don't need to wait for the element to be clickable, we can directly find it using the `presence_of_element_located` method.

```css
.post-markdown .flex:last-child,
.post-markdown .flex:nth-of-type(-n + 2),
.post-markdown .flex-col:last-child,
.post-markdown .flex-col:nth-of-type(-n + 2),
.post-markdown .gap-4:last-child,
.post-markdown .gap-4:nth-of-type(-n + 2),
.post-markdown .text-th-primary-dark:last-child,
.post-markdown .text-th-primary-dark:nth-of-type(-n + 2),
.post-markdown .text-base:last-child,
.post-markdown .text-base:nth-of-type(-n + 2) {
    /* styles */
}
```

You can use the `requests` library to send an HTTP POST request in Python. Here's an example:
```python
import requests

url = 'https://example.com/api/data'
data = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
response = requests.post(url, json=data)

print(response.text)
print(response.status_code)
```
In this example, we first import the `requests` library, then define the URL and data we want to send in the POST request. We then use the `requests.post()` method to send the request, passing in the URL and data as arguments. The response is stored in the `response` variable, which we can print out along with the status code of the response.

Note that in this example, we are sending JSON data in the body of the POST request using the `json` parameter. If you want to send other types of data (such as form-data), you can use a different parameter for that data, depending on the library you're using.
