It was just another day on the streets of City 17, and Gordon Freeman was minding his own business. But little did he know that danger was lurking around every corner. As he walked through the abandoned city, he heard the sound of footsteps behind him. He turned around, expecting to find a fellow survivor, but instead he saw a group of Metrocops patrolling the streets.

Gordon knew that if they caught him, it would mean trouble for both himself and his mission to save the city from the alien invaders. He quickly hid behind a nearby building, but the Metrocops spotted him almost immediately. They started running towards him, guns drawn.

Gordon tried to run in the other direction, but his legs were shaking with fear. The Metrocops were closing in fast, and he knew that he wouldn't be able to outrun them for much longer. Just when it seemed like all was lost, a figure appeared from nowhere and started firing at the Metrocops.

It was Alyx, one of Gordon's allies in the fight against the alien invaders. She had been tracking the Metrocops for some time and saw that they were closing in on Gordon. She quickly swooped in and took down several of the Metrocops with her rifle, buying Gordon enough time to escape.

Gordon was grateful to Alyx for saving his life and thanked her profusely before they continued their mission to save the city. He knew that he couldn't have survived without her help and was glad to have such a skilled ally on his side. Together, they were determined to stop the alien invasion and restore peace to City 17.
