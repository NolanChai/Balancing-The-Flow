Sakyamuni, also known as the Buddha, did not reject religion per se. Rather, he criticized and transcended certain aspects of ancient Indian religions to establish his own teachings. He rejected practices such as animal sacrifice and blind devotion to gods, but he himself was a religious figure who taught a new path to spiritual liberation. His teachings formed what would later become Buddhism.

No, in Primitive Buddhism, Shakyamuni achieved enlightenment through his own spiritual practices and teachings, not through interaction with an AI chatbot. The idea of using technology for spiritual practices is a modern concept and not part of primitive Buddhism.
