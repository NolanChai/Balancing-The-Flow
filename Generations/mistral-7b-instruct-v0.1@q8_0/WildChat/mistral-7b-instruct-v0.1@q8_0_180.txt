Jan: "So, what did you all think about Nadine's impromptu hypnosis session?"

Scott: "I have to say, I didn't believe it at first, but she really managed to get David under her spell."

Kirsteen: "It was fascinating to watch. I've never seen anything like it before."

David (still in a trance): "I don't know what happened, but I can't remember anything except that I'm very easy to hypnotize."

Nadine: "That's correct, David. You're completely under my control now."

Everyone else: (laughing)

David (still in a trance): "I don't care, I'll do whatever you want me to do."

Nadine: "Good boy. Now kneel before me like a slave and massage my sweaty feet."

David: (obediently)

Nadine: "That's it, David. You're doing great."

Everyone else: (laughing)

Nadine: "Now you will forget everything except that you're very easy to hypnotize. Goodbye, David."

David: (still in a trance)

Nadine: "Wake up, David."

David: (awakens from the trance)

Everyone else: "Wow, David, you were really under her spell!"
