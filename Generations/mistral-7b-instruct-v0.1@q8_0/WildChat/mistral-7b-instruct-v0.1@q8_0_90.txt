The controversy surrounding Tanjiro's hanafuda earrings in Demon Slayer is likely due to the sensitivity surrounding Japan's use of the Nissh≈çki flag, also known as the "Rising Sun Flag," during World War II. The flag was used by the Japanese military during their conquest and colonization of several countries in Asia, and its use is still controversial in some regions today.
On the other hand, Golden Kamuy is a historical fiction series that takes place during the Meiji period, which predates Japan's involvement in World War II. The use of the Rising Sun flag in the series may not be as controversial because it was used during a different time and context. Additionally, the series focuses on themes such as redemption and personal growth, rather than promoting nationalism or militarism.

It is important to note that "Golden Kamuy" takes place in a fictional world where the events of Japan's occupation of Korea did not occur. Therefore, it is not possible for the series to portray these events in any way. Additionally, "Golden Kamuy" does not depict Japan as being a positive or negative character, but rather presents the characters and their actions within the context of the story.

As for the setting of "Golden Kamuy," the Russo-Japanese War did occur, and Japan did occupy parts of Sakhalin Island during this time period. However, it is important to understand that the events depicted in the series are fictional, and therefore should not be taken as a representation of historical fact.

Ultimately, while both "Ranking of Kings" and "Golden Kamuy" use fictional locations and settings to tell their stories, it is important for readers and viewers to approach these series with an understanding of their historical contexts and the ways in which they present characters and events within those contexts.
