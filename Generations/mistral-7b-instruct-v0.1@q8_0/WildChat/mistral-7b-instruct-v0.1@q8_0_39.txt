Making a smoke bomb for use in a car event is not something that should be attempted without proper guidance and safety precautions. Smoke bombs can be dangerous if they are not used properly, and there are many risks involved in creating them.

Here are some general guidelines on how to make a smoke bomb:

1. Choose a base for your smoke bomb. This could be a plastic container or an aluminum can.
2. Cut the base in half and remove any sharp edges.
3. Fill the base with water.
4. Add a small amount of detergent and food coloring to the water. This will help the smoke bomb release smoke more evenly.
5. Add a small amount of baking soda and vinegar to the water. This will create a chemical reaction that produces the smoke.
6. Seal the base tightly.
7. Attach a string or wire to the top of the base.
8. Fill a plastic bottle with water and add a few drops of detergent and food coloring.
9. Screw the plastic bottle onto the top of the base, making sure it is securely fastened.
10. Add a small amount of baking soda to the bottom of the bottle.
11. Pour in some vinegar until the bottle is about three-quarters full.
12. Remove the string or wire from the top of the bottle and tie it to something secure, such as a tree branch or fence.
13. When you are ready to use the smoke bomb, simply pull on the string or wire and release the bottle. The chemical reaction in the bottle will cause the water to heat up and produce smoke.

It is important to note that this is just a general guide and there are many other factors that can affect the success of your smoke bomb. Additionally, it is never safe to use fireworks or explosives without proper training and expertise. If you are planning on using smoke bombs in a car event, it is always best to consult with a professional and follow all safety guidelines carefully.
