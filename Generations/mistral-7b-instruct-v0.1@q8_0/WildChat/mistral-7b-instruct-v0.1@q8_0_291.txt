'The meeting discusses the logistics for this and next week's IC meeting on CMS campaign and Capital Market Ideas. We're talking about the performance of SIS (4%+) and CMS (7%+). Some IC THs mentioned that other banks offered more attractive and higher deposit rates, nearly 6%, in order to grab more AUMs before the year end. Some clients are afraid of locking in current yield for long tenors. FCNs on UST remain popular choices.'
