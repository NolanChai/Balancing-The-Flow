Jane: "Andrea, what are you doing?"

Andrea: "I don't know, Jane. I got into a fight at school and now I'm being arrested."

Jane: "What? That can't be right! You didn't do anything wrong!"

Andrea: "I know, but the police believe me. They took me away to the station."

Jane: "Okay, don't worry. I'll come get you as soon as I can. Just stay calm and don't say anything until I tell you to."

Andrea: "Okay, Jane. Thank you for coming to get me."

Jane: "Of course. Don't worry, everything will work out in the end. I promise."
