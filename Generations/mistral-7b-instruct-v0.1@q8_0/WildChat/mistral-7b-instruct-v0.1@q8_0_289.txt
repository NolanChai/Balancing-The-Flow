Day 1:

Freedom Planet Girls and Naruto find themselves stranded on a desert island after their ship was wrecked by a rogue wave. As they explore the island, they realize that Naruto has lost his memory and can't remember who he is or why he's there. The girls are confused but decide to help him search for answers. They come across a strange device that appears to be a communicator, but it only works if Naruto remembers his code name. The girls try to jog his memory by asking him about his past adventures and battles, but nothing seems to work. As night falls, they build a fire and huddle together for warmth, wondering what the future holds for them on this deserted island.
