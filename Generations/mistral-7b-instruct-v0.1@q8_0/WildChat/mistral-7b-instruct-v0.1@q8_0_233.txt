Amatsumagatsuchi: "What is this place?"

Cupa: "It's a cavern. It's pretty cool, right?"

Vanessa: "Yeah, but why are you here? You don't look like you belong."

Amatsumagatsuchi: "I'm Amatsumagatsuchi, the elder dragon. I came to find a new home after my world was destroyed by Xyza."

Blazette: "Wait a minute, did you say 'elder dragon'? That sounds familiar."

Amatsumagatsuchi: "Yes, it's me. The one and only Amatsumagatsuchi."

Ayumi: (in pain) "I don't feel so good."

Amatsumagatsuchi: (noticing Ayumi's stomach) "What's wrong with you? Your stomach is swollen."

Cupa: "Yeah, she's been in a lot of pain lately. She doesn't know what's causing it, though."

Amatsumagatsuchi: (looking at Ayumi) "I see. And your clothes remind me of different creatures from my world - the Skeleton, the Creeper, the Cave Spider, the Enderman, and the Blaze."

Blazette: "Hey! That's right. You saw us when you first came down here. You must have been really confused."

Amatsumagatsuchi: (looking at Ayumi again) "Yes, but what is going on with your stomach? And why do I feel like I know you?"

Ayumi: (in pain) "I don't know. It's just been hurting a lot lately."

Amatsumagatsuchi: (putting his tail on Ayumi's forehead) "Hmm, let me see if I can help."

(After some time)

Amatsumagatsuchi: (looking at Ayumi) "I saw some flashbacks. They were confusing, but they showed you with a bow and arrows, and they also showed your stomach growing rapidly."

Ayumi: (in pain) "What does that mean?"

Amatsumagatsuchi: "It seems like there's something inside of you that's causing the growth. But I don't know what it is yet."

Cupa: "Wait, did you say 'something inside of her'? What do you mean by that?"

Amatsumagatsuchi: "I saw a hybrid of human and dragon in one of the flashbacks. It was inside of Ayumi. I don't know how or why, but it's definitely related to her stomach."

Vanessa: "What do we do now? We need to find out what this is and stop it!"

Amatsumagatsuchi: (nodding) "Yes, we must. Together, we will uncover the truth and save Ayumi from whatever is inside of her."
