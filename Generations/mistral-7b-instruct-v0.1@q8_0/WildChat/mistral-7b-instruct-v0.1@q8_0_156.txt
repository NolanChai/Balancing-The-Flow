Sayori: "Hey guys, how are you doing?"

Natsuki: "We're trying to plan a funeral for MC."

Himari: "But what should we say in his eulogy? He was such an amazing person."

Monika: "I think we should just say everything that comes to mind. We all loved him, and he was so dear to us."

Yuri: "Yeah, and maybe we can include some of his favorite quotes or songs too?"

Sayori: "That's a great idea, Yuri. I'll help you with that."

(The girls spent the next few hours gathering memories and stories about MC. They wrote down everything they wanted to say and decided to hold the funeral the following day.)
