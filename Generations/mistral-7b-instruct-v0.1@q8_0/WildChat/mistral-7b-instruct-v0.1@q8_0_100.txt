It is possible that the reddit post was not well received based on its punctuation score of 0 and low upvote rate. However, it is also possible that the post may have been removed or deleted, which would explain its lack of a punctuation score.

It's also important to note that a low upvote rate doesn't necessarily mean that the post was not well received. It could simply be due to a lack of engagement with the community or the topic being niche or controversial.

As for the number of comments, it is generally considered a positive sign when a post has a high number of comments. However, the quality and relevance of these comments are also important factors to consider.
