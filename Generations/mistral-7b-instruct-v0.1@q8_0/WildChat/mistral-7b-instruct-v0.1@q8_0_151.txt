"Sayori, how are you feeling today?" I asked as we sat in the dimly lit clubroom. As usual, she looked exhausted, but this time there was a glimmer of happiness in her eyes.

"I'm doing well," she said with a soft smile. "My little ones are growing so much."

I nodded understandingly. It was Sayori's first pregnancy and I knew how much this meant to her. She had always wanted children, but as a vampire, she didn't think it was possible until she met us.

"And how are your boys and girls doing?" Monika asked, looking over at the two small blobs that were floating in Sayori's womb on the screen in front of us.

"They're doing great," Sayori said proudly. "One is a boy and the other is a girl."

Yuri, who was sitting next to me, turned to look at the screen. "Wow," she said softly. "That's amazing!"

"Yeah, it really is," I agreed. It was hard not to feel excited for Sayori as she prepared for her first parenting experience.

As we continued our discussion, I couldn't help but think about how much our lives had changed since that fateful day when we met in the library. We had gone through so many ups and downs, so many twists and turns, but somehow, we were still here, together.

Sayori looked over at me and gave me a small nod. "Thanks," she said quietly.

I smiled back at her. "Anytime," I said. "We're in this together."
