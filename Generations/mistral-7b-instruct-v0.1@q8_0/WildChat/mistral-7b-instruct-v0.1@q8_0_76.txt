Jane: Hey guys, have you seen the new student in school?

Sam: Yeah, I saw her walking to class this morning. Her name's Julia Fairbanks.

Aaron Ling: Oh yeah! My sister Molly-Rose was talking about her last night. She says Julia is the daughter of the owner of Fairbanks's department store.

Jane: Yeah, I know her. She always comes to my dad's store and she's always calling her dad "daddy" instead of "dad". It's kind of weird.

Molly-Rose Ling: Oh my gosh! I saw Julia on TV in a commercial for Fairbanks's. I can't believe we have a celebrity in our school now!

Jane: Yeah, but she seems really confident when she's outside. I wonder if she's nervous inside.

Suddenly, an announcement over the PA system sounds.

Announcer: Attention, everyone! All students must report to the school auditorium immediately for an important announcement.

Everyone in the hall stands up and starts walking towards the auditorium. Jane, Sam, Aaron, and Molly-Rose all walk together.

As they enter the auditorium, Julia Fairbanks walks up onto the stage, accompanied by her father, Mr. Fairbanks.

Julia: Hello everyone! I'm Julia Fairbanks, and I'm so excited to be at this amazing school. My dad owns Fairbanks's department store, and I've always loved shopping there.

Mr. Fairbanks: Thank you, Julia. It's an honor to have my daughter here at this esteemed institution. And for those of you who may not know, Fairbanks's is the largest department store in town, with the best selection and prices you'll find anywhere.

Jane whispers to Sam: "I don't think she's being completely honest about her dad's store."

Sam: Yeah, I heard he's really pushy and demanding. He wants his store to be the biggest and the best, no matter what it takes.

As Mr. Fairbanks continues his speech, Jane can see that Julia is trying to hide her nervousness behind a confident facade. She's constantly fidgeting with her hair and clothes, and her eyes keep darting around the room.

Finally, the announcement ends and everyone starts clapping. Julia and her dad take their seats in the front row, while Jane, Sam, Aaron, and Molly-Rose sit in the back.

Jane: Wow, that was... intense. I don't think I've ever seen a more self-centered person in my life.

Sam: Yeah, it's like she thinks she's the only person who matters in this world. And her dad just enables her.

Aaron Ling: I heard that Mr. Fairbanks is really strict with his employees. He doesn't care about their feelings or opinions, as long as they do what he says.

Molly-Rose Ling: That's so sad. I hope Julia can find a way to break free from her dad's influence and see the world in a different light.

Jane nods in agreement. "Yeah, I really hope she does too. Because right now, she's living in a bubble of privilege and entitlement that's going to crash around her soon."
