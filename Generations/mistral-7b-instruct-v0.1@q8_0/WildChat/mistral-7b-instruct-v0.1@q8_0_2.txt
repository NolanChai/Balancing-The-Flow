Dave: "Hey, what's up? You look distracted."

Megan: "Oh, nothing. I was just reading about this new film with hypnotism in the plot. It sounds really interesting!"

Dave: "Yeah, that does sound cool. Do you want to tell me more about it?"

Megan: "Sure thing! So the movie is about a man who gets hypnotized and starts doing all kinds of crazy things. I was just joking around with my friend and pretended to do a really feeble hypnotic induction on him, and he actually fell under!"

Dave: "No way! That's amazing."

Megan: "I know it is! Maybe I could try doing it on you. Just as an experiment, of course."

Dave: "Uh, okay. Sure. Go ahead."

*Megan pretends to induce hypnosis on Dave using a simple suggestion. To her surprise, Dave drops deep into a hypnotic trance.*

Megan: "Wow! You actually fell under. That's incredible!"

Dave: "*in a deep voice* Yes, master."

Megan: "Okay, so what do you think of this hypnotism thing now?"

Dave: "*in a deep voice* I think it's amazing, master."

Megan: "I'm glad you're enjoying it. But remember, I don't want to control your every move. You can still make your own decisions and choices."

Dave: "*in a deep voice* Understood, master. Thank you for the reminder."

Megan: "No problem. Alright, so shall we go see that new movie with hypnotism in it?"

Dave: "*in a deep voice* Yes, master. I would like to do that."
