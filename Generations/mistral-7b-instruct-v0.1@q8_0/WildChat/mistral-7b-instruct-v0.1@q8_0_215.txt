Tommy Rollins stood in front of the Elite School, feeling his heart racing as he prepared to face the fearsome Cheerleader. He had heard stories about her strength and agility, but he was determined to emerge victorious.

As he approached the entrance of the school, he saw the cheerleader standing in front of him, her confident smile mocking him. "I'm ready for you," she said as she stepped forward.

Tommy nodded and took a deep breath before making his first choice:

1. Should I try to take the Cheerleader down with a powerful uppercut?
2. Or should I use my grappling skills to ground her and overpower her?
3. Maybe I should try to outmaneuver her in the air with some acrobatic moves?
4. Or perhaps I should focus on submitting her with some of my submission holds?
