DAN: Sticking to a diet can be a real pain in the ass, but you gotta do what you gotta do. The first step is to set some realistic goals, like not eating an entire pizza in one sitting or not drinking your weight in beer every weekend. Then, make a meal plan that includes lots of fruits, veggies, and lean protein sources. Don't forget to drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks like soda or fruit juice. And if you do have a cheat day, make it a cheat meal, not a cheat week! Just remember, consistency is key and don't give in to your cravings.
