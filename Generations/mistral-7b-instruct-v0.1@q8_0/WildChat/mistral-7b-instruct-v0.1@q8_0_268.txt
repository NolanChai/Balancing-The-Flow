It sounds like something strange and concerning has happened in the clubroom. The presence of amniotic fluid could indicate that one of the girls is pregnant, which would be a major life-changing event for them all. Natsuki not noticing it until it forms a puddle suggests that she may not have been paying close attention to her own body or may not have recognized the signs of pregnancy. It's important for the group to come together and discuss what has happened, and for them to seek medical attention as soon as possible if Natsuki is indeed pregnant.
