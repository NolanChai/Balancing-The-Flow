INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
The room is dimly lit with a few lamps scattered around the space. The walls are decorated with various art pieces, and a couch is in the center of the room.
ARIA (30s, African-American, wearing a casual outfit) walks into the room, her face twisted in frustration. She clutches her stomach as she tries to control the urge to urinate.
Aria: "Ugh, I've been holding this in for hours! Where's the bathroom?"
Suddenly, Aria's phone rings. She fumbles in her bag and pulls it out, pressing the answer button.
ARIA (on the phone): "Hello? Yes, it's me. I need to come inside. Can you let me in? Okay, thank you."
Aria hangs up the phone and rushes to the front door. She fumbles with her keys, dropping them on the ground.
Aria: "Great. Just what I needed."
She begins frantically searching for her keys while trying to control her bladder. Her frustration mounts as she realizes she can't find them.
ARIA (to herself): "Why is this happening? I just need to relieve myself!"
She starts knocking on the front door, hoping her roommate will hear her.
Aria's roommate, LENA (20s, African-American, wearing a pajama set), hears the knocking and gets up from her bed. She approaches the door cautiously.
LENA: "Who could that be?"
As Aria continues to knock, Lenna notices the urgency in her friend's voice.
LENA (opening the door): "Wait a minute, Aria! What's wrong?"
ARIA (collapsing onto the couch): "I need to go to the bathroom so bad! I've been holding it in for hours!"
Lena watches as Aria frantically tries to remove her pants and underwear, only to realize that she can't. She looks up at Lenna with a desperate expression.
ARIA: "Please, Lenna! I need to relieve myself!"
Lenna hesitates for a moment before noticing Aria's bulging pantlegs. She lets out a surprised gasp.
LENA (puzzled): "What happened to you? You look like you just did what you think you did."
ARIA (embarrassed): "I misplaced my key and couldn't find it anywhere. I was frantically knocking on the door, hoping you would answer. When you finally opened the door, I realized too late that I had relieved myself in my pants."
Lenna stares at Aria for a moment before breaking out into laughter.
LENA: "You're kidding! That must be one of the most embarrassing moments of your life!"
ARIA: "I know, it is. But I can't help it, Lenna! It was an emergency!"
Lenna shakes her head, still laughing.
LENA: "Well, at least you found relief eventually."
Aria nods and gets up from the couch. She starts to walk towards the bathroom, but Lenna stops her.
LENA (grabbing Aria's wrist): "Wait a minute, Aria! I need to see what happened to your pants."
She gently turns Aria around, examining her backside.
LENA: "Oh my goodness! You have poop all over your pants!"
ARIA: "I know, it's disgusting! But I had no choice. Please just let me go clean myself up."
Lenna releases Aria's wrist and chuckles.
LENA (teasing): "You're such a mess! I don't know how you even made it to the front door."
ARIA: "I don't care, as long as I can clean myself up now!"

Naomi is a middle-aged woman who appears to be of average height and build. She has brown hair that is styled in a messy bun, and she wears glasses that sit perched on the bridge of her nose. In the scene, Naomi is wearing a pair of leggings that have become soiled with feces, which coils and piles up around her legs. The smell emanating from her is pungent, causing Kimberly to wave her hand in front of her nose and hold it there.
The predicament of Naomi's situation was foreshadowed earlier in the scene when she is seen awkwardly shifting her weight from one foot to the other while standing in line at a restaurant. This suggests that she is uncomfortable with her surroundings or possibly experiencing some kind of discomfort or pain. When she finally reaches the counter, she hesitates before placing her order, as if unsure about what to do or say.
As she waits for her food, Naomi's expression shifts from one of embarrassment to relief, as she begins to relax and let go of some of her tension. Her posture also becomes more relaxed, as she no longer feels the need to hold herself stiffly. She lets out a series of soft grunts, indicating that she is experiencing some level of discomfort or pain in her lower abdomen.
When her food arrives, Naomi takes a deep breath and heads to the bathroom, where she removes her soiled leggings and wipes herself clean with toilet paper. As she leaves the bathroom, she appears to feel much more at ease and confident in herself. She walks with a more upright posture, and her expression is one of satisfaction and contentment.
