[As the player tries to lead the female snow golem to safety, they realize that the village is abandoned and deserted.]

[player]: "Wait, where are we supposed to go? There's no one here..."

Female Snow Golem: (panting) "Just keep walking. I'll try to make it."

[The player notices that the female snow golem is experiencing contractions, and they realize that they need to get her to a healer.]

[player]: "Hang in there. We're going to find you a healer."

[The player tries to lead the female snow golem to safety, but they come across a group of hostile trolls who are blocking their path.]

Troll 1: "Who do you think you're fooling? You can't just waltz into our tundra and take whatever you want!"

[The player tries to defend themselves and the female snow golem, but they are outnumbered and outmatched.]

Troll 2: "You should have thought of that before you tried to steal our precious resources!"

[As the player is being attacked by the trolls, they notice that the female snow golem has gone into labor.]

[player]: (screaming) "Oh no! She needs a healer!"

Troll 1: "What's it to you? This is our tundra, and we have the right to protect it!"

[The player tries to fight off the trolls while also trying to help the female snow golem give birth. Eventually, they are overwhelmed and defeated by the trolls.]

[As the player lies on the ground, gasping for breath, they hear the sound of a baby crying.]

[player]: (stumbling up) "What the heck?! Where's the baby?"

Female Snow Golem: (panting and smiling) "It's okay. I managed to give birth. Thank you for your help."

[The player is stunned by the sudden turn of events, but they are overjoyed that the female snow golem was able to give birth safely.]

[player]: (smiling) "Congratulations! You did it!"

Female Snow Golem: "Thank you. I'll be sure to keep an eye on this little one."

[The player and the female snow golem continue on their journey, with a newfound appreciation for the fragile nature of life in the harsh tundra environment.]
