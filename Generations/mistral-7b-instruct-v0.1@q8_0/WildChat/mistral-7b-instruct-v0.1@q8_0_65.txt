/imagine prompt: rugged mountain range, snow-capped peaks towering above lush valleys, a solitary hiker carrying a backpack and trekking poles, wandering through the cold and isolated landscape, surrounded by misty clouds and icy terrain, the sun setting behind the mountains, casting warm, golden light on the scene, captured by a Nikon D850 camera, 24-70mm lens, capturing the harsh beauty of nature, composition focused on the mountain range, reminiscent of a painting by Caspar David Friedrich. --ar 16:9 --v 5.2
