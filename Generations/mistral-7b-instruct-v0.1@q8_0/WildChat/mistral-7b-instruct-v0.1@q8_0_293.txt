No, "迅速盗贼潜伏瀑布上方" is not a good translation for "The Velociraptor stalks its prey above the waterfall." in Mandarin Chinese. 
A more accurate translation would be "鹞鸥在水falls附近的速度骚猎" (jiāng jiāng zài shuǐ fānxiàn de shùdè hěng). This translates to "Raptor hunting near the waterfall with speed."

You got the sentence right, but you used the wrong characters for "velociraptor." The correct translation would be 迅猛龍 ("velociraptor") in Mandarin.

As for "swift thief/robber" in Mandarin Chinese, it is a common way to translate the name of this extinct dinosaur in English, but it might not be the most accurate translation. Velociraptors were actually small theropods that lived during the late Cretaceous period. They were not known for their stealing or robbing behavior but rather for their hunting abilities and agility.

The Chinese phrase "迅猛龍在瀑布上方潜伏追踪猎物" is a better translation because it uses the correct name for the dinosaur and describes its hunting behavior accurately.

No, the sentence "迅猛狩獵為嬰兒龍" is not an accurate translation of "The Velociraptor hunts for baby Azhdarchids" in Mandarin Chinese. The correct translation would be "Velociraptors hunted young azhdarchids". 

The sentence you provided, which uses the word "狩獵" (hunt) and implies a single subject ("迅猛"), does not accurately convey the meaning of the original sentence. Additionally, the use of "龍" (dragon) in place of "azhdarchids" is incorrect.

No, "她是这些森林的頂級掠食者。" is not an appropriate translation for "She is the top predator of these forests." The correct translation would be "這些森林中的最高生物質量動物是這個女人" (zhè qǐng shēnwùjìng zhōngde zuìgāoshéngmǎnshì dàng yīrén).

The literal word-for-word translation of "單喙翼龍" (shíng bāng yìng lóng) in English is "single horned dragon with wings".

Yes, I can provide a literal morpheme-by-morpheme translation of a word from one language to another. However, this method may not always produce a natural or fluent translation. It is recommended to use context and the intended meaning of the word to create a more natural translation.
