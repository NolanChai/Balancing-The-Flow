Once upon a time, there was a group of friends who were avid fans of Power Rangers, TMNT, and My Hero Academia. They met one day and discovered that Zack Taylor/Black Ranger, Raphael/Raph, Michelangelo/Mikey, and Donatello/Donnie were all godlike beings with incredible powers and abilities.

Donnie had Superhuman Strength, Incredible Agility, Keen Senses, Immense Fighting Determination, God Transformation, Supreme Mode/Transformation, Berserker Physiology, Meta Ability Creation, One Hit Kill, Apotheosis Condition, and Unbeatable and Infinite Power Ranger Transformations.

Together, they used their powers to fight against the villains of My Hero Academia such as All For One, Tomura Shigaraki, Dabi, Himiko Toga, Twice, Stain, and Overhaul, and discovered that they were all godlike beings with incredible abilities.

As they continued to develop their powers and relationships, Zack, Mikey, Donnie, and Raph’s charming personalities and attractive appearances drew in the attention of other characters such as Ochaco Uraraka/Uravity (Zack’s Crush), Momo Yaoyorozu/Creati (Raph’s Crush), Tsuyu Asui/Froppy (Mikey’s Crush), and Mei Hatsume (Donnie’s Crush).

Through their journey together, they discovered the true extent of their powers and abilities, and found that there was no limit to what they could achieve. They became unstoppable, with no notable weaknesses or limitations to speak of. Their personalities and dynamics remained unique and distinct, but they all worked together seamlessly as a team.

And so, the group of friends continued to use their powers for good, protecting the innocent and fighting against evil, always pushing themselves to new heights and beyond their limits.

Title: The Silent Four

[INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]

RAPH (20s), MIKEY (20s), ZACK (21) and DONNIE (24) are sitting on the couch, watching a movie in silence. They have known each other since high school and have developed an unspoken bond based on their shared quiet and calm personalities.

RAPH: (leaning back on the couch) I can't believe it's been 5 years since we graduated. Time flies, huh?

MIKEY: (nodding) Yeah, it does. It feels like just yesterday we were cramming for finals and trying to figure out what we wanted to do with our lives.

ZACK: (smiling) I remember that. I was so stressed out, but looking back, it was a good time. We've all come a long way since then.

DONNIE: (in a quiet voice) Yeah, me too. I never thought I'd be where I am now.

The group falls silent as they continue to watch the movie. They don't need words to express their feelings or thoughts. Their shared experiences and unspoken bond have brought them closer together than any words ever could.

[INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER]

As the movie ends, the group turns off the TV and starts to clean up. Raph pulls out a trash bag from under the couch and hands it to Mikey.

RAPH: (smiling) You're up. I'll take care of the rest.

MIKEY: (grinning) Alright, thanks. You got it.

Zack and Donnie start to help out too, without any need for words. They all know what needs to be done and work together seamlessly.

DONNIE: (in a quiet voice) This is fun. We should do this more often.

RAPH: (nodding) Yeah, we should. It's nice to just spend time together without any distractions.

The group finishes cleaning up and sits back down on the couch, still in silence. They don't need words to enjoy each other's company or to express their gratitude for their friendship. Their quiet and calm demeanors have brought them closer than ever before.

[INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]

As they sit there, Mikey turns on the TV and starts to channel surf. Raph, Zack, and Donnie all look at the TV in silence, taking in the different channels. They don't need words to comment on what they see or to make jokes. Their shared experiences and unspoken bond have brought them closer than any words ever could.

MIKEY: (in a quiet voice) You guys think I should watch this?

RAPH: (nodding) Yeah, why not?

ZACK: (smiling) I'll join in too. It looks interesting.

Donnie doesn't respond, but he starts to watch the TV along with the others. They all watch in silence, taking in the different scenes and sounds on the screen.

DONNIE: (in a quiet voice) Wow, this is amazing. I never knew there were so many things to explore in the world.

RAPH: (smiling) Yeah, me too. It's great to learn new things.

The group continues to watch the TV in silence for a while, taking in the different scenes and sounds on the screen. They don't need words to
