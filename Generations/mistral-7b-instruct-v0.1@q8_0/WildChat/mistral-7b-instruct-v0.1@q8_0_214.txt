Necrohemoth: "What the hell? What happened?"

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Archeogiana, did someone just hit you?"

Archeogiana: "Ugh...I don't know. It felt like a sharp pain in my stomach."

Necrohemoth: "Could it have been the Sculk-elemental Blacksight? He's known for his unpredictable behavior."

Eye of Kingthulhu: "Archeogiana, we need to find out what happened before we can continue our exploration."

Necrohemoth: "I agree. Archeogiana, you okay?"

Archeogiana: "Yeah...I think so. It's just a lot of pain."
