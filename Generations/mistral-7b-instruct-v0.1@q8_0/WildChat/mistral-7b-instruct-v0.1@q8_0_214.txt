To calculate the amount of water formed from the reaction between oxygen gas and hydrogen gas, we need to know the molar mass of each gas. The molar mass of hydrogen gas is approximately 1 g/mol, while that of oxygen gas is approximately 32 g/mol.

Using the balanced equation 2H2 + 02 > 2H20, we can see that for every mole of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas involved in the reaction, one mole of water will be formed. Since there are 32 grams of oxygen gas and 32 grams of hydrogen gas in the reaction, this represents 16 moles of each gas (since 32 ÷ 1 = 32 and 32 ÷ 32 = 1).

Therefore, one mole of water will be formed for every 16 moles of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas involved in the reaction, resulting in a total of 16 moles of water.

To calculate the mass of this water, we multiply the number of moles by the molar mass of each molecule:

Mass of water = (Number of moles of H2O) × (Molar mass of H2O)
Mass of water = 16 × 18.015 g/mol
Mass of water = approximately 288 g

Therefore, when 32 grams of oxygen gas and 32 grams of hydrogen gas react in this balanced equation, approximately 288 grams of water will be formed.
