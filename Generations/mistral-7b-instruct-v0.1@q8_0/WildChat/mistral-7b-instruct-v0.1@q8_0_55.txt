Lilac looked over at her friend, Ants, with a mix of curiosity and concern. "What are you doing, Ants?" she asked, trying to sound calm.

"I found some food," Ants replied, excitedly. "Check it out!"

Lilac approached Ants and examined the fish that they had found lying on the ground. She frowned and shook her head. "No way," she said. "That's not what I expected to find. It's too big."

Ants looked at Lilac with confusion. "But it's delicious!" they exclaimed.

"I don't know, Ants," Lilac said. "It's a human food. And humans are scary."

Suddenly, a loud crash echoed through the forest. Lilac and Ants quickly looked up to see a massive figure standing before them, surrounded by a cloud of smoke and dust. It was Goku!

Lilac gasped in shock. "Who is that?" she asked, her voice trembling with fear.

"It's me," Goku said, grinning down at the tiny ants standing before him. "I heard you guys were making some food, so I decided to drop by and have a taste."

Lilac felt tears well up in her eyes. She had never seen anything like this before. This human was enormous compared to her, and she didn't know what to say or do.

But Ants stepped forward bravely and offered the fish to Goku. "Hey there, big guy," they said. "Why don't you try some of our food?"

Goku grunted and picked up the fish with one hand, tossing it into his mouth. To Lilac's surprise, he didn't seem to notice her at all. He just focused on eating the fish, savoring each bite.

As Goku finished the last piece, he stood up and stretched. "Thanks for sharing," he said to Ants. "I'll see you around!"

And with that, he was gone, leaving Lilac and Ants standing there in shock. They had never met a human before, and they didn't know what to make of this whole situation.

As Lilac and Ants walked through the forest, they suddenly heard a loud crash behind them. They turned around to see a group of giant ants marching towards them with menacing intent. The girls were terrified as the ants towered over them like buildings, and they had no idea how to defend themselves against such a formidable enemy.

Just as the ants were about to attack, a figure emerged from behind the trees, wearing a bright-colored suit and holding a powerful looking energy ball. It was Goku! The girls were in shock as they realized that he was huge, just like the ants they faced, but unlike them, he wasn't scared of humans.

"What do you want with us?" Lilac asked, her voice trembling with fear.

Goku looked down at the girls, who were still reeling from the surprise attack, "I was on a mission to destroy these ants, but I couldn't find any weaknesses in them. But I see that you two seem to know something about them. Can you help me?"

Lilac and Ants exchanged worried glances, but they knew that they had to try and help Goku if they wanted to survive. "We know that the ants are immortal," Lilac said, her voice barely above a whisper, "But we don't know how to defeat them."

Goku nodded thoughtfully, "Then I guess it's up to me to figure out a way to destroy them. But you two had better stay hidden if you want to survive. Good luck!"

And with that, Goku disappeared into the forest, leaving Lilac and Ants alone once again, but this time they knew that they had to come up with a plan to save themselves and stop the ants.
