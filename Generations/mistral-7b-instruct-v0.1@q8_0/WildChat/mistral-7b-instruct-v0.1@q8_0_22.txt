To accomplish this task, you can use VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) programming language to create a macro that can automate your process. Here is an outline of the steps you need to follow:
1. Open Excel and press "ALT + F11" to open the Visual Basic Editor.
2. In the editor, click on "Insert" in the menu bar and select "Module". This will create a new module where you can write your VBA code.
3. Write the following code to create a user form that includes a text box and a button:
```vbnet
Sub CreateForm()
    Set f = Application.ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddTextBox(, , , , "Enter value", , , msoFalse)
    With f
        .Name = "TextBox1"
        .Left = 50
        .Top = 50
        .Width = 200
        .Height = 20
        .TextAlignment = xlCenter
        .VerticalAlignment = xlMiddle
    End With
    
    Set b = Application.ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddButton(, , , , "Enter", , msoFalse)
    With b
        .Name = "Button1"
        .Left = 325
        .Top = 50
        .Width = 75
        .Height = 25
        .TextAlignment = xlCenter
        .VerticalAlignment = xlMiddle
        .OnAction = "EnterValues"
    End With
End Sub
```
This code creates a user form with a text box and a button. The button has an event associated with it that will call the "EnterValues" function when clicked.
4. Write the following code to create a macro that will run when the button is clicked:
```vbnet
Sub EnterValues()
    Dim val As String
    
    val = Application.InputBox("Enter value")
    
    Dim i As Integer, j As Integer
    
    For i = 1 To 12
        Cells(i, 1).Value = val
    Next i
End Sub
```
This code gets the value entered in the text box and then loops through rows 1 to 12 in column A, setting each cell's value to the entered value.
5. Save your work and close the Visual Basic Editor.
6. Go back to Excel and click on "Developer" in the ribbon (if it is not already enabled).
7. Click on "Macros" and select "Record Macro".
8. In the "Macro name" field, enter a descriptive name for your macro.
9. Select "EnterValues" from the list of available macros to record.
10. Click "OK" to start recording.
11. Go back to Excel and click on the button you created earlier.
12. Enter a value in the text box and click OK.
13. The macro should now be running, and you should see the entered value displayed in columns A1:A12.
14. To stop recording, click on "Developer" in the ribbon and select "Stop Recording".
