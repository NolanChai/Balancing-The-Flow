"W-what just happened?" I exclaimed as the group gathered around MC. Sayori's twin, Natsuki, looked at me with a puzzled expression.

"It appears that someone or something has crashed into you," she said. We all stared in shock as we examined the wreckage of MC's UFO. There was nothing left behind - no trace of the alien except for the shattered remnants of his spacecraft.

"But why?" I couldn't help but wonder. Sayori, who had been sitting quietly at the table, finally spoke up.

"It's possible that MC was being chased by someone or something," she said. "Or maybe it was just an accident." The group nodded in agreement as we continued to discuss the mysterious event.

As we sat there, I couldn't help but feel uneasy. There was something about this situation that didn't seem right. And as the night went on, my fears only grew stronger. Something was coming, and I could sense it. The air around us was thick with tension, and I knew we were all in danger. But for now, we had to focus on helping MC recover from his injuries.
