To click on a CSS selector using Selenium WebDriver in Python, you can use the `find_element_by_*` methods provided by the WebDriver interface.

Here's an example of how to click on the CSS selector "//p[normalize-space()='Social Media Growth Hacker']" using Selenium WebDriver in Python:
```python
from selenium import webdriver

# Create a new instance of ChromeDriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the website
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# Find the element using the CSS selector
element = driver.find_element_by_css_selector("//p[normalize-space()='Social Media Growth Hacker']")

# Click on the element
element.click()
```
Note that the above code assumes you are using ChromeDriver as your WebDriver. You can use other browsers like Firefox, Safari, and Edge by installing their respective WebDriver implementations.

Here is an example of how to use Selenium WebDriver in Python to click on a CSS selector `//p[normalize-space()='Social Media Growth Hacker']`:
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# create a new instance of the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# navigate to the desired website
driver.get("https://example.com")

# find the element with the CSS selector
element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "//p[normalize-space()='Social Media Growth Hacker']")

# click on the element
element.click()
```

To access the element with class "SocialMediaGrowthHacker", you can use the `querySelector` method in JavaScript. Here is an example of how to do it using Node.js and the Cheerio library:
```javascript
const cheerio = require('cheerio');
const $ = cheerio.load(html);

const socialMediaGrowthHackerElement = $('//p[normalize-space()="Social Media Growth Hacker"]');
console.log(socialMediaGrowthHackerElement.text());
```
This code will output the text inside the `<p>` element with class "SocialMediaGrowthHacker" in the HTML. Note that you'll need to install Cheerio and Node.js before running this code.

The provided code is using Selenium WebDriver library and executing a simple action on a web page. Here's what this code does:

1. It creates an instance of `WebDriverWait` object with a timeout of 10 seconds, meaning it will wait for up to 10 seconds before timing out.
2. It uses the `element_to_be_clickable()` method from the `ExpectedConditions` module to check if the element with XPath `//p[normalize-space()=‘Social Media Growth Hacker’]` is clickable. `normalize-space()` function is used to remove leading/trailing whitespaces and convert the text to lowercase, making the XPath more robust against different formatting of the text on the page.
3. It uses the `click()` method on the element to click on it.
4. The code execution will continue after this line, or it will raise an exception if the element was not found or if the timeout occurred before the element became clickable.

To select the last element with a specific class, you can use CSS selector. For example, if the class you are looking for is "post-markdown flex flex-col gap-4 text-th-primary-dark text-base", you can select the last element using the following CSS code:
```css
.post-markdown:last-child {
  /* add your desired styles here */
}
```
This selector will target the last element with the "post-markdown" class, and you can add your desired styles within the curly braces.

In Python, you can use the `requests` library to send a POST request to an API endpoint. Here is an example:
```
import requests

url = "https://api.example.com/endpoint"
data = {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}  # dictionary containing the data to be sent
response = requests.post(url, json=data)
print(response.json())  # print the response as a JSON object
```
In this example, we first import the `requests` library. We then define the API endpoint URL and a dictionary containing the data to be sent in the request body. Finally, we call the `requests.post()` method with the endpoint URL, the data to be sent (as a JSON object), and print the response as a JSON object.

Note that you may need to add headers to your request depending on the API you are working with. You can find more information about the `requests` library in the official documentation: <https://docs.python-requests.org/>
