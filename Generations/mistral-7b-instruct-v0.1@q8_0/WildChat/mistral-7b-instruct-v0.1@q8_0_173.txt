It's difficult to determine exactly which flower you are referring to based solely on the description, as there are many flowers with red petals and white stripes. Some possibilities could include roses (specifically those of the 'Peace' variety), carnations, or even some species of begonias. If possible, it would be helpful to provide a clearer picture or more specific details about the plant in question to help identify its exact species.
