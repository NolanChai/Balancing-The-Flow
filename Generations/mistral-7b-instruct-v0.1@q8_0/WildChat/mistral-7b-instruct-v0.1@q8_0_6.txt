INT. HAWKINS NATIONAL LABORATORY - MAX'S ROOM - NIGHT

Max is lying in bed, flipping through a magazine when she suddenly feels a strange presence in her room. She sits up and looks around, but sees nothing out of the ordinary.

Suddenly, she feels a cold hand on her shoulder. She turns to see Mike sitting next to her, looking concerned.

"Max, are you okay?" he asks.

Max nods, trying to shake off the feeling. But as Mike starts to ask her questions about her day, she feels like something is really wrong.

Suddenly, she begins to convulse and scream. Mike tries to hold her down, but she's too strong.

As the scene continues, Max's body becomes consumed by the Mind Flayer. Her eyes turn black and her skin turns pale. She starts to levitate off of the bed, hovering in mid-air.

Mike looks terrified as he watches his friend being possessed by the creature. He tries to think of a way to help her, but he's not sure what to do.

Finally, just as Max is about to be completely consumed by the Mind Flayer, Eleven appears out of nowhere and uses her powers to force the creature out of Max's body.

Max collapses onto the bed, gasping for breath. Mike rushes over to her and helps her sit up.

"What just happened?" he asks, looking dazed.

Max looks at him with tears in her eyes. "I don't know," she says. "But I think...I think I might have been possessed by the Mind Flayer."

The scene opens in a dark room, illuminated only by flickering candles. Max is standing in front of the camera, her face twisted into an evil smile.

"I've been playing a game with you all this time," she begins, her voice dripping with malice. "And I must confess, I've always wanted to be evil. It's not something that just happened to me, it's something I've always desired."

She leans closer to the camera, her eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.

"I let the Mind Flayer in, willingly," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "And now, I have become its avatar, its instrument of destruction. The world is mine to conquer, and I will stop at nothing to achieve my ultimate goal."

The camera zooms out, revealing a massive, dark creature behind Max. Its tentacles stretch out into the darkness, ready to strike at a moment's notice.

"I am the Mind Flayer," Max says, her voice rising to a crescendo as the creature lunges towards the camera. "And I will not be stopped."
