Mei had always been fascinated by the idea of shapeshifting. As a child, she would spend hours watching spy movies and reading science fiction novels that featured characters who could change their appearance at will. When she discovered that her hero Tracer was also capable of shapechanging, she couldn't contain her excitement.

Tracer was known for her ability to turn invisible and teleport short distances, but Mei had never seen her do it in person until one day when she stumbled upon Tracer's secret laboratory. Inside, she found a strange device that looked like a cross between a robot and a spacesuit. Tracer explained that the device allowed her to blend in with any environment and disappear from view at will.

Mei was amazed by the technology and begged Tracer to let her try it on. Tracer reluctantly agreed, and Mei slipped into the suit. She felt the weight of the armor pressing down on her body, but as soon as she activated the device, she became invisible. Mei was thrilled at the sensation of being unseen, and she spent the next few hours exploring the lab and trying out different disguises.

Meanwhile, Mercy had always been fascinated by the idea of mind control. She had spent years studying psychology and neuroscience in hopes of developing a way to read people's thoughts. When she discovered that Tracer was also capable of mind control, she couldn't contain her excitement.

Mercy approached Tracer with her discovery, and Tracer revealed that she had been experimenting with mind control herself. She showed Mercy the device that allowed her to control other people's actions, and Mercy was amazed at how it worked. Mercy begged Tracer to let her try the device on, and Tracer reluctantly agreed.

Mercy slipped into the suit, and she felt a rush of power as she took control of Mei's mind. She could see everything that Mei saw, hear everything that she heard, and even control her actions. Mercy was thrilled at the sensation of being all-powerful, and she spent the next few hours exploring the lab and controlling Mei's every move.

But as time passed, Mei and Tracer began to feel a sense of unease. They noticed that their abilities were becoming less controlled and more erratic. They realized that they were being influenced by an unknown force, one that was slowly taking over their minds and bodies.

Mei and Tracer went to Mercy for help, but she refused to listen. She was too caught up in the power of her new abilities to care about their well-being. It wasn't until they confronted her with evidence that something was wrong that she started to take them seriously.

Together, Mei and Tracer discovered the truth: they were all being controlled by Sombra, the mysterious villain behind many of Overwatch's most dangerous missions. Sombra had been using his advanced technology to infiltrate their minds and manipulate their actions from a distance.

Mei, Tracer, and Mercy realized that they needed to work together to take down Sombra once and for all. They each brought their unique abilities to the table, but they also had to learn to trust each other. It wasn't easy, but with determination and teamwork, they were able to defeat Sombra and free themselves from his control.

As they emerged victorious, Mei, Tracer, and Mercy realized that they had learned a valuable lesson. They had shed their skin as individuals and become something more than just heroes. They had become a team, one that was stronger and more powerful together than apart. And as long as they stayed true to each other, there was nothing they couldn't accomplish.
