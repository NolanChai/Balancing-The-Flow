Freedom Planet:

Brevon unsheathes his sword and attacks Naruto with multiple strikes. Naruto blocks all his attacks with one finger.

Brevon gasps, completely shocked by Naruto's power.

Naruto 70 Age:

Naruto is now 70 years old and has achieved a power level of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. He is now considered one of the most powerful beings in the universe.

Naruto's Lilac chakra mode has increased his power level to 80-160, making him even stronger than before. His other teammates also have impressive power levels, with Carol at 67, Milla at 60, Torque at 100, and Syntax at 30-40.

Brevon, on the other hand, has a power level of 120, making him formidable but still nowhere near Naruto's level. As he attacks Naruto, Naruto effortlessly blocks all his strikes with one finger. Brevon gasps in shock as he realizes the extent of Naruto's strength and skill.
