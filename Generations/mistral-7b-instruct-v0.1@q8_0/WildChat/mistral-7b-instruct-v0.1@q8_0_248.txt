Here is the corrected grammar:

Hi Crystal,

May I confirm if HR will upload the business objective goals to my performance goals for tracking, or I need to fill that in myself? Since my line manager has already assigned 5 performance goals in HR Direct. Thanks.

Best regards,
Jimmy

Dear Crystal,

I hope this message finds you well. Could you please clarify if the Human Resources department will upload the business objective goals to my performance goals for tracking, or if I am still responsible for filling that information in myself? I understand that my line manager has already assigned five performance goals through HR Direct. Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Jimmy

"May I confirm whether HR will upload the business objective goals onto my performance goals for tracking purposes, or do I still need to manually input the goals into the spreadsheet if I have already recorded them in HR Direct? My line manager has already assigned five performance goals to me on HR Direct. Thank you."

"Since Crystal is on leave until this Friday and will be back next Monday, shall we still meet tomorrow for discussion?"
