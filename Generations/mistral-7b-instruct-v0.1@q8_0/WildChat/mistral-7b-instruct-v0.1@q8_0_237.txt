-Naruto's Story-

3 years later, Naruto is seen standing on top of the Naruto Uzumaki Hill, looking out at the island chain in the distance. He seems contemplative, with a sense of nostalgia and longing for something that has been lost to time. As he stands there, he reflects on his journey as Hokage and the responsibility that comes with it. He also remembers the friends he has made along the way, and how much they have grown and changed in these last three years. With a sense of determination, Naruto resolves to continue leading his people towards a brighter future.

As the fight continues, Lilac becomes increasingly frustrated with Neera's accusations and the lack of concrete evidence. She eventually breaks down into tears, confessing that she didn't do anything and just wants to go home. However, she is interrupted by a loud explosion in the ship's engine room, which leads her to the source: Pangu.

Pangu reveals itself as a sentient being with a mission to reclaim its stolen data from Parusa, and it invites Lilac to join it on its quest. She initially refuses, but eventually agrees after seeing Pangu's determination and passion for justice. Together, they set out to gather the evidence needed to clear Lilac's name and bring down Parusa for their crimes.

As they journey across the planet, Lilac learns more about Pangu and its origins, as well as her own history with the robot that destroyed her treehouse. She also develops a newfound respect for the power of technology and the importance of protecting it from those who would use it for evil purposes.

In the end, Lilac and Pangu successfully gather enough evidence to bring down Parusa and clear Lilac's name. They return home as heroes, with Lilac grateful for the adventure she went on and the lessons she learned along the way.
