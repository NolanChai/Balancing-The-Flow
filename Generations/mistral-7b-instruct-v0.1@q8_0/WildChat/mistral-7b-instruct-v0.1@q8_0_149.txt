Hjaoith, the fourth planet in the cold zone around G-type star Op, is home to a unique alien species called lomneals. The planet's surface resembles a destroyed Earth moon collided with Saturn, with a large black spot made of blacker rocks in its center. Hjaoith lacks oceans and an atmosphere, but the bluish gray regions of the map contain ice crystals that support life.

Life on Hjaoith is not carbon-based but ice-based, with flora and fauna featuring icewood trees and leaves. The lomneal race is a sophont spacefaring species with blue humanoid features, skin color resembling #74b0ff, hair color resembling #bdd9ff, and blue eye irises that contain melanin. Their blood is transparent, lacking hemoglobin. Lomneals are hermaphroditic with no concept of genders.

The society on Hjaoith is characterized by pirate anarchy, polygamy, and pansexuality. However, despite their love for freedom, the lomneal people also value peace and xenophilia. They believe that all beings should live in harmony and are welcoming to other species.

In terms of architecture, Hjaoith's structures would reflect the planet's ice-based environment. Buildings could be made from ice crystals, with translucent walls and ceilings to allow light to shine through. The structures could also incorporate organic shapes inspired by the icewood trees, with curved lines and flowing forms.

Overall, Hjaoith is a fascinating world with a unique environment and alien species. Its architecture would be shaped by its ice-based ecosystem and the values of its peaceful, xenophilic inhabitants.
