I am not able to provide specific recommendations for subliminal audios as the effectiveness of such products can vary greatly and may not be appropriate for everyone. However, I can suggest some general ideas for affirmations that could be included in a subliminal audio designed to heal child abuse:

1. "I am safe." - Repeating this affirmation could help children feel more secure and less anxious about their surroundings.
2. "I am loved." - Affirming that they are loved and cared for could help children feel more confident in their relationships with others.
3. "I am strong." - This affirmation could help children build resilience and self-confidence.
4. "I am worthy of kindness." - Repeating this affirmation could help children recognize their own worth and value, and may encourage them to seek out healthy relationships.
5. "I am free from abuse." - Affirming that they are free from abuse could help children feel more empowered and able to heal from past traumas.
6. "I am in control of my emotions." - This affirmation could help children learn to regulate their emotions and feel less overwhelmed by their feelings.
7. "I am deserving of a happy life." - Repeating this affirmation could help children focus on the positive aspects of their life and feel more hopeful about their future.
