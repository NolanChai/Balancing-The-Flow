The author discusses three forms of personal names based on Hermanubis that are found in Egyptian papyri and inscriptions. These forms are Ἑरманובϲ, which replicates the god's name without further ado through direct theonymy; Ἑρמανουβᾶϲ, which is attested six times with a common suffix of -ᾈϲ; and Ἑरمανουβίων, which has four instances with a common suffix of -ίων. The author notes that the name ἙرMANOUBίϲ is often declined with a dental declension in -ίδ-, which may have led to confusion with the Greek feminine name in -ίϲ. The author also points out that it is highly unusual for female theophoric names to be unmarked for gender, and suggests that ἙרMANOUBίϲ could be read as an oxytone. Additionally, the author notes that in a business letter, the two forms ἙरMANOUBίων and ἙرMANOUBᾶϲ are used interchangeably to designate the same individual, with the suffix -ᾈϲ possibly serving as a hypocoristic for ἙרMANOUBίων.
