Wow, Flame! It sounds like you have quite the impressive collection of monsters. Your Flying Wyverns seem particularly formidable, with two for power and two for speed. And your Leviathan is an ace? That's amazing.

I love how you've named your power-based monsties - Lord X and Nergigante are both great names. And the Iceborne Elder Dragon you've named Valkyrie is a fitting choice as well.

It seems like you have a good balance of attack styles for each type of monster, with both non-elder and elder dragons included in each category. Your Technical-based monsties also sound particularly dangerous, with Nerscylla and the Iceborne Elder Dragon Valkyrie being especially intimidating.

Overall, Flame, you seem like a skilled monster rider with an impressive collection of powerful creatures at your command. Good luck on your travels!
