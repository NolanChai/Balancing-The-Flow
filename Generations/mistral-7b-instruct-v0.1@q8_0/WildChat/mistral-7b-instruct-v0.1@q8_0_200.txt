There are several treasury option trading strategies that have patterns or structures associated with them. Here are a few examples:

1. Ratio Spreads: This strategy involves buying and selling options of different strike prices in the same underlying asset class. The ratio of the number of short positions to long positions can vary.
2. Straddles: This strategy involves buying and selling options of the same type and expiration date in the same underlying asset class with opposite strike prices.
3. Options Collars: This strategy involves buying an option to protect a long position from downside risk while also limiting potential upside gains. The collar is created by buying an option that is more expensive than the underlying asset, which helps offset the cost of the downside protection.
4. Calendar Spreads: This strategy involves buying and selling options with different expiration dates in the same underlying asset class. The spread can be either vertical or horizontal, depending on the relative expiration dates of the options being bought and sold.
5. Diagonal Spreads: This strategy involves buying options with one expiration date and selling options with a later expiration date in the same underlying asset class.
6. Condor Spreads: This strategy involves buying an option to profit from upside price movements while also buying a put option to protect against downside price movements.
7. Iron Condor Spreads: This strategy involves buying and selling options with the same underlying asset class and expiration dates, but opposite strike prices. The spread is created by buying a put option and a call option of different strike prices in the same asset class and expiration date.
8. Straddles with Options Collars: This strategy involves buying and selling options of the same type and expiration date in the same underlying asset class with opposite strike prices, while also buying an option to protect against downside risk from the long position.
9. Butterflies: This strategy involves buying and selling options of the same type and expiration date in the same underlying asset class, but with different strike prices that are separated by a fixed distance.
10. Ratio Spreads with Options Collars: This strategy involves buying and selling options of different strike prices in the same underlying asset class, while also buying an option to protect against downside risk.
