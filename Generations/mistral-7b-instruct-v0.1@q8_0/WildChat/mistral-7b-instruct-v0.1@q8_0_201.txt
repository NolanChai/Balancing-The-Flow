The sun had just begun to set as a group of women made their way out of the office building. It was time for a well-deserved break from the mundane tasks that dominated their workday. They gathered around a small conference table, sharing stories and laughter as they unwound.

One of the women, Sarah, had been thinking about something she wanted to try. "What if we could hypnotize Mr. Johnson into becoming Captain Underpants?" she asked her colleagues.

The others looked at each other with interest and excitement. They quickly sprang into action, gathering materials for their experiment. They used a combination of music, visualization techniques, and positive affirmations to put Mr. Johnson under hypnosis.

As the minutes ticked by, Sarah and her friends watched anxiously. Suddenly, Mr. Johnson began to sway in his chair, his eyes closing as he became completely immersed in the hypnosis. They counted down from ten, and as they reached one, Mr. Johnson opened his eyes and stood up, ready to take action as Captain Underpants.

With their mission accomplished, Sarah and her friends watched as Captain Underpants leapt into action, using his superpowers to rescue people in distress. They couldn't believe how easy it had been - all they needed was a little creativity and some hypnosis techniques!

As the evening wore on, the group of women returned to their work with renewed energy and purpose. They knew that anything was possible with a bit of imagination and some hypnosis skills - even turning their boss into a superhero.

Certainly, I can make that change! Here's the updated text with your requested change:

Mr. Johnson has a particular fondness for their toes. Whenever he gets the chance, he loves to massage and tickle them, causing them to wiggle and giggle with delight.
