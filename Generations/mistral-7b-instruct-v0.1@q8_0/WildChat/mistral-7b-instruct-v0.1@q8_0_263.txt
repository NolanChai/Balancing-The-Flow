It's understandable that you may prefer to watch anime with fandubs instead of the officially licensed versions, especially when the legally released versions may not be as accurate or may have subpar voice acting. However, it's important to consider the legal implications of watching and distributing copyrighted material without permission.

While it may be tempting to justify your actions by pointing out that fandubbers often provide more accurate translations, this does not negate the fact that they are still infringing on the copyrights of the original creators. In many cases, the anime production companies and distributors have invested a significant amount of money in producing and marketing their legally released versions, and it is unfair to them for fans to choose to support fandubbers instead.

Additionally, fandubbing can often lead to negative consequences, such as lost revenue for the original creators and distributors, as well as potential legal action against those involved in copyright infringement.

Ultimately, while it may be tempting to support fandubbers, it is important to respect the intellectual property rights of the original creators and to consider supporting legally released versions of anime whenever possible.

No, you do not need to become an "anime refugee" to watch content that has not been legally released in your country. There are many legal ways to access content from other countries, such as using online streaming services or purchasing physical copies of the content. It is important to respect copyright laws and obtain content through legitimate means.

1. Request a legal release: Reach out to the distributors or streaming platforms that offer anime in your country, and let them know about the specific titles you want to see. If enough fans show interest, they may consider acquiring the license and making the content available legally.
2. Check legal international streaming platforms: Some international streaming platforms, like Crunchyroll, Funimation, and Netflix, offer a wide range of anime titles. Although certain content may be region-locked, their catalogues are constantly updated, and the anime youâ€™re interested in might become legally available later.
3. Import legally released DVDs or Blu-rays: Although this can be expensive, consider importing DVDs or Blu-rays of the anime you want to watch from a country where they are legally available. Be sure to check if your DVD or Blu-ray player can support the video format and region codes of the imported discs.
4. Use VPNs: You can use VPNs to bypass geo-restrictions and access content that is not available in your country. However, be aware that using VPNs may violate the terms of service of some streaming platforms and could result in your account being suspended or banned.
5. Join anime communities: Joining anime communities can help you connect with other fans who share your interests and might have information on how to legally access the content you want to watch.

It is important to note that there are different meanings for the term "marginals," and it can be used in a variety of contexts. In this case, it appears that the term was being used to describe participants of a rally who supported the anime To Your Eternity.

It is possible that the organizers of the rally used the term "marginals" as a way to denigrate the participants or to suggest that they were not part of the mainstream. It's also possible that the term was used in a playful or lighthearted manner, and the participants didn't take it seriously.

It is important to be aware of different meanings and connotations of words, especially when they are being used in a context where they could be misinterpreted. It is always a good idea to use words that are clear and unambiguous, and to avoid using terms that may be perceived negatively or offensively.

It is common for companies to use bot accounts and automated scripts to spread their message online. These accounts can be used to generate likes, followers, or comments on social media platforms, which can help boost the popularity of a product or service. However, it's also possible that real people were involved in this campaign to promote To Your Eternity in your country. It's difficult to determine for certain without more information.
