Planet Psychre, also known as Hjaoith, is the homeworld of the Lomneal species. This planet is located in the cold zone around a G-type star named Op, in the same galaxy as Earth on planet Civtia. The map of Hjaoith resembles Luna, with a large black spot made of blacker rocks, caused by the collision of the moon with Saturn. The planet lacks oceans and atmosphere, but is covered in bluish gray regions containing ice crystals.

Hjaoith's ice crystals, along with the absorption of starlight by the black spots on its surface, support life on the planet. Ice-based proteins and lipids evolve, leading to unique flora and fauna on Hjaoith. The flora includes icewood trees with light blue woods and leaves, while the fauna is a diverse range of creatures adapted to their icy environment.

The Lomneal species are sophont spacefaring beings, designed in the image of blue humanoids. They have skin that resembles #74b0ff, hair that resembles #bdd9ff, and dark blue eye irises containing melanin. Their blood is transparent, lacking hemoglobin, making them a unique species among others.

Lomneals are hermaphroditic, with no concept of genders, and they are a peaceful and xenophilic species. Their society is characterized by pirate anarchy, with a polygamous pansexual lifestyle. The Lomneal civilization has been shaped by their way of life, with architecture reflecting their love of freedom and individuality.

The architecture on Hjaoith is a testament to the Lomneals' ingenuity and resourcefulness. They have built structures out of ice, using its unique properties to create elegant and functional buildings. The cityscape is a beautiful blend of form and function, with towering ice sculptures and sprawling communities that reflect the Lomneal way of life.
