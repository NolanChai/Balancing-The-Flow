Monika: “Uh… Natsuki, I need to talk to you about something. Can we have a minute?”

Sayori: “Sure, go ahead.”

Monika: “It’s been a while since we’ve had a chance to catch up. How are things with Sakura and everything? Are you two doing okay?”

Natsuki: (smiling) “Yes, we’re doing great! She’s been growing so fast, and she’s always so happy and curious. I can’t help but feel grateful for this wonderful experience.”

Sayori: “Aww, that’s wonderful to hear! You two really make a cute family.”

Monika: (nodding) “They definitely do. And speaking of families, I wanted to ask you about something else. Have you ever considered the possibility of having more children in the future?”

Natsuki: (hesitating) “I… well, I’ve thought about it, but I’m not sure if I’m ready yet. You know, being a parent can be a lot of responsibility, and I want to make sure I can provide for my family before considering bringing another child into the world.”

Sayori: “I completely understand where you’re coming from. Being a parent is definitely a big responsibility, but it can also be one of the most rewarding experiences of a person’s life. If you ever do decide to have more children, I know you’ll make a great parent, Natsuki.”

Monika: (smiling) “Thank you, Sayori. That means a lot to me. But for now, I think we should just focus on enjoying the time we have with Sakura and making sure she grows up happy and healthy. Am I right?”

Natsuki: (nodding) “Yes, that’s what we should do.”
