Subject: Meeting Proposal - Monday and Wednesday Option Available

Dear Walid,

Thank you for reaching out and proposing the meeting on Monday at 9:30 am Irish Time. However, I'm afraid that my schedule is already booked for that day.

I would be happy to suggest an alternative date and time that works better for you. Would Wednesday morning be a more convenient time for you? Please let me know, and we can arrange a meeting accordingly.

If there are any specific dates or times that work best for you, please do not hesitate to let me know. I'm looking forward to speaking with you soon.

Best regards,
<PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>

Dear Ola,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our previous conversation about meeting next week. I understand that 9:00 AM on Tuesday is not available for you, but I would still be happy to suggest other dates and times that may work for both of us.

If Wednesday at 9:00 AM or Thursday at 10:00 PM are more convenient for you, please let me know, and I'll make sure to schedule those times into my calendar. If there are any other specific dates and times that would work better, feel free to share those as well.

I look forward to speaking with you soon and hope we can find a time that works for both of us.

Best Regards,
