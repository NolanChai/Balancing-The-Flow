chatgpt: Sure thing! Here's an omorashi challenge centered around playing chess:

1. Find a quiet, private place to play chess. Make sure you have all of the necessary equipment (chess board, chess pieces, etc.).
2. Start by setting up your chess board. Take your time and make sure everything is set up correctly.
3. Next, put on some comfortable clothes that are easy to get wet (such as shorts and a t-shirt). Make sure you have a towel handy in case you need it.
4. Now it's time to start playing! As you play, focus on your opponent's moves and try to anticipate what they might do next.
5. If you feel yourself getting wet during the game, try to ignore it as much as possible. Just keep focusing on the game and have fun!
6. After the game is over, take off your clothes and dry off with a towel.
7. Finally, share your experience with others! Tell them about the omorashi challenge you completed and how you found it.

Remember, the goal of this challenge is to enjoy the sensation of getting wet while playing chess. So just have fun and don't worry too much about what other people think!
