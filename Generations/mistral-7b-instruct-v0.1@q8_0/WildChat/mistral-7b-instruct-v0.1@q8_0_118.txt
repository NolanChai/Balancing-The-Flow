(As Sayori was about to give birth, her contractions started getting worse.)

MC: “Okay, Sayori, you can do this.”

Sayori: “I know, MC. But it hurts so much!”

(After a few more minutes of intense labor, Sayori finally pushed out our daughter.)

MC: “It’s a girl!!!”[2]

Sayori: “She’s so beautiful! Look at her little face!” (tears streaming down her face)

(I picked up our daughter and hugged Sayori tightly. We had made it through this difficult journey together, and now we were the proud parents of a beautiful baby girl.)

MC: “We did it, Sayori. We did it.”

Sayori: “Yes, we did. I love you so much, MC. And our daughter will grow up knowing how much she means to us.”

(As we watched our daughter take her first breath, we both knew that this was only the beginning of a new chapter in our lives as a family.)
