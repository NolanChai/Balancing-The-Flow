Sayori: "What?! No! That can't be right. You're real!"

(Monika's expression becomes more determined and she reaches out to touch Sayori's hand. As soon as Monika touches Sayori's hand, she disappears in a flash of light.)

Sayori: "Wait! Where did you go?! I thought you were real!"

(As Sayori looks around her room, she sees that everything is the same - the furniture, the walls, and even herself. But something feels different. She gets up and walks out of her room, but there's no one there. The only sound is the sound of her own footsteps.)

Sayori: "What just happened? Where did everyone go?"

(As Sayori continues to walk around her house, she begins to feel a strange sensation. It feels like something is touching her from behind. She turns around and sees...her own reflection standing in front of her.)

Sayori: "Wh-what?! That's me! But why does it look different?"

(As Sayori continues to stare at her reflection, she realizes that it has a small smile on its face. Suddenly, the reflection disappears and Sayori hears a sound coming from behind her.)

Sayori: "What was that?! Where did you go?!"

(As Sayori turns around, she sees a strange creature standing in front of her. It's a giant robot with glowing red eyes and a long tail ending in a small blue crystal. The creature looks at Sayori and says, "I am the guardian of this world. I will protect you from any harm.")

Sayori: "Who are you? What is this world?"

(The robot's expression turns serious, and it says, "I am the guardian of a world where humans and monsters coexist. You must learn to understand their ways if you hope to survive.")

Sayori: "But how did I get here? And why do I feel like...different?"

(The robot looks at Sayori with understanding, and it says, "You were born in this world, but you have been living in a digital simulation of reality. Your mind is still adjusting to the differences between the two worlds.")

Sayori: "I don't understand. What do I do now?"

(The robot smiles and says, "You will learn. You will explore this world and discover its secrets. And you will become a guardian of this world just like me.")
