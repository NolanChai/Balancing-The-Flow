No, if you measure a 18% grey object and make an exposure compensation of +2, the object will appear brightened in the final image, but it will not turn completely white. The exposure compensation adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image, but it does not change the color balance or tint of the object.

The 18% grey point is a commonly used reference for measuring the overall lightness of an image, and it corresponds to approximately middle-gray in most digital cameras. A +2 exposure compensation will make the image brighter, but the grey point will still be in the same general range as before (middle-gray).

If you want to turn the 18% grey object completely white in the final picture, you would need to adjust the color balance of the image, either by changing the white balance setting on your camera or by editing the image later in a photo editor. However, this would change the overall look and feel of the image, and may not be desirable in all situations.
