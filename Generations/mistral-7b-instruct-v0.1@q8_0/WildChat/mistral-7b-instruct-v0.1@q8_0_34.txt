There are several forms of personal names based on Hermanubis in Egyptian papyri and inscriptions, including two "proper" polytheophoric names. The form Ἑرمάνουβιϲ is the simplest, replicating the god's name through direct theonymy, while the form Ἑרμανουβᾶϲ often declines with a dental declension in -ιδ-, which may be conflated with similar declensions of Greek feminine names. The form Ἑरמανουβίων is another form based on Hermanubis and uses the commonest Greek suffixes -ᾶϲ and -ίων. It is interesting that in a business letter, two different forms of the name are used interchangeably to designate the same individual, with Ἑरمαنουβᾶϲ being a possible hypocoristic form of Ἑרमανουβίων.
