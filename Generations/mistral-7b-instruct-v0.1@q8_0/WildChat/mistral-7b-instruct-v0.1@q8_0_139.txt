In Starcraft, Sonic the Hedgehog is not a character or non-character. Therefore, there are no in-game reactions to him. However, if you're asking about how some fictional characters might react to Sonic in a hypothetical scenario, here are a few possibilities:

* Characters who are friendly and open to new things: They might be curious about this strange new character, and could try to communicate with him or investigate his presence. Examples include Tychus, Nova, and Zeratul.
* Characters who are wary or suspicious: They might view Sonic as a potential threat, and would take steps to defend themselves or their allies. Examples include Jim Raynor, Maru, and the Terran Dominion.
* Characters who are neutral: They might not have much of a reaction, as they simply observe Sonic without any particular emotional attachment or interest in him. Examples include Admiral Piett, Gengus, and Artanis.
