If you are receiving a message stating that your Instagram account has been restricted from advertising due to non-compliance with Meta's advertising policies, there are several steps you can take to resolve the issue.

1. Review the Advertising Help Center: The first step is to review the Meta Advertising Help Center to ensure that your ads comply with their guidelines and policies. This may involve updating your ad targeting, ad copy, and imagery to meet their requirements.
2. Contact Instagram Support: If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you can contact Instagram support for assistance. They may be able to provide additional guidance on how to fix the problem or may need to review your account to determine if it violates any policies.
3. Check Your Ad Account: You should also check your ad account in Instagram to ensure that there are no other issues that may be preventing you from advertising. This may involve checking your ad budget, targeting settings, and other settings to make sure they are properly configured.
4. Appeal the Decision: If none of these steps help resolve the issue, you may be able to appeal the decision by contacting Instagram support. They will review the issue and determine whether or not to lift the restriction on your account.

"Shine On" is a term often used in the fashion and jewelry industry to describe clothing or accessories with gold or silver accents. This can include anything from jewelry, such as necklaces, bracelets, and rings, to clothing like jackets and dresses adorned with metallic embellishments.

Print-on-demand jewelry is a business model where a company creates custom pieces of jewelry using digital printing technology. The customer can provide their own design, which is then printed onto a metal surface, such as silver or gold-plated brass, to create the final piece. This type of business can be profitable if done correctly, but it does require some knowledge and experience in both jewelry making and marketing.

Some factors to consider when determining whether print-on-demand jewelry is a good business include the cost of materials and equipment, the market demand for your products, and your ability to effectively promote and sell them. It may also be helpful to conduct market research and gather feedback from potential customers before making any major investment decisions.
