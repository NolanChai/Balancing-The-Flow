Jane: "Hey guys, have you heard about the new student coming to school today?"

Sam: "Yeah, I saw her on my way here. She looks really popular."

Aaron: "I don't know, I haven't seen her before."

Molly-Rose: "Wait, is that the girl from Fairbanks's? I've seen her in commercials!"

Jane: "Yeah! Everyone knows her. She's the daughter of the store owner."

Sam: "I went there once with my mom and saw her and her dad. They were so rich and fancy."

Aaron: "I don't think I've ever been to Fairbanks's, but everyone else in town has, right?"

Molly-Rose: "Definitely! And she always calls her dad 'daddy' instead of 'dad.'"

Jane: (smiling) "I know, it's so weird. But I guess that's just who she is."

(They all look over at the auditorium as the bell rings and everyone starts to file in.)

Principal: (into the microphone) "Attention, students. We have a very important announcement to make. Please take your seats and remain quiet."

Jane: "What do you think it is? A new policy or something?"

Sam: "I don't know, but I hope it's good news."

Aaron: "Maybe it's about the football game tonight."

Molly-Rose: "I hope it's not about our math test tomorrow. I don't study enough."

(Julia Fairbanks walks into the auditorium with her father, who is holding her hand.)

Julia: (smiling) "Hi everyone! I'm Julia Fairbanks, and this is my dad, Mr. Fairbanks. It's great to be here at [School Name]."

Principal: (into the microphone) "Thank you for joining us today, Ms. Fairbanks. We are honored to have you here as a new student."

Julia: (smiling) "I'm honored to be here too. I can't wait to get started and make some new friends!"

Principal: "Well, we certainly hope you enjoy your time at [School Name]. Remember, our school values hard work, respect, and responsibility. We expect everyone to uphold these values and contribute to a positive learning environment."

Julia: (nodding) "I understand completely. I'm a big daddy's girl, so I know the importance of hard work and responsibility. I promise to do my best and make my dad proud."

Principal: "Thank you for your commitment, Ms. Fairbanks. We are looking forward to having you as part of our school community."

(The auditorium applauds as Julia and her father take their seats.)

Jane: (whispering to Sam) "I can't believe she just said that. She's so rich, and she has her dad with her all the time."

Sam: "I know, it's insane. But I guess it shows how much she loves her dad."

Aaron: "Maybe she's trying to make a good impression on everyone. You never know, she might end up being really cool."

Molly-Rose: "I hope so too. But I don't think she's going to be friends with anyone who isn't rich like her."

Jane: (shrugging) "Well, we'll just have to see how it goes. In the meantime, let's get back to class and study hard for our math test tomorrow."
