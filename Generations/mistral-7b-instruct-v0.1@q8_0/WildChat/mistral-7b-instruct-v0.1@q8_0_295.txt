Yes, there are several devices available in the market that can prevent the use of UK plugs. One such device is called a "Power Strip with Anti-Fuse" or an "Anti-Fuse Power Strip." This device works by detecting when the fuses in the power strip have been tripped, which usually indicates that there has been too much current flowing through them. Once this happens, the anti-fuse mechanism springs into action, preventing any further flow of electricity.

Another device you could use is a voltage converter or transformer, which would change the voltage of the UK plug to one that is compatible with your appliance or device. This method would allow you to use your UK plug in other countries without any issues.
