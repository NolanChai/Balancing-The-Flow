No, the grey 18% object will not turn white in the final picture with an exposure compensation of +2. The purpose of exposure compensation is to adjust the exposure of an image so that the grey tones appear as a neutral gray rather than black or overexposed white. By adjusting exposure compensation, you can ensure that your images have balanced lighting and that the grey tones are not too dark or too bright.

In this case, if you measure the grey 18% object with a light meter and find that it is reading at 18%, you would adjust exposure compensation to +2. This would increase the exposure of the image so that the grey tones appear as neutral gray rather than dark grey. However, this does not mean that the grey tones will turn white in the final picture. They will simply become lighter, but still grey.

To achieve a bright white in the final picture, you would need to adjust exposure compensation even further, or use other post-processing techniques such as editing the contrast or brightness of the image.
