I take pride in my dedication to clear, accurate, and legible documentation of nursing information. I am fully aware of the significance of upholding patient confidentiality and adhere strictly to guidelines set forth by the patient code of rights and privacy act. In my role on the unit, I often make use of software applications such as Medi-Map and Vcare for medication administration and record keeping. Upon conclusion of each session, I take great care to log out thoroughly to ensure maximum protection of patient confidentiality.

During one instance, I conducted a blood sugar level check on a resident and administered the recommended insulin based on the instructions provided in Medi-Map. The result showed that the resident's blood sugar level was within normal limits. Subsequently, I recorded all pertinent details in the patient's electronic file, including date and time, and secured it with my preceptor's counter signature to maintain accuracy for future reference while safeguarding patient privacy.

In my clinical placement, I have consistently upheld the principle of patient confidentiality by not disclosing residents' details outside the clinic. When a family member entered during a handover process, I paused it to attend to their inquiry and resumed once they left. I make sure to discontinue endorsing when anyone enters the nurses' station and always securely return any nursing handover sheets. This approach allows me to address the family member's needs while safeguarding our patients' privacy and confidentiality, which is crucial for providing quality patient care and maintaining trust in the healthcare setting.

Informed consent is a fundamental right for every resident in a healthcare facility. During an interaction with a resident, I seized this opportunity to educate her about the significance of taking Levodopa, a medication in her treatment regimen. I explained how the medication helps replenish dopamine levels, thereby addressing and alleviating symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, and slow movement. Additionally, I discussed the potential side effects of the medication and its role in improving her overall health condition.
Ensuring that my explanation was comprehensive, I ensured that the resident understood the information provided. She expressed her gratitude for my assistance and took the medication as ordered under my preceptor's supervision. Informing residents about their treatment is essential to promote transparency, build trust, and empower them to make informed decisions regarding their health.

During my rounds, a patient refused to take all of his morning medications. The patient was particularly agitated and non-compliant with food and medications. I gave him time and space to calm down before explaining the importance of taking the medication on time, how it helps his conditions, and the possible consequences if he continues to refuse them. I informed my preceptor that the patient had refused the medication, and I handed it over to the next shift to update with the GP when the patient is available.
