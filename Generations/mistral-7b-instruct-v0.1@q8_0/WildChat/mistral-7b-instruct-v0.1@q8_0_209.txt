To calculate the current through the battery after 0.05 seconds, we need to use the RC circuit time constant formula:

τ = 2πRC

where R is the resistance in ohms (15 Ω in this case), and C is the capacitance in farads (6.5 μF in this case).

τ = 2π × 15 × 6.5 μF / 10^6

τ = 9.18 seconds

Now that we know the time constant, we can use it to find out how long it takes for the current to reach its final value. We want to calculate the current after 0.05 seconds (which is a fraction of the time constant), so we can multiply the time constant by this ratio:

I = τ × f

where I is the final current through the battery, τ is the time constant, and f is the frequency at which the circuit is operating.

Since the switch is closed, the circuit is charging in parallel mode, and the charging current is proportional to the voltage of the battery divided by the resistance. Let's assume that the voltage of the battery is V volts. Then:

I = (V / R) × f × t

where t is the time it takes for the current to reach its final value, which we want to find after 0.05 seconds. We can rearrange this equation to solve for I:

I = V / (R × f × t)

I = V / (15 × 6.5 μF / 0.000001 H × 0.05 s)

I = V / (9.18 s)

I = V / 9.18 s

Now we have the final current through the battery in terms of the voltage of the battery. We need to find the value of I for a given voltage, or we can solve for the voltage required to achieve a given current.
