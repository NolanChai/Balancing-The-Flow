It sounds like Flame is quite the accomplished monster rider! With two Elder Dragons by his side and a diverse array of other monsties, he's ready to take on whatever challenges come his way. It's clear that Flame has a strong fascination with bow weapons and has become skilled in their use, which is why his monsties are divided into power, speed, and technical categories based on the type of weapon they wield.

Flame's power-based monsties include Lord X, a Dreadking Rathalos, and Nergigante, an unstoppable monster known for its incredible strength and durability. He also has a second Technical-based monstie named Valkyrie, who is an Elder Dragon capable of dropping the temperature around her enemies to render them incapacitated.

Overall, Flame seems like a formidable adversary, with a diverse array of powerful monsties at his disposal!
