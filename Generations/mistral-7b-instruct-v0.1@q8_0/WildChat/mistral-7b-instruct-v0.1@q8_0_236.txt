```vbnet
You have successfully installed express package and started the server on port 3000. The command `npm install express --save` was used to install the express package, and the command `node server.js` was used to start the server. It is recommended that you run the `npm fund` command to check for any packages that need funding.
```

To start your Express server, you need to create a file named `server.js` in your project directory and write the following code:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```
This code sets up a basic Express server that listens for requests on port 3000 and responds with "Hello World!" when a request is received.

After writing this code, save the file `server.js`, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your project directory, and run the following commands:
```csharp
npm install express --save
node server.js
```
The first command installs the Express package from npm as a dependency in your project (which is necessary for running the server), and the second command starts your server by running the `server.js` file.

If you receive any errors, make sure that you have installed all of the required dependencies by running:
```csharp
npm install
```
This will install all of the packages specified in your `package.json` file. If you still encounter issues, please provide more details about the error messages you are receiving.
