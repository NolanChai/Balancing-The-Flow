You find yourself on the shores of the island of Wano, known for its lush vegetation and clear blue waters. The sun is setting, casting a warm glow across the sky. Before you lies the entrance to the village of Portgas D.Ace, home to the famous pirate captain Monkey D. Luffy and his crew. To the left, you see a small fishing boat bobbing up and down on the waves.
