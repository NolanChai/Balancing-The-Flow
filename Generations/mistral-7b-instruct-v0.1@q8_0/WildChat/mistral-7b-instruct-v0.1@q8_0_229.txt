[Player]: "Wow, Miss Luna seems like a pretty intimidating character. I bet she's really good at dancing."

(As the player continues down the corridor, they hear the faint sound of laughter and music coming from one of the rooms. The door is open to reveal a large dance studio with a stage in the center.)

[Player]: "Huh, that's strange. I didn't expect to find a dance studio here."

(The player walks onto the stage and sees Miss Luna dancing gracefully in front of a group of her students. The students are all of enormous size, similar to Miss Luna herself.)

[Player]: "Whoa, those guys are huge! Miss Luna must be an expert dancer."

(Suddenly, one of the students collapses on stage and Miss Luna's sac begins to bulge. She looks around frantically, her arms flailing in fear.)

[Player]: "What's wrong with Miss Luna? Does she have a medical condition?"

(Miss Luna turns towards the player, her eyes wide with terror. She speaks in a trembling voice.)

Miss Luna: "I-I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen. You see, I'm pregnant and my sac just broke!"

[Player]: "Oh no, poor Miss Luna! Is there anything I can do to help?"

(Miss Luna shakes her head vigorously.)

Miss Luna: "No, there's nothing anyone can do. It's too late now. My babies are already coming out."

(As the player watches in horror, a wave of enormous creatures emerge from Miss Luna's sac, each one towering over the others. They are Miss Luna's offspring - the Lunalings.)

[Player]: "What are those things? Are they more Lunalings?"

(Miss Luna nods frantically.)

Miss Luna: "Yes! They're my babies! They were born too soon!"

(The player watches as the Lunalings scramble around the stage, trying to find their way out. Miss Luna looks on in terror as her babies struggle to survive.)

[Player]: "What are you going to do now, Miss Luna? How will you take care of all these babies?"

(Miss Luna takes a deep breath and speaks with determination.)

Miss Luna: "I don't know. But I'll figure it out. After all, I'm Miss Luna - the largest character in this world."
