I see, thank you for clarifying! So, to summarize, the license is renewed monthly or annually based on the membership period selected at the time of subscription. The annual subscription provides access to the service for one year from the date of subscription. Is that correct?

Translation: 
"We apologize for any confusion caused by our previous explanation of the license renewal process. The license renewal occurs on a monthly basis, regardless of the length of your membership, which could be monthly or annual."

This text appears to be a transcription of an apology message that was sent from a company to one of their customers named Chris Milam. In this message, the company acknowledges that there may have been confusion surrounding the renewal process for their license, which is renewed either monthly or annually depending on the customer's chosen membership period. The company apologizes for any inconvenience caused and hopes to provide clearer information in the future.
