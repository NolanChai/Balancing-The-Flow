To make the gradient visible, you can apply a linear gradient to the `.highlight-line` class instead of using a single color. You can also adjust the direction and stop points of the gradient to match your desired effect. Here's an example:
```css
@keyframes shot {
  from {
    left: 0%;
    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255, 1, 3, 0), rgba(0, 0, 255, 0));
  }
  to {
    left: 100%;
    background-image: radial-gradient(circle at center right, rgba(255, 1, 3, 0.9), rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.9));
  }
}
```
This gradient transitions from a solid color (red for the left side) to a radial gradient (blue for the right side). You can adjust the colors and stop points to match your desired effect.
