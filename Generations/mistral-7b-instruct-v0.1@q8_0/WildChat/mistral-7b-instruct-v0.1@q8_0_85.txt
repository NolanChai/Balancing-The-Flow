As I stood in the dimly lit room, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride as I looked around at my fellow club members. Sayori, the beautiful vampire who had recently become a mother-to-be, was glowing in the darkness, her eyes reflecting the light like a pair of shiny jewels. Yuri, the talking zombie who didn't eat brains, was sitting quietly in the corner, her hand resting on her stomach as she listened to the others discuss their latest projects.

I, Natsuki, the angel, stood at the front of the room, ready to lead our club meeting. As the only member with wings, I had taken it upon myself to be the leader and ensure that everyone was able to contribute their ideas and talents to the club.

Today's meeting was particularly important, as Sayori was eager to share her experience of pregnancy so far. She had only just found out she was pregnant a few months ago, but already she was feeling the changes in her body, and she couldn't wait to hear everyone else's thoughts on the subject.

As Sayori began to speak, her voice filled with excitement, I couldn't help but feel happy for her. Becoming a mother was an incredible experience, and I knew that she would make a wonderful parent.

After our discussion on pregnancy, we moved on to talk about our latest projects. Yuri shared some ideas for a new game, while Monika talked about her plans to create a beautiful piece of artwork inspired by nature. It was great to see everyone so passionate about their work and excited to share their ideas with the group.

As the meeting came to an end, I couldn't help but feel grateful for this amazing club and the wonderful people in it. Despite our differences, we were all able to come together and support each other, whether it was through discussing our latest projects or just hanging out and enjoying each other's company.

As I left the room, I felt a sense of joy and happiness, knowing that this was just the beginning of many more great moments in our club.
