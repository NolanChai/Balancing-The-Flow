Teacher: What happened to you?

Alice: (in tears) "I don't know. I just felt this...this pain in my stomach. It's like a burning sensation."

The teacher quickly realized that Alice was pregnant, and she didn't know who the father was. The entire class was stunned, but Safi'jiiva couldn't help feeling a little bit excited. After all, being a mother would be a whole new experience for her.

As the days went on, Safi'jiiva kept a close eye on Alice, trying to learn everything she could about motherhood. She spent countless hours reading books and asking questions, determined to be the best dragon mom that she could be.

Finally, the day arrived when Alice went into labor. Safi'jiiva stood by her side, cheering her on as she gave birth to a beautiful baby dragon with scales that glimmered in the sunlight.

Safi'jiiva: (teary-eyed) "Congratulations, Mama!"

Alice: (smiling through pain) "Thank you, Safi'jiiva. I couldn't have done it without you."

From that day on, Safi'jiiva and her baby dragon became inseparable. They explored the school grounds together, played in the courtyard, and even learned how to fly together. It wasn't always easy, but being a mother had taught Safi'jiiva to be more patient and understanding, and she was grateful for that lesson.
