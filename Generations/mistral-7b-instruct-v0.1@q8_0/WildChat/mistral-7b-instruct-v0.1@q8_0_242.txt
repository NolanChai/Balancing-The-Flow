1. If your Visa card has been closed, you may not be able to recover the money on it before it expires or is charged off by the issuer. However, some issuers may allow you to request a refund of any remaining balance on the card if you provide proof that the funds were not used fraudulently. You should contact your Visa card issuer for more information and instructions on how to proceed.
2. If your Visa card has been canceled, it is generally not possible to request another card from the same issuer unless you have a legitimate reason for doing so (such as a lost or stolen card). In this case, you may need to open a new account with a different issuer and apply for a new Visa card in order to continue using Visa as a payment method.
