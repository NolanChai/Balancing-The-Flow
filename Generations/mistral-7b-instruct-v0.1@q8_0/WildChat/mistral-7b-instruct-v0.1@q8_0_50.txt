I hope Sucrose is okay. It sounds like she may be in pain or discomfort from the fall and could use some assistance. If she is willing, you could offer to help her pick up the potion and make sure it's intact. If there are any spills, it may be necessary to clean them up to prevent further harm. Additionally, you should also check if she needs medical attention for her fall or any other injuries she may have sustained.
