The story begins with a catastrophic thermonuclear war that devastated the world and reduced the United States to remote holdouts scattered across the country. For years, various factions fought for power, but eventually a technological regression occurred as modern technology was damaged or destroyed in the war. Despite some knowledge being saved, much of it was lost. Over time, America gradually rebuilt itself into a society based on neo-medievalism with warlords and roving gangs fighting for power. However, global trade eventually began to reconnect America with the rest of the world and humanity's population slowly began to grow again.

The rebirth of global trade led to the spread of "new" ideas, technology, and goods. Cities such as Eureka in California became hubs of commerce and the country gradually unified under the leadership of Henry Santos. By 2133 AD, America had been completely rebuilt and transformed into a Grand Republic with the sun finally rising over it.

Since then, America has rapidly changed at a breakneck speed. A massive road connecting the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean was completed, allowing people to travel across the country quickly without fear of banditry. Cities sprang up where there were once small settlements and America became a prosperous nation. The government is now in charge of most things and controls many aspects of society.

Despite the government's power, the Senate remains influential as they are responsible for electing the Potus (President), although Henry Santos, the last Potus, is still alive and ruling as President for life. There is a political drama in which Republicans are trying to replace the hereditary nature of the Potusial title with a republican structure centered around the Senate. Additionally, Mexico was not affected by the war as much as America and has rebuilt itself into a major power that supplies oil to the Republic and is its main economic partner.

I'm glad you asked about stability in the Republic. The Republic has been established for over 10,000 years and has faced numerous challenges throughout its history. However, through strong leadership and unity among its citizens, it has remained a stable and thriving society.

One of the factors that contribute to the stability of the Republic is its commitment to the principles of democracy and human rights. These values are deeply ingrained in the fabric of the Republic and are upheld by its leaders and citizens alike.

Another factor is the Republic's strong economy. It has a diversified economy, with a thriving agricultural sector, advanced technology, and a growing tourism industry. This economic stability provides a foundation for the prosperity of its citizens.

Finally, the Republic has a well-trained military that is dedicated to protecting its citizens and borders. Its leaders have made strategic alliances with other nations and are always prepared to defend the Republic in the face of external threats.

In summary, while there may be challenges ahead for the Republic, it remains a stable and prosperous society due to its commitment to democracy and human rights, strong economy, and well-trained military.

The system of a parliamentary republic, where the president is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government, can have several potential issues. Here are a few:

1. Separation of Powers: While a parliamentary system separates powers among different branches, it can also create confusion about who has the final say in decision-making. For example, if the president and the prime minister disagree on how to handle an issue, it can lead to deadlock or other political crises.
2. Accountability: Because the president is largely a ceremonial figurehead in a parliamentary system, they may not be held accountable for their actions. This can create a lack of transparency and trust in government.
3. Fragile Coalitions: A parliamentary system relies on coalitions to form a government. If these coalitions become too fragile or if a single party gains control of the government, it can lead to political instability and polarization.
4. Potential for Corruption: In any system of government, there is always the potential for corruption. In a parliamentary system, however, this can be amplified because the president may have less power to remove corrupt officials from office.
5. Role Ambiguity: The role of the president in a parliamentary system can be ambiguous and subject to interpretation. Depending on the specific laws and traditions of the country, the president's responsibilities may vary widely, leading to confusion about what they are supposed to do.
