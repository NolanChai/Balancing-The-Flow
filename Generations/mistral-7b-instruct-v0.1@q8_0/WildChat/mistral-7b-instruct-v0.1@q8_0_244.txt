In summary, the overall effectiveness of cascade CO2RR catalytic systems is largely dependent on the conversion efficiency and energy efficiency of the upstream CO2 reduction process. The optimization of catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions is critical to achieving high CO2 single-pass conversion efficiency (SPCE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the CO2RR stage.
