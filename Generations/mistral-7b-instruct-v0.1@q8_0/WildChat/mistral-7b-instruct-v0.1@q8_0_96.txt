The production test in 1996 showed that salt plugging had occurred in the produced fluid due to accumulation, which prevented the flow of fluids through the 3.5" tubing and the surface system. To remove the old 3.5"-2.875" completion, a costly fishing job was planned to avoid. However, this did not happen easily, and instead, the 2.375" tubing was run inside the old completion. Fresh water was injected through the 3.5" - 2.375" annulus, and oil production continued on 2.375" tubing.

The cleaning job for the tubing was performed on September 14th, 2015 by pumping 6 cubic meters of 15% inhibited acid and 7 cubic meters of flushing water. The well flowed smoothly with no problems during Monday night of 14th September 2015 and Tuesday, with a working pressure (WHP) of 35 bar, a cap rate (CP) of 30 bar, a maximum allowable pressure (MA) of 27 bar, a fluid level pressure (FLP) of 17 bar, an injection rate of 6 cubic meters per day. However, on Wednesday morning, the MA (injection) pressure dropped off to zero, and the CP began to drop as well. By noon the same day, WHP=20bar, CP=0bar, MA=0bar. At night the same day, the injection rate was put back to 6 cubic meters per day, and then to 3 cubic meters per day.
