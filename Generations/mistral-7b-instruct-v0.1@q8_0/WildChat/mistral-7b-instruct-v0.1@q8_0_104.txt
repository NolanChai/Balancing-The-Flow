Scene 1:

You are standing in the bustling streets of Portgasdor, a city on the outskirts of the Great Eastern Empire. The air is thick with the smell of fish and sea salt, and the sound of seagulls can be heard echoing through the narrow alleys. In front of you lies the entrance to the Red Light District, where many sailors come to relax after a long day at sea. To your left is a blacksmith's shop, where you can purchase weapons and armor. To your right is a tavern, where you can grab a drink or a bite to eat. What would you like to do?
