Title: The Struggle for Power: A Nazi Civil War

Opening shot: October 1963, Germany. Hitler's reign has ended after his death in August 1962. The country is thrown into chaos as the Nazi party struggles to decide on a successor.

Albert Speer - reformist architect and industrialist, he believes in rebuilding Germany through peaceful means and wants to focus on economic development. He's seen working on designs for new buildings and infrastructure projects.

Martin Bormann - conservative politician and SS leader, he wants to maintain the status quo and maintain the Nazi party's power and control over Germany. He's seen giving orders to his troops and holding meetings with other Nazi leaders.

Hermann Göring - warhawk and Reichsmarschall, he believes that Germany needs to be militarily strong and wants to expand its territory. He's seen leading military parades and giving speeches about the need for a strong army.

Reinhard Heydrich - SS butcher and former HSSPF (Hauptsturmführer der Schutzstaffel) leader, he is known for his ruthless tactics and willingness to use violence to maintain control. He's seen giving orders to his troops and carrying out executions.

As the struggle for power intensifies, Speer tries to negotiate with Bormann and Göring to find a peaceful solution, but they refuse to listen. Heydrich becomes more and more aggressive in his attempts to maintain control, using violence and intimidation to suppress any opposition.

In the end, Göring emerges as the most powerful figure and is able to seize control of the Nazi party. However, his reign is short-lived as he is eventually arrested and put on trial for war crimes.

The film ends with Speer and Bormann both reflecting on their actions and the consequences they faced. Heydrich's fate remains unknown as he disappeared during the war and was never found.
