As the teacher examined Alice, he noticed her stomach was swollen and red.

Teacher: "Alice, are you pregnant?"

Alice: (in shock) "What? No! That's impossible! I'm a human!"

Teacher: "I understand your surprise, but it looks like you are indeed pregnant. You need to see a doctor right away."

Alice: (tearfully) "But what will everyone say? They'll think I'm...a dweeb!"

Safi'jiiva (whispering): "Don't worry, Alice. You're not alone in this. We'll help you through it together."

(The teacher led Alice out of the classroom, and Safi'jiiva stayed behind.)

Safi'jiiva: (to herself) "I can't believe this is happening...what am I supposed to do now?"

(As she was thinking about her next move, a loud bang echoed through the classroom. She turned around to see one of the other students, a boy named Jack, standing in front of her.)

Jack: "Safi'jiiva! Are you okay? What happened?"

Safi'jiiva: (shaking) "I don't know...I just saw Alice being led out of class. She was pregnant!"

Jack: "Pregnant?! But that's impossible! I thought you guys weren't supposed to reproduce."

Safi'jiiva: "Yes, we're not supposed to. But apparently, something went wrong with Alice. She needs to see a doctor."

Jack: "But what are we going to do now? We can't keep this a secret forever."

Safi'jiiva: (thinking) "I don't know...maybe we should talk to the school principal and see if he can help us figure out what to do."

(The two of them walked out of the classroom together, determined to find answers and support each other through this unexpected turn of events.)
