"What the hell is going on?" I gasped as I looked at the wreckage of MC's UFO. "We thought he was a human," said Sayori, her voice shaking with fear.

"I can't believe this," exclaimed Yuri, her eyes wide with shock. "He just suddenly crashed into us."

"But why?" asked Monika, her face etched with concern. "What could have possibly caused such an accident?"

As we continued to discuss the strange turn of events, MC slowly regained consciousness. He looked around at the wreckage and let out a deep sigh.

"I'm so sorry," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "I didn't mean for any of this to happen."

We all exchanged puzzled glances as we tried to piece together what could have led to such a devastating accident. And as the night wore on, it became clear that MC was not like us - he was an alien from another planet, and his presence in our world was anything but ordinary.
