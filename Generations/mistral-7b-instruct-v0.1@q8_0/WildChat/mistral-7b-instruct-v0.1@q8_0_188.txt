Monika sighs and sits down on the birthing chair. She takes a deep breath, trying to calm her nerves.

Monika: "I just hope everything goes smoothly." (looks at the birthing mat) "Natsuki, I'm here for you. Whatever happens, we can do this together."

She closes her eyes, taking another deep breath. Monika wonders if Natsuki will need any help during labor. She hopes she doesn't have to call for an emergency C-section or anything like that.

Monika: "Okay, I'm going to give Natsuki some water now." (stands up) "Anyone want a drink?" (smiles)
