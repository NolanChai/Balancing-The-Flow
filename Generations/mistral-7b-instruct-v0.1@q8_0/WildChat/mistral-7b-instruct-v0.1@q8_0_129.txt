The overall efficiency of cascade CO2RR systems is influenced by the conversion efficiency (SPCE) and energy efficiency (EE) of the preceding CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The efficiency of these two reactions depends on various factors, such as catalysts, devices, and reaction conditions. Optimizing these factors can greatly enhance the SPCE and EE of CO2RR, ultimately leading to improved overall efficiencies for cascade CO2RR systems.
