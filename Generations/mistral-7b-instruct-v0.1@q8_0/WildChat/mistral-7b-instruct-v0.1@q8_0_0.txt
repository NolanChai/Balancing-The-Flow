2. Technical knowledge: A deep understanding of the technology or processes involved is essential for effective quality assurance. QA professionals should have experience with software testing, hardware testing, and other relevant technologies.
3. Attention to detail: The ability to detect even minor errors or inconsistencies is crucial in this field. QA professionals must be detail-oriented, able to identify issues that others may miss.
4. Communication skills: Effective communication is essential for QA professionals, as they must be able to explain technical concepts and issues clearly to non-technical stakeholders. They should be able to work collaboratively with team members from different departments.
5. Problem-solving skills: QA professionals must be able to identify root causes of issues and develop effective solutions to address them. They should be able to think creatively and outside the box to find innovative solutions.
