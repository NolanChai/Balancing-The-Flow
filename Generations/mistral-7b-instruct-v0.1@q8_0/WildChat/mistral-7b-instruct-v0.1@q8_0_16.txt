The output of this code will be 5.

This is because the variable `z` is initialized to negative infinity (-inf). Then, the loop iterates over each element in the list `x`, and compares it with `z`. If the current element in `x` is greater than `z`, then `z` is updated to that value.

For example, when `w` is 0, `x[0]` (1) is compared with `z` (-inf), and since 1 is greater than -inf, `z` is updated to 1. Then, when `w` is 1, `x[1]` (2) is compared with `z` (1), and again, 2 is greater than 1, so `z` is updated to 2. This process continues until the end of the loop, at which point the final value of `z` is 5, which is printed out.
