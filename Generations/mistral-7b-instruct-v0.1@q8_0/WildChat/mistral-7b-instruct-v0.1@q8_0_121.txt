Amber: (pacing nervously in her room) Something isn't right... My little firecracker hasn't been moving as much as usual.

(She reaches for her phone and dials her friend's number.)

Amber: (voice trembling) Hi, it's Amber. I just woke up and I noticed that my baby isn't moving as much as usual. Can you come over and check on me?

Friend: (listening intently on the phone) Sure thing, Amber. I'll be there in 10 minutes.

(Amber takes a deep breath and tries to calm herself down while waiting for her friend to arrive.)
