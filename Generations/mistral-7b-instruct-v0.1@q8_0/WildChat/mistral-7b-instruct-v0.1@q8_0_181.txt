Scene: Jane's room

Jane: (sitting on her bed, looking worried) What is going on?

Andrea: (entering Jane's room, looking distressed) I got arrested.

Jane: (jumping out of bed) What?! Why were you arrested?

Andrea: (pacing the room) I don't know. They said it was for a drug bust, but I swear I don't know anything about that.

Jane: (putting her arm around Andrea) Don't worry, we'll figure this out together.

Andrea: (sighing) I just hope they let me go soon.

Jane: (nodding) They will. We'll get you out of there as soon as possible.

Andrea: (looking defeated) Thanks, Jane. I don't know what I would do without you.

Jane: (smiling) That's what I'm here for. Now let me see if there's anything I can do to help.
