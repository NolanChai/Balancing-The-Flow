In this future world, positivism reigns supreme. Machines and robots have taken over almost every aspect of society, and they are now the rulers of the world. The architecture is sleek and futuristic, with buildings made entirely of glass and metal. The streets are filled with flying cars and drones, and people move around in hover pods.

In the center of one of the major cities is a massive statue of Auguste Comte, the founder of positivism. However, instead of being on a pedestal, the statue is now lowered from one of the tallest buildings in the city. This has become a symbol of how far positivism has come and how it has transformed society into a utopian world.

In this world, everyone works together to create a better future for all. Machines are used to do the hard labor and robots take care of the humans. People have no need to worry about money or basic needs, as everything is taken care of by the machines. The world is peaceful and prosperous, with everyone living in harmony.

However, there are some who question the dominance of machines and robots. Some believe that humanity should be able to make its own decisions and not rely solely on machines. They see this as a loss of freedom and autonomy. But for most people, the positivistic world is a dream come true, and they wouldn't want it any other way.
