ads for the new World's Fair in New York, and I thought it might be a good time to visit some old friends who had emigrated there.

The elevator doors opened, and I stepped out onto the floor with a sense of déjà vu. The smell of hot dogs and popcorn was overwhelming; it brought back memories of my childhood in Poland, when my parents would take me to fairs and amusement parks on weekends. I felt grateful for this small slice of familiarity in an otherwise foreign land.

As I made my way through the crowds, I saw a tall man standing near a booth selling souvenirs. He was dressed in a crisp white shirt and dark slacks, with a bow tie that seemed almost out of place amidst the chaos of the fairgrounds. His face was angular and severe, but there was something about his eyes that made me feel drawn to him.

We struck up a conversation as we waited for our turn at the booth, discussing everything from politics to art. It turned out that he was an American historian, here studying the progress of technology and industry since the war. He spoke with such passion and knowledge that I couldn't help but be intrigued by him.

When our time came, we both stepped forward to buy our souvenirs. As I handed over my money, I noticed a small pin on his lapel - a simple star made of red enamel, the symbol of the resistance movement in Poland during the war. I felt a sudden surge of pride; here was someone who understood what it meant to fight for freedom and justice.

We exchanged numbers, promising to keep in touch as we continued our exploration of the fair. Over the next few days, we met up again and again, each time discovering new shared interests and experiences. We talked about everything from literature to music, and I found myself learning more about America and its culture than ever before.

As our time in New York came to an end, I knew that I would never forget the man who had shown me the beauty of this strange new world. In him, I saw a reflection of my own struggles and triumphs - a fellow traveler on the journey towards freedom and self-discovery. And as I boarded my plane to return home, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the unexpected encounter that had changed my life forever.
