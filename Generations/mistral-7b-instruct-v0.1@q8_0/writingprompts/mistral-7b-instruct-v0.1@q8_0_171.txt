metry and it's fascinating how simple shapes can be so complex in their combinations. However, as with most things, it's hard to find a balance between being too rigidly formulaic and completely random.

I have had some good conversations about this topic with others, particularly in regards to the creation of music. Sometimes there is an over-reliance on a formula or structure that can lead to a lack of creativity and individuality. On the other hand, relying too heavily on a completely random approach can result in a lack of cohesion and purpose within the work. 

It's important to strike a balance between the two, to find some kind of middle ground that allows for both structure and creativity. For me, I often find it helpful to have a clear plan or idea before starting to create something, but also leaving room for spontaneity and experimentation along the way. It's all about finding what works best for you and your creative process.
