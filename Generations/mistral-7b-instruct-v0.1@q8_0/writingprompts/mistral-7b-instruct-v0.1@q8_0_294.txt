the whispers of the wind and the cries of the wolves 
 
 For they are merely sounds that do not make sense to us 
 
 Instead, listen for the hum of the earth, for it is what will guide us 
 
 The cave's entrance, we must dig with our bare hands 
 
 And as we reach it, we must step inside, closing the door behind us 
 
 The darkness, so thick and so deep 
 
 It seems to swallow all light, leaving only shadows 
 
 But fear not, for in the center of the cave lies our prize 
 
 A key that will unlock the fourth wall 
 
 To obtain it, we must defeat a great beast 
 
 A monster of epic proportions and strength 
 
 We must fight with all our might 
 
 And when we emerge victorious, we will claim our prize 
 
 The key to breaking down the fourth wall 
 
 With it in hand, we can return to reality 
 
 And the world beyond the wall, we shall conquer 
 
 The possibilities endless 
 
 For now, let us prepare for battle 
 
 And may the odds be ever in our favor
