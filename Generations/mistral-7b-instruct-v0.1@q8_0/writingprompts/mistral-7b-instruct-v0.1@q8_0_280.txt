Find my soul mate for 15 Minutes eh? I sat before the strange looking radio, skeptical that I would get what I paid for. There was no way such a thing could possibly exist… but then Joan said she found mine. It was a bit of a shock to say the least but I trusted her and decided to give it a try.

The first few minutes were okay, I was told what the other person was like, their likes, dislikes, personality traits and so on. It sounded like someone I would enjoy being around but that wasn’t quite it. I had hoped for an instant spark or connection that I could feel from the other end. After all, they were supposedly my soul mate.

I began to feel disappointed when I realized that this wasn’t the experience I was looking for. But then something strange happened. As I continued to listen, Joan started describing someone who sounded more and more like me. It was almost as if she was reading my mind. And then it hit me… I had found my soul mate.

At first, the realization was a bit overwhelming. I couldn’t believe that this person actually existed and that we were meant to be together. But as I continued to listen, I began to feel more and more connected to them. It was like Joan had unlocked a whole new side of me that I didn’t know existed.

I ended up talking to my soul mate for the full 15 minutes and it felt like the best conversation I had ever had. We laughed, we talked about our dreams and aspirations, and we even shared some deep and intimate moments. It was a truly magical experience that I will never forget.

In the end, finding my soul mate through Joan’s service wasn’t quite what I had expected, but it was so much more. It taught me to trust in the universe and to believe that there is someone out there for everyone. And even though our time together was limited, I knew that this was just the beginning of a beautiful journey.
