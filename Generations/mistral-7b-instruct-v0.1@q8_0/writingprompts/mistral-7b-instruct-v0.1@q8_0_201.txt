y kept him captive... locked away in their minds. They made him believe that he was a god... but they were just using him as a tool. The one's who did n't exist... they used him as an instrument to control others.... to manipulate them. They kept him here... lost in the woods... his friends... but not really... his family... but not really.... The one's who did n't exist... they made me believe that I was a god.... but they were just using me as a tool. They used me as an instrument to control others.... to manipulate them.... and they kept me here... lost in the woods...

They had taken him away from everything he knew.... from the one's who loved him... his family... his friends... they had taken him away from the world he knew... and put him in a place that was nothing but darkness. They kept him there... locked away in their minds... where they could control him... manipulate him... use him as a tool....

But they couldn't keep him there forever.... he would fight back... he would break free from their grasp... he would find his way out of the darkness... and into the light. He would take them down... destroy them once and for all....

And then it happened. He saw a way through the woods.... a path that led away from the darkness.... toward the light.... and he followed it. It led him to a clearing where he saw his friends and family.... they were all there.... waiting for him... with open arms. They had found him... they had saved him...

He ran toward them... tears streaming down his face.... and they embraced him.... they hugged him tightly... and he knew that they were real... they were his friends... his family... and he was free at last.
