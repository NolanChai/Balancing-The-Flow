ulking frame and an intense gaze that seems to bore into me. His clothes are tattered and dirty, and he smells like sweat and stale cigarette smoke. I can see the stains on his shirt from some long-forgotten fight or accident, and I can tell that he's been living on the streets for a while now. 
 
 He doesn't say much as we drive through the city, but I can tell he's watching me. Every time I glance over at him, he's staring back at me with those cold, dead eyes. It's like he's trying to figure out something about me, and I don't know what it is. 
 
 Finally, we reach our destination - a dilapidated old house on the edge of town. He gets out of the car and starts walking towards the front door, but I stop him. "Where are you going?" I ask, my voice trembling with fear. 
 
 He turns to face me, his expression dark and menacing. "I have a place to be," he growls, his hand reaching for the doorknob. "Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go." 
 
 I nod nervously, not wanting to get in his way. As he walks away, I can't help but feel like something terrible is about to happen. I should have never picked up that hitchhiker - I should have just kept driving. 

 But now it's too late. I'm stuck here, alone with this stranger, and I don't know what to do.
