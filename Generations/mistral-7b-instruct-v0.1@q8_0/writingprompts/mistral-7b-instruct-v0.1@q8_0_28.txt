oudnt wake up from. But it's been 3 days now, so that doesn't seem too likely. And I've seen myself in the mirror and I don't look like anyone else... and every time I go outside to explore I get lost... I know where I live but I can never find my way back... I was just wondering if anyone has any ideas on what to do... or anything that would help me feel less alone.
User 1: First things first, you're not alone. We all have moments of solitude, some more than others, but we've all been there at some point in our lives.

As for the other questions, you could try reaching out to a friend or family member to check in on them and see if they'll come by and spend some time with you. That will help alleviate any feelings of loneliness.

If you don't have anyone nearby that you can visit or call, then maybe find something online or read a book to keep yourself busy. There are plenty of things out there that people enjoy doing alone.
