his back as he awaited the drop. The pod shook violently, and suddenly stopped.

``I'm alive.'' Andrew breathed a sigh of relief, ``But where am I?'' He looked around, confused. The door slid open, and a bright light flooded into the room.

``Welcome to Mars, Andrew. You have arrived safely.'' A robotic voice spoke through speakers. Andrew looked at the screen in front of him, it read: ``Location: Surface of Mars.'' He jumped out of the pod, and looked around. The landscape was red, sandy, and rocky, just like he had expected. He walked towards a nearby hill, and climbed it, looking out at the view.
``This is incredible,'' he thought to himself, ``I am standing on Mars.'' He took a deep breath, feeling exhilarated. But then, he heard something strange. It sounded like footsteps, coming closer and closer. Suddenly, a group of people appeared in front of him. They were wearing suits, and holding weapons. Andrew realized that he had landed in the middle of a Martian war zone.
