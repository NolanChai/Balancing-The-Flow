os and had been trying to get into his apartment for over an hour. With the new system, only authorized personnel could enter their own apartments. The previous one didn't require any kind of identification, but that had changed after last week's break-ins. 

 Ardin swiped his card and stepped into his apartment. He closed the door behind him and let out a sigh of relief. He turned on the lights, scanning the room quickly to see if everything was in place. The living room looked fine, but he knew better than to trust his eyes. They had been known to deceive him before. 

 He walked into his bedroom, where he found the bedsheet neatly tucked into the corners and the pillowcases turned right-side out. He sighed again and collapsed onto the bed. He was exhausted from the day's events, but he knew he couldn't afford to rest just yet. 

 He pulled out his communicator and called his personal assistant, Rachel. "Rachel, are you there?" 

 "Yes, Senator Ardin," she replied. "How can I help you?" 

"I need your help," he said, "I need to see what's going on with the new system. It seems to be malfunctioning." 

"Understood, Senator," she replied. "I'll send a technician right away." 

Ardin sighed and sat up in bed. He knew this was just another headache he didn't need right now. He needed to rest and get ready for the meeting tomorrow. The meeting would be with the president of Atlantia, and it was something he couldn't afford to miss. 

He lay back down on the bed and closed his eyes, trying to clear his mind. But he couldn't shake the feeling that this was just the beginning of a much bigger problem.
