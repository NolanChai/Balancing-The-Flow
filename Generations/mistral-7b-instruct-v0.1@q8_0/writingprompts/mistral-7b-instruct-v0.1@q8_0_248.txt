was a small town with only one gas station and one supermarket. The main street had three shops; a bakery, a barber shop, and Greg's toy shop. They were the only businesses on the street. The town was dead, almost like a ghost town. It was an old-fashioned place where people still went to church every Sunday and kids rode their bikes down the road instead of going on their phones.

 Greg had opened his toy shop hoping to make some money, but he barely broke even. The only time he saw customers was during Christmas or birthdays. He would spend hours setting up his displays, creating a magical atmosphere in his store. But it never seemed to attract enough people.

 It was on one of these quiet days that Greg met Mary. She had just turned ten and walked into his shop looking for birthday presents for her friends. Mary was tall and had curly red hair. Her eyes sparkled with curiosity as she looked around the store.
`` Hey, can i help you find something?'' Greg said to her.
`` Yeah, I need some presents for my friends,'' Mary replied. `` Do you have anything special?''
`` Well, we just got in a new shipment of action figures,'' Greg said, holding up a box with a picture of a G.I. Joe figure on it. `` They're pretty cool, but they're kind of expensive.''
`` How much are they?" Mary asked.
`` Twenty-five dollars," Greg replied.
`` Wow, that's a lot," Mary said, looking confused.
`` Yeah, but they're really cool," Greg said.
`` Can you show me some other options?" Mary asked.
`` Sure thing." Greg led her to the back of the store and opened up a new box. He pulled out a few more action figures, each one more impressive than the last. There was a Spider-Man figure, an Iron Man figure, and a Batman figure.
`` These are our most popular," Greg said. `` But if you're looking for something cheaper, we have some toy cars or dolls."
`` Thanks," Mary said, picking up a Spider-Man action figure. "This one looks pretty cool."
`` Yeah, it's a great one," Greg said. Mary paid with her parents' credit card and left the store.
`` Wow, that was easy," Greg thought to himself as he watched Mary leave. He couldn't believe how much she had paid for the action figure. But he was glad to have made a sale.
`` It's been a slow day," Greg said to himself as he tidied up the store. He knew things would pick up during the holiday season, but he had to make it through the next ten months until then.
