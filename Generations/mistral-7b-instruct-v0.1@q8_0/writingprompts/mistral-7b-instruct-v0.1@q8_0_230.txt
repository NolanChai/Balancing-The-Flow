an addiction for me and I spent most of my free time reading comics.

But one day, I started to realize that being a superhero was not all fun and games. Sure, it may seem exciting to save the world from evil but it also comes with great responsibility. For example, when I was reading about Batman, I wondered how he could afford his high-tech gadgets and maintain his secret identity while still saving the city from crime. It seemed impossible.

I then started to think about the psychological effects of being a superhero. Wouldn't it be stressful to always be in the spotlight? And what if they made a mistake? They could potentially put the entire world at risk. It was all very overwhelming for me.

After a while, I realized that being a superhero wasn't something I wanted to become. Instead, I decided to focus on making a positive impact on my own life and the lives of those around me. It may not be as exciting as saving the world but it's still rewarding in its own way.
