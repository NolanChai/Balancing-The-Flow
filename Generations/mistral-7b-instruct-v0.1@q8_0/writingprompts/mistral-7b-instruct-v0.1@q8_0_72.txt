Once again I heard the knock at the door, and calmly left the office room in my house to go answer it. But it was not the front door I went to, nor the back door. Instead, I went to the door leading to the kitchen, which was ajar.

As soon as I entered, I saw that my mother had been waiting for me, and she greeted me with her usual smile.

“Son, your father just called me and told me he won’t be back until later tonight,” she said. “He asked if you could come over to the house for dinner.”

I smiled at her and nodded my head in agreement. I knew that it had been a busy day for both of us, so I welcomed the opportunity to spend some time with my family.

“Sure, Mom, I can do that,” I said. “Do you want me to pick up some groceries on the way?”

My mother nodded and gave me a list of items that she needed from the grocery store. I promised to grab them on my way over to her house.

As soon as I left my office, I headed down the street towards my mother’s home. It was a short walk, but it was nice to finally get some fresh air and enjoy the sights and sounds of the neighborhood.

When I arrived at her house, I could smell delicious aromas wafting through the air, and I knew that dinner was about to start. I rang the bell and my mother answered, welcoming me inside with a big hug.

As we sat down to eat, we shared stories about our days and caught up on the latest news and developments in our lives. It was a wonderful feeling to be surrounded by love and support from family, especially after such a long day at work.

After dinner, my mother and I watched a movie together, sipping coffee and enjoying each other’s company. As we said goodnight and I headed back home, I felt grateful for the time we had spent together, and I knew that I would look forward to many more opportunities to catch up with my family in the future.
