ctored. The lottery system used by the government was a cruel game, one that could make or break your life in an instant. And I had already lost enough times to know better than to hope.

 I groped around the dark room for my phone charger and plugged it into my device, praying that the battery would hold up long enough for me to access the app. With a deep breath, I opened my eyes and stared at the screen, waiting for the numbers to appear.

 They did. My heart began racing as I read them off: 1, 3, 2, 5, 6, and 8. This was it. My fate had been decided. The next step would determine whether I would be given a chance at the life I wanted or be condemned to continue in my current misery.

 I opened up the app's messaging feature and typed out my message: "Please inform me of my assigned job." As I hit send, I could feel my stomach churning with anticipation. This was it. My moment of truth.

 A few minutes later, my phone buzzed with a response. I eagerly opened the message and read the words that would change my life forever: "Congratulations! You have been assigned as a nurse in a local hospital."

 A wave of relief washed over me. Nursing had always been my dream job, but I had never thought it was possible. With each passing year, my hopes dwindled as more and more people were chosen before me. And now, here I was, finally getting my chance.

 I quickly made arrangements to move into the city where the hospital was located and began preparing myself for the challenges that lay ahead. Nursing was a demanding profession, one that required dedication and hard work. But I was ready. I was determined. And most importantly, I was hopeful.

 As my first day of work approached, I couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. I had made it. Against all odds, I had been chosen. And now, I could finally begin building the life I had always wanted.
