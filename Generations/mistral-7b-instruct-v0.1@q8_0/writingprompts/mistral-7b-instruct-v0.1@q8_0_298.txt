The station had been closed for months and was in disrepair, but tonight they had found shelter there. They huddled together, shivering from the cold and the damp that clung to their clothes like a second skin. 

 There were nine of them in total - seven men, one woman, and one non-binary person who preferred not to be identified by name. They had all been living on the streets for different reasons - some because they couldn't afford housing, some because they had mental health issues that made it difficult for them to find work, and others because they were addicted to drugs or alcohol. 

 But despite their differences, they had found common ground in this desolate place. They shared stories of their struggles, laughed at each other's jokes, and sang songs together around the fire. It was a rare moment of connection in a world that often left them feeling isolated and alone.
