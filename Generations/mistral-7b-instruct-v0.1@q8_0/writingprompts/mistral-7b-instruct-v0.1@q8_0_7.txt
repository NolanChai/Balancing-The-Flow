"Hey," he called out, waving at his neighbor across the street. "Want to come over for some lunch?"

"Sure thing, man." John replied, climbing up the steps to his front porch. "What are we having?"

Christopher walked over, holding up the bag with the food in it. "I got us a double cheeseburger and fries from McDonalds," he said as he handed John the bag.

John took it gratefully and they both headed into his house.

"You're a lifesaver," John said as they sat down at the kitchen table. "I was about to head out there myself."

Christopher grinned. "No problem. Happy to help," he replied, taking a big bite out of his burger.

The two friends talked for hours, enjoying their food and each other's company. They reminisced about old times, caught up on the latest news, and made plans for the future. It was a perfect afternoon in every way.
