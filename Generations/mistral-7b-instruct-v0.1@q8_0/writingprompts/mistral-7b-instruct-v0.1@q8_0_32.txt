lie.
 
 I am not who I seem, I am what others perceive me to be, and that’s always been enough for me.
 
 I am like an empty canvas waiting for someone to paint, but I have painted my own story, with my own colors and brush strokes, and it has been beautiful.
 
 I am like a river flowing through the desert, quenching the thirst of the world around me, but I am also dry inside, yearning for something more.
 
 I am like a bird in flight, soaring through the sky, but sometimes I feel like I’m falling.
 
 I am like a puzzle waiting to be solved, with pieces that don’t quite fit, but it’s still beautiful.
 
 I am like a sunflower facing the sun, basking in its warmth, but also swaying in the wind.
 
 I am not just one thing or another, but a combination of all things, both good and bad.
 
 I am who I am, and that’s enough for me.
