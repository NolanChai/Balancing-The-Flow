rayon Drawing Contest to lead the forces of Hell.

So when it comes down to it, if you want to talk about betrayals, let's talk about how I ended up being the one standing on the precipice of my own destruction.

It started with my little sister, Lucy. She was a good kid, a lot smarter than me and had an even greater sense of loyalty. But she got caught in a trap. A trap laid by the Outsiders. And they killed her.

I could've let it go. I could have mourned her loss and continued to fight my war against them. But something in me changed that day. Something broke.

It was a bloodlust, a hunger for vengeance. A fire that consumed everything in its path. And that fire burned until only one thing remained: my hatred for the Outsiders.

I gathered my troops, my loyalists who had stayed by me through thick and thin. We marched towards the heart of their territory, ready to exact our revenge.

But when we arrived, we found something unexpected. A group of children, huddled together in fear, crying out for help. I hesitated at first, but then I remembered Lucy. And I knew what I had to do.

I ordered my troops to leave them be. To give them a chance to live. It was a risky move, one that could have cost me the war. But it was worth it.

In the end, it didn't matter. The Outsiders killed us all anyway. And I died with Lucy on my mind, knowing that I had made the right choice.

But it wasn't enough for them. They wanted more. More blood, more destruction. And so they kept fighting, even as their own numbers dwindled and their resources dwindled too.

They fought to the bitter end, until there was only one Outsider left standing. A man who had lost everything, who had nothing left to fight for but his own survival.

And that's when I made my final mistake. I let him go. I thought he would just fade away into obscurity, a forgotten memory of the war. But he didn't. He came back with a vengeance, and he brought an army with him. An army of demons, hell-bent on destruction.

And so here we are now, standing on the precipice of our own destruction. Fighting against an enemy that we thought we had defeated. And all because I let one man go. Because I couldn't control my bloodlust, my hatred, my need for vengeance.

It's a bitter pill to swallow. But it's the truth.
