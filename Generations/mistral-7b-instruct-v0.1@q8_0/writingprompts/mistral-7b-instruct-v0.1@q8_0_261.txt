your father's knight, do you not?'' he asked her gently.
 
 She looked into her father's eyes and replied, `` I do, Father. He is kind, brave, loyal and good. And most importantly, he treats me with respect. I have never been so loved or cherished. Why should I not love him back?''
 
 The King nodded, understanding the depth of his daughter's emotions. He knew that he must honor her wishes and allow her to marry the stableboy if that was truly what she wanted. But first, he needed to see if the boy was worthy. And so, he summoned him from the stables and led him before his daughter.
 
 The stableboy knelt down before the King and greeted him respectfully. He then turned to the Princess, took her hand in his and looked deep into her eyes.
 
 ``I love you, my lady,'' he whispered.
 
 The Princess smiled back at him, feeling his warmth and tenderness. She knew that she loved him too and she was grateful for this opportunity to be with him.
 
 The King looked at the two of them, his heart swelling with pride as he saw his daughter so happy. He stood up and nodded at the stableboy.
 
 ``Welcome, my son,'' he said.
 
``Thank you, Father," the stableboy replied.
 
The King turned to his daughter. ``Are you ready to start this journey with him?'' he asked her.
 
She smiled up at him and nodded. ``Yes, I am.''
 
And so, with tears of joy in their eyes, the Princess and her stableboy walked off into the sunset, hand in hand, ready to face whatever adventures lay ahead.
