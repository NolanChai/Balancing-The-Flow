first week on the job.

``Thank you.'' Delia said with a smile, and I knew that I had done just what I was supposed to do. Delias job was not only important but also vital, and it was my duty to treat her with respect and give her whatever she needed, especially something as seemingly mundane as a stapler.
``I'm going to make sure you have everything you need.'' I told her. Delia nodded and thanked me again before she walked out of the room. I could feel my heart sink, knowing that Delia was just another new face in our department, destined to be forgotten like so many others who came before her.

It wasn't long before my phone rang again, this time from my boss, Mr. Johnson. "What the hell is going on in your department?" He demanded. I sighed deeply, knowing that I was about to get in trouble for something that had nothing to do with me. "I don't know, sir." I said honestly. Mr. Johnson scoffed, "You better have a good excuse for that attitude."

"I was just trying to help Delia out," I explained, hoping that he would understand. "She's new here and she needs all the help she can get." Mr. Johnson shook his head, "That doesn't excuse your behavior. You need to be more respectful to your superiors."
``I apologize, sir." I said contritely. Mr. Johnson sighed, "Fine, but make sure you treat everyone with respect from now on." He hung up the phone, leaving me feeling even more guilty.
``What have I done?" I thought to myself. I knew that I had made a mistake, but I didn't know how to fix it. I sat at my desk, staring blankly at the screen in front of me, trying to come up with a plan.

I spent the rest of the day thinking about what I could do to make things right. I decided that the best course of action would be to talk to Delia herself and apologize for my behavior. I went to her desk and found her sitting at her computer, typing away furiously. "Delia?" I called out to her. She looked up from her screen and smiled at me. "Hey there."
``I just wanted to talk to you for a minute," I said, trying to sound casual. Delia nodded, "Sure thing."
``I'm sorry if I came across as rude or disrespectful earlier," I began. Delia looked surprised, "No, you didn't. You were actually very kind to me." I smiled at her, feeling a bit better already. "Well, thank you. It means a lot to me that someone is looking out for me."
``I just wanted to make sure that you had everything you needed," I said honestly. Delia nodded, "Yeah, you were really helpful. Thanks again."
``No problem." I replied, feeling much better now. "If there's anything else I can do to help, just let me know." Delia smiled at me and thanked me again before going back to work.
``I think that went well," I thought to myself as I sat back down at my desk. I felt a sense of relief wash over me, knowing that I had done the right thing. From that day on, I made sure to always treat everyone with respect and kindness, no matter who they were or what their job title was. And Delia, well, she went on to become one of our most valued employees, known for her diligence and dedication to her work.
