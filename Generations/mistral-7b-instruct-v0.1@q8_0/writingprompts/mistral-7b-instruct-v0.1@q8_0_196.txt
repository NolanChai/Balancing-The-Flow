'know, for a mermaid, he does a pretty good job of swimming. 

The water is warm and inviting, and once again, the little mermaid finds herself in trouble. She didn't mean to do anything wrong, but somehow, she ended up near a school of piranhas. She tries to swim away, but her tail gets tangled in a piece of kelp. 

She looks down, trying not to panic. It's been years since she had to deal with fish, and she had no idea how to get out of this mess. Her legs tingle, and she feels herself drifting downwards. 

Suddenly, a bright light illuminates the water. The little mermaid gasps as she sees a human boy staring at her. He's wearing scuba gear, and he looks scared. 

"Hey there!" he calls out, waving his hand at her. "Don't worry, I won't hurt you!" 

She doesn't know what to do. On one hand, she's a mermaid. She could just swim away and forget this ever happened. But on the other hand, she feels kind of sorry for him. He looks so scared. 

She swims closer, curious. As she gets closer, he seems to relax. "Hey, it's nice to meet you!" he says, smiling at her. "I'm Ariel." 

The little mermaid nods slowly. She can't help but feel a pang of familiarity wash over her. She's heard the name before. But where? 

"Ariel?" she repeats, trying to sound more confident. 

"Yeah!" he says excitedly. "I'm Ariel! I heard you were in trouble, and I wanted to help! Are you okay now?" 

She nods again, feeling a bit foolish. She knows that humans can't see her tail or her scales. She should have just swam away. But somehow, she finds herself drawn to this boy. Maybe it's because he looks like a human version of the sea creatures she loves so much. 

"Yeah," she says, trying to sound casual. "I'm okay now. Thank you for coming to help me." 

He smiles at her again. "No problem!" he says. "So, where do you live underwater?" 

She feels a wave of embarrassment wash over her. She knows that humans can't see her underwater kingdom. But somehow, she doesn't care. She just wants to talk to this boy. 

"It's called the Coral Reef," she says softly. "It's a really beautiful place. It's full of colorful fish and sea turtles and all sorts of amazing creatures." 

He nods, looking interested. "I've heard about it!" he says. "I love diving and exploring new places underwater. Do you like to go on adventures too?" 

The little mermaid can't help but smile at him. She feels like they have so much in common. They both love the ocean, and they both seem to be drawn to each other. 

"Yeah," she says. "I do! I love exploring new places and meeting new creatures. Do you ever dive with your friends?" 

He shakes his head, looking sad. "No," he says. "My dad won't let me go diving anymore. He thinks it's too dangerous." 

She feels a pang of sympathy for him. She knows how much fun diving can be, and she hates the idea of never being able to experience it again. 

"I'm sorry," she says. "That must be really hard for you." 

He nods, looking down at the water. "It is," he says. "But I guess I understand why my dad does it. He doesn't want me to get hurt." 

The little mermaid thinks about her own father. She knows how much he loves her and wants to keep her safe. But she also knows that sometimes, the only way to truly grow is to take risks. 

"I think your dad is right," she says, trying to sound reassuring. "Sometimes, we have to be careful not to get hurt. But we can't let fear stop us from having fun and exploring the world around us." 

He looks at her, a hint of hope in his eyes. "You know what?" he says. "Maybe you're right. Maybe I should try diving again someday. Do you think you could help me out?" 

The little mermaid can't believe what she's hearing. She never thought she would be able to help a human boy in any way. But somehow, she feels drawn to him. She wants to help him. 

"Of course!" she says happily. "I'd love to help you out! Just let me know when you're ready." 

He smiles at her again. "Thanks," he says. "I really appreciate it. You know, maybe one day, I could come visit your underwater kingdom and meet all your friends!" 

She nods eagerly, feeling a wave of excitement wash over her. She can't wait for the day when this boy can see her world. Maybe he'll even help her explore it too. 

"I hope so," she says. "I'd love to show you all the amazing things we have down there." 

The little mermaid swims away from the boy, feeling a sense of accomplishment and joy. She may not be able to save every human in trouble, but somehow, she feels like she's made a real difference in this boy's life. And for the first time in forever, she feels like she belongs in the world above.
