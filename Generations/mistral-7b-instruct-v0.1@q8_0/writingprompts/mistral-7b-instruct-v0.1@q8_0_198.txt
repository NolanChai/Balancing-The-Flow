ank, it was raining, and I had to go outside for a fucking second, which is pretty much an instant recipe for death in my world. 

 But, as always, there are people who have to make me suffer. 

 "Wake up, wake up!" The sound of my phone vibrating against the nightstand shook me awake. I squinted at the clock and let out a groan.

"What the fuck? It's too early."

"You need to get up," said my mother's voice from the other side of the phone. "The game is about to start, and we can't miss it!"

I rolled over to face the wall, trying to ignore the fact that I was supposed to be asleep and that I had been dragged out of bed for a stupid fucking game. 

"You're on speakerphone," I said irritably. "Why the fuck didn't you just text me?" 

"I can't text you," she said impatiently. "My phone has no signal."

I sighed and slid the phone out of my pocket, rolling over to face it and putting it on speakerphone. "Fine. What am I missing?"

"The game is about to start!" my mother exclaimed. "It's going to be amazing! You can't miss it!"

"You realize that this is the last season I could possibly have bought into this craze, right?" I said dryly.

She shrugged. "What? It's a game! It doesn't matter what season it is."

I rolled my eyes and sat up in bed. "Fine, fine. I'll go watch it," I said grudgingly.

My mother let out a whoop of joy. "Thank you!" she cried. "I knew you wouldn't let me down!" 

I sighed and tossed the blankets aside, standing up to head to the living room where the game was being played. As I walked, I couldn't help but wonder what could possibly be so amazing about this game that my mother had convinced me to watch it on such a short notice, especially after the last season.

"What am I missing?" I asked as I walked into the living room. My father, who was sitting next to my brother, looked up from his phone and raised an eyebrow.

"You mean you're here?" he asked incredulously. "Because we were about to start without you."

I rolled my eyes. "Don't be ridiculous," I said with a sigh. "Of course I'm here."

My brother, who was sitting across from me on the couch, grinned. "You better get your ass in that chair," he said. "You don't want to miss this."

I shook my head. "I already missed it," I said dryly. "It started five minutes ago."

My father's face turned red with anger. "What the fuck?" he sputtered. "You can't just walk in and expect to watch!"

"Hey, hey, now," my brother interjected. "Don't get too pissed off, dad. He didn't know we were starting."

My father glared at my brother. "I hope you're happy, kid. You've convinced me to miss the start of one of the best games in years just because your dumbass brother was too lazy to text."

I sighed and sat down on the couch next to my brother. "Okay, okay," I said begrudgingly. "You guys can go on without me. I'll catch up later."

"No," my father snarled. "You stay here, you little shit. If you miss this, I swear I'm going to ground your ass until you're fifty."

I rolled my eyes and shook my head. "Fine," I said with a sigh. "I'll stay here."

My brother grinned and leaned over to me. "You know what the best part is?" he asked quietly. "We've got the perfect spot in this stadium. We're right behind the end zone, so we can see every pass, every tackle, and every touchdown up close."

I raised an eyebrow. "Really?" I said dryly. "Because that sounds like a nightmare to me."

My brother laughed. "Don't worry," he said reassuringly. "We'll be fine. And who knows? Maybe we'll even catch a touchdown pass or something!"

I shook my head and leaned back against the couch. "Good luck with that," I said dryly. "But if I have to watch this game, at least I can do it from a comfortable spot."

As the game began, I couldn't help but think about how much I would rather be anywhere else in the world than here. I hated football, and I hated watching it even more. But my mother was so excited about this game that I didn't want to disappoint her.

"Come on, come on!" she cried as the two teams took their positions on the field. "This is going to be amazing!"

I rolled my eyes and looked away, trying to ignore the fact that I was stuck in a room with my family watching a stupid fucking game.

As the whistle blew, signaling the start of the game, my father stood up and stretched his arms. "Here we go," he said excitedly. "Let's get ready to watch some football!"

I sighed and looked at my brother, who was grinning from ear to ear. "Good luck with that," I murmured under my breath. "I'm going to try not to die of boredom."

As the game progressed, I found myself getting more and more irritated by the noise and chaos around me. The shouting, the cheering, the constant interruptions of commercials - it was all too much for me.

"What the fuck?" I snapped as a particularly annoying commercial interrupted the game. "I can't watch this!"

My father turned to me with a scowl on his face. "You better not say that again," he warned.

I raised an eyebrow. "Why not?" I asked dryly.

"Because I'm going to make you sit through every single second of this game," he said ominously. "And if you try to leave, I swear I'll drag you back by your collar."

I shook my head and looked away, trying to ignore the fact that I was being held captive by my own family.

As the game drew to a close and the two teams took their positions on the field for the final touchdown, my heart started racing. I could feel my blood pressure rising, and I knew that if I didn't get out of there soon, I might actually have a heart attack.

"Come on, come on!" my mother cried as the whistle blew, signaling the start of the final play. "This is it! This is the moment we've been waiting for!"

I looked at my brother, who was standing up and pumping his fists in excitement. "Fuck this," I muttered under my breath. "I can't watch any more of this."

As the two teams charged toward each other on the field, I jumped to my feet and stormed out of the room. My parents were too busy cheering for their team to even notice me, and my brother was so caught up in the excitement that he didn't even realize what was happening.

I slammed the door shut behind me and leaned against it, panting and trying to catch my breath. As I stood there, trying to clear my head, I couldn't help but think about how much I hated football, and how much I hated this last season in particular.

"What happened?" my brother called out from the other side of the door. "Did you miss the touchdown?"

I shook my head. "No," I said dryly. "I just couldn't watch any more of it."

My brother sighed and opened the door a crack, peering out at me curiously. "Are you okay? You look like you just got hit by a truck."

"I'm fine," I said irritably. "I just can't stand watching this stupid game anymore. It's like torture to me."

My brother frowned. "But it was so good!" he protested. "You missed out on the most amazing play of the game!"

I rolled my eyes. "I don't care," I said dryly. "It doesn't matter what happened, I just can't watch this crap anymore."

My brother sighed and closed the door behind him. "Fine," he said grudgingly. "But you better get ready for the after party. We're going to celebrate that win in a big way!"

I shook my head. "No thanks," I said dryly. "I think I'll just pass on that one."

My brother laughed and turned to go, but before he left, he turned back to me and said, "You know what the best part is? You won't have to watch this game again for at least another year. Maybe even two!"

I raised an eyebrow. "Really?" I said dryly. "Because
