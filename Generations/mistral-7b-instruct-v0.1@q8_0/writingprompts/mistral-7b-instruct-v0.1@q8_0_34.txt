little too well if you ask me. But, as always, it was not enough for me. I had to break one more law. The ultimate law. The law that would make me truly unstoppable.
``The Last Law," they call it,'' I thought, feeling an electric charge run through my veins. "And what is this last law?" I wondered aloud.

I searched deep in my mind for any clue, anything that could lead me to the ultimate law. And then it hit me. The one thing that no one else had ever thought of before. The one thing that would make me truly unstoppable. The one thing that would give me absolute power over everyone and everything in this world.
``The law of the weak," I thought, feeling an immense sense of satisfaction. "That's it! That's the last law to break!" And with a grin on my face, I set out to break it once and for all.

I spent days carefully planning my move, studying every detail and strategizing every step. And finally, the day arrived. I stood in front of the weakest person in the world, a young boy who had been bullied and tormented by everyone around him. He was alone, vulnerable, and afraid. But that's exactly what I wanted.

I approached him slowly, trying to intimidate him with my towering presence. I spoke in a menacing tone, taunting him for his weakness and telling him how much he was worthless. And then, without warning, I struck. I punched him hard in the face, knocking him down and sending him sprawling across the ground.

As he picked himself up off the floor, blood trickling down his nose, I looked at him with an intense sense of satisfaction. I had broken the ultimate law, the law of the weak. And now, I was truly unstoppable.
