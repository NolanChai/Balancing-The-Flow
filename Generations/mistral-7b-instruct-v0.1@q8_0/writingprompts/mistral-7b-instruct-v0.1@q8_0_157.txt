far enough apart that we could talk without being overheard.

Hannah’s favorite color was blue. She liked everything about it: its serenity, its vastness, and its ability to represent truthfulness. I didn’t know much about art, but I understood her love for it. It wasn’t hard to see that she wanted the world to be full of beauty, even if it meant ignoring all the other colors.

It was funny because we both knew this date wouldn’t go well. We were both too nervous, too tense. But we did it anyway. The restaurant was nice, but not overly fancy. There was a live band playing jazz. It sounded pretty good, but I couldn’t shake the feeling that someone was trying to seduce me with music.

The conversation was awkward at first. We talked about how much we loved our jobs and how they were going. Then we moved on to family and friends, which made things a little easier. By the time we got to dessert, I felt like I could breathe again.

But when we left the restaurant and walked out into the cool night air, something changed. We held hands tighter, our breaths shallow. The streetlights flickered on, casting an eerie glow over everything. It was as if time had stopped, just for us.

Hannah looked up at me with her big blue eyes. She said something about how beautiful the world was and how much she loved me. I smiled and told her I felt the same way. Then we kissed.

It was a long kiss, full of passion and longing. When we finally pulled away, we stood there for a moment, just looking into each other’s eyes. We knew this was the start of something big. Something that would change our lives forever. And as we walked back to my car, hand in hand, I couldn’t help but feel grateful for this beautiful, blue world that brought us together.
