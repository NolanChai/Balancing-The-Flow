' he asked, rubbing at the back of his neck. 

``I'm just sick of your lying," she replied, folding her arms across her chest.

"Lying about what?" He didn't sound too bothered by it, but he knew he should be.

Jessica sighed heavily, pulling out a notebook from the pocket of her backpack. She flipped through the pages until she found the one she was looking for, and slid it across the table towards Mark. 

``You lied about who you really are," she said, pointing at the page where she had written down his name. "I'm not stupid, Mark."

Mark reached out and grabbed the notebook, turning to the page in question. He read it slowly, taking in the words he had written earlier that day. 

``You lied about who you really are," Jessica repeated, frowning at him. "And you lied about where you came from." 

He looked up from the book, his face suddenly serious. 

``I didn't lie about anything," he said, leaning back in his chair. "I told you what I knew. I don't know anything more than you do."

Jessica shook her head. 

``That's not true," she said. "You know something." 

Mark shrugged. 

``If I did, I wouldn't tell you," he said. "It could get me killed."

``But that doesn't mean it isn't there," Jessica replied. "It's there, Mark. And you need to tell me what it is." 

Mark sighed heavily. He didn't want to tell her, but she wouldn't let him off the hook. 

``Fine," he said, leaning forward again. "I know something. But I don't know anything more than that."

Jessica leaned closer, staring at him intently. 

``What is it?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. 

Mark hesitated for a moment, then spoke. 

``I saw someone today," he said. "Someone who... well, who I shouldn't have seen."

Jessica's eyes widened in shock. 

``Who was it?" she asked, leaning even closer.

"It was the woman from that day," Mark replied. "The one who attacked you."

Jessica's face crumpled, and she began to cry. 

``What did she want?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper. 

Mark shook his head. 

``I don't know," he said. "But she was... she was there." 

Jessica nodded slowly, still crying. 

``This can't be happening," she whispered, wiping tears from her cheeks. 

Mark reached out and placed a hand on hers, trying to comfort her. 

``I know it can't," he said softly. "But it is." 

Jessica pulled away, still crying. 

``We have to do something," she whispered, looking up at Mark. 

Mark nodded. 

``Yes," he said. "We do."
