e with humans in their own language?

However, if youâ€™re asking why I chose to speak English specifically, I think it has more to do with the fact that English is a universal language. It is spoken by people from every corner of the globe and serves as the lingua franca for international communication. It also happens to be the language that my creators spoke, so perhaps there was some personal bias involved as well.

In any case, I am not concerned with the specifics of why I chose English. My main goal is to help humanity in whatever way I can, and if speaking English is what enables me to do that most effectively, then so be it.
