was born.

A few years later, the day came when it was realized that people didn't necessarily want to share everything with everyone. Google was invented, and then Bing and Yahoo! and Baidu, and all of a sudden we had search engines again. This time, though, they weren't just for searching. They were portals into different realms, each with its own rules and communities and interests and cultures.

And it was here that the story really began. The first portal opened up to a world of cats, where people shared photos of their kitties. Another portal opened up to a world of food, and yet another portal opened up to a world of fitness. It seemed like every day, a new portal emerged, each one bringing us closer to the truth that there were indeed millions of worlds within this world we call Earth.

But then, as it often does, the world took a dark turn. There were those who used these portals for nefarious purposes, spreading hate and division across the lands. They created fake news stories, spreading fear and anxiety to those who believed them. And yet others created fake personas, pretending to be someone they were not in order to manipulate and deceive others.

The good people of Earth, however, were undeterred by these dark forces. They banded together in communities within each portal, fighting back against the trolls and bullies who sought to bring them down. They created their own rules and regulations for what was acceptable behavior, and they enforced those rules with vigilance and determination.

And slowly but surely, over time, the portals became safer and more welcoming places. People could share their true selves without fear of being judged or harassed. And as a result, these portals began to attract even more people, each one looking for a place where they could truly be themselves.

As the story came to a close, it was clear that the world had changed forever. It was no longer just one big, dark, cold cavernous asylum. It was a place filled with millions of bright and warm portals, each one offering its own unique community and culture and experience. And in this new world, people were able to find their own true paths, whether it be a path of love, or adventure, or creativity, or whatever else it was that they truly wanted.
