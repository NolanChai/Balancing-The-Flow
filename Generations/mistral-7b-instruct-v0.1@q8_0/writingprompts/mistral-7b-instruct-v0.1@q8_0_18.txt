``I’ve found my Grandfather’s old hunting rifle and the diary he kept with him while fighting in World War II. '' 

``Wow, that’s amazing Tim! Do you mind if I take it away to have it appraised? ''. 

``No Sally, not at all but you have to promise me you won't sell it.''. 

``Okay, I promise Tim, I won't. '' 

So now here we are. I don't even know where the diary is or if I even have it anymore. I just remember the feeling of guilt and betrayal I got that day. 

I feel like I've been punished for something I didn't do. 

This isn't the first time either, my ex-wife did it to me with her diary too. She used to keep all of our personal info in there, including stuff about me and our relationship. 

I always wondered where she got it from until one day I found out that she had been sneaking into my personal computer files while I was at work. 

When I confronted her about it she denied everything. She even said that the diary I found wasn't mine, it must have just been a coincidence. 

I know better than to believe her though. This whole thing has left me feeling like I can never trust anyone again.
