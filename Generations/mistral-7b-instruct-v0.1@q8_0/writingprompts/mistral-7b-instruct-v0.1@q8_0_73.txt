inquished a few crumbs.

 `` Eat something, Harold. You look like you haven't eaten since last year."

 `` I ate." Harold said, holding up his hand to stop Orville from slapping him again.
 
 `` Are you sure? Because you look like...'' Orville began, but was interrupted by Harold's voice.

 `` Look at me!" Harold threw his hands in the air. "I'm a professional musician. I have discipline!''

 `` But you're not eating. You can't possibly expect to keep your energy levels high if you don't eat." 

 `` Oh, Harold, Harold," Orville said with mocking. "Don't you know that you need your fuel in order to perform? Don't you know that...''

 Suddenly, a loud crash was heard. Both of them jumped out of their skin.

 `` What was that?'' Harold asked, shaking his head in confusion.

 `` I don't know, I was just looking at the sky." Orville shrugged. "But let's go check it out, shall we?" 

 They ran outside and found a large tree branch lying across the path.

 `` Ugh!'' Harold grunted as he lifted the heavy branch up and placed it back on its original location.

 `` Hmm...I wonder what caused that," Orville mused, examining the damage.

 `` Well, maybe it was a squirrel trying to find food for the winter." Harold replied, shrugging his shoulders. "Or maybe it was just a random gust of wind."

 As they continued on their way, Harold couldn't help but notice the increasing amount of crumbs falling from his mouth.

 `` Eat something!" Orville snapped, grabbing Harold by the arm and pulling him into a nearby grocery store.

 `` Fine," Harold sighed, rolling his eyes. "I guess I can get something to eat."

 As they walked down the aisles, Harold couldn't help but notice the large selection of junk food available.

 `` Ugh!'' he groaned. "Why do they have so many options for things that are bad for you? This is ridiculous!"

 `` Because people like to indulge sometimes," Orville explained. "But hey, don't worry. I'll help you find something healthy."

 Harold sighed, following Orville down the aisles as he pointed out various items.
 
 `` Ooh, look at these granola bars!" Orville exclaimed, grabbing one from the shelf. "They're filled with nuts and seeds, perfect for keeping your energy levels up during long performances."

 `` Hmm...I guess those could work," Harold agreed, grabbing a pack of the granola bars.

 As they made their way to the checkout line, Harold couldn't help but notice the large amount of soda cans stacked on the shelves.

 `` Ugh!'' he groaned, rolling his eyes. "Why do people have such a strong urge to drink so much sugar water?"
 
 `` Because it's easy and satisfying," Orville explained. "But hey, don't worry. You can find some water bottles over here."

 Harold sighed, following Orville over to the other side of the store.

`` Hmm...I guess I could get a couple of these," he said, picking up two water bottles. 

As they left the store, Harold couldn't help but notice how much better he felt with the granola bars in his hand and a bottle of water to wash it all down.

`` Wow, Orville!'' he exclaimed, smiling. "You really know your stuff when it comes to nutrition!"

`` Glad I could help," Orville replied, grinning back at Harold. "And hey, maybe you can start incorporating some more healthy food options into your diet."

`` Hmm...I guess I could try," Harold agreed, nodding his head. "Thanks for the advice, friend!"

As they walked away, Harold couldn't help but feel a little more hopeful about his health and wellbeing. Maybe he wasn't as invincible as he thought he was, but with Orville's guidance, maybe he could turn things around and live a healthier lifestyle.
