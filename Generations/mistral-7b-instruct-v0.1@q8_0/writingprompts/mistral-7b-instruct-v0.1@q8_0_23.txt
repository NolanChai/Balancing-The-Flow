matter how prepared she was, nothing could have prepared her for this day.

The sun shone bright on her face as she opened her eyes to the sound of birds chirping outside her window. She sat up in bed and rubbed her eyes, trying to clear the fog that had settled within them. It was then that she heard it. A faint whisper, barely audible above the sounds of nature all around her.

"Eve," the voice said, "It's time."

She froze in her seat, staring wide-eyed at the empty space beside her. She had heard that voice before. It was the voice of her creator, God himself. And now it was calling out to her, beckoning her to leave this world behind.

With a heavy heart, Eve stood from her bed and began to make preparations for her departure. She knew there would be no going back once she took that final step. But even as the shadows lengthened around her, she refused to give in to fear or despair. For she had faith that God would guide her through this transition, just as he had guided her throughout her life on Earth.

As she walked out of her home and into the warm embrace of the setting sun, Eve felt a sense of peace wash over her. She knew that her journey was far from over, but for now, she was ready to face whatever lay ahead. And with each step forward, she carried with her the love and grace of her creator, knowing that she would never truly be alone.
