3-D printer models from them, and cosplay costumes made out of cardboard, duct tape, glue and paint.

August's only friend was his cat, Bumblebee, which he'd rescued from the local pound a year ago. The two were practically inseparable, spending their days cuddling in front of the computer while August browsed through various websites about space and physics.

One day, August received an e-mail from NASA with an invitation to participate in the next Mars rover mission. Overwhelmed with excitement, August quickly prepared his resume, cover letter and portfolio of 3D models he'd made of various spacecrafts and planets, including a detailed model of himself wearing a spacesuit, standing on top of Olympus Mons.

A few weeks later, August found himself in the middle of the Mojave desert, surrounded by a group of astronauts, engineers and scientists from NASA, all dressed in white space suits. The air was thin and crisp, the sky a deep shade of blue. August felt like he was finally living his dream.

The mission was a success, with the rover landing safely on the surface of Mars and sending back stunning images of the red planet's landscape. August was ecstatic, spending countless hours analyzing the data sent back by the rover, looking for signs of water or life on the planet's surface.

As August sat in front of his computer, surrounded by his 3D models and cosplay costumes, he couldn't help but smile at how far he'd come. From a lonely nerd to a mission specialist with NASA, it was a journey he'd never have imagined. And as he looked out the window at the stars above, August knew that this was just the beginning of his adventures in space.
