lyway. Under the street lamp. Take off your shoes.

It’s been three days since you last did this. Three nights since you last felt. You can’t remember why you started or why you stopped. But you know why you’re back now. You need to feel something, anything, again. Something real. Something other than the emptiness that comes from your routine existence.

You sit down on the curb and take off your clothes. The cool breeze brushes past you as you strip down to nothing but your underwear. You reach out and touch yourself. Your fingers trace over your nipples, your abs, your thighs. You close your eyes and focus on the sensation of your own body.

It’s been too long since you last touched yourself. Too long since you last felt alive. It’s time to reclaim that feeling. To remind yourself that you are more than just a student. More than just a routine existence. You are a human being, with desires and needs and feelings.

You start to masturbate. Slowly at first, then faster as your body begins to respond. Your fingers move in circular motions, pressing harder and harder against yourself. You close your eyes and focus on the sensation of your own body. The way your chest rises and falls with each breath. The way your heart races as you reach for climax.

You’ve never felt like this before. Never felt so alive, so real. And when you finally reach climax, you let out a loud moan. It feels so good to feel something again. To feel like a human being.

You sit there for a few minutes, catching your breath and feeling the afterglow of your orgasm. You’re not sure why you did this. But you know that you need to do it again. And again. And again. Until you can’t anymore. Because right now, in this moment, you feel alive.
