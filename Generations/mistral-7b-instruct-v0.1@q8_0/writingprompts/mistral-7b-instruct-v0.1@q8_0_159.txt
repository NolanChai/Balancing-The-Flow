me? I don’ t have all day to waste. ” the woman said, leaning back on her desk in an ornate chair and puffing on her cigarette. Her nails were long and painted red.

“ I was hoping to get some information,” Latrina said, shifting his weight from one foot to another as he leaned against the desk. “ Something about a certain gentleman.”
 
The woman’s eyes narrowed at this revelation. She took another drag off her cigarette and blew out a long stream of smoke. “ What gentleman would that be? I don’ t know anyone named that. ”
 
“ Well, he goes by the name of Mr. Victor Blackthorn. He was one of your clients back in the early days of the business. You remember him?”

The woman snorted and blew out another stream of smoke. “ Yes, I do. I remember him as a loud, obnoxious man who had too much money to spend. He was always barging in here demanding information on this or that. Always looking for some kind of edge in the market. Never seemed to care about anyone but himself. ”
 
Latrina nodded solemnly. “ That’ s the same man I’ m looking for. He’ s been causing a lot of trouble lately and I need to find out where he’ s hiding. Do you remember where he used to live?”
 
“ Oh, he lived in that big house on Elm Street. You know, the one with all those crazy antiques? He had a real thing for collecting oddities. That place was like a museum. But he sold it off a few years ago. Said he wanted to move on to bigger and better things. I don’ t know where he went after that.”
 
Latrina thanked the woman and left, feeling a little more hopeful than before. He knew that finding Blackthorn would be difficult, but if he could track down his former client, he might just be able to get the information he needed.
