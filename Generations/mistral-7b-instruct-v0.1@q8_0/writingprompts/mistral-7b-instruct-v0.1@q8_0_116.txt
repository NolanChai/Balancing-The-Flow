a collection of pipes being played by an electronic system just astounds me. There's something almost poetic about the simplicity of the concept- you take the wind from your lungs, channel it through a set of tubes and out come the most beautiful music. It's a constant reminder that even in the most complex machines there is always room for a bit of human ingenuity and creativity to shine through.
