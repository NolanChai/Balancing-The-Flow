old bike from the back alley. At least that's what his friends told him he should do. But Jeffery wasn't like them. He had no interest in any of those things.

He had much more important concerns to worry about. His family was moving, and he didn't know where they were going. His parents had been acting strange lately, keeping secrets from each other and from him. All he knew was that they needed to sell their house and find a new place to live.

Jeffery sighed and rolled out of bed. He dressed in his usual outfit - a faded t-shirt, ripped jeans, and sneakers. His hair was messy and unbrushed, just like he liked it. He walked over to the window and pulled back the curtains, letting in the warm afternoon sunlight.

He spotted something strange outside. A man was standing across the street, staring intently at the house. Jeffery squinted his eyes and tried to make out the man's face. It was hard to tell from this distance, but it didn't look like anyone he knew.

Jeffery decided to investigate. He walked over to the front door and slowly pushed it open. His heart beat faster as he heard a faint whisper coming from inside. He cautiously stepped into the living room, his eyes scanning every corner for any sign of danger.

That's when he saw her. She was sitting on the couch, her back turned to him. Her long hair flowed down her shoulders like a waterfall, and she wore a flowing white dress that seemed to glow in the sunlight filtering through the windows. Jeffery couldn't believe his eyes. It was like he had just stepped into a fairy tale.

He tiptoed closer to her, trying not to startle her. As he got closer, he heard her singing softly. The tune was beautiful and haunting, and it filled Jeffery with a sense of peace and wonder.

Suddenly, the man outside shouted her name. She whirled around, her face filled with terror. Jeffery didn't recognize the man at first, but then he remembered seeing him earlier. It was the creepy guy who had been staring at their house.

Jeffery quickly grabbed hold of her arm and pulled her away from the window. "Don't worry," he said reassuringly. "I'll protect you."

She looked up at him with wide, scared eyes, and for a moment, Jeffery thought she was going to run away. But then she smiled, and he felt his heart flutter.

"Thank you," she whispered. "You saved my life."

Jeffery didn't know what to say. All he knew was that he had never felt this way before. He had never been so drawn to someone, so captivated by their beauty and grace.

And as they stood there, holding hands and watching the man outside disappear down the street, Jeffery knew that his life would never be the same again.
