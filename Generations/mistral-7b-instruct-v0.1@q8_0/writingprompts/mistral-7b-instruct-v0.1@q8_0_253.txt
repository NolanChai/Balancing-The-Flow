ke out, trying to form words in this sea of bodies, my own included. It was easy to feel overwhelmed, to be consumed by the masses. But that wasn't what had happened here tonight. Tonight was different.
`` What happened?" I whisper to Troy, who shook his head slowly.
`` Nothing." he said. I scowled and crossed my arms over my chest. ``Nothing? You don't know? But why aren't you angry? Don't you get it? This is the night they killed him. The night he was taken from us without warning.''
`` Troy?" I nudged him, but he shook his head again, his eyes clouded over with a distant look in them.
`` Why are you acting like this?" I snapped, my voice rising above the murmurs of the crowd. But as I looked around, I realized that it wasn't just Troy who was behaving strange. Everyone around us was too. Their faces were blank, their movements robotic. It was almost like they had lost themselves in some sort of trance.
`` What's going on?" I asked, but no one seemed to hear me. They just continued to mill around aimlessly, like mindless zombies. Suddenly, a scream pierced through the air, and everyone turned towards it.
`` Oh my god!" I gasped, as I saw a young girl running out of the crowd, tears streaming down her face. She was followed by a boy, who looked just as distraught. They ran straight towards us and collapsed on the ground, their bodies wracked with sobs.
`` What happened?" I asked, my voice shaking.
`` He killed him!" cried the girl, between gasping breaths. ``He just came out of nowhere and started shooting! Everyone was running, but he caught up to me... I tried to run, but he pushed me down and...''
`` Troy!" I screamed, as I rushed towards her side. The boy was still sobbing, his body shaking uncontrollably. ``What's wrong with him?" I asked, as I picked him up and hugged him tightly. But even as I held him, I couldn't shake the feeling of dread that was creeping up my spine. Something was off here. Something just didn't feel right.
`` Troy...'' I called out, but he was gone. The crowd had dispersed, leaving us alone in the middle of the empty field.
`` Where are you?" I called out, but there was no answer. I looked around frantically, but all I could see were the distant lights of the city in the distance. And as I watched them flicker and fade, I realized that we were completely and utterly alone.
