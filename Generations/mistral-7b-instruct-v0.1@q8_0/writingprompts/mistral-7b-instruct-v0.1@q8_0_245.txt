acophony of screeching strings for two hours every single day, with no relief? 
 
 The second time I saw you in class, wearing that hideous purple tie-dye sweater, my hatred grew. Do you have any idea how embarrassing it is to walk around with that on? 
 
 And then there was the third time, when you brought your entire family to school for Family Day, and your mom made sure that everyone knew she was the PTA president by wearing her badge proudly. Oh my God, I wanted to die. 
 
 But my hatred did not end there. Every time I saw you at lunch, eating your disgusting chicken nuggets while your friends laughed at how you couldn't even pronounce "sushi," I felt a burning hatred in my heart. And when you came running towards me with your arms wide open and your cheesy grin on your face, all I could do was cower in fear and hope that you wouldn't touch me. 
 
 And then there was the worst part of it all: you were always so damn happy. You would bounce around with a smile on your face, as if you had never experienced any hardship or pain in your life. I couldn't help but feel jealous of you and wish that I could be as happy as you were. But deep down, I knew that you didn't deserve it. 
 
 So, here it is: I hate you. I hate everything about you, from your screeching violin to your embarrassing clothes to your stupid family to your cheesy grin to your happiness. And I hope that one day, the universe will punish you for being so damn perfect all the time.
