150 doors and various other locks on the walls of the building. It was like a jumbled bunch of keys from a hardware store, each key about an inch and a half long, all made of brass or steel. I couldn't identify any of them without taking a good look at the number engraved on each one and comparing it to the chart I had memorized.

 ``Ah, here we are,'' I said finally, finding what I was looking for: the master key for the first floor storage room, #272. It was a tall brass key with a twisted head, which made it easy to spot among the other keys. 

 The door itself was fairly ordinary, with an aluminum frame and frosted glass windows that were hard to see through because of the condensation on the inside. It was locked tight, but I knew better than to try using anything other than the master key. Turning it carefully, I heard a satisfying click, and the door swung open silently. 

 Inside the room, I found myself surrounded by rows upon rows of shelves, each one filled with boxes and crates full of various equipment and supplies. Most of it was old and outdated, but there were still a few things here that could be useful: a couple of laptops, some servers, a bunch of printers and scanners, a whole rack of monitors and keyboards...and a large stack of boxes labeled ``Chemicals.'' 

 I picked up the pile of chemicals and began to carefully inspect each one. There were several cans of flammable liquids (mostly used for cleaning), some containers of hazardous waste, a few jugs of acid, and a bunch of small vials filled with various powders and substances that looked like they might be useful in a lab setting. I didn't recognize any of them, but I figured it was better to err on the side of caution and leave everything alone until I could figure out what each one was.

 As I stood there, trying to decide what to do next, I noticed something strange: the shelves seemed to be shaking slightly, as if someone were moving around up above me. I looked up to see a man in a lab coat standing on one of the higher shelves, his back towards me as he rummaged through a box full of chemicals. He didn't seem to notice me at first, but eventually he turned around and caught sight of me standing there with a stack of chemicals in my hands. 

 ``Uh, hello,'' I said politely. ``I was just...um, inspecting the chemicals here.'' 

 The man looked at me for a moment, then nodded slowly. ``Yes, I see," he said. ``You're one of the new hires, aren't you?"

 ``Yeah," I replied, "just started today."

 ``Well, welcome aboard," he said. ``I'm Dr. Babbage. You might want to put those chemicals down before you drop them and spill something." 

 I quickly set the stack of chemicals on a nearby shelf and stepped forward to introduce myself properly. "I'm Mike," I said, extending my hand.

Dr. Babbage shook it politely, then turned back to his box. "Ah, yes," he said, "you must be the new lab assistant. Well, you're in luck: we just got a new shipment of chemicals in this morning, so you should have plenty to work with."

``Really?" I asked, genuinely excited. ``That's great! What kind of stuff is it?"

``Oh, all sorts of things," he replied. ``We do a lot of research here, you see: everything from biochemistry to materials science to nuclear physics. And we need lots of different chemicals for that." 

 ``Wow," I said, "that sounds really interesting. What kind of equipment do you have here?"

Dr. Babbage smiled. "Well, as you can see, we've got quite a bit: microscopes and spectrophotometers, centrifuges and incubators, atomic force microscopes and X-ray machines...and of course, our computers and servers." 

``That's amazing," I said. ``How many people work here?"

He shrugged. "Oh, just a handful of us full-time," he said. "But we get lots of visitors: researchers from other universities, government agencies, even the occasional spy or intelligence operative."

I raised an eyebrow. "Really? Why would they be interested in our research?"

``Well," he said with a cryptic smile, ``sometimes it's not what we know that matters, but who we know. And some people have very specific interests indeed."

 I looked around the room again, taking in all the equipment and supplies. "So, what kind of research do you guys do here?" I asked.

``Oh, let me show you," he said, gesturing for me to follow him. We walked over to a large glass cabinet filled with vials and test tubes, where several other containers of chemicals were arranged neatly on the shelves above. 

 ``Here, for example," he said, picking up one of the vials, "is a sample of a new type of biofuel that we're working on: it's made from genetically engineered algae that can be grown in freshwater ponds."

He handed the vial to me, and I carefully examined it. It was filled with a clear green liquid, which seemed to shimmer slightly as it caught the light. "Wow," I said, "that's really cool! How does it work?"

Dr. Babbage smiled proudly. "Well, the algae contains special enzymes that can convert sunlight and water into hydrogen and oxygen, just like photosynthesis," he explained. ``And the hydrogen can be used as a fuel: it's non-toxic, non-polluting, and it can be stored in tanks for later use."

I nodded, impressed. "That sounds amazing! So what are you planning to do with it?"

He shrugged. "Oh, we're just doing some preliminary tests right now," he said. ``But eventually, we hope to make this stuff commercially available. It could revolutionize the way we power our homes and industries."

I looked around at all the other chemicals in the cabinet, wondering what else they were working on. "What about these?" I asked, pointing to a group of vials filled with dark red liquids.

``Ah, those," he said, "are some samples of a new type of nuclear fuel we're developing: it's based on a combination of uranium and thorium isotopes, but it's much safer and more efficient than traditional nuclear power."

I raised an eyebrow. "So, you're working on atomic weapons?" I asked, half-jokingly.

He laughed. "No, no," he said. ``We're not interested in making weapons: that's not what we do here. But we do have some very powerful tools at our disposal, and sometimes those tools can be used for good as well as evil."

I looked around the room again, taking in all the other chemicals and equipment. "So, what else do you guys work on?" I asked.

He shrugged. "Oh, just a bit of everything," he said. ``We've got people working on advanced materials, like nanotechnology and 3D printing; we've got others studying the fundamental properties of matter itself, using particle accelerators and other cutting-edge equipment."

``Wow," I said, "that sounds incredible! How did you get all this stuff?"

He smiled. "Well, as I mentioned earlier," he said, ``we get lots of visitors here: researchers from all over the world who want to use our facilities and equipment. And sometimes, those visitors bring us gifts."

I looked at him curiously. "Gifts?" I asked.

``Yeah," he said, "like this sample of a new type of superconductor that's been developed in Japan. Or this vial of a new type of antibiotic that was discovered in England. Or this...this." 

He gestured to the stack of chemicals I had set down earlier. "These are some samples that were sent to us by a group of spies from the United States. They want us to take a look at them and see if we can figure out anything useful."

I stared at him in disbelief. "You mean...you're working with spies?" I asked, incredulously.

He nodded. "Yes," he said, ``but that's just part of the job. When you work in a research facility like this one, you have to be prepared for anything."

``Anything?" I asked, raising an eyebrow.

He shrugged. "Well, for example," he said, ``you might have to deal with people who are trying to steal your equipment or sabotage your experiments. Or you might have to help out a researcher who's been kidnapped by a terrorist group and is being held hostage in some remote part of the world."

I looked at him in horror. "What? Why would they do something
