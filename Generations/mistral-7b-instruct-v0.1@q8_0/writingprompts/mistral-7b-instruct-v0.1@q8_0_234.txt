But I guess that's how it goes.

You're getting downvoted here, but it seems to me that you might be interpreting this quote as saying something along the lines of: "If I kill myself, then everyone else in the world is affected, and I've made their lives worse in some way." 

But what Donne was actually saying is that each individual death has a ripple effect throughout society, and that each person's life affects every other person's life in profound ways. We are all interconnected.
User 1: No, he was saying if you kill yourself, then you are diminished because you are part of mankind. If you take your own life, it diminishes everyone else.

I don't understand why people keep taking his quote out of context to say something completely different.
