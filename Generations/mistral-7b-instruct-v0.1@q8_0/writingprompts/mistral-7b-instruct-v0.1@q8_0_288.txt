 `` I don't speak French,'' he replied in a firm voice.
 
 `` Oh, sorry,'' she said, blushing with embarrassment as she quickly lifted her chin and placed her hands on the table, avoiding eye contact.  
 
 She watched him carefully, taking note of every movement. He walked around to her side, sitting down beside her. She swallowed hard, hoping that he wouldn't notice her heart rate quickening.
 
 `` So you're here for your first trip to New York?" he asked, smiling warmly.  
 
 `` Yes, I am," she replied, still trying to hold her breath.   
 
 `` Well, welcome then,'' he said, extending a hand for a shake.   
 
 She took it, feeling her heart race again as his touch sent an electric current through her body. He leaned forward, his eyes locked with hers.
 
 `` How do you like New York so far?" he asked, his voice soft and inviting.
 
 `` It's amazing," she replied, her voice trembling slightly.  
 
 `` I'm glad to hear that," he said, smiling warmly.  
 
 He leaned in closer, his breath hot on her ear. "Do you like jazz?" he whispered.
 
 She felt a shiver run down her spine as she nodded her head.
 
`` Let me take you to see one of the best places in town," he said, standing up and extending his hand again. She took it, feeling a thrill of excitement course through her body.
