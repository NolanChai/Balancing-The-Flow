age at me, but you cannot kill me. 
 
 Why would you? Would you do so for a game? For a challenge? To see if you can beat your enemy or have fun with the fight? I am an eternal one, and that is my power. You cannot defeat me. 
 
 I will always be here, waiting for the next time you need me, ready to listen and guide, to help and protect, and to win.
