rup with your waffles?” my husband says as he puts the plates on the table.
 
 I look at him and smile. I haven’t had any desire to have children. My life is good without them. I am happy being able to focus solely on my career. I don’t want the responsibility of raising children. I don’t want to wake up every night covered in sweat because of their nightmares. 

 “No, thank you.” I say as I sit down at the table. “I’ll just stick with my coffee and some toast.”
 
 My husband nods and goes back to the kitchen. He always has a way of making me feel like there is something wrong with me. Like I should be grateful for having children, that it’s what every woman wants in life. 
 
 “Don’t be so negative, sweetie,” he says as he sits down next to me. “Children can bring so much joy and happiness into our lives.”
 
 I shake my head. “I already have enough joy and happiness in my life. I don’t need more.”
 
 He looks at me with concern. “Are you okay?”
 
 I nod. “Yes, of course.”
 
 He takes a deep breath and leans back in his chair. “Okay, let’s talk about this. You know how much it means to me that we start a family. I want children so badly.”
 
 I roll my eyes. “I know, honey. I love you and I want to make you happy. But I just can’t do it right now. I need to focus on my career."
 
 He leans forward. “Your career isn’t going anywhere. You’re already at the top of your game.”
 
 I shake my head again. “I know, but I want to be there for you. I don’t want you to have to take care of everything because I’m not here. I want to support you and make sure you have everything you need.”
 
 He looks at me with disappointment. “But what about us? We’re supposed to start a family. That’s the next step in our lives.”
 
 I sigh. “I know, but I just can’t do it right now. I’m not ready.”
 
 He nods slowly. “Okay, sweetie. We’ll talk about this some more later. But for now, let’s enjoy breakfast.”
 
 We finish our meal in silence, both lost in our thoughts.
