the most part, people answered no. They couldn't imagine being friends with someone they didn't care for deeply, or caring for someone they hated. However, I had always been fascinated by the question. In my mind, it was one of those questions that could reveal a lot about who you were as a person.
 
 I didn't like to admit it, but I had thought about it often. Would I ever kill a friend? The answer was always yes. But only in certain situations. Only if they were endangering themselves or others. It was an uncomfortable truth, one that I kept hidden from everyone else. 
 
 It wasn't until I was on my way to meet my newest client that I realized why I had been so conflicted about the question. Because I knew what it felt like to be a friend in need.
