tern. West Coast USA was deserted by the Pacific Ocean currents that once brought nutrients. The Atlantic Ocean currents ceased too.

Then, the world found out the cause: a massive supervolcano erupted in Siberia. The volcanic ash made it difficult for the sun's rays to penetrate. The sun's radiation did not reach the Earth. It was like a nuclear winter.

After years passed, humanity tried to recover. A new civilization was born on the West Coast of North America. They had no contact with their ancestors. They were different from them too- they lived in cities and they had a culture based on technology. They had machines and robots and cars, but they still couldn't survive without solar power.

Then, a group of people discovered a way to create a magnetic field around the Earth that allowed sunlight to penetrate through the volcanic ash. It was risky. They didn't know if it would work or if it would destroy them all. But they tried. 

Their attempt worked. The sun's rays began to reach the Earth again. The weather changed drastically- the continental winds vanished and the seas became calm again. The oceans became blue again, and the atmosphere was free of ice.

A new era began. Humanity was reborn. They had learned their lesson, they knew that they were fragile. They knew that they could not destroy their home again.
