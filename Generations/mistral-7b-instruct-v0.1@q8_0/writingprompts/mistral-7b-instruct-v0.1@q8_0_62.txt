unk back onto her seat, her eyes fixed firmly on the floor. 
 
 Mary had been drafted into the army. She had no idea what to expect from this new world that was about to swallow her whole. It wasn't something she had planned for or even thought about. She had always been a simple girl, living in a small farm with her family and helping out where needed. 

 The man in front of her stood up, pacing back and forth across the room. Mary tried not to look at him as he walked, but his every movement seemed to draw her attention to him.

 ``Are you sure this is something I can do?'' she asked hesitantly.
