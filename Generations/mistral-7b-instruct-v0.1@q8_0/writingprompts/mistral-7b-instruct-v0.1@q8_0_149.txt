keye the room, but all that’s there to see are more screens than I can count. I sit.

The air conditioning whirs in my ears, the hum of machines soothes me, and I feel an almost familiar sense of peace. The screen before me is blank, blackness in blackness. My fingers fly across the keys. They’re light, quick, and they dance above them.

I remember this moment from the beginning, when my fingers first began to fly across the keyboard. It was a long time ago, but I never forgot it. It was the first time I felt like I was truly alive, and it was only because of these keys, this machine.

I let out a sigh, knowing that the truth is still hidden within me. But I can’t wait to find it, to uncover the secrets that lie beneath this skin. I’ve been waiting for a chance to do so for a long time, and now that chance has come.

I take another deep breath, and then I begin to type. The letters flow across the screen, each one a word, a thought, a memory. It feels good.

It feels good to be alive.
