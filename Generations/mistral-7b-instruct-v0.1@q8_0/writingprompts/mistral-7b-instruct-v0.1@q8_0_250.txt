 "I remember reading this one book by that lady I couldn't quite place," Sarah said, as she put her hands on her chest to feel the familiar bump she'd grown. "It was a travel book of sorts. She told tales about all these amazing places she had visited." 
 
"Well, what happened to them?" Riley asked, feeling a little excited. "Like, did they just disappear or something?" 
 
 Sarah shook her head. "No, I don't think so. It was very long ago, but I remember reading that she had gone out on a voyage, hoping to find other survivors. She even built a ship of sorts, using the materials in the forest." 
 
 Riley leaned forward, eyes wide. "How did she make it all work?" 
 
 "Oh, that's the thing," Sarah said wistfully. "I remember reading that her ship had been made from things like wood and vines, but I don't think I quite understood how that worked." 
 
 "Well, maybe you should ask me," Riley suggested. "I know a thing or two about building stuff." 
 
 Sarah smiled at the suggestion. "Yes, that would be very helpful," she said. "But first, we need to find the books." 
 
"What do you mean?" Riley asked. "Why don't you just keep them here with us?" 
 
 Sarah shook her head. "I think they belong somewhere else," she said. "Maybe back at Rabecca's old house? Or somewhere important, where people can find them." 
 
 Riley nodded in agreement. "Okay then, let's get started," he said. "We should be able to find the books pretty easy if we just look around."
