* after a *fucking blackout* last night.  

 God, I hate this goddamn roommate. He is the most inconsiderate asshole on Earth. And he thinks it's funny to screw with signs. I swear he does it just to fuck with me. 

 Why did I even take this room? It was supposed to be my own goddamn space where I could chill and have some peace, but now I can never escape from my asshole roommate's bullshit. And I've got no one else to talk to. 

 Why don't I just pack my shit and move out? Fuck it, I will. I'm done with this bullshit. It's time for me to take back my goddamn life.
