?"' Phil said, a little confused, as he was still shoveling his front sidewalk. 
 
 `` No, no...I mean, you know, like 'daddy'?'' Greg continued, trying to clarify himself. 
 
 `` Oh!'' Phil exclaimed, now realizing he had been addressing the person shoveling next to him as "Dad". 

 `` I'm sorry,'' Phil said. 
 
 `` It's okay," said Greg. `` My name's Greg.'' 
 
`` And mine is Phil," Phil replied, still a bit confused. 
 
`` Okay then, how about you?" asked Greg. 
 
`` Well, it's actually my mom," Phil admitted with a laugh, realizing his mistake earlier in the conversation. 
 
`` Yeah, I have a son and a daughter," said Greg. `` They just got married last summer." 
 
Phil looked up from his shovel. `` Oh wow, that's great to hear! Congratulations!" he said sincerely.
`` Thanks," said Greg. "I appreciate it." 
 
`` How old is your son?" Phil asked curiously.
`` He just turned 25," said Greg proudly. 

`` That's amazing! I thought you were older," Phil replied, still a little confused. 

`` Yeah, we started a family late in life," Greg said. `` But it was worth the wait." 

Phil smiled at the idea of starting a family later in life. "You know, I always wanted to start a family when I was younger, but I never thought it was possible." 

Greg shrugged. "It's never too late. You just have to find the right person and be patient." 

Phil nodded, still thinking about his own experiences with relationships. He had always been more focused on his career in law than starting a family, but he realized now that it was time to prioritize something else in life. He turned back to Greg, eager to hear more about his life and experiences. 

"So, what do you and your wife do for work?" Phil asked.
