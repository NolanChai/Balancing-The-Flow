the river's bend, 
 And South of the mountains so high. 
 
 Here you can find the old man who lost his way, 
 and the girl with a broken heart, 
 Just like me, they're lost in time, 
 And their future seems torn apart. 
 
 But don't worry my dear friend, 
 I've found a way out of this place, 
 And together we can escape, 
 To a world that's bright and full of grace. 
 
 We'll leave behind the darkness here, 
And climb up to the sky above, 
 To find a new beginning, 
A fresh start, free from love. 
 
 So come on my hand now, 
 Let's make our way out of this place, 
 And towards a future filled with hope, 
Where we can build a life without any trace. 
 
 Come on, let's go, let's go, 
Let's leave the triangle behind, 
And find a new world where love is real, 
And our dreams have a chance to shine.
