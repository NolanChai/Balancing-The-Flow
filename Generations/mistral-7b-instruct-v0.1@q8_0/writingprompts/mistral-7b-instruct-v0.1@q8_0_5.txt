 It didn’t last long, he was caught in the act and sentenced to life in prison. She had a baby girl who she raised alone until the girl died at age 4. She started drinking heavily herself to cope. She met someone, they were both lonely, but it wasn’t right. She started abusing her newborn daughter too. Her daughter was taken away from her and given to someone else to raise. She left and started living on the streets. 

 She would go to bars and find a man she liked and have sex with him in exchange for food or shelter, until she had enough money to keep herself fed for a little while. She started taking drugs to cope with the pain. One night she was sleeping on the street and woke up with her clothes off, she tried to run but they caught her. She was taken away to a hospital and treated for sexual abuse. 

 She recovered but still couldn’t leave her past behind. She was always looking over her shoulder. Every man who looked at her made her jump. She would go to bars and men would just stare at her, she felt like she couldn’t escape it. It followed her everywhere. 
 
 She eventually died on the streets from an overdose. No one knew about her, no one cared.
