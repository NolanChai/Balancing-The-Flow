ve lucky?

There was no radio signal for several hours. I tried using the emergency beacon, but it didn't work. When we finally regained contact, the rescue team had to pull me out of the wreckage. They told me that the only reason I survived is because of the air-lock.

I know I should be happy to have made it through, but my mind keeps going over the things that didn't go according to plan. My first thought was to make sure everyone was okay. That was when I realized that the other scientists were gone. I found their bodies a few hours later, all of them crushed under the debris. It was a horrible sight, and it still haunts me.

I can't help but think about what went wrong. We had everything we needed to conduct our research. We had the latest technology, the funding, and the support. But something happened that none of us could have predicted. We were doing something so important and yet, it ended in tragedy.

It took me weeks to come to terms with what had happened. I still struggle with the guilt of not being able to save my colleagues. I wonder if there was anything I could have done differently to prevent it. Maybe if we had waited a little longer before starting our experiment, we could have avoided the explosion. But who knows? Sometimes things just don't go as planned.

Now, I'm back on Earth, trying to move forward. But it's hard to forget what happened. The memory of my colleagues and the tragic accident still haunts me. I hope that one day, we can find a way to prevent accidents like this from happening again. Maybe we can learn something from our mistakes and use it to create a safer future for scientists everywhere.

But for now, I'll just try to focus on the positive. I'm alive, and I'm grateful for that. I'll keep working hard and trying to make a difference in the world. And maybe, one day, I'll finally be able to find peace with what happened.
