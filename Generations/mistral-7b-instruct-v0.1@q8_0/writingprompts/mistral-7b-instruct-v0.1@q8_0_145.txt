before. There were no borders, only borders. There was no nation or people, 
 only individuals. There was no good or evil, only existence.

 There were no gods, only machines. There were no leaders, only collaborators. 
 There were no heroes or villains, only survivors.

 And yet, they all were.

 The sun was always shining in the sky, but the world was plunged in eternal darkness. 
 The moon was always shining in the sky, but the stars were invisible. 
 The earth was always spinning, but it never left its spot. 

 There were no birds or beasts, only insects and plants. But there were no 
 animals at all. They had become one with the machines, a symbiotic 
 relationship that worked perfectly. The machines had no will of their own, 
 only following the laws of nature.

 There was no sound or music, except for the rustling of leaves. But there 
 were no trees or forests. They had all been destroyed and turned into 
 factories and cities. The air was always clean, but the sky was filled with 
 pollution. The water was always pure, but there was no sea or ocean.

 There was only one memory left in the world, a memory of a time before 
 everything changed. It was a memory that everyone shared, but no one knew 
 how it came into existence. It was a memory that no one could ever forget.
