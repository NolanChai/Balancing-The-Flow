ons ago, but still so real.

He turns to me, eyes wild with a mixture of fear and fascination, like he's never seen anything quite like me before. I nod, a silent agreement. The world has become so much bigger in those moments.

I reach out and touch him, my fingers tracing over the ridges on his skin, the texture as smooth as glass. It feels cold beneath my fingertips, but somehow it warms me from the inside out. His heart beats like a drum, pounding against my palm.

He pulls away, his breath coming in ragged gasps. He stammers something incoherent, and I can't help but smile at the absurdity of the situation. We've just witnessed something extraordinary - something that should have been impossible - yet here we are, standing on this very ground, as if nothing happened.

As he turns to leave, I grab his arm, pulling him back towards me. He struggles for a moment, but then relaxes into my hold. It feels like gravity has shifted, drawing us closer together, binding us with an unspoken understanding.

"You're not alone," I say softly, my voice barely above a whisper. "We've seen what you can do. And we'll protect you."

His eyes widen, searching mine for some kind of meaning. I see the fear begin to recede, replaced by something else - something I can't quite put into words yet. It's like he's found a piece of himself that he didn't know was missing, and now it's fitting perfectly back into place.

He nods, slowly at first, then more eagerly as the realization sinks in. And just like that, we go from strangers to friends - bound by this shared secret that will forever change our lives.

As he turns to go, I call out after him, "Come back soon!" My heart aches with anticipation for when we'll meet again.

He smiles at me over his shoulder before disappearing into the night, leaving behind only a trail of sparkling energy in his wake.

But as much as I want to believe it's just another dream, something deep down tells me that this time is different. This time, magic has truly crossed paths with reality - and there's no going back.
