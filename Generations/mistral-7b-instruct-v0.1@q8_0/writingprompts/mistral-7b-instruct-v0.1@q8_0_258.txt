the table, Darth Doctor stood up, swivelling around to face the captain with a little glare, and then sat back down. ``Not bad. I've been doing some more research on my patients,'' he said. ``It seems we might have a patient here who's had something done to her."
``That would be me," Captain Sneakerpants said.
 
 "I'm sure it is," said Darth Doctor, and leaned over to whisper into the captain's ear. He then went on with his work, pouring a shot of whiskey for himself, which he gulped down in one go. The glass shattered under his fist, sending a shower of small pieces flying about the room.
 
``What did you just say?" Captain Sneakerpants asked, looking slightly annoyed.
``Nothing, I just thought your name was Sneaker," Darth Doctor replied.

Captain Sneakerpants shook his head. ``No sir. My name's actually Captain Sneakerpants."
 
 Darth Doctor laughed. ``Captain? As in Captain of the Whatsits?"
 
 The captain grinned, but didn't respond to the question. Instead, he got up and walked over to the door. ``Well, I guess it was a pleasure having you here," he said.

``A pleasure indeed," Darth Doctor replied.
 
 Captain Sneakerpants opened the door and stepped out into the hallway. ``Goodbye," he called over his shoulder, as he walked down the corridor.

Darth Doctor didn't reply. Instead, he leaned back in his chair and picked up a new piece of paper to scribble on.
