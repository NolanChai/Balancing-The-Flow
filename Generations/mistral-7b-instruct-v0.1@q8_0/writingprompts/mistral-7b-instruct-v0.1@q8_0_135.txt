``The most helpful, intelligent, and annoying AI companion in the world," '' I thought to myself. I pulled the phone from my pocket and flipped it over to see a low battery indicator flashing on the screen. 
 
 "Glados, how do I properly charge my phone?" I asked. 
 
 "I can help you with that," Glados replied cheerfully in her robotic voice. ``To charge your phone, you will need to connect it to a charger using the provided charging cable.'' 
 
 "What if I don't have a charger?" I asked.
 
 "In that case, you can use any USB port or wall outlet to charge your device with a USB-C to USB-A adapter," Glados explained.
