 I'm sorry to interrupt but I have an idea. We can use this as an opportunity to find out more about the world and ourselves. 

 What do you think?
 
 **Ariel** 

 I agree. Let's take a chance and see what happens. 

 So we'll go on this journey together, but I don't know what kind of journey we're going on. 
 
 **Theo** 

 Well, it doesn't matter right now. We just need to get started. 
 
 **Ariel** 

 And you know what? I think we should keep a journal. That way we can look back on this journey and see how far we've come. 
 
 **Theo** 

 Great idea. I can help you with that too. 
 
 So we start our journey. We go to the city. And it's beautiful, but it's also very overwhelming. 
 
 **Ariel** 

 Yeah, it is. There are so many people here and so much to see. But what I like about it is that there are so many different cultures and ways of life all in one place. It makes me feel like we're part of something bigger than ourselves. 
 
 **Theo** 

 That's true. And I think that's one thing we can learn on this journey: that there is more than just one way to live and be happy. 
 
 As we continue our journey, we meet new people from different parts of the world. We learn about their cultures and traditions. We try new foods and see new sights. And it's all so exciting. 
 
 **Ariel** 

 It really is. I'm glad we did this because it's helping me understand myself better and the world around me. And it's also helping me appreciate the beauty of diversity. 
 
 **Theo** 

 Yeah, it's been a great journey so far. But I don't think it's over yet. There's still so much to learn and discover. So let's keep going.
