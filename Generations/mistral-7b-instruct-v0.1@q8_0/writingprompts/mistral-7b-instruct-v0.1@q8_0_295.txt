guishing over whether my desire would ever be fulfilled. And then, it was.

My desire, a dream that has haunted me since childhood, was realized. I received the call today. My dream, the one I thought was impossible, was within my grasp. This realization has left me both exhilarated and filled with trepidation. Exhilarated because my heart is finally beating in rhythm with what I truly want. Filled with trepidation because I know that this journey will not be easy.

I have always dreamed of being a writer. But, I never thought it would happen. My schooling was geared toward science and technology. My parents encouraged my passion for coding and programming. So, when my friends told me about their writing pursuits, I dismissed them as na√Øve idealists.

But, then came the day when my desire could no longer be suppressed. It bubbled up from deep within me, like a spring of inspiration. And, I started to write. I wrote everything that came into my mind, without stopping or thinking about it. Hours passed by, and I looked at what I had written, with both pride and amazement.

The realization dawned upon me then. I was a writer. Not a coder, not an engineer, but a writer. And, this desire could no longer be ignored. So, I started to research writing courses, workshops, and conferences. And, that's when I stumbled upon the call I received today.

The opportunity to pursue my dream was presented before me. But, I knew that it wouldn't be easy. The journey ahead would be filled with challenges and obstacles. My mind is already racing with thoughts of how I will balance my writing with my day job. How will I find time to write when I am already so busy?

But, despite these fears, I cannot ignore the call. It is too strong. It resonates deep within me. This realization has left me both exhilarated and filled with trepidation. Exhilarated because my heart is finally beating in rhythm with what I truly want. Filled with trepidation because I know that this journey will not be easy.

I must embrace this call. I must take a leap of faith and trust that everything will work out. I must believe in myself and my abilities. And, I must be willing to put in the hard work necessary to fulfill my desire.

I am grateful for this opportunity. And, I am eager to embark on this journey.
