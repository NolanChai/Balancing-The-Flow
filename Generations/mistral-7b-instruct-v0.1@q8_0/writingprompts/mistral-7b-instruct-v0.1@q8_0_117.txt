I'm sure someone has done that before...

As I slowly and methodically, but without hesitation or regret, deleted my entire online presence; every single thing I had ever done on the web was erased like it was nothing. And now, as I sit here, staring at my new screen with a sense of pride, and perhaps even liberation, I wonder: have we truly become slaves to this digital medium? Are we willing to trade our humanity for the empty satisfaction of likes, comments, and shares?

And so, it's time to reclaim our lives, to break free from the chains that bind us to this virtual world, and to start living in reality again. Because the truth is, no matter how many times we press the like button, or how many people comment on our posts, we will never truly be happy if we are not happy with ourselves. And so, let us embark on this journey of self-discovery, of growth, and of liberation, and let us start living our lives to the fullest.
