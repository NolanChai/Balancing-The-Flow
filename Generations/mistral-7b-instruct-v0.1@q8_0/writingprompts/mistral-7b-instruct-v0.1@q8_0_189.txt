time. He wondered how many people had been in his spot at some point in their lives, hoping, praying that time would pass quickly so they wouldn't have to endure this moment again.

His thoughts were interrupted when he heard the familiar rumble of an approaching locomotive, and his heart began to race. The train pulled into the station with a hiss of brakes and screech of metal on metal. He took a deep breath and stepped off the platform onto the waiting car, feeling the familiar metal grate underfoot as he made his way towards his seat.

He sat down next to a woman in a flowing dress and matching shoes, her hair tied up in a messy bun. She looked up at him with bright blue eyes and smiled warmly before turning back to her phone. He couldn't help but wonder what she was thinking as he stared blankly out the window.

The train began to move, picking up speed as it left the station behind. The landscape outside blurred into a haze of green and brown, and he felt the familiar ache in his chest. It was always worse when he was alone, and this trip had been long-awaited. He had been saving for months, trying to scrape together enough money for a ticket to see her again.

He closed his eyes, feeling the warmth of the sun on his face as the train sped through the countryside. His thoughts drifted back to the last time he had seen her, and how much he had missed her since then. He wondered if she felt the same way, if she thought about him too.

The train jolted to a stop, and he opened his eyes just in time to see their destination come into view. The station was bustling with activity, people rushing to get off the train and onto buses or taxis. He stood up and made his way to the exit, feeling a sense of urgency building inside him.

He spotted her immediately, standing near the ticket counter with her arms folded across her chest. Her smile was wide and warm as she turned to greet him, and he felt his heart skip a beat. "Hey," she said, "I'm so glad you could make it."

He wrapped her up in a tight hug, feeling her soft body pressed against his own. "I missed you," he murmured into her neck, trying to hold on just a little bit longer. When he finally pulled away, she looked up at him with bright blue eyes and a mischievous grin.

"Well," she said, "you're here now, so let's make the most of it."

And with that, they stepped out of the station and into the world beyond, ready to face whatever adventures came their way.
