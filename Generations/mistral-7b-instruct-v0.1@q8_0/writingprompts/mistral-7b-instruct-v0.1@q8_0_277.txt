esta before heading back towards us. 

And then it started to fall apart.

The metal plates began to buckle, the solar panels shuddered off, and the landing gear, which had been in pristine shape when we last checked, twisted like an old man's twisted knee. It was getting worse, but we couldn't do anything about it. We were miles away, with no means of communicating. 

I don't remember what happened next, how long it took for the ship to finally break apart and fall into Earth's atmosphere, but I remember that when it did, I felt a strange sense of sadness. It was like watching a beautiful thing die. 

And then I saw the ship again, burning brightly in the sky, streaking towards us. The fire was so bright that it cast a shadow over everything, and for just a moment, all you could see was this beautiful, blazing ship coming down. It was like something out of a dream. 

And then it landed. 

It was hard to tell what was real and what wasn't, but the ship seemed to materialize in the air before our eyes. The landing gear touched down gently on the ground, and as if by magic, the metal plates straightened out and the solar panels reattached themselves. It was like we were watching a movie or something. 

And then it started to move. 

It trundled forward, rolling along on its wheels like a giant caterpillar. The engines buzzed softly in the background, like a swarm of bees. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before. 

As it moved, it began to glow. The metal plates seemed to shimmer and sparkle, and the engines glowed bright red. It was like watching a living thing come to life. 

And then it stopped. 

It sat there for just a moment, humming softly in the air. And then it opened its hatch. 

A man emerged. 

He looked like he was made of glass. His skin was clear as crystal, and his eyes were black holes that seemed to suck you in. He smiled at us, and we could see that his teeth were made of shimmering silver. He had no hair, but on his head was a strange device that looked like it was made of some kind of crystalline material. 

As he walked towards us, the ship began to change. The metal plates melted away, and in their place appeared a series of giant tubes. They were made of some kind of translucent material that glowed faintly with an otherworldly light. 

The man continued to walk towards us, and as he did so, the ship began to transform. The tubes began to open up, revealing strange machines inside. There were engines that seemed to run on nothing but energy, and there were tanks filled with glowing liquid that shimmered like water. 

And then it was over. 

The man reached us, and as he did so, the ship vanished in a blinding flash of light. The man smiled at us, and then turned and walked away, leaving us standing there in the middle of a desert. 

We never saw him again.
