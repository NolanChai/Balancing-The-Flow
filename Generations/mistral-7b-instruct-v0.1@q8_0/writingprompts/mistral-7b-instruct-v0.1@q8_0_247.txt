and no prospects of ever having one. You have a 16 year old son who is living with us but he doesn't want to live in the same house as you. You're not paying rent here so it's time for you to find somewhere else to stay.

My father and I had an agreement. He would pay for my schooling while I stayed at his house. But the moment he found out I wasn't straight A student, he started yelling and berating me for not being a good son and a good husband. I have always been a good son but it didn't matter to him because I wasn't meeting his expectations. He would constantly belittle me in front of everyone else and even called my mother names for "not raising me right". I started feeling ashamed of myself, like he was right that I couldn't achieve anything.

I have always been a good husband but my father would never acknowledge it. He would constantly criticize me for not being able to provide for my family and make his life easier. He would even tell other people that I didn't pay him enough in alimony and that I wasn't doing my fair share. Even though I had a good job, he would always tell me how much better off he was without me and how much more money he was making.
`` 

I have always been there for my mother. She is the one who raised me and made sure I didn't become a failure like he did. But now she has started to see him in a different light. She has started to realize that he was abusive to me and that I never had a good relationship with him. She wants to cut ties with him but I am afraid of losing her too.
`` 

I feel like my life is falling apart. My father's behavior towards me has been a constant source of stress and anxiety for years. He has always been critical of me, belittling me and telling everyone else how much better off he would be without me. I have tried to talk to him about it but he never listens. All he ever wants is to make me feel like the worst person in the world.

User 0: I'm sorry that you have gone through this, it sounds like your father is a toxic and abusive person. I understand how much you love your mother and want her to be happy, but sometimes we have to prioritize our own wellbeing and safety above others.

Have you spoken with a trusted friend or therapist about what has been happening? It's important to talk to someone who can offer support and guidance during this difficult time.
User 1: I have tried talking to my mother about it but she refuses to cut ties with him because she thinks that he will turn against her. She believes that the only way to fix things is to stay close to him, even though it causes her a lot of pain and stress.
