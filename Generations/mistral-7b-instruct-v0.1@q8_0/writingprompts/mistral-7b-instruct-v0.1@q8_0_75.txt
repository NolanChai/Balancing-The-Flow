umas, both physical and emotional, for each other. 

 In the beginning, there had been the massacre of the unarmed townspeople of Marin in the depths of night, with no warning, no mercy, only brutal violence. The men were shot dead in their sleep, women and children brutally murdered. There had been no prisoners taken, no ransoms demanded, nothing but blood. 

 That was just the beginning. As the war progressed, the forces of Ol became more and more barbaric in their actions. They would routinely pillage villages, raping the women and killing the men. They burned homes, churches, schools, and anything that might be seen as a symbol of resistance. 

 The Scorched King was no better. His forces were equally brutal, with the same methodical cruelty. They would kill anyone they deemed to be an enemy, regardless of age or gender. There were no prisoners taken, no mercy shown. They burned homes and towns, leaving nothing behind but destruction. 

 It was a war without any hope of victory. Both sides seemed to have lost their minds. The only thing that kept the people fighting was their hatred for each other. They fought with a blind fury, each trying to inflict as much pain on their enemy as possible. 

 It was a war without end, one that would drag on forever until there were no more men left standing. The Scorched King had no intention of defeating the forces of Ol, but rather of driving them back into the sea from whence they came. And Ol had no intention of being driven out by the forces of the Scorched King. They both wanted to see their enemy suffer and die. 

 It was a war without any winners, only losers.
