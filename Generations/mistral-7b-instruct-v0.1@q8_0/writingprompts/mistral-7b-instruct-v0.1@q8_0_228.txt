representative replied. 

 `` Well, that's a good thing, because I don't think I could bear losing them.'' Santa chuckled as he thought about how much his toys meant to him. He had been so happy with them last Christmas, and he couldn't imagine life without them. Even if they were technically his again, it didn't mean that he would want them back. 

`` What about you?" the representative asked Santa. `` Do you still want your original toys back?'' 

 Santa shook his head. `` Nope, sorry. I really do n' t think so. I love my new ones too much.'' 

 The representative nodded. `` Alright, then. Let me check our records one last time and make sure everything is in order." 

 He picked up the paperwork from his desk and flipped through it quickly. He nodded as he found what he was looking for. `` All looks good here," he said. `` It looks like your toys are yours to keep." 

 Santa smiled broadly. `` Yay! I'm so glad. Thank you so much, representative.'' 

 The representative smiled back. `` You're welcome, sir. And happy holidays!" 

 Santa waved goodbye and headed out of the office. As he walked down the hall, he couldn't help but feel grateful for his new toys. He was lucky to have so many amazing presents to enjoy this Christmas.
