we didn't say much to each other. You were always so focused on the technique and I was just trying not to fall. But as I watch the sun dip below the horizon here, I realize now that those moments we spent together were some of the most meaningful of my life.

 I remember when you showed me how to stand up straight and take in the view. We stood there for a while in silence, just looking at the snow and the trees and the sky above us. It was like nothing had ever mattered before that moment. And in that moment, I understood why you were always so focused on your students. You wanted them to see the beauty of the world around them and to appreciate it for what it is.

 And now, as I lay here dying, I can't help but think about how much you mean to me. You taught me so much more than just how to ski. You taught me how to live life with intention and purpose. You showed me that even the smallest moments can be meaningful if we take the time to appreciate them. And for that, I will always be grateful.
