urls me toward oblivion, I can't help but think of something utterly inconsequential: I never learned how to ride a unicycle.

The unicycle had been a source of fascination for me since childhood. I would watch in awe as the guys at the local circus would effortlessly balance themselves on one wheel, weaving through the audience like they were riding an invisible tightrope.

As I grew older, my fascination with the unicycle only intensified. I spent countless hours watching videos of professional unicyclists and practicing my own rudimentary skills. I would attempt to balance on a single pedal while my other foot dangled in mid-air, or I would try to navigate a winding course through the neighborhood streets with varying degrees of success.

But despite all my efforts, I was never able to truly master the unicycle. There were always moments of frustration and defeat when my balance would waver and I would crash onto the ground in a heap of metal and rubber.

Now, as I face my own mortality, I can't help but wonder what it would have been like to finally conquer that elusive beast. To ride a unicycle with grace and skill, weaving through the traffic with ease and confidence, leaving all who watched in sheer amazement.

But alas, it is too late for me to learn how to ride a unicycle. The machinery that holds me captive has seen my dreams crushed beneath its cold, unforgiving metal. I can only hope that somewhere out there, someone else is learning how to ride a unicycle and experiencing the joy and wonder that I was denied.

And so, as I prepare to face the unknown, I close my eyes and imagine myself riding a unicycle, wind whipping through my hair, sun shining brightly upon my face. It's a beautiful image, and it gives me some small measure of comfort in my final moments.

For though I may never have mastered the unicycle, it will always be a symbol of hope and possibility - a reminder that we should never give up on our dreams, no matter how impossible they may seem. And maybe, just maybe, if we are truly determined and persistent, we can find a way to make even the most unlikely dreams come true.
