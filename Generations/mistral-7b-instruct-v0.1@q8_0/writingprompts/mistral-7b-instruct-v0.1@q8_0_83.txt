' with me.
 
 Once we get out there, we gotta move fast. We don't wanna take no chances.
 
 Now, once we see the house, it's gonna be chaos.
 
 I need you to get in there first and do your thing.
 
 I know what you mean, Cam, but he won't hurt me. He won't hurt anyone else. You gotta put him down quick, before it gets out of hand.
 
 If you can, try not to shoot him too many times, save as much ammo as possible.
 
 Alright, so we go in fast, Paul stays with me, and we clear the place. Then, if he's still alive, we get him outta there, no questions asked.
 
 Okay, so that was the plan. I just need you all to remember, this guy isn't gonna be easy. He's got a lot of weapons in there, and he's not gonna go down without a fight.
 
 So let's get our heads ready, alright?
 
 Alright, I think we should get outta here now. We need to do this tonight, before the cops show up.
