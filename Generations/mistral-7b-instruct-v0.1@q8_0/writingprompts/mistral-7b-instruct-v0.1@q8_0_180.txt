It was the final exam, a test that would determine their entire academic career. And it seemed that neither of them had studied enough. 
 
 "I can't believe this," Sarah whispered. "This can't be true." 
 
 "It's not possible," John said in disbelief. They were both too stunned to move, let alone speak. 
 
 After what felt like an eternity, Sarah finally broke the silence. "What do we do now?" she asked. 

 John looked at her blankly for a moment before responding. "We have to figure out how to get this mistake corrected." He paused, trying to collect his thoughts. "But first, we need to understand what happened." 

 Together, they went over their exams again, meticulously reviewing each question and answer. They both felt sick to their stomach as they realized the enormity of their failure. 
 
 It wasn't just that they had failed; it was that they had failed so badly. Sarah and John were both top students in their class, but now it seemed like all their hard work had been for naught. 

 They spent hours poring over textbooks and reviewing notes, trying to understand where they had gone wrong. Eventually, they stumbled upon a mistake in one of the questions that they had both answered incorrectly. 

 With a sigh of relief, they quickly corrected their answers and submitted their exams again. All they could do now was wait for the results and hope for the best. 

 As the days passed, Sarah and John became increasingly anxious. They constantly checked their emails and texts, waiting for any news from their professors. 
 
 Finally, after what felt like an eternity, they received a message from their professor. The exam had been corrected, and they both passed with flying colors. 
 
 They were over the moon with joy, their relief palpable as they hugged each other tightly. They had done it; they had overcome their failure and emerged victorious. 

 As they walked out of class that day, Sarah and John knew that they would always remember this moment. It was a reminder that no matter how hard things got, they could always find a way to overcome adversity.
