ever hired. Her skills were such that Elon Musk had personally come to the hiring room to 
 offer her the job. Now, Ania was ready for a promotion. But if this was going to be 
 her first mission as a team leader, she didn't want to face it alone. 

 She sent another message back: ``Yes.'' 

``Okay,'' came the response, ``I'm sending the information now.'' Ania glanced 
 at the screen, watching as lines of data flowed down, then paused for a moment before 
 resuming. The numbers were complex and arcane, but she had seen them all before. 
 They were just like the ones that appeared in the briefing room every morning when 
 she came on duty. This was her bread and butter, after all. 

 She was about to ask for more details when a sudden sound filled the Earth-link room: 
 a soft chime, followed by a faint hiss. Ania's eyes widened in surprise as a holographic 
 projection began to form before her. It was an image of her team - all six members of the 
 Mars Orbiter Team. They were standing in front of a giant red orb, the Earth, that had been 
 blown up to almost the size of their entire spacecraft. 

 Ania gasped as she realized what was happening. Her team was about to be stranded on 
 Mars with no way to get home. She looked at the data streaming down the screen. It 
 wasn't just a bunch of numbers anymore; it was a countdown. They had only six minutes 
 left before the launch window closed. 

 She blinked rapidly, trying to process this new information. Then she took a deep breath and 
 began to speak into her comms.
``Hello, Earth!'' She said calmly, ``We have an issue with our launch window. We need to 
 abort the mission immediately.''

 There was a brief silence as the Earth-link communication system processed her words. 
 Then came the response: ``Understood,'' said a voice that sounded like it had been 
 generated by a computer. ``We are sending you emergency instructions now.'' 

 Ania watched as another holographic projection appeared on the screen. This one was a map of 
 Mars, with her team standing in the middle of it. The projection was marked with red lines 
 that led away from their current position, each line labeled with a different number. 
 Ania recognized what they were - escape routes. 

 She looked at her team members, who were all staring blankly at the screen. Then she 
 spoke again.
``Everyone, listen carefully,'' she said, ``we have six minutes to get off this planet. You 
 are to follow these instructions and head towards the designated escape routes. Do not 
 stop until you reach the designated landing site.''

 There was a moment of confusion before one of her team members spoke up.
``But how will we survive on Mars?'' he asked, ``We don't have any oxygen or water!"

 Ania nodded. It was a good question. But she didn't have time to explain. She 
 turned back to the screen and waited for the next holographic projection to appear. 

 This one showed an image of a small spacecraft, designed to hold up to six people. It 
 had been modified to include additional life support systems, including oxygen tanks 
 and water filtration systems. Ania recognized it immediately - it was the escape pod 
 that they had all been trained on during their missions to the Moon. 

 She looked at her team members again, who were still staring blankly at the screen. 
 Then she spoke again, this time with more urgency in her voice.
``This is it,'' she said, ``we have to get into these pods and activate the life 
 support systems immediately. Do not delay!"

 There was a moment of panic before everyone sprang into action, grabbing their 
 assigned escape pods and rushing towards them. Ania watched as they climbed inside, 
 making sure that each person was securely strapped in. Then she turned back to the 
 screen and waited for the final holographic projection to appear. 

 It showed a series of numbers, counting down from six. Each number was accompanied by an 
 image of a spacecraft, starting with one small pod and gradually getting larger until 
 they reached the main spacecraft itself. Ania recognized it immediately - it was the 
 countdown to lift off. 

 She watched as the numbers ticked down, her heart pounding in her chest. Then she heard 
 a sound that made her blood run cold - the countdown had reached zero. But instead 
 of launching, nothing happened. There was only silence. 

 Ania looked up at the screen, her eyes widening in shock as she saw that the Earth-link 
 communication system had crashed. The holographic projections were gone, replaced by a 
 solid black screen. 

 She grabbed the comms device on the desk and began to frantically tap away at the keys. 
 But no matter what she did, there was no response. It was as if the entire planet had 
 vanished into thin air. 

 Ania stared at the screen in disbelief, her mind racing with questions. What had happened? 
 What was going on? And most importantly, how was she supposed to get her team back? 

 She looked at her team members, who were all staring blankly at the screen. Then she 
 turned to the door and pushed it open, stepping out into the darkness beyond. 

``What's going on?'' she called out into the void, her voice echoing off the walls of the 
 Earth-link room. There was only silence in response.
