``Christ, what a night,'' Pete mumbled to himself as he splashed water on his face in the bar's bathroom. Shelly, his best friend's girlfriend, was having her 21st birthday party outside, and he was supposed to be there for her. He had promised her that he would come to the party, but when she called him at work, he realized that he had a very important meeting scheduled for that night. He couldn't reschedule it. Pete sighed and wondered what he was going to do. He didn't want to disappoint Shelly, but he also couldn't miss this important meeting. 

Just then, his phone rang. It was Shelly. 

``Hey, you gotta come to the party tonight," she said urgently. ``It's gonna be amazing!''

Pete hesitated for a moment before answering. "I wish I could, but I have an important meeting scheduled tonight," he replied. 

Shelly groaned. "Okay, fine," she said, sounding disappointed. "I guess we'll see you later."

Pete hung up the phone and sighed again. He didn't want to disappoint Shelly, but he also couldn't miss this important meeting. As he thought about it, he realized that maybe he could find a way to make both happen. Maybe he could leave early from work and go to the party first, and then quickly drive home and make it to his meeting on time. It was risky, but Pete had always been a bit of a risk-taker. 

He quickly changed into jeans and a t-shirt, grabbed his car keys and dashed out of the bar. He knew he was taking a chance, but he was determined to make it work. As he drove to Shelly's house, Pete couldn't help but think about how much fun he was going to have at her party. Maybe it would be a distraction from his nerves about the meeting, and maybe it would remind him of why he was working so hard in the first place. Whatever happened, Pete was determined not to let Shelly down.
