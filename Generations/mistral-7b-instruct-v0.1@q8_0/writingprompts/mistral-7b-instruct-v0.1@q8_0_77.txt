, so much change. He had read everything Nora had sent him. He knew it all by heart.

Nora sat down on the other side of the table. She opened a folder and took out a small booklet. “Ok, here’s your test.” she said, passing the booklet to him. He looked at the title on the cover. “Hierarchy and Structure in Organisms” it read.

He smiled. It was a good title.

He opened the booklet and began to read. The questions were easy. They were about things he had learned months ago. About evolution and adaptation and the different levels of organization in living organisms. He finished the test quickly, confidently answering every question without hesitation.

“That was fast,” Nora said, looking at her watch.

He closed the booklet and handed it back to her. “I read everything you sent me. I know it all.” he said, smiling.

Nora looked at him with a mixture of surprise and disappointment. “Well, that’s not very helpful,” she said. “The test is supposed to be challenging. You need to demonstrate that you understand the concepts.”

“I do understand the concepts,” he replied, leaning back in his chair. “But I don’t see the point in repeating myself. I’ve already learned everything there is to know about hierarchy and structure in organisms.”

Nora frowned. “That may be true, but it doesn’t mean you’re ready for this project,” she said. “This project requires more than just knowledge. It requires creativity and innovation. You need to come up with new ways of thinking about these concepts. You can’t just rely on what you already know.”

He sighed. He had been so confident. He had thought he knew everything there was to know. But Nora was right. This project required more than just knowledge. It required imagination and creativity.

“Ok, I’ll try again,” he said. “I’ll think outside the box.”

Nora smiled. “That’s the spirit,” she said. “Now let’s get started.”
