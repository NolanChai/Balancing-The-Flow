ifies over time.

As I mentioned previously, our universe has gone through several bifurcations where different timelines were formed. Each new timeline spawned a new universe, each one distinct from the last. But eventually, each of these universes will inevitably merge back into a single universal framework. This will happen in the future and it will be catastrophic.

The merging will occur as a result of the entropy and chaos inherent to all systems that have existed for long enough. At some point, the complexity of each universe will level out and they will begin to converge. Eventually, this process will culminate in a massive singularity event where all the universes merge into a single cosmic entity.

This singularity will be the ultimate end of all multiverse simpification. It will be the final bifurcation, leaving us with only a single universe to inhabit.
