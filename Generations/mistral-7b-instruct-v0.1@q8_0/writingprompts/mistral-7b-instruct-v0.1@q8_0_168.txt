ceptical." He said in a firm tone. ``She might be telling the truth, but that doesn't mean she isn't lying about what she saw or didn't see.'' 
 
 I took a deep breath and nodded. "I agree. We need more evidence to build on." 
 
 Detective Rand stood up from his chair, walking over to the desk and picking up my file. He opened it slowly, looking at the pictures inside. ``I can see you've got quite a few people with connections to the victim here, but none of them seem to have any direct ties to this particular incident."

 
 "Yes," I replied, ``That was my first thought too.'' 

 Detective Rand turned towards me, his expression serious. ``We need to start looking into anyone who might have had a motive for doing something like this." He said in a stern voice.
``This isn't just about catching someone, it's also about finding out why they did it and what they hoped to achieve. We can't ignore that aspect of the investigation." 

 I nodded my agreement and took out my notepad, jotting down everything we had discussed so far. It was going to be a long road ahead, but I was determined to see it through.
