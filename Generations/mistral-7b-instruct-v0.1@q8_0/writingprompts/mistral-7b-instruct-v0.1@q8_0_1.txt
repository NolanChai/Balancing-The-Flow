off of the metal wall behind me.
`` Stop,'' the guard called in alarm.
`` Go ahead,'' the voice said, ``just remember: don't stop.''
I scrambled to my feet and ran full speed toward the wall that I could see looming before me. The door slammed shut behind me as I rounded a corner into a long, narrow corridor. The dim light from the guard station flickered off the shiny metal surface of the wall in a grotesque, distorted pattern that made me feel as if I was moving through a twisted dream.
`` What did they do to her?'' I gasped.
`` Don't worry,'' the voice said calmly. ``It's only a temporary procedure. You'll be fine.''
I continued to run blindly down the dimly lit passage, my heart pounding in my chest. The walls seemed to close in around me as I felt myself being pulled toward something terrible, something that filled me with dread and fear.
`` Stop,'' the voice said suddenly.
`` Why?'' I shouted.
`` Because you're reaching the end.''
I stumbled forward into darkness and found myself face down on a cold, hard metal floor. My hands were tied behind my back and my feet were secured to the ground by thick metal chains that dug deep into my flesh. Panic surged through me as I realized what was happening. The voice spoke again, but this time it was much louder.
`` You're going to be a prisoner forever.''
The last word echoed in my ears as I felt myself being lifted off the ground and dragged away into darkness.
