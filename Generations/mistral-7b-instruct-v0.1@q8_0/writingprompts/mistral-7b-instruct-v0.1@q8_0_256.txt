anything at all to keep me from falling through the rotting floorboards.

*Why did I climb up here anyway? * I couldn't answer that, but a small part of me suspected it was in search of something that could answer that very question.

I looked around at the piles of dust and cobwebs that covered every available surface, wondering what my eyes were seeing instead of the memories they should have been recalling.

*Where were my memories? * I asked myself, as if someone would suddenly appear to provide an answer.

A sudden gust of wind sent a shower of leaves and dirt down onto the floorboards below me, snapping me out of whatever trance I was in. I looked down, taking in the mess that lay before me, wondering how it had all gotten this way.

I started to climb back down, but as my feet found purchase on the rickety boards, I realized that something else was wrong. It wasn't just the memories that were missing, it was also the feeling of familiarity with this place. I'd spent countless hours up here as a child, playing and exploring, but now it felt like a stranger's home.

I shook my head, trying to clear the confusion from my mind. *This isn't possible, this must be a dream...* But even as the words left my lips, I knew they were false. This was all too real.

As I made my way back down into the darkness of the attic, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dread. Something was off, something was missing, and I had no idea what it could be.
