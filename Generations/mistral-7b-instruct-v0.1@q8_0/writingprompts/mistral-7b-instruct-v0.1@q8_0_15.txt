she probably has tons of guys asking her out every day.

She smiled at me and walked away. As soon as she was gone, I felt a twinge of sadness wash over me. Why couldn't I just be myself around her? Why did I always get nervous and screw everything up? I sighed and shook my head. It was time to stop thinking about her and move on.

But as the day went on, I found myself constantly thinking about her again. Every time I saw her, my heart skipped a beat. Every time she smiled at me, my stomach fluttered. I knew I had to do something about it, but what?

As I sat alone in my room that night, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I would write her a letter. A heartfelt letter expressing how I felt about her and asking if she would consider going out with me.

I poured my heart and soul into the letter, telling her everything I had been feeling. As I finished writing it, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. I had finally done something about my feelings and now all I could do was wait for her response.

The next day, I saw her walking down the hall and my heart skipped a beat as she approached me. She handed me the letter with a smile on her face. "I read your letter," she said. "And I really appreciate you taking the time to write it."

"I'm glad you liked it," I replied nervously. "But what does that mean for us?"

She looked at me and smiled. "Well, I think we should go on a date," she said.

My heart leapt with joy as she took my hand and led me out of the school. It was the start of something beautiful, and I knew I would never forget it.
