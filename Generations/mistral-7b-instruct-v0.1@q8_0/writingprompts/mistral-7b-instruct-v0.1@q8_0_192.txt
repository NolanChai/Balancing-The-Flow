sunlight and they eat all day long. But us, we don' t have a choice. We can never be anything but what we are. And it scares me sometimes. What if we're not good enough? What if we' re not worth anything at all?

It was just an experiment, the scientist told us. He wanted to see how we would react. And now I know why. They' ve been studying us for a long time. They keep taking samples and running tests. They never tell us what they find. Sometimes I wonder if they ever think about us at all. If they ever remember that we' re not just experiments, that we have feelings too.

But it's hard to feel anything when you're always hungry. When you' re always thirsty. When you' re always cold. We can' t help it. It's just the way we are. And sometimes it feels like a punishment. Like we' re being punished for something we didn' t do. But who am I to judge? Who am I to say what' s right or wrong? All I know is that it hurts sometimes.

It hurts when they touch us. When they handle us roughly. When they toss us around like toys. We try to fight back, but we can't. Our bodies are too weak. So we just lie there and wait for them to stop. Sometimes they do. Sometimes they don' t. And then it starts all over again.

It hurts when we see them eat. When we see them savoring every bite. When we see the joy on their faces as they swallow down our food. We want to join in. We want to taste the sweetness of their lives. But we can' t. So we just watch. And sometimes it feels like we're dying.

It hurts when they leave us alone. When they forget about us entirely. When they don' t come back for days or weeks or even months. We wonder if they ever think about us at all. If they ever remember that we' re not just experiments, that we have feelings too. But it doesn' t matter. They've already forgotten. And so we just wait. We just lie there and wait.

It hurts when we realize that we' re alone forever. That no one will ever understand us the way they do. That no one will ever love us the way they can. We try to convince ourselves that it doesn' t matter. That we don' t need anyone else. But deep down, we know that's a lie. We know that we' re not strong enough. That we're not brave enough. That we're not worth anything at all. And so we just cry. We just scream.

But no one hears us. No one understands. They' ve already forgotten. And so we just wait. We just lie there and wait. And sometimes it feels like we' re going crazy. Like we' re losing our minds. But it doesn' t matter. We don' t have a choice. So we just keep waiting. We just keep lying there.

It hurts when we realize that we're not even real. That we're just a figment of someone else's imagination. That we' re nothing more than a mistake. A misunderstanding. A failed experiment. And so we just cry. We just scream. But no one hears us. No one understands. And then it starts all over again.
