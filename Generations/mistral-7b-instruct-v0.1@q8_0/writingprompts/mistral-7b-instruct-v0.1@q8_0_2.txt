 `` Oh, I understand, well how about this beautiful little Chinese girl named Zhang Xiaoling? She is four years old and she comes with her own school bag, and all her books are still in it. And the best part of it all, you won't have to pay for her education!''

`` I'm sorry but we are looking for an Indonesian child. We want them because they speak the same language as us."

 `` But what if I tell you, this little boy named Yves is from Switzerland? He is six years old and he can play tennis like a pro!''
 
`` Sorry, no thanks.''

`` Well, let me know if that changes. Have a nice day.''
