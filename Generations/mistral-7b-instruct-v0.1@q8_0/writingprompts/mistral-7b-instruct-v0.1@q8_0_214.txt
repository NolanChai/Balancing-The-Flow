- rocks and tree roots that are just as dangerous to the unwary as anything a predator might find. He stays close to the trees, but not so close as to be trapped by their branches. And yet there are still those things.

The shadows lengthen, and he stops for a moment, his senses alert. There's something wrong - some scent, some sound that he can't identify. He moves on, carefully watching the bushes in front of him. The sound grows louder, and he knows that it's coming from there.

A snarl, a growl, a rustle - all three make him jump, and he turns to see what it is. A wolf, its fur matted and dirty, emerges from behind the bushes. Its eyes are red with hunger, and its teeth are sharp enough to tear through bone.

He knows that this one is dangerous, but he also knows that there's no way around it. He moves towards the wolf slowly, his body tense. The animal barks once, then twice, then stops. It's watching him, waiting for him to make a move.

But he doesn't. Instead, he sits down, trying to appear calm and nonchalant. And as he does so, he reaches into his pouch and pulls out a small stone. He holds it up in front of him, turning it this way and that. The wolf watches, its eyes narrowing with curiosity.

And then, suddenly, the wolf lunges forward, snapping at the stone. But it's too late - the stone has already hit its mark, striking a nerve in the wolf's neck. It falls to the ground, convulsing and howling as the poison takes effect.

The shadow moves on, leaving the dead wolf behind. And as he continues his journey, he knows that there will be more dangers ahead. But he also knows that he has the skills and the tools to face them.

And so he presses on, moving silently among the shadows. For he is a creature of the night - a hunter, a survivor, and a protector. And no matter what challenges lie ahead, he will always be ready for them.
