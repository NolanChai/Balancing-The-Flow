now what I was up to for the summer. So I checked in and saw my friend Ryan had posted about some new show on Netflix:

> "I just started watching Arabian Amulets on Netflix and can't seem to stop! It's got a really intriguing storyline, and I think you should check it out!"

As the next few days went by, I watched the whole first season in one go. As far as Netflix shows go, I'd say this is worth the watch.

## Plot

The show takes place in a distant future where Earth is a barren wasteland and humanity is almost extinct. There are only two cities left: New York City and Shanghai. However, something has changed: the world is no longer bound by gravity as we know it. Instead, there are four different realms connected to one another, each representing one of the four cardinal directions. These realms are:

1. **North:** A cold realm that represents winter and contains a dark forest.
2. **East:** A hot realm that represents summer and contains a desert.
3. **South:** A dark realm that represents fall and contains a jungle.
4. **West:** A bright realm that represents spring and contains a lush meadow.

The people of these realms are bound together by a special artifact known as the **Amulet,** which has the power to grant wishes. However, each realm has its own rules and restrictions for using this amulet. For example, in the North realm, you can only wish for something related to cold or ice. In the East realm, you can only wish for something related to fire or heat.

The series follows the story of twin siblings, Navin and Norah Rao. They come from an ancient family that possesses a powerful amulet which has been passed down through generations. As children, they were forced by their parents to use the amulet to wish for peace between the four realms. However, as they wished, things went wrong; the amulet was corrupted and only granted partial wishes.

Now, years later, Navin is a teenager who has been tasked with finding the four realms and their respective amulets, so that they can be destroyed to restore balance to the world. Along the way, he teams up with a group of unlikely allies: an artificial intelligence named Vega, a shape-shifting thief named Darius, and a powerful warrior from the East realm named Yara. Together, they must navigate through the four realms, facing off against powerful enemies and uncovering secrets about their own pasts.

## Characters

Navin is the protagonist of the series. He is a 17 year old boy who comes from an ancient family with a history of amulet wielding. He has long brown hair and dark eyes. Navin is a compassionate and kind person, but he struggles to come to terms with the weight of his responsibilities.

## Conclusion
