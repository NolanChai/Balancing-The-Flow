veything they thought could never happen did happen in one single day.

It all started around noon when the sky turned grey and the wind picked up. The storm clouds had rolled in from the west and before anyone could even make sense of what was happening, hail and lightning started to fall. The rain came down so hard that it seemed like needles were being pinned into your skin.

The streets were flooded within minutes, cars were thrown off the road and buildings started to collapse under the force of the wind. People panicked, they ran for their lives screaming and crying.

Then there was the explosion. No-one knows exactly what caused it but suddenly everything went silent, the storm stopped and the sky cleared. In the center of the city there was a great big hole where a building used to stand. The ground shook so hard that people were thrown off their feet and buildings started to crumble around them.

The survivors were left to pick up the pieces of their lives. They were afraid to leave their homes, they were afraid to go outside. They were afraid that something else might happen at any moment.

And yet, despite everything that had happened, there were still people who were alive. People who had been through this punishment and had come out the other side. And maybe, just maybe, they would learn from what had happened. Maybe they would listen to God and try to do better next time.
