arm and waited for a few seconds, listening intently before moving further into the prison complex.

It was another one of those places that were built to intimidate you. A maze of steel and concrete, with barbed wire fences and tiny windows high up. The paint had peeled off most of the walls, leaving them gray and weathered.

I took a deep breath before stepping into the courtyard. The sun was setting behind the tall towers, casting an eerie orange glow over everything. Shadows danced on the cracked concrete floor, creating patterns that seemed to mock my sanity. 

My heart thudded in my chest as I scanned the area. There were bodies scattered everywhere - some sprawled out in what looked like fatal accidents, others with gaping wounds or broken limbs. It was a scene from hell, and yet, there was something strangely beautiful about it too. Like nature reclaiming its domain after centuries of neglect.

I walked past the corpses, feeling their cold stares follow me. They were all dressed in tattered rags, remnants of their former selves. Some had been burned, others shot or stabbed. It was a grim reminder of what life inside this place must have been like.

And then I saw him. Or rather, her - or maybe it was neither. A figure wrapped in a white sheet, lying motionless under the dim light. Her face was obscured by the cloth, but something told me she wasn't dead. Not yet.

I approached cautiously, pulling back my weapon just in case. As I got closer, I noticed a faint pulse. It was slow, steady, almost rhythmic. Like a lullaby calling out to the unknown.

I knelt beside her, ripping away the sheet to reveal her face. She was young, probably no more than twenty. Her eyes were wide open, filled with terror and confusion. They stared at me, blank and unseeing, as if she didn't recognize me either.

Her body shook slightly, and I realized too late that she was shivering. I removed my jacket and placed it over her shoulders, watching as her fingers clenched tightly into fists. 

She looked so fragile, so vulnerable. And yet, there was something about her that felt familiar. Like I had seen her before, not just in pictures or stories, but in the flesh. It was a strange sensation, one that made me feel both connected and disconnected at the same time.

Suddenly, she started convulsing. Her whole body jerked violently, twisting and turning in a frenzied dance. I tried to hold her down, but she was too strong. Too light. She seemed to be fighting for something - air perhaps, or maybe just life itself.

As the convulsions subsided, her breath came out in ragged gasps. She opened her eyes slowly, searching for mine. And when she found them, she gave me a look of pure recognition. It was like seeing myself reflected back at me, only distorted and twisted.

And then, without warning, she started screaming. A high-pitched wail that echoed through the courtyard, piercing my ears and sending shivers down my spine. I tried to cover her mouth, but she pushed me away, arching her back and thrusting herself upwards.

Her body glowed with an otherworldly light, pulsating in time with her screams. And as I watched, she began to transform. Her limbs grew longer, stretching out towards the sky like tendrils of ivy. Her face changed too, morphing into something else entirely - something beautiful and terrible at the same time.

It was then that I realized what was happening. She was being possessed, consumed by some dark force that had taken over her body. And it wasn't just any possession - it was a symbiotic relationship, one where the entity inside her was feeding off her life energy.

I stood frozen, watching as the transformation continued. Her skin turned translucent, revealing the pulsating mass beneath. The thing inside her was growing larger, its tentacles snaking outwards, searching for more flesh to consume.

And then, without warning, it burst forth from her body. A shower of gore and ichor erupted around me, drenching me in viscera and stench. The creature stood before me, towering above the ground, its true form revealed for the first time.

It was a monster - a grotesque amalgamation of human and beast. Its body was covered in scales and spines, with long, sharp claws that dripped with blood. Its face was a twisted mess of flesh and bone, its eyes burning with malevolence and hunger.

As it stared at me, I felt a wave of dread wash over me. This thing had been inside her, feeding off her energy until she was nothing more than a hollow shell. And now, it wanted me too.

I raised my weapon, taking aim at the creature. My hands trembled as I pulled the trigger, bullets spraying out in a chaotic pattern. But they didn't seem to harm the thing. Instead, it seemed to feed off the impact, growing stronger with each shot.

In that moment, I realized something shocking - this creature wasn't invincible. It could be killed. It just needed the right weapon. And as I looked around the courtyard, I saw what I needed. A pile of makeshift bombs, scattered among the debris.

I quickly gathered a few, setting them carefully near the creature. As it lunged towards me, I activated one of the bombs. The explosion was deafening, sending shrapnel flying every which way. But when the dust settled, the creature was gone.

Only its remains remained - a pile of gore and bone that had once been a beautiful young woman. And as I looked upon her body, I felt a strange sense of sadness and loss. For all the pain she must have endured, for all the fear and terror she must have experienced, she was still just a victim.

But at least now, her soul could rest in peace.
