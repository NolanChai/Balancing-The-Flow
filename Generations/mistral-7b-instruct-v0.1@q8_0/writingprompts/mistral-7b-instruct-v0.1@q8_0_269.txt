in the past. He didn't know why they gave it to him but he didn't ask questions either, he just took it. He knew that if it served its purpose then he will make good use of it.
 
 He was surprised when he saw the metal rod materialize from thin air, right in front of his eyes. The rod was a long one and was made of solid metal. It had a weight to it which added to its feeling of realness.
 
 He took the metal rod in both his hands and began to turn it around, feeling its weight and texture. He could feel that there were some grooves engraved on the surface of the metal rod.
 
 He then proceeded to use the metal rod as a tool to open the door. The metal rod had a strength to it which helped him break the lock with ease. With just a few hits, the lock broke and the door swung open.
 
 As soon as he walked in, he could feel the weight of his body on the ground. He took a deep breath and looked around, trying to adjust his senses to this new environment. 
 
 The room he was standing in was quite sparse. There were some old pieces of furniture scattered around the room, but they had been covered with dust and cobwebs for ages. The walls were cracked and peeling off, and there was a musty smell hanging in the air. 
 
 He walked towards one of the old tables and sat down, feeling the hardwood surface beneath him. He looked around the room, trying to find something that could be useful to him. 
 
 After a few minutes of searching, he noticed a small drawer on the table. The drawer was slightly open, and he could see some papers inside. He opened the drawer and began to read through the papers. They were old documents, written in an unfamiliar script. 
 
 As he continued to read, he could feel that something strange was happening around him. It was as if the air was becoming charged with energy, and there was a feeling of pressure building up inside his head. 
 
 He knew that this wasn't good, so he quickly got up from the chair and began to walk towards the door. But before he could reach it, something strange happened. The metal rod began to levitate off the ground and began to spin around in a circle, emitting a bright light. 
 
 Suddenly, the room was filled with a blinding light, and the air was filled with an electric charge. The papers on the table were lifted up and began to float around the room, as if they had been charged with some sort of energy. 
 
 As the light began to fade, the papers started to settle down, but he could see that something strange had happened. The documents were no longer written in an unfamiliar script, but in a language he recognized. 
 
 He quickly grabbed the metal rod and turned it around, trying to create some sort of shield against the energy. But it was too late, the energy had already reached him. 
 
 He felt his body being pulled apart, as if he was being torn into two. The energy was too strong for him to withstand, and he collapsed onto the floor, unconscious.
