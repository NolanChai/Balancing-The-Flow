MICHAEL: ``Yes, but I didn't realize it was so popular.''

MICHAEL: ``Oh, okay. That makes sense.''

AMY: ``Another way is to contact the show directly and ask if they have any upcoming episodes that need extras or if they are looking for people to be on the show.''

AMY: ``No, you don't need any special qualifications to be on the show. However, it's important to have a good reason for wanting to go undercover in your company.''

MICHAEL: ``I understand. Well I think I'll give it a shot and see if I can get on the show.''

AMY: ``That's great! Let me know how it goes.''
