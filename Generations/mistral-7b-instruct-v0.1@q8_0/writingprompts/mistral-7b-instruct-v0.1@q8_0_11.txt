bh, this is probably a little too much for him to handle. ``Yes,'' he says softly in a voice that makes me want to wrap myself around him. His eyes are a piercing blue and I can feel their gaze on my body every time we make eye contact.
``Can you play with me?'' I ask, leaning forward with eager anticipation. He doesn't seem too sure about this one and hesitates for a moment. But when he finally says yes, I feel like the luckiest person in the world. ``Of course," he murmurs, his voice barely audible. ``What do you want to play?''
``I don't know," I say, shrugging. ``I just want to spend some time with you.'' He smiles at me and nods.
``Alright,'' he says. ``I can think of a few things we could do. What kind of game would you like to play?''
``I don't know," I say again, this time shrugging more forcefully. ``I just want to spend some time with you." He nods again and leans forward, his gaze on me.
``Okay," he says softly. ``If you're willing, we could play a game of hide and seek.'' I look at him suspiciously but when I see the mischievous glint in his eye, I know this is something I want to do. "Alright," I say, smiling back at him.
``Great,'' he says, clapping his hands together. ``Let's get started!'' He stands up from the couch and starts pacing around the room, giving me hints about where he might be hiding. I follow closely, trying to keep up with his movements. We continue for a few minutes until finally, I spot him hiding behind the couch.
``Found you!" I exclaim, triumphantly pointing at him. He laughs and stands up, tucking his hair behind his ear.
``Well played,'' he says. ``What else could we do?" I shrug again and stare blankly at him. He looks confused for a moment before finally saying, "We could play a game of truth or dare." I nod my head eagerly and he grins at me.
``Alright," he says, taking a deep breath. ``Here's your dare: I dare you to tell me something about yourself that you've never told anyone before." I look at him nervously but when I see his serious expression, I nod slowly.
``Okay," I say, taking another deep breath. ``I used to have a pet lizard when I was a kid. His name was Spike and he was the coolest little guy ever. He had these crazy orange spots all over his body and he loved to run around on his hind legs." He grins at me and I smile back at him.
``Now it's your turn," he says, gesturing for me to go first. I take a deep breath and say, "I used to have a secret crush on the boy who lived next door when I was a kid. His name was Harry and he was always playing in his garden with his friends. He had this cute little scar above his left eyebrow and I couldn't help but stare at him whenever he walked by." He laughs at me and says, "Wow, that's brave!"
``Thanks," I say, grinning back at him. We continue playing truth or dare for a few more minutes until finally, it's my turn to come up with a dare. I stare blankly at him for a moment before saying, "I dare you to do something completely out of character." He looks at me curiously and asks, "What do you mean?"
``Like," I say, gesturing wildly with my hands, ``something that would make everyone's jaws drop if they saw you doing it." He chuckles at me and nods.
``Okay," he says. ``I dare you to sing a Taylor Swift song in front of me." I look at him nervously but when I see his serious expression, I nod slowly.
``Alright," I say, taking another deep breath. I close my eyes and start singing "Shake it Off" as loudly as I can. He laughs so hard that he's almost crying and I can feel his gaze on me the whole time. When I finish singing, I look up at him and see that his expression has changed from confused to impressed.
``Wow," he says softly. ``That was amazing." I smile back at him and say, "Thanks!" He nods again and leans forward, taking my hand in his own.
``You know," he says softly, his voice barely audible above the sound of rain hitting the window, "I've never felt this way before. But I think I want to spend more time with you." My heart skips a beat at his words and I stare at him in shock.
``What do you mean?" I ask, my voice barely above a whisper. He looks at me deeply and says, "I mean that I want to be your boyfriend." I look at him, stunned. I can't believe what I'm hearing. I've never felt this way before either. But there's something about him that makes me feel like I could trust him with my life.
``Can you?" he asks, his eyes pleading. I stare at him for a moment, trying to find the words to say. Finally, I nod slowly and squeeze his hand tightly.
``Yes," I whisper. He grins at me and leans forward, taking my lips in a gentle kiss. As we stand there, wrapped up in each other, I know that this is the start of something special. Something beautiful. And I can't wait to see where it takes us.
