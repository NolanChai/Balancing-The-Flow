world, but no one has found any answers. They simply say it's rare to be born without hearing, yet here I am, the only person in the world without it.

It's like living in a dream. All my life, I've been surrounded by sounds that most people take for granted. The rustling of leaves in the wind, birdsong, even the hum of an air conditioner. To me, it's all just white noise. Sometimes, if I close my eyes really hard and concentrate, I can feel some vibrations in my chest, but that's as close as I ever get to hearing.

I've spent my whole life trying to adapt to this new way of living. Learning sign language, reading lips, using special devices to communicate with others. It's a constant struggle, but I've managed to make it work.

But sometimes, I wonder what it would be like to hear the world again. To feel the music in my bones, to understand people without having to read their lips. I know it's impossible, but sometimes, just sometimes, I can't help but dream of what life would be like if I could just hear again.
