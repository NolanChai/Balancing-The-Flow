`` Oh, come on!" I groaned, rolling my eyes at him again. `` There's no way he could ever be a Sith Lord.'' 
 
"And yet," Cody said, `` there are those who believe otherwise." He pointed to a book lying across the table from us: ``The Secret Life of Jar-Jar Binks'' by John Smith. 
 
I picked it up and turned it over to read the cover. ``Is this serious?" I asked incredulously. 
 
``Oh yes, my friend, very serious," Cody said, grinning. ``This book is a classic in fan theory, and it argues that Jar-Jar Binks was actually a Sith Lord all along." 
 
I laughed. ``But what about the fact that he's a Gungan?" I asked, shaking my head. 
 
``That's where things get interesting," Cody said, opening the book to page one. He began to read: 
 
"According to the theory outlined in this book, Jar-Jar Binks was not the innocent and naive Gungan that we all thought he was." 
 
I raised an eyebrow at him. ``How so?" I asked. 
 
``Well, for one thing, his name is not actually Jar-Jar," Cody continued, turning to page two. "In fact, it's just a disguise that he adopted in order to infiltrate the Jedi Order. And that's not all." 
 
"What else?" I asked, intrigued by this new twist on my favorite character. 
 
``Well," Cody said, turning to page three, ``according to the theory, Jar-Jar was actually a powerful Sith Lord who had been exiled from the Dark Side after being betrayed by his fellow Sith Lords." 
 
I whistled in amazement. ``But how did he get away with it?" I asked. 
 
``That's where things get even more interesting," Cody said, turning to page four. "According to the theory, Jar-Jar used his Gungan disguise to infiltrate the Jedi Order and use his powers to manipulate others into believing that he was innocent." 
 
I shook my head in disbelief. ``But that's impossible," I said. "How could he possibly have been a Sith Lord?" 
 
``Well, according to the theory outlined in this book, it's all very plausible," Cody said, turning to page five. He began to read: 

"According to the theory, Jar-Jar was actually born into a powerful Sith dynasty, and was trained from a young age in the ways of the Dark Side." 
 
I raised my eyebrows at him. ``But where's the proof?" I asked. 
 
``Well," Cody said, turning to page six, ``according to the theory, there is no proof." 
 
"What do you mean?" I asked, confused. 
 
"I mean that Jar-Jar's Gungan disguise was so convincing that he was able to hide his true identity and powers from everyone," Cody explained. 
 
"But surely someone would have noticed if he was using the Force all the time," I said, skeptical. 
 
"Well, according to the theory, Jar-Jar was incredibly skilled at hiding his abilities," Cody continued, turning to page seven. He began to read: 

"According to the theory, Jar-Jar was able to use his powers in secret, without anyone suspecting a thing." 
 
I shook my head in disbelief. ``But that's just too crazy," I said. 
 
"No, it's not," Cody said, turning to page eight. He began to read: 

"According to the theory outlined in this book, Jar-Jar was able to use his powers to manipulate others into believing that he was innocent." 
 
I looked at him incredulously. ``But how did he do that?" I asked. 
 
``Well," Cody said, turning to page nine, ``according to the theory, Jar-Jar used his powers of persuasion and mind control to influence those around him." 
 
I shook my head in disbelief. ``But that's just too much," I said. 
 
"No, it's not," Cody said, turning to page ten. He began to read: 

``According to the theory outlined in this book, Jar-Jar was able to use his powers of manipulation and control to bend others to his will." 
 
I looked at him with a mixture of disbelief and fascination. ``But how did he get away with it?" I asked. 
 
``Well," Cody said, turning to page eleven, ``according to the theory, Jar-Jar was incredibly skilled at hiding his powers from others." 
 
I looked at him skeptically. ``But why would he do that?" I asked. 
 
``According to the theory, Jar-Jar realized that if he were known as a Sith Lord, he would be hunted and persecuted by the Jedi," Cody said, turning to page twelve. He began to read: 

``According to the theory outlined in this book, Jar-Jar recognized the dangers of being a Sith Lord and chose to hide his true identity in order to survive." 
 
I shook my head in disbelief. ``But that's just too crazy," I said. 
 
``No, it's not," Cody said, turning to page thirteen. He began to read: 

``According to the theory, Jar-Jar was able to use his powers of manipulation and control to bend others to his will." 
 
I looked at him with a mixture of disbelief and fascination. ``But how did he get away with it?" I asked. 
 
``Well," Cody said, turning to page fourteen, ``according to the theory, Jar-Jar was incredibly skilled at hiding his powers from others." 
 
I looked at him skeptically. ``But why would he do that?" I asked. 
 
``According to the theory, Jar-Jar recognized the dangers of being a Sith Lord and chose to hide his true identity in order to survive," Cody said, turning to page fifteen. He began to read:

I shook my head in disbelief. ``But that's just too crazy," I said. 
 
``No, it's not," Cody said, turning to page sixteen. He began to read: 

``According to the theory, Jar-Jar was able to use his powers of persuasion and mind control to influence those around him." 
 
I looked at him with a mixture of disbelief and fascination. ``But how did he get away with it?" I asked. 
 
``Well," Cody said, turning to page seventeen, ``according to the theory, Jar-Jar was incredibly skilled at hiding his powers from others." 
 
I looked at him skeptically. ``But why would he do that?" I asked. 
 
``According to the theory, Jar-Jar recognized the dangers of being a Sith Lord and chose to hide his true identity in order to survive," Cody said, turning to page eighteen. He began to read:
