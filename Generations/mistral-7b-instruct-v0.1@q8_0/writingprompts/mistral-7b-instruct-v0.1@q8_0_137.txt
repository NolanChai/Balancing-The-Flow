aven and Mimi!'' she said earnestly. 

 `` I know, Claire. You do too.'' I nodded. `` But we can't just waltz in here like they're our old friends. They won't accept us back. We're strangers to them." 

``I understand, but we have to try!'' Claire said with tears filling her eyes. 

``We will,'' I promised. ``But we must do it slowly, step by step. And not too soon. It will take time for them to trust us again. They don't know who we are now. We must prove ourselves to them."

``I understand," Claire murmured, and I felt a twinge of guilt for being so harsh on her. But it had to be done, didn't it? She couldn't just barge in uninvited. 

"But what about you?" she asked suddenly. ``What do we need to prove ourselves to them? We were friends before they disappeared."

I hesitated for a moment. Was there something more I needed to prove? Something that I hadn't considered? 

``We can start with the basics," I said eventually. ``We'll show up at school and just try to be friendly, like we used to. Maybe have lunch together. And see if they respond." 

``Okay,'' Claire nodded. ``That makes sense."

I smiled down at her, feeling grateful for her understanding. "Let's do it," I said.
