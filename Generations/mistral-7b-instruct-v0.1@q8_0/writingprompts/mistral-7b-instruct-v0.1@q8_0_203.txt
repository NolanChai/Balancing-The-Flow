to the screen on my Android device and searching away like a mad man.

The app has some amazing features. The search engine is fast and returns great results. I also love that I can save pages for later use. That way I don't have to bookmark everything. It's just so much faster than using the browser, right?

But here's the thing: I have been getting a ton of pop-ups on my device lately. And I realized that they all stem from this app. Every time I type something into this app, it seems to generate some sort of ad or pop-up on my phone screen. I mean, maybe I should just turn off the ads, but then I won't be able to search as quickly and easily anymore.

I guess it's just a trade-off. Either I deal with the ads, or I have a slower and less convenient way of searching online. And at this point, I think I prefer the convenience. Maybe one day I'll switch back to using my browser, but for now, I'm going to keep this app and its annoying ads.
