t sure if it was the stove or the oven that was the source of heat, but I did not care. I was just glad that I was warm.

I gazed up at the ceiling of my room, which was adorned with posters from various bands and musicians I admired. One poster in particular caught my eye; it was a photograph of Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds, who had performed in Paris only a few weeks prior. I had been there, sitting on the grass outside the Palais des Sports, waiting for them to take the stage. It had been an incredible experience, one that I would not soon forget.

But now, as I sat here in my small apartment, surrounded by the familiar, I could not help but feel a sense of longing for something more. A feeling that I was destined for something greater. Something beyond these four walls and the bustling streets outside. I had always been restless, even as a child, but now, as an adult, that restlessness had intensified tenfold.

I knew that I could not simply sit here, waiting for something to happen. I needed to take action, to seek out new experiences and challenges. But where to begin? I was not sure. I had always been a dreamer, but now, as I sat here in the dim light of my room, I felt a sudden sense of clarity.

I would start by making a list. A list of everything I wanted to accomplish, everything I wanted to experience. And then, I would work on each and every one of them, one by one. It was a simple plan, but it was a plan nonetheless.

And so, with a renewed sense of purpose, I reached for my pen and paper, and began to write.
