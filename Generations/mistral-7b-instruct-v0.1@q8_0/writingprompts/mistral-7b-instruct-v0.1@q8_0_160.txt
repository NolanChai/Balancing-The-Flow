looked at me with her warm brown eyes that glimmered with tears. She said, “You are so lucky.” 
I woke up with a start and realized I must have been dreaming. I rolled over to the side and stood up. The room was empty and dark. I felt around the wall and found it. It was a large painting of her that I had painted myself years ago. As I traced my fingers over her face, I could almost feel her warmth and love for me. 
I sat down on the couch and closed my eyes. The tears began to fall, but they were not sad ones. They were tears of happiness and gratitude for having her as a part of my life, even if only in my dreams. 
As I sat there alone with my thoughts, I realized that sometimes being alone can be very lonely, but it can also bring peace and contentment. It can allow us to connect with ourselves and our own emotions in ways that are impossible when we are surrounded by others. 
In the end, whether we are alone or not, it is up to us to find happiness and meaning in our lives. And sometimes, even the smallest moments of happiness can be the most significant ones.
