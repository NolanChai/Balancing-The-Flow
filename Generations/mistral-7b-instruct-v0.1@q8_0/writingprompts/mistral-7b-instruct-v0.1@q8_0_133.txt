te. He ordered a drink in exchange, to wash away the taste.

"What have we here?" Alistair asked, gesturing towards his drink. It was a tall glass of amber liquid, with a cherry on top.

"The bartender's special," the barkeep replied gruffly. He leaned over the bar and whispered into Alistair's ear. "It's just orange juice, mixed with a few drops of whiskey." 

Alistair snorted, it was obvious that this barkeep was trying to swindle him. But he didn't care, the drink looked tasty enough to ignore the deceptive words of the barkeep.

"Well then," Alistair said with a nod, taking a sip of his drink. He savored each drop, savoring the taste of the orange juice and whiskey. 

The bartender glared at Alistair as he took another swig of his drink.

Alistair grinned wickedly, "You can try to cheat me, but I'm not one to be taken advantage of." He stood up, finishing his drink and paying the bartender. "Thanks for the drink, it was...special," he said with a wink before walking out of the bar.

The barkeep spat on the ground after Alistair left, muttering under his breath about cheating bastards.
