el, but my sword is, Mjolnir. I have killed many foes in my time. I have seen the end of worlds, and I have been to realms that are not meant for mortals.

## Background Edit

Hilda was created by Odin himself when he sought an eternal warrior who could fight alongside his Aesir kin in the afterlife. As the first daughter born of the Allfather, she was imbued with extraordinary strength and durability, making her a formidable opponent even for gods. She was also granted the ability to control lightning and fire, making her even more deadly.

She has seen the rise and fall of many civilizations throughout history. Her most recent incarnation is that of a warrior princess from Asgard who fought alongside the God of Thunder himself in the Great War. It was during this war that she lost her first love, Thor, to the hands of an enemy sorcerer who wielded the powerful artifact, Mjolnir.

## Personality Edit

Hilda is a stoic and reserved warrior who rarely shows any emotion beyond anger. She has fought countless battles in her time and has seen too much death and destruction to become attached to anything or anyone. Her sole purpose is to defend the realms from those who would do harm, no matter what form they take. She is fiercely loyal to those she considers friends, but will not hesitate to turn on them if they betray her trust.

## Appearance Edit

Hilda stands at a towering 6 feet and weighs about 250 pounds of muscle. She has long silver hair that falls in waves down her back and piercing blue eyes that seem to look right through you. Her armor is made of a shimmering golden metal that seems to glow with an otherworldly light, and she wields the mighty Mjolnir as her weapon of choice.

## Abilities Edit

Hilda possesses incredible strength and durability, making her almost invincible in combat. She can also control lightning and fire, allowing her to unleash devastating attacks on her enemies. Her sword is enchanted with the power of Mjolnir, which grants it the ability to cleave through even the strongest of materials.
