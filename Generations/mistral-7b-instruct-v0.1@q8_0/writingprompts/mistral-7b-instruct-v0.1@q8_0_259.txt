right now but I'll tell you something, when we get older, and we will, it's gonna be a whole lot worse without that degree. We're gonna have to take classes just to learn how to live a normal life. Don't think I'm joking here, you think we can afford to get the fucking job we want in the field we love? No, we're gonna have to settle for some crappy day job that pays minimum wage and we'll be stuck in it forever because we didn't bother with our education. 

 So listen here little guy, you need to buckle down and take those classes. We may not like them but they're gonna make sure we can live a decent life in the future. I know right now it seems like such a chore but trust me, in the long run you'll thank me for it. You think I got where I am by being lazy? Hell no. I worked my ass off and so did you. We just have to be patient and keep grinding. 

 Also, don't forget about your health. You need to eat better and exercise more. Trust me, we can't afford to get sick or injured in the future. We already have enough problems going on. But I won't harp on that. Just know that it's important and you should take care of yourself now. 

 So, what else do you wanna know? There's a lot more I could tell you but we don't know if we'll ever meet again. I hope this message finds you well and gives you some guidance on the path ahead. If not, just remember that I'm always here for ya, no matter where or when. Love ya little guy. 

 Sincerely, 

 Your future self
