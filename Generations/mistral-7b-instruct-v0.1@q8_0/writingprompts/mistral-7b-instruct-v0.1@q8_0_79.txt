'd just get it done?

I know the feeling of wanting to skip work or homework, but procrastination can have long-term effects on our mental and emotional wellbeing. It can lead to anxiety, stress, and even depression.

The reason why I felt bad about not doing what I needed to do is because my priorities were aligned with my values. When we prioritize tasks based on their importance to us, we are more likely to feel satisfied with the outcomes of those tasks.

So instead of trying to avoid or procrastinate on tasks that align with our values, it's important to acknowledge and respect those values by giving them the time and attention they deserve. We may not always feel like doing something, but when we prioritize it based on its importance to us, we are more likely to experience a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.

Ultimately, the key is to find a balance between work and play, and to approach tasks with an attitude of curiosity and creativity. By doing so, we can avoid the negative effects of procrastination while still enjoying the benefits of pursuing our passions and goals.
