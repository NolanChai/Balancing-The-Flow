is everything. That's what makes it look right. That's what makes it look real.''

`` And I think the secret to good coloring is not over-thinking it. You just let yourself go, and let your mind take you on a journey through the picture. You see something that catches your eye, and you follow it with your brush. That's when the magic happens. That's when you really start to bring the picture to life.''

`` And sometimes I use a technique called color blocking. It involves using big areas of flat color to create a sense of depth and texture in the picture. It's like building with blocks. You start with one color, and then add another on top of it, and another after that, until you get the desired effect.''

`` And don't worry too much about getting everything perfect. It's all part of the process. Sometimes mistakes can lead to new discoveries, and help you find new ways of approaching your art. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers. Just do what feels right for you, and trust your instincts.''
