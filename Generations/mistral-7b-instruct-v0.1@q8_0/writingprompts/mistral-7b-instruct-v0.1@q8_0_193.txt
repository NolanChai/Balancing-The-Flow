to learn an instrument at all? It wasn’t like I had anything better to do.

 So I took up the bass.

 As it turns out, the bass is quite easy to play. Not that I was any good at it. But my fingers were flexible enough. After a while, I learned that you didn’t really need much technical skill to play the bass. It was more about attitude. If you could put in some effort and believe in yourself, then you could be a decent player.

 I practiced every day for hours on end. And my progress was slow but steady. I didn’t know if I was any good, but I was getting better.

 Then one day, my band got offered a gig. It was at a small bar downtown. I was nervous as hell. I hadn’t performed in front of an audience before. But Ethan assured me that I would be fine. He had faith in me. And he was right. I played like a pro. The crowd loved it. 

 And from that day on, I realized the power of believing in yourself. It can make all the difference. If you put in enough effort and have confidence in yourself, then there is nothing you can’t achieve. 

 I still suck at the bass, but I don’t care. I love playing it. And that’s all that matters to me.
