When everything cleared, I saw that there had been an explosion in the middle of the room. The walls were cracked and there was smoke everywhere, and all my books were scattered on the floor. 
 I jumped up from my chair and ran to the window, hoping to see what had happened. But when I looked outside, I saw nothing but clear sky and blue ocean. 
 I didn't know what to do or think. I was alone in a room with no doors or windows and nothing seemed to make sense. 
 As time went on, I started to hear strange sounds coming from the walls and the floorboards under my feet. It felt like someone was trying to break in. 
 I couldn't move. I was too afraid. But then I remembered something my mother had told me when I was a child. 
 `` If you ever find yourself trapped, just think about the happiest moment of your life and imagine that person or thing is with you. It will give you strength.'' 
 So I closed my eyes and thought of my childhood home and the smell of freshly baked cookies wafting through the air. 
 Suddenly, the strange sounds stopped and I felt a comforting presence behind me. 
 I turned around to find that it was just me. But somehow, I knew that I wasn't alone. 
 And with that thought, I realized that I had the power to overcome my fears and escape from this room.
