5 minutes later they call you back. Now it takes weeks for an interview and sometimes not even then do you get the job. I had 2 interviews recently for jobs I knew I was qualified for, and they said they couldn't contact me yet because they were still going through all the applications. Why can't these companies just let me know? It's not like anything is ever gonna change now, so why bother even trying to get a job at all?
User 1: I don’t think it’s shit. Just because you’re not getting the jobs you want doesn’t mean things are bad. You’ve gotta keep your options open and apply to everything that interests you. Don’t focus on one job, there are plenty out there. Also, companies don’t have to contact you right away. They have a lot of applications coming in so they need to review them first. 

I went through a period where I had interviews but didn’t get any jobs for about 2 years. It was tough, but I kept applying and applying until I got one. So don’t give up!
