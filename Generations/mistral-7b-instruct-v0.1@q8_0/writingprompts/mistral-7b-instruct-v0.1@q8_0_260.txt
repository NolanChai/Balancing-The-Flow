ia shook his arm, ``You did such a great job, dad!''

 He smiled weakly. “I really appreciate that, but you know, there was some bad blood between me and the police before.”

 Jackie raised her eyebrows. “Oh? You never told me about that.” 

 Cassidy shook his head, “I didn't want to. They accused me of killing her mother and...” He paused as he tried to remember why he hadn’t told them that part. The more he thought about it, the less it made sense. It was like a fog had descended over him.
 
 “I don’t know,” he said finally. “It’s just not something I want to talk about.”

 Francinia patted him on the arm. “You did what you had to do, dad.”

 Cassidy nodded. He didn't know if they were right or not but he was relieved that they were here for him. They had always been there for him, no matter what. 

 He looked at his daughter again and smiled. “Jackie, you did such a great job tonight. You really went all out.” 

 Jackie blushed, “I just wanted to make sure everything was perfect for mom.”
 
 Cassidy's heart swelled with pride. His daughter had grown up so much, and he was proud of her for everything she had accomplished. He looked at Francinia and saw that she was still smiling at him, and he realized how lucky he was to have such great kids.

 “You guys are amazing,” he said.

 Jackie hugged him tightly. “We love you too, dad.”

 Francinia put her arm around his neck, “And we’re so proud of you too, dad.”
 
 Cassidy smiled as he felt the warmth of their love surrounding him. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, savoring this moment. It was a moment he would never forget, and one that he knew would make him a better person in the end.
