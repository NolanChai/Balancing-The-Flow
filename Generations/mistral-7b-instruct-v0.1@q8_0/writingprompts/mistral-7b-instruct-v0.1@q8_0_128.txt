my PlayStation to play, but there was a message: ``Please update your console software.''

I didn't want to do anything that might cause problems with my game, so I clicked on `Update Software` and waited for the download to finish. Suddenly, my PlayStation started beeping like crazy. It kept flashing different colors and symbols until it finally turned off completely.

When I tried to turn it back on, there was no power at all. I looked around the room and saw that all of the electrical outlets were dead. I had never heard of this happening before. How could something like this happen?

I immediately went outside and looked for a transformer. There wasn't one anywhere in sight. I also checked to see if any of my neighbors had any problems, but they seemed to be okay.

After searching online, I found out that this kind of thing is actually pretty common. Apparently, there are some video games that can cause power outages because they use a lot of electricity. The game I received in the mail was one of those games.

I didn't know what to do, so I called up customer service and explained the situation. They told me that I would need to return the game to get a refund, but they also suggested that I unplug all of my electronic devices when not in use.

In the end, it turned out that the game wasn't worth risking any further problems with the power. I returned it and decided to stick to older games that didn't require as much electricity.
