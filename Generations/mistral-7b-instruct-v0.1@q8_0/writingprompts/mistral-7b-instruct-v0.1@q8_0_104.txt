ies who had once called him a pussy got their comeuppance. The people that had always mocked his love of comics and video games were now the ones lying on the ground, lifeless. And for the first time in his life, Jonathan was popular. He was even invited to the party.
 
 But as time went on, Jonathan's mood began to shift. Sure, he enjoyed the chaos of it all at first. It was fun to see the world turn upside down. However, as he started to realize that the end was truly nigh, his mindset began to change. He had always been a bit of a loner, but now he found himself wishing for company.
 
 He longed for someone to talk to, to share his thoughts with. He missed the days when he could go out and play video games with his friends. But no one was around anymore. All of his classmates were dead. Even his family.
 
 Jonathan spent most of his time wandering through the abandoned cityscape that used to be his home. It was eerie, to say the least. The streets were deserted, and there was a strange silence in the air. The only sounds were the occasional scavengers rummaging through trash cans or the distant echoes of some sort of explosion.
 
 He would often sit on the steps of an abandoned building, staring out into the distance. Sometimes he would imagine that he could see people walking down the street, or hear laughter coming from a nearby park. But when he looked closer, he knew that it was all just an illusion.
 
 Jonathan had always been afraid of the unknown. And now, with the world ending around him, he felt more alone than ever before. He didn't know what the future held. All he knew for certain was that the end was near.
