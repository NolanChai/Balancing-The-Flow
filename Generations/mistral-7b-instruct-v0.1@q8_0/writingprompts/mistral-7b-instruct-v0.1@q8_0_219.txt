away from himself, and swung his legs over the side of the bed. It was a cool morning with temperatures in the 70s, but it felt great when he stood up and stretched.
 
 
 John picked up his toothbrush and headed for the bathroom. He brushed his teeth as usual and then gargled with mouthwash before spitting it into the sink. He didn't wash his face or comb his hair - he just had a quick shower and headed downstairs to grab breakfast from the cafeteria.
 
 
 John walked down the hallway, greeting a few of his colleagues as he went by. He saw a few of his friends from college who were working at different companies in the building. They said hi and chatted for a minute before John hurried off to get some coffee.
 
 
 After grabbing his coffee, John headed back up to his office on the 10th floor. The view from his desk was great - he could see the city skyline from his window. He spent a few minutes checking his emails and responding to any urgent messages.
 
 
 At 8:30, John's boss came by to give him an update on a project they were working on together. They chatted for a little bit before John headed back to his desk to work on some more.
 
 
 The day went by pretty quickly after that. John finished up some tasks, went out for lunch with a few co-workers, and then spent the rest of the afternoon working on the project with his boss. It was a busy day, but he enjoyed it.
 
 
 When John got home that evening, he found Sarah sitting in his living room, watching TV. He walked in and introduced himself. "Hey, I'm John," he said. "I live here too."
 
 
 Sarah looked up at him with a friendly smile. "Nice to meet you!" she replied. They struck up a conversation and chatted for a while before going out to dinner together. It was the start of a beautiful friendship.
