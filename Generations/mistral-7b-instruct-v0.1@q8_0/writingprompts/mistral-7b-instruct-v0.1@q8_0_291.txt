stopped. And there she was. A tiny, pale girl with blonde hair that shone in the moonlight. She smiled at me, but her eyes were sad. "I'm lost," she said. "Can you help?" I knew what to do. "Follow me," I said. We started walking together, deeper into the forest. The willows grew thicker and taller around us, almost blocking out the moonlight. But still, we could see the stars above. They were bright and shining, guiding our way. As we walked, we talked. She told me her name was Lily, and she had been wandering for hours. We finally found a path that led back to civilization. I helped her up and held her hand as we walked. When we reached the town, she hugged me tightly and thanked me. And as I watched her walk away, I knew that I would never forget this night. It was a moment of pure magic, when even the darkest woods could light up our hearts.
