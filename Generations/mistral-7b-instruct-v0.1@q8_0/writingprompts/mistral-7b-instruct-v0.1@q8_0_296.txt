-ver forget what it is you serve? '' He whispered to himself as he walked down the hallways of the tower.

It was a simple question. But one that Moira had never fully understood until now. For the past three years, she had been following orders without questioning them. She had always believed that she was simply doing her job as an assassin for the highest authority. But in the back of her mind, there was always some small doubt that perhaps there was more to it than that.

And now, with the revelation of her true purpose, she felt a weight settle onto her shoulders. She was not just an assassin. She was a weapon. And weapons must be controlled and kept in check. It was a heavy burden to bear, but Moira knew she had no choice.

As she walked down the hallways of the tower, she could feel eyes upon her. Eyes that were watching her every move. It was a strange feeling to be watched so closely. But it was one that she would have to get used to. She was a weapon, and she must be kept under close scrutiny at all times.

Moira stopped in the middle of the hallway, her heart pounding in her chest. She had always known that there were other assassins out there. Other people who were just as skilled and dangerous as she was. But she had never imagined that there could be an entire organization dedicated to controlling and using them for their own purposes.

The thought was both terrifying and exhilarating at the same time. She was a part of something much bigger than herself. Something that was both powerful and dangerous. And she knew that she had no choice but to follow the orders of her master, no matter what they were.

As she continued down the hallways of the tower, Moira couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to learn. More to discover about herself and the world around her. But for now, she knew that she had to focus on her task. She was a weapon, and she must be kept under control at all times.
