had happened. I didn't know if it was from being shot, or if he was somehow still alive. He looked like he could have died on the spot, but something was still moving inside him.

"I can't just leave you here," I thought. "I don't want to see him die."

I quickly picked up my radio and called dispatch. "911, this is 4567. We have a guy down here. He needs immediate medical attention. Can you send an ambulance?"

"Ambulance on the way," came the distant reply. I waited anxiously as I heard the sound of sirens approaching.

A few minutes later, I saw the red and blue lights in the distance. An ambulance was speeding towards me, its driver no doubt terrified of what he might find. I quickly pulled out a first aid kit from my truck and started to tend to Joseph's wounds as best I could. He winced in pain as I tried to clean the bullet holes in his chest, but he didn't scream or cry.

"Hey, buddy," I said gently. "You gotta hang on until help gets here."

He nodded weakly, and I continued to work on him. The paramedics arrived soon after, their faces a mixture of shock and concern as they saw the state of Joseph's injuries. They quickly took over from me, moving him onto a gurney and starting to work on his pulse.

"We need to get him to the hospital," one of them said urgently. "He doesn't have much time."

I nodded in agreement, and we started to lift Joseph up and carry him towards the ambulance. He was too weak to walk, but he didn't seem to mind. He just closed his eyes and let us take care of him.

As we loaded him into the ambulance, I couldn't help but think about what had led to this moment. Joseph had been a suspect in a robbery, and when the police found him trying to steal something from a convenience store, they assumed he was armed. They opened fire without hesitation, and now he was lying on that gurney, barely alive.

I didn't know what would happen next, but I knew one thing for sure. This was not how Joseph Walker's day should have ended.
