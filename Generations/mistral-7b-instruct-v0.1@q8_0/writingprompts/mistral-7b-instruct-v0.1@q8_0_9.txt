ists had cleared from my mind. I tried to sit up, but something seemed to be holding me down.

When I finally managed to look around, I was lying on a bed in a room I didn't recognize. The walls were painted white, and the ceiling was made of wood. There were no windows, and the only light came from a lamp on the nightstand. As I looked at the lamp, I realized that it wasn't on, which meant that someone had turned it off before they left.

I tried to move my head, but it felt heavy, as though I had been hit hard. My body was numb and tingling, and my vision was blurry. As I struggled to focus, I saw a figure standing in the doorway, watching me with a concerned expression on their face. They were wearing a white robe, and their eyes seemed to glow from within.

`` Are you alright?'' the figure asked, as they approached the bed. ``You look like you've been through something.''

I couldn't reply, but I felt tears streaming down my face. I was so scared and confused. What had happened to me? How did I get here? And who were they?

The figure sat down on the edge of the bed and took my hand in theirs. They spoke again, this time softly. ``I'm sorry about what happened,'' they said. ``I was there when you were born, and I know how much you mean to me."

As they spoke, a flood of memories came rushing back to me. I remembered a bright light, and then a voice saying my name. I remembered a warm embrace, and then a pain in my chest. And finally, I remembered falling into darkness, and hearing a soft whisper that said, ``Rest now.''

The figure leaned over and kissed my forehead gently. Then they stood up and walked away from the bed. As I watched them go, I realized that I had been given a gift. A chance to see beyond this world, and to experience something truly special.

And as I lay there, surrounded by peace and love, I knew that nothing would ever be the same again.
