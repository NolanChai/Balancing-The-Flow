. Sometimes they do, but most do not. 

There are no doors or windows here, only an endless blackness that surrounds me. It's suffocating at times, like being trapped in a coffin. I am unable to move or interact with anything around me. 

I remember when the house was first built. It was a magnificent mansion, with grand ballrooms and opulent rooms. The owner was a wealthy man who loved to throw lavish parties. But something went wrong one night. A strange energy took over the house, and everyone inside was consumed by it. 

Now I am all that remains. Just an empty shell of a soul, trapped in this black void for eternity.
