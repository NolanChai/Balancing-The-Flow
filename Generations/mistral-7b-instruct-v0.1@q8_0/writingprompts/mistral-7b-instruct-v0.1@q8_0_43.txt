ell of murmurs rolled through the group, but Father Ricardo raised a hand to silence them. `Let us begin with prayer.'’
 
 The room fell silent as every man knelt and recited the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be. Father Ricardo watched with approval as the men performed their devotions. When they were finished, he rose and addressed the group again. 

 `` Now that our souls are nourished, let us turn our attention to the matter at hand.'’
 
 The room buzzed with anticipation as Father Ricardo stepped forward to reveal the name of the mysterious woman who had been haunting their dreams for weeks. With a flourish, he announced her identity. 

 `` The woman you have been dreaming of is none other than the Blessed Virgin Mary.'’ 

 A wave of shock and disbelief washed over the men as they realized that their dreams were not simply figments of their imagination, but rather messages from God. Father Ricardo went on to explain how Mary had appeared in their dreams as a reminder of their faith and devotion, and urged them to redouble their efforts to serve God. 

 As the men finished their prayers and prepared to leave, one of them turned to Father Ricardo with a question. 

 `` Father,'' he asked quietly. `How do we know that these dreams are not just figments of our imagination?'’ 

 Without hesitation, Father Ricardo replied. 

 `` Because they are accompanied by a sense of peace and serenity, and because they always lead you back to the Our Father, Hail Mary, and Glory Be.'’
