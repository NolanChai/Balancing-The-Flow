ly hair with a hand.
``How?" the girl asked, turning her head towards him.
``The first time we met,'' he said softly, the memory of that day coming back to him in bits and pieces.
``We were both lost in the city," he continued, "and I found you."
 
 The girl smiled at the memory, feeling a lump rise in her throat. 
 ``I remember,'' she murmured.
``What?" the boy asked, his eyes on her.
``How?" she asked.
``The first time we talked," he said.
``We were both nervous. I didn't know what to say, and you seemed to be nervous too. We talked about everything and nothing. It was like we had always known each other."
 
 The girl nodded, feeling a twinge of sadness.
``Yes," she said. "It was like that."
``But that wasn't all," the boy continued, his voice growing serious.
``We also talked about our dreams. You told me you wanted to be a writer, and I told you I wanted to be an artist."
 
 The girl's eyes widened in surprise.
``Really?" she asked. "You always knew that?"
``No," the boy said. "I just felt like it. Something about you... I could tell you were a writer. And something about you... I could tell you were an artist."
 
 The girl sighed, feeling a tear slip down her cheek.
``That's why this is so hard," she said.
``Because we had to let go of our dreams."
 
 The boy nodded.
``Yeah," he said. "But we did it together."
 
 The girl smiled.
``And that's all that matters."
 
 The yellow light from the cafe faded, and the city lights began to twinkle in the night. The girl and the boy stood there for a few more minutes, silently watching the world around them.
``I'll miss you," she said softly.
``I'll miss you too," he said, his voice thick with emotion.
``Let's go," she said finally, wiping away the tears on her cheek.
``Yeah," the boy agreed, and together they turned to leave the city behind.
