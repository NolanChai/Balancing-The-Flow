-member me, even though I couldn't be there with you. 

 I hope you like your new home, and all the toys that you got. It must be a lot of fun for you now. I bet you're running around like crazy, chasing Mommy and Daddy! 

 I really miss you, my little Sammy. You make me so happy just to think about you. I hope to see you soon, and give you big hugs. Until then, be good and take care of yourself. 

 Love always, 
 Mommy
