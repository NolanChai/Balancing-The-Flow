. Despite this, she held on to a large collection of stuffed animals and fluffy blankets in her lair.

Thulgaria's ex-husband Hybolgion was notorious for his violent temper, which often made Thulgaria fearful of him. But now that he had left, Thulgaria felt safe and secure in her own lair, surrounded by fluffy things. She spent most of her days cuddling with the animals or reading books on dragon-keeping.

One day, while she was sitting in her armchair with her stuffed animals, a strange noise caught her attention. It sounded like the fluffiest stuffing in the world was being torn apart.

Thulgaria quickly jumped up from her chair and ran to her lair's window. She looked out into the sky and saw a group of dragons flying towards her lair, all with their fluffy white fur on fire. Thulgaria realized that this must be a group of dragons who were on a mission to steal all the stuffing in her lair for themselves.

Thulgaria immediately jumped into action. She used her fire breath to shoot down the dragons one by one, but they kept coming back with more. Thulgaria knew that she needed help if she was going to stop them. She quickly called on her fellow dragons in the nearby forests and they all flew out to help.

The two groups of dragons clashed in the sky, with the fluff-stealing dragons getting the upper hand at first. Thulgaria knew that this was not good, so she used her powerful tail to sweep down the ground and create a large pile of dirt and rocks that the fluff-stealing dragons could not fly through.

The fluff-stealing dragons quickly realized their mistake and turned back around to try to fly over the pile. But Thulgaria and her fellow dragons were too quick, and they all landed safely on the other side of the pile. The fluff-stealing dragons tried to fly through the pile again but could not make it through.

Thulgaria quickly ran back to her lair and grabbed a large bag filled with fluffy stuffing. She used her fire breath to create a powerful gust of wind that blew the stuffing right at the fluff-stealing dragons, causing them to cough and choke on the stuffing.
