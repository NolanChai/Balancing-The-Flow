Clay sits on the stool and pours out a cup of coffee. He takes a deep breath, watching it steam rise through the air before he drags it into his lungs. The bitterness settles like a weight in his stomach. How could he be so stupid? Couldn't he have just done something normal, like go to school or play with friends instead of being here, alone, now, with this terrible secret. 
 
`` 

He takes another sip of coffee and wipes away the steam from his face. He has to do this. They all need him to do this. The thought of letting them down is almost too much to bear. But he knows they will understand. They've always known. It's just that they didn't know when or if. 
 
`` 

Clay looks at the clock on the wall. It's 7:52 AM. He has about an hour before school starts. He takes a deep breath and sets his cup down on the counter. It's time to start preparing. 

`` 

He begins by grabbing a piece of paper from the drawer. He folds it in half, then folds it again. Then he opens it up and begins to write. He writes quickly, his mind focused on the task at hand. There are only two lines on the page when he finishes, but they are enough. 

`` 

Clay stands up from the stool and walks over to the sink. He takes a deep breath and turns on the faucet. The water rushes out, filling the sink with a steady stream of cold droplets. He pours in a small amount of dish soap, watching it mix with the water until it becomes a cloudy white liquid. 

`` 

He takes the paper from the counter and carefully places it into the soapy water. The paper sinks to the bottom, but he doesn't pull it out. Instead, he stands there, watching as the water rushes over it, dissolving the ink until nothing is left. 

`` 

Clay turns off the faucet and pulls out a clean piece of paper from the drawer. He writes the same two lines again, this time carefully folding the paper in half before placing it back into the sink. The water rushes over it, washing away the ink until only white remains. 

`` 

He repeats this process several more times, each time folding the paper and placing it back into the sink. By the end of it, there is nothing left on the paper but a faint outline of what used to be. 

`` 

Clay pulls out a razor from the drawer and begins to shave off the ink. It's slow going, but he doesn't rush. He takes his time, making sure every last bit of ink is removed. When he's done, there is nothing left on his face or hands. 

`` 

He takes a deep breath and looks at himself in the mirror. The reflection stares back at him with empty eyes, a ghostly white skin. He takes a moment to process this new look before turning to leave for school. 

`` 

Clay opens his backpack and pulls out a notebook. He flips through it until he finds the page with the two lines he wrote earlier. He folds the page in half, then folds it again, and finally places it back into the notebook. 

`` 

He walks out of the kitchen and closes the door behind him. He takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself down before walking to his room and getting dressed for school. 

`` 

As he puts on his shirt and jeans, he tries to imagine what it will be like when the kids at school find out. They'll be shocked, he knows. They'll ask questions. Some of them might even be upset. But they'll get over it. They always do. 

`` 

Clay finishes getting ready and walks down the hall to his room. He pulls open the door and steps inside, closing it behind him. He takes a deep breath and looks at himself in the mirror again. 

`` 

For a moment, he feels like he's looking at someone else. Someone who is nothing like the person he was before. But then he remembers that this is who he is now, and he takes another deep breath. 

`` 

Clay opens his notebook and begins to write. The words flow onto the page, filling it up with ink until it's full. Then he closes the book and sets it aside, taking another deep breath before turning off the lights and going to bed.
