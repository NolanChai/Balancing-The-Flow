adrin had told him to find the stonework inside the building, and he had done so in short order. The only trouble now was getting past the plaster that protected it.
`` I see you found it.'' said Liadrin as she strode into the room with a handful of bolts and a pair of pliers. "Good job."
`` Thanks,'' said Coruscan, wiping sweat from his brow with one hand while he held onto the jackhammer with the other. He was starting to get the hang of it.
`` Let's take this wall down," she said, nodding at the plaster on the wall. "And then we'll find out what's behind it."

She turned and headed toward a nearby staircase, where they had stashed some tools and equipment. Coruscan followed her, feeling more confident with each step. He knew he was doing something important, something that could change the course of history. And he was willing to do whatever it took to get it done.
`` I'm ready to start," said Liadrin as they reached the top of the stairs. "Let's go."
She gestured to a door on the left side of the hall, which had been marked with a red circle and an arrow pointing toward it. Coruscan nodded, feeling a thrill of excitement as he stepped inside and closed the door behind him.

The room was small, with a low ceiling and two windows that let in a little light. But what caught his eye was the wall on the opposite side of the room. There were several large holes in it, each one surrounded by a thick layer of plaster.
`` This is the one," said Liadrin as she approached the wall. "Let's start here."
She handed Coruscan the jackhammer and pointed to the first hole. He took a deep breath, gripped the tool tightly, and swung it at the wall with all his might. The plaster crumbled away, revealing a small opening that led into a narrow tunnel.
`` Go ahead," she said as he handed her the jackhammer. "I'll get the bolts."
Coruscan nodded, taking a deep breath and stepping inside the tunnel. It was dark, damp, and musty, but he could see something glinting at the end of it. As he approached, he realized what it was: a chest, half-buried in the earth.
`` Is that it?" he called out, feeling a rush of excitement as he reached for the handle.
`` I think so," said Liadrin from behind him. "But we need to be careful. There could be traps or dangers lurking inside."
He nodded, gripping the chest tightly and pulling it out of the earth. It was heavy, but he managed to lift it onto his shoulder and carry it back to Liadrin.
`` This is amazing!" she said as she took the chest from him. "You did a great job."
`` Thanks," he said, feeling proud of himself. "I'm glad I could help."
`` Now let's see what's inside," she said, opening the chest and pulling out a small box. Inside was a scroll made of parchment, which seemed to be ancient and fragile.
`` This must be it," she said, unrolling the scroll and examining it closely. "It's a prophecy, written by one of the earliest sages. It says that there will come a time when the world is threatened by darkness, and that a hero will rise to save it."
Coruscan listened as Liadrin read the rest of the prophecy, feeling a growing sense of awe and wonder. It was hard to believe that he was part of something so important, something that had been foretold for millennia.
`` This is incredible," he said as she finished reading. "What do we do now?"
`` We need to find out more about this hero, and what they can do to save the world," said Liadrin. "And we need to do it fast. The darkness is already starting to spread."
Coruscan nodded, feeling a surge of determination as he realized the importance of their mission. He was ready to do whatever it took to help the hero, to make sure that the prophecy came true. And he knew that with Liadrin by his side, there was nothing they couldn't accomplish.
