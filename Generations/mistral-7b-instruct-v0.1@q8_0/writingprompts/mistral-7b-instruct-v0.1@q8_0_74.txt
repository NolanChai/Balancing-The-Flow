on the floor as I headed toward my bed. I had a few hours to kill before my next assignment and I planned on spending it doing something that was not work-related.

 *My phone buzzed with a notification* and I pulled it out from underneath my pillow, glancing at the message without even bothering to read it. 

 *I glanced over at the clock on my bedside table.* It was nearly midnight. *I smiled as I recalled that my next assignment would be a difficult one. My target had been identified as a high-ranking military official who was known for being extremely security conscious, but I had a few tricks up my sleeve to get past his defenses.*

 *My thoughts were interrupted by the sound of someone knocking at my door* and I let out a frustrated sigh. "Who is it?" I shouted as I stood up and walked toward the door, but when I opened it, I was met with a shock. 

 *Standing on the other side of my door was a woman who I had never seen before.* She was tall, slim, and had piercing green eyes that seemed to look straight through me. "I have been sent to bring you to a meeting," she said in a cold voice.

 *I narrowed my eyes and studied her carefully.* There was something about her that felt off, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. "Who are you?" I asked, trying to keep the suspicion out of my voice. 

 *She hesitated for a moment before answering.* "My name is Alexandra," she said in a calm and measured voice. "And I am here to take you to your next assignment."

 *I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized that this was not going to be the easy assignment that I had planned for myself.* I glanced over at my list of targets and sighed. "Fine," I said, trying to keep my voice neutral. "Let's go."

 *Alexandra led me out of my apartment and into a black van that was waiting outside.* I followed her inside and took a seat in the back, glancing around curiously. "Where are we going?" I asked. 

 *She didn't answer.* Instead, she pulled out her phone and began typing on the keyboard. After a few moments, she looked up at me and smiled coldly. "We are heading to Washington D.C.," she said. "Your target is there, and so is your next assignment." 

 *I nodded silently, wondering what kind of obstacles I would face in this new mission.* As the van pulled out of the parking lot and headed down the highway, I couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Something about this job felt different, and I wasn't sure if I was ready for whatever awaited me on the other end.
