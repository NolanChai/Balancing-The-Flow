nish a bottle of wine and my metabolism is screwed for the rest of the week. This is me trying to win her over by convincing myself that I am worthy.
I just started dating again. It has been 3 months since she left. I keep looking at pics of her, scrolling through them, and when I see her I want to scream. So now I keep thinking maybe if I was just a better person then we would be together. Or better dressed. Better in bed. More athletic. But I have already tried all those things and nothing worked.
So now I just try to eat healthy and drink less wine.
