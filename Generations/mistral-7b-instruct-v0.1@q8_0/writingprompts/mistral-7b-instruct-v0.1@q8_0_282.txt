100%, but it’s close enough for a girl. She takes one last look around before heading back into the forest. She can hear the sound of footsteps coming closer and she turns to face them.

She was in her early twenties when she stumbled upon the community. The people had always been friendly, welcoming, and kind. It wasn’t until she met the leader that she realized what was different about this place. He was older than most of the other members, with gray hair and a beard to match. His name was David, but he never introduced himself as such. He seemed like an outsider, but Lucia didn’t mind. She was drawn to him in a way that she couldn’t explain.

David showed her around the community. There were no fences or walls to keep them out. The people went about their daily lives without any fear of harm from outsiders. They worked together, shared meals, and told stories by the fire at night. Lucia felt a sense of belonging that she had never known before.

But as time passed, David’s behavior became more and more distant. He would spend hours alone in his room, staring off into space. He hardly spoke to anyone anymore and when he did, it was always about something unimportant. Lucia tried to talk to him, but he brushed her off or changed the subject.

One day, while out gathering berries, Lucia saw a man standing in the distance. She couldn’t make out who he was, but she could see that he was armed and dangerous. She ran back to the community to warn David. But when she arrived, she found that no one else had noticed him either.

David sat quietly in his room, staring out the window. Lucia tried to get his attention, but he didn’t seem to notice her. Suddenly, he stood up and walked over to the door. He opened it slowly and stepped outside, leaving Lucia behind. She followed him cautiously, trying not to make any noise.

As they approached the stranger, David drew a weapon from his belt. It was a small gun, but it looked like it could do some serious damage. The stranger turned to face them, his eyes narrowed in anger.

“You shouldn’t have come here,” he said, drawing his own weapon.

Lucia watched as the two men faced off, unsure of what to do. She didn’t want to get involved, but she also didn’t want to leave David alone with this danger.

Just as Lucia was about to make her decision, David turned to face her. He pointed his gun at her and pulled the trigger. The sound of the gunshot echoed through the forest, sending shivers down Lucia’s spine. She backed away slowly, unsure of what to say or do next.

David walked back into the community, leaving Lucia behind. She sat down on a nearby rock, staring off into the distance. She didn’t know what was coming next, but she knew one thing for sure. Her life would never be the same again.
