that lie ahead for me and my siblings. 

Dad slumps down in front of the TV, flipping through channels while I make my way to the couch. My siblings are already there, glued to their screens.

As I settle onto the worn cushions, the screen flickers to life. The characters dance across the screen as their voices blare from the speakers, the dialogue completely incomprehensible. 

I can't help but feel like this is my prison cell. Locked away, unable to escape the horrors of everyday life. I yearn for freedom, for a chance to live without fear and without shame. But all I have are these four walls that bind me, and the endless cycle of monotony that has become my life.

The day goes on in the same fashion as every other day. The sun rises and sets, but nothing ever changes. The same questions haunt my thoughts, and the same answers remain elusive. 

As I lay back on the couch, my siblings already asleep beside me, I can't help but wonder what life would be like if only things were different. But until then, all I have is this endless cycle of despair that has become my existence.
