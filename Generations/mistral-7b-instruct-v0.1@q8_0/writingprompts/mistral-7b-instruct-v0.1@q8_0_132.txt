had tried to make me a Christian but all it did was make me question things. I couldn't believe in a god who would let things happen like the Holocaust. They tried to use their authority to make people believe that way, but they failed. People could still have their own beliefs and practice them no matter what anyone else thought.

The problem with most of the people around here was that they didn't really understand that. They had grown up in a world where religion was all there was, where it was the only thing that made sense. That was why they wanted to ban other religions and impose their own on everyone else.

I tried to explain this to them, but they wouldn't listen. They were too afraid of change, of people thinking differently from them. They had grown up with a certain way of thinking and they weren't going to let anyone else challenge it.

But I knew better than that. I had learned how to think for myself, to question things and not just accept what others told me. That was why I had become an atheist, and that was why I wasn't afraid of other religions or other ways of thinking.
