24/7. 
 They never stop. 
 They never slow down. 
 They never speed up. 
 They just keep going. 
 Even when they are broken. 
 Even when they are wrong. 
 They still keep ticking on. 
 But clocks are not the only thing that does such a thing. 
 Life is like a clock. 
 It keeps going. 
 You wake up and go through the motions. 
 You work, you rest, you eat, you sleep. 
 Every day is the same. 
 The world never stops spinning around you. 
 Even when you are dead. 
 Even when your dreams are over. 
 Life just keeps going. 
 And that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it.
