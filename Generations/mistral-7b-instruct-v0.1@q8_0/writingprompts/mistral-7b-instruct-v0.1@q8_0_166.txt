experience a forceful expulsion from the pod and then a brief but intense period of free fall before landing on whatever surface is available. The pod has some kind of hatch that releases a huge amount of air and vacuum, causing the occupants to be lifted up off the floor and flung through the air with great force. It's like being inside an inflatable balloon that suddenly bursts. The interior of the pod is covered in a thick layer of foam which is meant to provide cushioning for the impact when we land on whatever surface there may be. When we reach the end of our fall, the parachute is released and we're pulled back down to the ground at a much slower rate, so you can feel your body being dragged along until it finally comes to a stop. Then the hatch releases more air and the pod suddenly empties, leaving us in the void with no oxygen or anything else to breathe. The parachute then pulls us back down to the surface until we land safely. We can only hope that there is a rescue ship nearby and that they hear our S.O.S. before it's too late.
