ill one day... I got a little restless and jumped out from under the table. Maestro kept looking at me with this evil eye. He ran his finger across his throat, indicating I was going to be gone soon.

I felt so scared, I didn’t know what was happening. Then suddenly it stopped, Maestro dropped the knife and picked up a pen. He wrote something down on a piece of paper. Then he looked at me again with a big smile on his face. “ Now you can finally be free, little rabbit ”.
