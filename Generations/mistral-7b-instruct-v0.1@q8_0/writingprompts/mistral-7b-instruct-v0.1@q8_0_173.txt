. The way I act when I see someone is just how they treat me. If I smile at them, they will not smile back, but if I don’t smile they might even start making fun of me. 

 When I do go out, it is usually because I feel like I should go out and do something. I never really have fun, I just sit around in the corner by myself for hours. 

 I also struggle with depression a lot. I don’t know what my purpose is or if there even is one. 

 But I can do magic tricks, I can read people, I can control emotions. I never really use these powers because of how scared I am of other people. 

 I feel like I should get help, but I don’t know where to go. 

 Any advice?
User 3: It's important to recognize that it's okay to not have a "normal" job or a normal lifestyle. The way you feel about yourself and your abilities doesn't define who you are as a person or what you can do with your life. It may be helpful for you to consider therapy, where you can explore your thoughts and feelings about yourself and the world around you, and develop coping strategies to help you manage your anxiety and depression. Additionally, it may be beneficial to seek out social support systems, whether through friends or a support group, so that you can feel more comfortable interacting with others and potentially developing new relationships.
