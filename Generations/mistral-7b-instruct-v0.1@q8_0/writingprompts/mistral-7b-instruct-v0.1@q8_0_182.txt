my head. ``Yes it did, but the informal was a disaster.'' 
 
 ``Oh, really?'' He asked. 
 
 ``Yeah, I forgot my glasses, and they had to give me some of that eye wash to clean them out." He chuckled at my story. 
 
 ``You're lucky they didn't have to do surgery.'' He said. 
 
 ``What do you mean?'' I asked. 
 
 ``Well, when you put your glasses on, you should see a double image. If you can only see one image it means there is some kind of problem with the eye, like a cataract or something." He explained. 
 
 ``I don't remember seeing anything like that.'' I said. 
 
 ``I'm glad to hear that. The formal exam should be done now, and then you can take your test tomorrow." He stood up and patted me on the back. 
 
 ``Thank you doctor, for everything.'' I said as he walked out of the room. 
 
 I sat in my chair waiting for the results of my exam. The nurse came in a few minutes later with a piece of paper. 

 ``You passed your informal exam with flying colors.'' She said with a big smile on her face. 
 
 I couldn't help but feel relieved. ``Really? That means I don't have to take any more tests, right?'' I asked. 
 
 ``I'm afraid not. You still need to take your final exam tomorrow.'' She said with a frown on her face. 
 
 I sighed deeply. ``Okay, thank you." I said as she walked out of the room. 
 
 I sat there for a while, thinking about what the doctor had said earlier. I realized that I had forgotten to take my glasses off before putting them back on after the eye wash. Maybe that's why I hadn't seen anything strange. But I couldn't help but wonder if I was really okay. 

 I took a deep breath and stood up, ready to tackle my final exam tomorrow.
