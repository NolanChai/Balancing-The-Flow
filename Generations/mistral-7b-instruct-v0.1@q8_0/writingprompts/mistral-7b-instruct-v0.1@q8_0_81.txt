were, each in our own little spot. The horse family was on the left, with their gleaming coats and manes blowing in the breeze, and the donkey stood proudly next to them. It had a little bit of an attitude and was not afraid to show it.

One day I decided that the donkey looked like it could use some friends. So I picked up the sheep and moved it closer to the horse family. The sheep seemed to enjoy its new spot, as if it had always been there. But then the donkey noticed. It stared at the sheep for a few seconds, and then it started whinnying.

My teacher was sitting nearby when this happened. She smiled at me and said, "Looks like you made a mistake."

I laughed nervously and said, "Yeah, I guess I did."

From that day on, the donkey and the sheep became best friends. They played together in the fields all day long, chasing each other around and laughing. And whenever anyone asked me about my favorite animal, I would always say, "The donkey! Because it's not like everyone else."
