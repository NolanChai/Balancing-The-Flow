to breathe properly. I tried to roll over, but something seemed to hold me back.
 My eyes fluttered open and I tried to focus on the room around me. 
 
 I was lying in a small, bare room with white walls. 
 There were no doors or windows to be seen. It didn't take long before I realized that I was bound by chains. 
 
 My head hurt like crazy, and my eyes were watering profusely. 
 I tried to blink my eyes clear, but it didn't work. 
 
 Then I heard a voice call out to me from the darkness beyond the wall of my cell. 
 "You are not alone." The voice sounded warm and friendly, but I couldn't tell where it was coming from. 
 
 I tried to speak back, but all I could manage was a croak. 
 "Who... are you?" My throat hurt too much to speak properly. 
 
 The voice chuckled. "I am the one who saved your life," it said. 
 "I brought you here and gave you the chance to live again." 
 
 I didn't know what to say. I couldn't believe that someone would save my life in such a way. 
 "How did you...?" I asked. 
 
 The voice paused for a moment before answering me. 
 "I will tell you everything," it said, "but first you must promise me one thing." 
 
 I nodded eagerly, unable to resist the opportunity to learn more about my mysterious savior. 
 "What do I have to promise?"
