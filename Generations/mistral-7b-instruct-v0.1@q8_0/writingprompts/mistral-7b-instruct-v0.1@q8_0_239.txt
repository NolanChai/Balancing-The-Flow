lemish and blood. The sight of it brought memories back flooding in; of how he'd fought alongside his friends, their hearts beating as one against their enemies. And how they had won, but at a cost. He had never forgotten that cost. 

 He knelt down beside the lance, taking hold of its hilt and pulling. It was heavy, as if it had been forged by the very gods themselves, and yet he could bear it. With a deep breath, he began to pull, his muscles straining with each movement. He knew it would hurt, but he didn't care. Not now. 

 As he pulled, he felt something tugging at his side. He turned, expecting to find his friend there, ready to fight once again. But instead, he found a young girl, her face filled with terror and desperation. 

 "Please, sir," she begged, her voice trembling. "You must help me." 

 He stopped pulling on the lance and looked at the girl. She was small, barely reaching his waist, and her eyes were wide with fear. He knew what she wanted; he had been there himself once. But would he have the strength to do it again? 

 "What happened?" he asked softly. 

 "They took my family," she said, tears streaming down her face. "I'm the only one left." 

 He nodded, understanding what she meant. He had lost his own family long ago, in a battle against an enemy that had seemed invincible. But he knew better now; he had seen the truth, and he would not rest until he had avenged them. 

 "I'll help you," he said, standing up and taking her hand. "We'll find your family." 

 The girl looked up at him, a glimmer of hope in her eyes. He knew what he had to do. But would it be enough? Would it be enough to save them both? Only time would tell.
