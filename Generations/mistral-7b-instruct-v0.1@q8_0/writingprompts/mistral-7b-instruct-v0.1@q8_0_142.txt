shhhh*

**Oh, you're such a cynical bastard. Why don't you just try to enjoy it while you can? You never know when you'll have another chance at this level of opportunity.** 
 
 *The hell with the opportunity. This is bullshit. I was fine before you showed up.*
 
**You don't need anyone else's approval. You're good enough already. Just be yourself, and everything will work out just fine.** 
 
 *Oh yeah, sure! Be myself! That'll make everything better. Like it ever does.* 
 
**Don't think so hard about this shit. Just relax and let things happen naturally.** 
 
 *I can't just relax. I have responsibilities. Things to do.* 
 
**Well, what are your priorities? Is there anything more important than the people you care about? It sounds like you might need to reevaluate your priorities.** 
 
 *I don't want to think about my priorities right now. I just want things to go back to how they were before you got here.* 
 
**You know what, maybe it's for the best. Maybe this is a sign that you need to let go of some stuff and focus on what really matters in life. If not, you'll end up missing out on something important.** 
 
 *I don't want to miss out on anything.* 
 
**Exactly! And if you let things happen naturally, you might just discover the things you were missing out on without even realizing it.** 
 
 *Fine. I'll give it a shot.*
