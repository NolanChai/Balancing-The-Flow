is the only one allowed to be with them, he has no wife or girlfriend. 

 He has been keeping these children for over a decade now. They are not all the same age and they have different physical appearances. They are all children who were taken from their families against their will. 

 He believes that he is doing them a favor by keeping them safe and protected from harm, but deep down he knows it is wrong to keep them captive. He has a moral dilemma that is eating away at him. 

 His business partner asks him what the children are for. He claims they are used in his experiments for his new line of products, but there is something sinister about his experiments and no one else knows what he is really doing with them. 

 The children are not treated well and they are often beaten or starved. They are kept in small cramped cages with no windows and only a hole in the floor for waste. 

 As time goes by, some of the children begin to resist their captivity and try to escape. He punishes them severely for this and tells them that they will never be free if they disobey him. 

 The business partner is not happy with the situation and begins to pressure him to release the children. He refuses at first, but eventually he gives in and releases some of them. 

 However, as soon as they are released, they all run away from him and he realizes that he cannot trust any of them. He continues to hold on to some of them and punishes those who try to escape again. 

 He becomes increasingly paranoid and obsessed with the idea that someone will come to take the children away from him. He hides them in secret locations and moves around constantly, never staying in one place for too long. 

 In the end, he realizes that he cannot keep these children captive forever and he releases all of them. They all run away from him and he is left alone with nothing but his guilt and moral dilemma.
