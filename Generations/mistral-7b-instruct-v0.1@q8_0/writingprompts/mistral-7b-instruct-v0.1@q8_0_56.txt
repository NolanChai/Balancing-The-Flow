 `` But what if he's doing it to steal your harem?'' I said, looking down at his body.

 He laughed at me. 
 
`` You don't understand, girlie,'' he said. ``I've been here for a long time, and there was no problem with the babes until this new guy came. I never saw him before, but I know his type.''

 ``What is his type?'' I asked. 

 He grinned at me. 
 
`` He's a manwhore," he said, pointing to the green slimy monster that was now crawling away from the door. ``He always tries to steal all the babes. But he can never be as good as us.''

 I looked at the green slimy monster. "I hope so," I said. 

``But that doesn't mean you have to help me," I said, turning back to him.

 He shrugged his shoulders. "What can I do? I don't want to get involved."

``No, no! I meant you have to help me stop him!" I said, getting up from the chair and putting my hands on my hips. 

He laughed at me again. "You think you can stop a manwhore with your puny little hands?" He asked. 

"I'll find a way," I said stubbornly. 

``But what if he kills us?'' he said, gesturing towards the green slimy monster.

"Then we'll die together," I said. 

He sighed deeply. "Fine," he said. ``But you have to promise me one thing."

``What's that?" I asked.

``Don't tell anyone about this," he said. ``I don't want people knowing what we're up to.''

I nodded my head. "Of course not," I said. 

"Alright then," he said, grabbing his sword and walking towards the door. ``Let's go and take care of this manwhore."
