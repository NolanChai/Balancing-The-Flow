I know you weren' t at the party!' she said angrily. 'And what about all those people who saw you there?' 
 I shrugged. ''What are they gonna do? Call the police?" She laughed, but I could tell she wasn' t amused. 
`` It doesn' t matter, Donna.'' I said. ''I have my reasons." 
She sighed. "You know I trust you, Nick. But this is getting out of hand." 
"What do you want me to do?" I asked. 
``Take it down," she said firmly. "We can talk about whatever it is later. Just take it off now." 
I sighed and began typing. I hit the delete button on every file that contained pictures from the party. The files disappeared one by one, but Donna' s anger didn' t dissipate. 
``You better not have anything else," she said as soon as the last picture disappeared. "Because if you do, I' m calling the police." 
I shook my head. "No promises, Donna. You know what you did to me. And it won' t go away that easily." 
She sighed. "Okay, fine. We can talk about it later. But for now, just take it down." 
I nodded and began typing again. This time, I made a mistake. Instead of hitting the delete button, I accidentally hit enter. A new file appeared on the screen. It contained a picture of myself with Maria, the girl Donna had accused me of cheating with. 
Donna gasped when she saw the picture. "What is this?" she asked, her voice shaking. 
I shrugged. "It' s just another picture from the party." 
She shook her head. "No, it' s not." She pointed at the picture. "That' s Maria. And that' s you. And you were kissing her!" 
I sighed. "It was a stupid mistake. I didn' t even realize I hit enter instead of delete." 
She shook her head. "No excuses, Nick. You cheated on me. It doesn' t matter if it was an accident or not. You still cheated." 
``I don' t care about the picture," I said, my voice low. "What I care about is how you treated me afterwards. You accused me of cheating on you and called the police! You tried to ruin my life!" 
She shook her head again. "That' s not true. I didn' t want to ruin your life. I just wanted to make sure you were honest with me." 
``But you did ruin my life," I said bitterly. "You made me out to be a cheater in front of everyone I know! You turned my friends against me!" 
She sighed again. "I' m sorry, Nick. I didn' t mean for it to go that far. But I had to do something. I couldn' t let you keep lying to me." 
``But what about the truth?" I asked. "What about the fact that you accused me of cheating without any proof? What about the fact that you called the police on me?" 
She hung her head. "I know it wasn' t right. But I had to do something. I couldn' t let myself be hurt like that again." 
``But what about me?" I asked, my voice rising. "What about my feelings? What about my reputation? What about my life?" 
She sighed. "I' m sorry, Nick. I didn' t mean for any of this to happen. But I had to do something. I couldn' t let myself be hurt again." 
I shook my head in disbelief. "You still don' t get it, Donna. You can' t just accuse someone of cheating without any proof and expect everything to go back to normal. That' s not how it works!" 
She hung her head. "I know I made a mistake. And I' m sorry for everything that happened." 
I sighed and closed my laptop. "It doesn' t matter now," I said quietly. "We' re done." 
``What does that mean?" she asked, her voice low. 
I looked at her and shook my head. "It means we' re done, Donna. Our relationship is over. You can have your apologies, but that' s all you' re gonna get." 
She stared at me in disbelief. "What are you talking about? We' ve been together for years! We can work this out!" 
``No," I said firmly. "We can' t. You' ve crossed the line too many times. It' s time for us to move on." 
She shook her head in disbelief. "This is crazy. You can' t just walk away from our relationship like this!" 
``I can, and I will," I said coldly. "So go ahead and call the police if you want. But don' t bother calling me again." 
Donna stared at me for a long moment, her face a mixture of shock and disbelief. Then she slowly nodded. "Okay," she whispered. "I guess we' re done then." 
I closed my laptop and stood up. I walked to the door without looking back. Donna didn' t call me again. She never did.
