build and well dressed. He asked for my name. I told him it was Sergey Korovayev. 
 
 He said that he had been tracking me for a while. I thought I should be angry, but I am not. It is strange. I feel like being observed from the inside out. Maybe this is just a feeling. 
 
 I told him I did not know who to talk to in Russia and would be grateful if he could help me find someone who might be able to tell me what's going on with my project. He said that he would look into it. I asked him to keep my name out of it. 
 
 I think about the time I spent with him. There was a strange feeling in the air, like being in another world. It is hard to describe. Maybe this is just a feeling, but it is a different one from usual. 
 
 When he left, I felt like something had ended. I am not sure what it was, but it left me with a sense of loss. 
 
 I sat down and thought about my situation. I have no idea what's going on. I do not know who to talk to. I feel lost, alone and afraid. I do not know how I will find out the truth. 
 
 Maybe it is time to leave this place and go back home. But there is something holding me back. Maybe it is the thought of what might happen if I am caught. I have no idea what they want from me. I just know that I have to keep going. I have to find out who they are and what they want from me. 
 
 I do not know how I will find out the truth, but I will try. I will keep fighting for the truth, no matter what the cost.
