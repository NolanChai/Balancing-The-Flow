rive on this. It fuels me. This is what I want.

I can feel the tension in the air around us, crackling with anticipation. And I am ready. I take a step closer, my breath hot against your face. The smell of adrenaline mixes with yours.

"Please," you beg, your voice barely audible above the sound of our heavy breathing. "Let me go." But I only laugh at your pleas.

"No one ever leaves me," I whisper, my breath hot against your neck. "Not without a fight."
