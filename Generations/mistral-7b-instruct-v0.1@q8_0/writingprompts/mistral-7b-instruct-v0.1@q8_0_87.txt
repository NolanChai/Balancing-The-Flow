g to simply run. I had to sprint. The final stretch loomed ahead of me, stretching out before me like the finish line of an impossible marathon. I pushed my legs harder than ever, straining with every sinew, with every ounce of energy left within me. My lungs screamed for air, my heart for release, but there was none to be found.
 
 The countdown reached zero, and the red numbers vanished. There was only darkness. 
 
 I collapsed to the ground, gasping for breath, my chest heaving as I tried to pull in as much air as I could. My body ached from every inch of it, every muscle strained to its breaking point. But there was no time to rest. No time to even breathe. I had to get up.
 
 With a herculean effort, I forced myself to my feet. My legs felt like they were made of lead, but I refused to let them give way beneath me. I stumbled forward, each step a laborious struggle, my heart pounding in my ears like the drums of war. 
 
 But there was no escape from this nightmare. No end to this torment. As I stumbled onwards, the darkness closed in around me, enveloping me like a shroud. All that remained was the endless void, the eternal abyss that awaited me at the end of this path. 
 
 And with each step, I knew that I would never make it out alive.
