Mary looked up from her sketch pad to find her husband, Paul, holding their daughter, Sarah, on his shoulder. She smiled and took the pencil out of her mouth.

“She’s fine, honey,” Paul said reassuringly. “I think she just wanted a little snuggle.”

Mary nodded, and with a laugh, she stood up and walked to them. Sarah had her eyes closed and her head buried in Paul’s neck.

“There you go, sweetie,” Mary cooed, running her hand over the baby’s hair.

Sarah opened one eye and looked at her mother. She smiled, then closed it again.

Mary watched as Paul carefully lowered Sarah to the ground. She took a deep breath and began to unpack their backpack.

“I think she just needed some attention,” Paul said as he sat down on the log near the waterfall. “She’s always been a bit of a mommy’s girl.”

Mary chuckled. “Yes, well, I think that’s very clear now.”

As they prepared to continue their hike, Sarah suddenly stood up and walked over to the waterfall. She reached out and touched the cool water on the rocks.

“Look at her,” Mary said, impressed. “She seems to be fascinated by the waterfall.”

Paul smiled as he watched his daughter explore. They had been hiking for three hours and had already encountered several small streams and waterfalls. This one was different, though; it was larger and more powerful.

“Maybe we should find a nice spot for a picnic,” Paul suggested.

Mary nodded, and together they spread out their blanket on the rocks near the waterfall. They took out some sandwiches and fruit that they had packed for lunch. As they ate, Sarah continued to watch the waterfall, fascinated by its power.

After lunch, they decided to continue their hike. The trail led them deeper into the forest, past more streams and small waterfalls. Finally, they came to a large clearing, where they found a beautiful meadow filled with wildflowers.

“Wow, this is breathtaking,” Mary said, looking around at the colorful blooms.

Paul nodded in agreement. “I can’t believe we didn’t discover this earlier.”

As they walked through the meadow, Sarah suddenly stopped and looked up at the sky. Mary followed her gaze and saw a flock of birds flying overhead.

“Look at them,” Sarah said, pointing excitedly.

Mary smiled and watched as the birds soared through the air. “They’re beautiful, aren’t they?”

As they continued to explore the meadow, Sarah suddenly ran off in the opposite direction of her parents. Mary and Paul exchanged a worried glance, but before they could react, Sarah came running back, holding a small bird in her hand.

“Daddy, look at what I found!” she exclaimed, showing the bird to her father.

Paul took the bird gently from her hand and looked it over. “It’s a blue jay,” he said. “I think it’s injured.”

Mary nodded in agreement. They carefully picked up the bird and examined it closely. The feathers were ruffled, but there didn’t seem to be any major injuries.

“We should take it back home and see if we can heal its wing,” Mary suggested.

Paul nodded in agreement. They continued their hike with the injured bird carefully tucked away in a pocket of their backpack.

As they walked, Sarah suddenly stopped and looked up at the sky again. This time, she saw a rainbow arching across the sky.

“Look at this, Mama,” she exclaimed, pointing to the rainbow.

Mary smiled as she looked up at the beautiful sight. “That’s wonderful, Sarah.”

They continued their hike, taking in the beauty of the forest and enjoying each other’s company. As they walked, Sarah suddenly stopped again and looked up at the sky.

“Look at this, Daddy,” she exclaimed, pointing to a shooting star that was streaking across the sky.

Paul smiled as he watched the star. “That’s special, Sarah.”

Mary nodded in agreement. They continued their hike, feeling grateful for the beauty of nature and for the wonderful moments they were sharing with their daughter.
