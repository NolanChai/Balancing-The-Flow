shades of orange and pink. 

We talk about everything, nothing, anything at all. Our words weave around each other and for a moment I forget she is someone I know only from this place. She tells me about her family, her work, her hopes, her dreams. It's all so simple, yet so profound.

And then the wind picks up and the rain starts. We huddle together under our jackets, waiting for it to pass. The sound of the waves becomes louder, drowning out everything else. 

We stand there until the sky clears, until the sun comes out again. And then we go our separate ways, each heading back to where they came from. But somehow, I feel like I've gained something more than just a few hours of conversation. I feel like I've connected with her in a way that words cannot describe.

As I walk away, the trail feels longer and lonelier than before. But there's a sense of peace, a calmness that washes over me. And for a moment, everything seems to make sense.
