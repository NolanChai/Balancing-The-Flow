, they'd have to cut me in half!
 
 But hey, I can live with half a billion bucks, right? 
 
 So…what now? Do I retire? Buy a yacht? 
 
 No, no. This is my chance to make amends for everything I've done wrong in my life.
 
 I'm gonna donate it all to charity. Every last penny. 
 
 Yeah, yeah. The look on your face says it all. You can't believe I'm doing this! Well, watch me! 
 
 I'll start with the homeless. I mean, they don't need a yacht or anything fancy like that, right?
 
 Then maybe a hospital. Medical bills can be pretty expensive these days. 
 
 And finally…education. Because knowledge is power and all that jazz. 
 
 Yeah, you know who else needs a little extra help? My ex-wife. She could use some of this money to take care of her kids. 
 
 What? You don't think I'd be so generous as to give her a share too? Fine, fine. Maybe not all of it. But she deserves something.
 
 And hey, maybe I'll even buy myself a little house on the beach just for fun. 
 
 So there you have it. $ 326 million and counting. I hope my charity can make a difference in this world. 
 
 Yeah…I won! I won!''
