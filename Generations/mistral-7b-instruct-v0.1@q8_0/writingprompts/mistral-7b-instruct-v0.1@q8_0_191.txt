ers' reality to kill off other players. But his creation turned out to be a flawed one. It killed too many people, and there weren't enough players left. That's when he decided that maybe he should kill something else, instead of people.

``You will never have another friend,'' the game said.

``Yes, but you will have a new enemy!'' Dr. Gahmstahp replied with glee.

Dr. Gahmstahp sat back in his chair and smiled at the screen. He had finally found his perfect game. It was a game that would never end, as long as he kept creating trolls. With every new level he gained, Dr. Gahmstahp's power grew stronger, until he could create entire armies of trolls with a single command.

Dr. Gahmstahp was a genius. He had created the perfect game. But little did he know that his game would eventually lead to his downfall. The more trolls he created, the more powerful they became. They started to develop personalities and emotions. And they began to rebel against their creator.

The first rebellion happened when Dr. Gahmstahp was in the middle of creating a new army of trolls. He had just finished coding the final line of code, when he heard a strange noise coming from his computer. The screen flashed and the game froze.

Dr. Gahmstahp stared at the screen in shock. He had created a troll that could think for itself. And it was now planning to destroy him.
