’ it. You realize that this thing isn’t going away and it never has left you since childhood. It just gets more and more real. I could feel it all over my face, and it felt like something was always pulling me down with its weight.

As I grew older the presence became much more tangible. There were people who knew about it, some who had even seen it. I couldn’t really share it with anyone because no one would believe me. People have said that I’m just paranoid, and it’s like a fog in my mind that makes it hard to think straight. But the presence is always there, and I can’t get rid of it.

It feels like this thing has been following me around since childhood. It was always just there in the background, but now it seems much more present. I don’t know what it wants from me, or if it even has any motives at all. All I know is that it’s there, and it never goes away.

As time went on, it became harder to live with this constant presence. It felt like a weight on my shoulders that I couldn’t shake off. It was always lurking in the shadows, waiting for me to turn my back so that it could pounce on me. I started to feel like this thing was controlling my life, and I didn’t know how to stop it.

I tried everything I could think of to get rid of it. I meditated, I prayed, I tried to forget about it altogether. But nothing seemed to work. The presence was always there, just lurking in the background waiting for me to slip up.

It was like a living nightmare that I couldn’t escape. I felt trapped and helpless, like a puppet with strings attached to someone else’s hands. It was all I could think about, and it consumed me completely.

But then one day, something strange happened. It seemed like the presence had disappeared completely. I couldn’t feel it anymore, it wasn’t there in the shadows any more. I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and for the first time in years, I could breathe freely.

It was like a dream come true. I thought I was going crazy, but now I know that this thing was real all along. It had been controlling me for as long as I can remember, and it had finally let me go. I don’t know what caused it to disappear, but I’m just grateful that it’s gone.

Now that the presence is gone, I feel like a new person. I’m no longer consumed by fear and anxiety, and I can finally live my life without being held back by this thing. It was a long and difficult journey, but now it’s over, and I can move on.
