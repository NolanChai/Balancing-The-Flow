arcasm) and said "I'm getting married next month, and I want to see the big man". 

 So, being the asshole I am I asked him why he thought this was a good idea. He replied with "He knows about me and my situation, you don't". 

 I proceeded to ask him what the fuck situation is.. All he said was "Don't worry about it, you don't need to know." 

 And then he turned around and walked away. 

 The only thing I know is that he has been with this girl for about five years and they were always very secretive about their relationship. I thought there was something up with her but never really thought much of it. 

 He told me a few weeks ago that she had a boyfriend, but then again I think he said that last week too. So who the fuck knows? 

 Anyways, this is pretty much all we know so far. What are your thoughts on all of this?
User 3: I'm not sure about him being married.  I think he has been telling you something about his past and is trying to keep it from getting out.  But if he really does want to see the big man then there must be something that he wants.  

What was your role in all of this?  Did he ask you to help him with anything, or do you have any other information that would be helpful?  Are they going to get married where you work?
