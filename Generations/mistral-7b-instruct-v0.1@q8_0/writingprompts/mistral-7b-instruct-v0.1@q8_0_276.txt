arkened back to the days when manned space vessels were a common sight in the fleet. Captain Sinclair sat resolute, his hands locked on his command chair. He had been the captain of one such vessel, but it had been years since he took command of his last vessel. He had been appointed head of Starfleet's Special Operations branch. 
 
 His first mission was to hunt down a rogue starship that had stolen a large cache of advanced weaponry. Captain Sinclair had assembled a crack team of specialists for the task. They included Lt. Worf, a Klingon warrior, Lt. Commander Data, an android, and Ensign Geordi La Forge, a blind engineer. 
 
 The mission was successful, but it left scars on Sinclair that would never heal. His team had been ambushed by the enemy starship's crew while they were en route to their destination. Worf had been killed in action, and Data had been badly injured. 
 
 It was only through sheer luck that Sinclair and Geordi managed to escape with their lives. But ever since then, Sinclair had been haunted by the memory of his lost teammates. He had dedicated himself to ensuring that no one ever suffered the same fate as Worf or Data again. 
 
 As the starship approached the port, Sinclair took a deep breath. His heart raced with anticipation and anxiety. It was time for him to face the ghosts of his past.
