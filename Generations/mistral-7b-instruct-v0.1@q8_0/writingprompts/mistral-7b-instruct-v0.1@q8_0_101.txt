eded their power to an outsider.

"You don't understand," Kishua told his father, "Samurai are not meant for peace."

"I know this," the village elder said, "But your master was wise enough to use his position as a diplomat, and in doing so he allowed our village to remain peaceful."

"If I had been born into that time, perhaps I could have helped us keep our village from being taken," Kishua said.

The Elder looked at him sternly, "You can't change the past, my son. You must focus on your future."

But as his father spoke, Kishua could only think about how he would have fought to keep his people safe. How he would have defended them with his sword and his wits against anyone who wanted to take their freedom away from them.

He had always been a fighter. He had learned the art of swordplay from his father, and he had honed his skills under the tutelage of his master. But now that the danger was real, he found himself questioning whether he was truly ready for the task ahead.

The village was surrounded by enemy troops, their swords at the ready to strike at any moment. The elder's words echoed in Kishua's head, "You must focus on your future." But how could he do that when the very thing he had dreamed of all his life was being taken away from him?

As the enemy approached, Kishua steeled himself for battle. He knew that there was no turning back now, and that his people's lives were in his hands. He took a deep breath, drawing on all the strength and skill he had been taught throughout his life. And as the first blow struck, he swung his sword with all his might.
