The only thing I can tell is my body seems to be reacting normally, it’s just me who feels like I am floating. I feel a bit like a ghost in a haunted house, no one can see me and I have no way of interacting with them, except by bumping into walls or falling down the stairs.

I’ve been feeling like this for most of the week now. My mind is just empty, I feel like I am trapped inside a box made of glass. It’s clear, so I can see everything around me but I can’t touch anything, I can’t even feel my own body.

I don’t know what to do, I don’t know how long this will last. All I know is that I am scared and alone. I wish there was someone who could understand what I am going through. Maybe then I wouldn’t feel so lost, so isolated in my own mind.

But for now all I can do is wait, hope and pray that this feeling goes away soon. That it ends before I lose my sanity, before it takes over my life completely.
