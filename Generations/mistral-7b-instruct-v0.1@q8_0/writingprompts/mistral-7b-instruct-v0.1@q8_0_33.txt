as I reached the safety of my doorstep. My keyhole was frozen. I had forgotten to keep the front door open for my roommate. It was one of those nights that I wished I lived alone. I didn’t like the feeling of being watched.

My fingers were numb from the cold but the chill in my heart was something else. The sound of footsteps behind me made my heart jump and I spun around in a circle, trying to find where they were coming from. There was no one there. 

I turned on the lights and looked around my apartment. Everything seemed normal, nothing out of place. But I could n't shake off this feeling of dread that had settled itself in my chest. I walked to the window and pulled back the curtains to look outside. It was dark and empty, no signs of life anywhere.

I decided to lock myself inside and wait for my roommate to come home. But as I turned to go back to my room, something caught my eye. A shadowy figure standing in the corner of my living room, watching me with cold, dead eyes. I screamed and ran towards it but as I got closer, the figure disappeared into thin air.

I didn’t know what was happening to me, all I knew was that I couldn’t leave my apartment. I sat on the couch, staring at the empty corner where the shadowy figure had been. I felt like someone was watching me, like someone was following me. It was then that I heard it, a faint whisper in the darkness. 

“Leave this place or suffer the consequences.”

The voice was cold and emotionless, like a machine speaking. I tried to make sense of it but all I could hear was the sound of my own heart pounding in my ears. I didn’t know what to do, all I knew was that I couldn’t stay here any longer. 

I got up and walked towards the door, turning the handle slowly as I stepped outside into the cold night. The street was empty, there were no signs of life anywhere. I started walking faster, my feet pounding against the pavement as I moved away from my apartment. 

As I reached the safety of a nearby alley, I stopped and looked back at my old apartment. It was dark and silent, like nothing was happening inside. But I knew better than to underestimate the power of this place. This was a place that had haunted me since I first moved in and I couldn’t shake it off no matter how hard I tried. 

I continued walking until I reached my roommate’s apartment, knocking on the door with urgency as I waited for her to open it. When she finally did, I burst inside, telling her everything that had happened. She listened in silence, her expression serious as she took it all in. 

“We need to get you out of there,” she said finally, her voice firm. “You can’t stay there any longer.”

I nodded, relieved to have someone who believed me. Together we made our way back to my old apartment, armed with torches and determination. As we approached the front door, I could feel the weight of the darkness pressing down on me. But this time, I was ready. 

With a deep breath, I turned the handle and pulled open the door, shining the torchlight inside. The room was dark and empty, just like I had left it. But as we stepped inside, I felt a presence in the air, something that made my heart skip a beat. 

I followed my roommate’s lead as she moved deeper into the apartment, her torchlight bouncing off the walls. Suddenly, I heard a sound, a soft whisper in the darkness. 

“Leave this place now or suffer the consequences.”

My roommate and I looked at each other, both of us frozen in fear. But then, she stepped forward and shone her torchlight in the direction of the voice. And that’s when we saw it, a shadowy figure standing in the corner of the room, watching us with cold, dead eyes. 

We backed away slowly, our hearts pounding in our chests. We knew what we had to do. Together, we made our way back out of my old apartment and into the safety of the night. And as we walked down the dark street, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was the end of my nightmare, or just the beginning.
