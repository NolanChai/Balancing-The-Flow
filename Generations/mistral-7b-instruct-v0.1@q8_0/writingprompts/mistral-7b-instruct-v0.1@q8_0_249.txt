a flip phone.

I didn't know what to say, or do for that matter. My mind was spinning faster than the new gadgets in their hands.

Then it dawned on me: I had been given the chance to share my story with them. To tell them about life and love. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that stories have power. They can change lives, open minds, and heal wounds.

So, I began.

I told them about my first love, how we met under the stars on a cold winter night. How her laughter echoed through the snowy forest like music, and her eyes shone brighter than any moonlight. 

I shared with them the joy of holding hands, the warmth of her breath against my cheek as she whispered sweet nothings into my ear. The thrill of discovering new things together, from first kisses to travel adventures across the world.

But I also told them about heartbreak. About how love isn't always perfect, and sometimes it falls apart. How bitter tears taste when the one you love walks away, leaving behind only shattered dreams and an ache that refuses to fade.

As I spoke, something strange happened. The room fell silent. Everyone listened. Their devices were forgotten; they were just human beings now, connected not by technology but by empathy.

When I finished, there was applause. Not the clapping you'd expect after a stage performance or a motivational speech. It was quiet, gentle, filled with respect and understanding. 

In that moment, I realized that no matter how advanced our world gets, at its core, we are still storytellers. We find meaning in narratives, connect through shared experiences, and heal wounds through the power of words.

And as long as there are stories to tell, there will always be a place for us in this world.
