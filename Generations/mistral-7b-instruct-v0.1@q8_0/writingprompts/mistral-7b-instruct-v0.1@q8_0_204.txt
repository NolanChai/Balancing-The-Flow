trying to buy some milk and eggs and this man is staring at me like I'm an alien. I don't know what to say but he starts asking me questions about the accident. Apparently my memory is so bad that I can't even remember what happened. I feel so embarrassed, I just want to leave and forget it ever happened. Is there anything I can do?
User 0: You should ask for a copy of the police report regarding your accident from the store. The report will include all the details of the accident. You may also want to consider consulting with an attorney who specializes in personal injury cases. They may be able to help you determine if the store is liable and if so, what damages are appropriate for your injury.
User 1: I would recommend a medical professional as well. If you have memory loss, it could be related to the accident, or even post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A doctor can assess your condition and offer recommendations on how to manage it.
