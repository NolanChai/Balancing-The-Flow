4267. The stars shone brightly through my tiny spacecraft, but one star stood out. It was home. Earth, a blue dot in a vast cosmic ocean.

I was an astronaut, but I wasn't here to explore new worlds or study alien life forms. I was an artist, sent into the cosmos to document the beauty of the universe for all to see. I had been out there for months, traveling across galaxies, capturing stunning images of nebulae and black holes, celestial bodies that few people would ever get to witness in person.

It was my job, but it was also a passion. As I looked at the stars, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the opportunity to do what I loved. I had been lucky enough to be chosen for this mission, and now, as I faced the possibility of death, I realized how truly fortunate I was.

I closed my eyes, taking a deep breath. It was time to face the end. But before I did, I wanted to capture one last image. One final glimpse of the beauty that had captivated me for so long. With a steady hand and a determined eye, I pressed the button.

As the shutter clicked, a brilliant flash filled my viewfinder. And then, just as suddenly as it had started, everything went dark.
