I am interested in learning more about your studies. Have you found any particularly interesting or challenging subjects so far?

" Yes, actually. During my summer break last year, I interned at a marketing firm for two months. It was a great learning experience and helped me develop my professional skills."

" In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer with friends and reading books about different industries. How about you? What are your interests?"
