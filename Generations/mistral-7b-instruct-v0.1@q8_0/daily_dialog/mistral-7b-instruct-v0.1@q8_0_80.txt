" Great, a casual theme is perfect for an office party. What kind of cuisine do you think would work best? We have Italian, Mexican, and Chinese options available."

Great! Let's see, we'll need to order enough dumplings, wontons, and egg rolls for everyone, and don't forget the orange chicken. We might also want some appetizers like spring rolls or hot and sour soup. For the main dishes, we could consider ordering Kung Pao Chicken, General Tso's Chicken, or beef and broccoli. And of course, we can't forget about dessert! How about some fried bananas or fortune cookies?

Great, let's start planning the details. How many people will be attending the party? We'll need to make sure to order enough food and drinks accordingly. Would you like me to look up some Chinese restaurants nearby?
