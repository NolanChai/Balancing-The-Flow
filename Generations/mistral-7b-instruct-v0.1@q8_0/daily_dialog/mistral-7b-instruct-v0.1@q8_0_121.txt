"I typically write about technology and its impact on society. I'm particularly interested in emerging technologies like AI and blockchain, and how they might transform various industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation."

"I usually publish posts once or twice a week, depending on my schedule. Sometimes, if I have a lot of free time, I'll write and publish multiple posts in one day."

Yes, I still update my blog regularly. In fact, I just posted an entry about my recent trip to a new city in the US. It's always fun to share my experiences and connect with others who are interested in similar things.
