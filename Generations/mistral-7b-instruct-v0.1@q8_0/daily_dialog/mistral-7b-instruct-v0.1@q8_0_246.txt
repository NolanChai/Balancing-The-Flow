I apologize for misunderstanding. It sounds like you are looking to restock on personal care products. Have you considered asking the front desk if they can provide additional supplies or directing you to a nearby store that sells such items?

" I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any information on how to purchase souvenirs."

"Okay, I see. Would you like me to look up information on nearby stores or markets that sell souvenirs?"

I'm sorry to disappoint, sir. We do offer some free amenities like toothpaste and dental floss, but they are not in stock right now. However, I suggest you visit our souvenir shop for a variety of items at a discounted rate. Our gift cards could be used to purchase souvenirs as well.
