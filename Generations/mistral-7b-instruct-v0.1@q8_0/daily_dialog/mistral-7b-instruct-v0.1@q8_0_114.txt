" That's a great idea, George! But what about food and entertainment? How will we manage that?"

"Yeah, you're right! It would be so nice to take a break and relax. Let's start planning our trip now."

"Let's start planning now, Lili! We can pack a few essential items and head out early in the morning. And don't worry about the expenses too much, we can manage them along the way. Plus, it'll be good to get away from technology and enjoy nature."

"Okay, George, let's plan it out. We can leave tomorrow morning and start our journey towards the beach. There are plenty of campsites there where we can sleep in the van. We can also pack some snacks and have a picnic lunch on the way."
