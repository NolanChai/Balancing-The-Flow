"Yes, I do! I'm actually an experienced vocalist and I would love to join your band. Would you like me to come for a trial audition?"

Great! We'd love for you to audition for the singer position in our rock band. Let me know what time works best for you on Saturday or Sunday and we'll arrange everything. Can you bring any recordings of yourself singing that I can listen to beforehand?
