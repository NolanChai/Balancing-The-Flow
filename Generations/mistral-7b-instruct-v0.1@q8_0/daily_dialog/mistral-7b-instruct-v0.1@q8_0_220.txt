I understand your concern about the crowds on Saturday. Going shopping the day after tomorrow would give you an extra day to unwind before the weekend shopping madness starts. It sounds like we can make a plan that works for you. Do you have any specific stores or items in mind that you'd like to look for?

"Sounds good! I'll make a list of items for you at the clothing store. And I'll remind you to stop by the butcher's on our way back."
