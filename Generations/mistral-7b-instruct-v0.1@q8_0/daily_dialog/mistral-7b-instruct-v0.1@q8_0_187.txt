"Thank you for bringing that to my attention. Let me take a closer look and see if there is any room for negotiation on our part. Would you be open to discussing a lower price or perhaps adjusting the quantity of items included in each box?"

Thank you for taking the time to explain your offer. Based on what you've told us, we believe it would be best to accept the offer of 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box at 20,000 yuan. We appreciate your dedication to providing high-quality ornaments and are willing to work with you to ensure timely shipment in June.

"We value your patronage and understand your budget constraints. However, we cannot make such a reduction without compromising our quality standards. We suggest you consider ordering smaller quantities at our current prices or exploring our other product lines that may fit within your budget."
