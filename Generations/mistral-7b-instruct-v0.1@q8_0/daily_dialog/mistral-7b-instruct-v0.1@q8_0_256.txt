"I know it's hard to accept that your relationship is not what you thought it was, but it's important to give him space and time to figure things out. Maybe he needs some time alone or to work through his own issues before he can come back to you."

"I know it's hard, but try to focus on the good things about your relationship. You two have had some great moments together, right? Maybe give him a chance to explain himself before jumping to conclusions."

"Come on now, let me help you with that. First, take a deep breath and try to calm down. Then, pick up your phone and send him a text. Be honest about how you're feeling and ask if he's okay. Maybe there's something going on in his life that's causing him to ignore your calls."
