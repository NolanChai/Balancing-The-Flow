"That sounds delicious! Let's go with the samosas. And for drinks, do you want to try a glass of red wine or a beer?"

"I was thinking about trying their signature dish, the chicken tikka masala. Have you heard anything good about it?"

"A dahl is a spicy lentil soup," I can provide more information if needed.

" Sure, let's add an order of chicken tikka masala and some naan bread. How about we also try the mango lassi for drinks?"

"What kind of wine would you prefer?"

The server approaches and we order our food. As we wait for it to arrive, we chat about our plans for the rest of the evening and how much we're looking forward to trying out this new restaurant. We also exchange some stories from our recent travels and share a laugh together. The food arrives and we eagerly dig in, savoring every bite of the delicious samosas, dhal, lamb kebabs, and beer. We raise our glasses in a toast to good luck and good company before continuing to enjoy our meal.

"Haha, glad to be of help. Let's just sit back and relax while we wait for our food. Do you have any plans after dinner?"
