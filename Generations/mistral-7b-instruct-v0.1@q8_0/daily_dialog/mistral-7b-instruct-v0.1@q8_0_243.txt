"Alright, let's start with your cough. Can you describe how long it has been going on and what type of phlegm, if any, you are producing? Also, have you recently traveled anywhere or been exposed to anyone who has been sick?"

Thank you for coming in today, young man. Based on your symptoms, it's likely that you have a viral infection such as the common cold or flu. The good news is that these illnesses are usually treatable with rest, hydration, and over-the-counter medication if necessary. I recommend staying home from work or school until your symptoms subside to avoid spreading the virus to others. If your condition worsens or you experience any difficulty breathing, please come back in for further evaluation.

" I understand. Thank you for taking care of me, Doctor."
