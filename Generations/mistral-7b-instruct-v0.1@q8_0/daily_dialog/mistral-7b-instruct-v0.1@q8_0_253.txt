"Yes, I do sell my calligraphy pieces. The couplet you mentioned is a common one and often used as a greeting during special occasions. It brings good wishes for health, prosperity, and happiness. Do you have any specific requests or preferences for the couplet?

" Well, I keep most of my pieces with me and occasionally gift them to special friends or family members. I believe that art should be shared and appreciated, not just for financial gain. What about you, how do you spend your time outside of work?"
