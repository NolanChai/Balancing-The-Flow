" You made a few mistakes, but overall it wasn't too bad. You just need to work on your turning signals and paying more attention to traffic."

"I'm sorry, but you made several mistakes during the test, including failing to follow traffic laws and not demonstrating proper control of the vehicle."

" The main reason was that you made several mistakes while driving, such as running red lights and failing to follow proper road signs. Additionally, you had trouble controlling the car on some of the curves and straightaways. Overall, your performance was not up to the standards required to pass the test."
