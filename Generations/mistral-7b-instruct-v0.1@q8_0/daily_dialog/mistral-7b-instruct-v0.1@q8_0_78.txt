"Actually, my parents were very happy that we had a registry office ceremony and had their own party with their friends back home. They understood the importance of having our loved ones from both sides be present for this special occasion."

"Yes, actually we were able to make arrangements for everyone to meet each other during our three celebrations. We had a small dinner party in my hometown, a beach wedding in his home country, and then a big reception in the city where we currently live."

"Yes, after our second party, we went to a romantic beach destination in my husband's homeland for our honeymoon. It was a wonderful opportunity to spend quality time together and bond over our shared experiences."

"Well, it's true that weddings can vary widely depending on culture and personal preferences. We wanted to have something unique and meaningful for us. It was important for both of our families to be able to join in on the celebrations and share in this special day with us."
