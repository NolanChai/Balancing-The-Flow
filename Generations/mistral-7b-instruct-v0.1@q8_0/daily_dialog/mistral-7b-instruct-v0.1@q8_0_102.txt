There are responsibilities and duties to attend to, bills to pay, and a family to take care of. It seems like there is always something that needs my attention. Is there any way to manage this stress without sacrificing my work or personal life?

"Yes, that's right. Losing weight can help lower your blood pressure and reduce the strain on your heart. Have you considered trying a healthy diet and regular exercise? It may seem challenging at first, but with time and consistency, you'll start feeling better."
