I'm sorry, but we don't sell stamps here. You'll need to go to a nearby post office for that. Is there anything else you need help with?

"Here are your 30 stamps. Thank you! Do you need anything else?"

It may take longer if they have to go through customs. Is there anything else I can help you with?

"I understand. In that case, 30 stamps for Europe will be €5.00. Would you like to purchase them?"

"You can buy the bubble wrap over here, but it’s in stock."
