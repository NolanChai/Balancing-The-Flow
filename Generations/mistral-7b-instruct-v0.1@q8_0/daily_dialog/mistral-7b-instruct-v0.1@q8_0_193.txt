You may want to consider reaching out to rental platforms online, such as Craigslist or Zillow, to search for available apartments and homes in your desired location. You can also try contacting real estate agencies or property management companies to ask about any vacancies they may have. Additionally, you might consider asking friends or coworkers if they know of any places that are available for rent.

"Okay, that shouldn't be too difficult to find. I'll let you know if I come across anything that fits your budget."

I can definitely help you with that. Let's start by searching for apartments and rooms available near your current location, within your budget of 1,000 yuan per month. We can also look for options in neighborhoods with easy access to public transportation, such as the subway or bus routes. Is there a specific part of town you prefer?

" That's not too difficult. I'll check with my friends and family in the area to see if they know of any available apartments that meet your requirements. In the meantime, you might want to consider reaching out to real estate agents or searching online for listings specifically for sublets. Good luck with your search!"

" Yeah, that's correct. Many students often post their sublet listings on these boards as they move to new cities or apartments for the summer. It's worth checking them out for any available rooms or apartments."

"Also, have you considered staying with friends or family for a short time while you search for a new place? It might help ease the transition."
