"I'd like to clarify that your salary will be based on the performance during the internship, which will also be evaluated after three months. Do you have any questions about this?"

" Great! It sounds like a fantastic opportunity. I'm excited to work with you and learn more about the position."

"I have a few questions before we proceed with the contract. Can you clarify if there are any specific responsibilities during the internship period? Also, is there a non-compete clause included in the contract?"

" No, that covers everything. I am ready to sign now."

The training is designed to familiarize you with the company's policies and procedures, as well as your role and responsibilities. It will include an orientation session, as well as hands-on training in your specific area of work. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to meet and interact with colleagues and supervisors during the training period.

Jack: Thank you for clarifying. It sounds like a great opportunity, and I am happy to proceed with signing the contract.
