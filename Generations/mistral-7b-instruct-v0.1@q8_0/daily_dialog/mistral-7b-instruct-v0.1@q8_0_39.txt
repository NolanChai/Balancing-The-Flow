" Thank you, Judy. I have made the necessary changes to your reservation for Trans Pacific Flight 8 on August 2 from Taipei to Minneapolis instead of July 19. Is there anything else I can assist you with? "

" I see, thank you for letting me know. To proceed with the change, can you confirm your booking reference number and any additional details such as seat preferences or meal requirements?"
