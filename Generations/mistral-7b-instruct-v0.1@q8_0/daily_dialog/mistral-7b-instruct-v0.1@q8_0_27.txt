"Good morning, doctor. Can you help me with my headache?"

"I see. Have you been coughing up any sputum? It would be helpful to take a sample and test it for the presence of viruses."

The doctor will likely prescribe medication to alleviate symptoms and advise the patient to rest and stay hydrated. It's important for the patient to follow the doctor's instructions and seek medical attention if symptoms worsen or persist beyond a certain period of time.
