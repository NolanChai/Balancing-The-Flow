"I would say my supervisor did not give me clear feedback, which made it difficult to understand my strengths and areas for improvement. They also didn't seem to appreciate my ideas and contributions, which made me feel undervalued and unappreciated."

"I like to break down big projects into smaller, more manageable tasks. It helps me to stay focused and organized. Then, I create a detailed schedule with deadlines for each task. This way, I can track my progress and make any necessary adjustments along the way."

" I recently had to lead a team on a major project with a strict deadline. We were behind schedule and there were many obstacles along the way, such as unexpected delays and issues with stakeholders. It was very challenging, but we were able to work together as a team and find creative solutions to each problem that came up. In the end, we were able to finish the project on time and within budget. It was an intense experience, but it taught me the importance of effective communication and collaboration under pressure."

" I try to prioritize my tasks based on their importance and urgency, making sure to allocate the appropriate amount of time for each. I also like to schedule in breaks throughout the day to recharge my mental energy and avoid burnout. Additionally, I make use of tools and applications that help me stay organized and manage my time effectively, such as calendars and project management software."

" I remember a colleague suggested a new way to approach a project we were working on. Initially, I was hesitant, but after considering their idea and discussing it with my team, we decided to give it a try. The results were fantastic; we completed the project ahead of schedule and with better outcomes than our previous attempts. This experience taught me the importance of being open-minded and willing to consider new ideas, even if they come from unexpected sources."
