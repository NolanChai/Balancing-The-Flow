"Thanks for clarifying, Carl. I was actually planning on taking the D bus instead and getting off at the first stop in Chinatown. Would that be okay?"

"I see, I must have misunderstood. Shall we meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue D bus? The last stop is at Eldridge Street."

" No, Ann will not be able to make it as she has an important work commitment."

"Okay, sounds good. If anything changes, let me know."
