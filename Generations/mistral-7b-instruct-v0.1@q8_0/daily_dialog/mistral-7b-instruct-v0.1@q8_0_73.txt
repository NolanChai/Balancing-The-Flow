"Wow, sorry to hear about Lisa. Well, if you're looking for a new place to meet people, have you tried going out to any events or social gatherings in the city? It might be a good opportunity to make new connections and potentially find someone who shares your interests."

"Thanks, buddy. What kind of drinks do you want to order?"

"Hi there, what's your name?"

"Wait, what? Why are you leaving?"

"Because I don't like the way she looks at me."

"She can be a bit intense sometimes. But I think you could still give her a chance. She's worth it, trust me."

"Oh man, I didn't realize you had feelings for her," said Kenny.

"Yeah, we had some good times together," replied the woman.

Kenny sighed and looked down at his drink. "Well, I guess this is a bust then. Let me grab my stuff and get outta here."

The woman stood up to leave as well. "No, wait," she said, stopping Kenny before he could walk away. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. Maybe we should talk more about what happened with Lisa and see if there's a chance for us to work things out."
