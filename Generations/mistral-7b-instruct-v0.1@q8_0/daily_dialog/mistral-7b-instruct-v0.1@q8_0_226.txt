"I understand, honey. It can be difficult to navigate these types of behaviors in young children. Have you tried talking to your son about how his words hurt his mommy's feelings? Maybe you could also try finding ways to redirect his negative emotions into positive ones. For example, instead of saying 'kick mommy,' maybe he could say 'I don't like it when my mom does this.' It could be a small step, but it might make a difference in the long run."

I understand that it can be challenging, but it's important to remember that children develop at their own pace and may not always understand the impact of their words. It's also important to communicate with your son and explain why certain words are hurtful and inappropriate. Additionally, you could try setting boundaries and consequences for his behavior to help him learn what is acceptable.
