"I understand, Mrs. Williams. Thank you for your guidance on Jimmy's recovery. I will make sure to remind him of these instructions when he wakes up. If he has any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out."

" I see , thank you for letting me know. Is there anything else I can do for Jimmy, doctor?"

"I’m sorry, Dr. I don’t know where he is,” Mrs. Williams replied.

“That’s okay, Mrs. Williams. Just make sure to follow my instructions and monitor Jimmy closely. If his condition worsens at all, please let me know immediately. He will need to stay in bed for another two days, so it’s important that he rest and recover properly.”
