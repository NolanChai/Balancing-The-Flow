"I apologize for the inconvenience, but he has not provided us with his email or phone number while he is away on business. However, you may try reaching out to his assistant, Jane Doe, who can provide further information and assistance in locating him."

" Certainly, here's his email address: [tom.smith@companyname.com](mailto:tom.smith@companyname.com). But keep in mind that he may not be checking it frequently while he's away on business. If you need urgent assistance, I suggest trying to reach out to him through other means such as texting or emailing his colleagues."

"That I'm not certain, but I would assume that since he is away on a business trip, he might be checking his email less frequently. However, it's always best to try and reach out through multiple channels if you need to get in touch with him."

Thank you for providing Tom's contact information. I'll make sure to send him a message through email or call him back when he returns.
