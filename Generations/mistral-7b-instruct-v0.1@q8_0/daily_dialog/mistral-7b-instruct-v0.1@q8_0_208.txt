The clerk hands you three pairs of skates in the sizes you requested, along with three crash helmets. You thank the clerk for their help and head out to enjoy your morning on the ice.

Next, teach them how to fall safely if they do. Always hold on to an adult while skating for the first time. Make sure they wear their helmets properly and adjust them regularly. Finally, keep an eye on them and make sure they're not skating too fast or too close to other skaters. With these precautions in place, you can be sure they have a fun and safe skating experience."

I agree, starting slowly is important. Also, it's essential for them to know how to hold onto their skates properly and how to fall safely if they do tumble. Additionally, make sure they wear appropriate clothing, such as warm layers and gloves, to protect themselves from the cold and potential scrapes. And, don't forget to supervise them while they skate and provide guidance and encouragement as needed.

" Thanks for the advice. I'll make sure they understand and stay safe while having fun."
