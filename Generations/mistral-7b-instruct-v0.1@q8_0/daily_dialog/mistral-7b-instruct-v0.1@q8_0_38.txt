" No worries, let me walk you through it. First, insert a quarter into the washing machine and press the start button. For the dryer, insert four quarters and press the start button. If you still have trouble, let me know and we can try another approach."

" You can place the change in the coin slot at the top of the machine or in the designated change receptacle. Just make sure to insert it correctly so that the machine can detect and process the payment."

" Yes, that's it! Just make sure to add the right amount of laundry detergent for the type of clothes you are washing, and the washer will take care of the rest. If you need any more help or have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!"

Great job using the washer and dryer! Do you need help with anything else?
