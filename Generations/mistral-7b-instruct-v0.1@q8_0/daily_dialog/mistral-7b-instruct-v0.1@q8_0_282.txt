"Thank you, I'd like to purchase â‚¬500 at the current exchange rate. Can you give me my change?"

"We can certainly do that. We'll give you Euro banknotes in denominations of 10, 20, and 50. How many banknotes would you like?"

" Of course, please fill in the form with your name and contact information. Thank you for choosing our service."

" I see, would you like me to help you with that? And how much would you like to exchange in Swiss francs?"

The agent then proceeded with exchanging the Swiss francs for the dollars. They explained to her that the rate of exchange would be listed on the electronica screen, which she had already seen. The agent also informed her that the exchange form required her name and telephone number. Once she signed the form, the agent exchanged 20,000 RIB for Euros at a convenient denomination that could be easily used in daily life. However, due to low demand, the agency was not authorized to exchange coins and instead suggested she change 2,000 $ into Swiss francs. The agent apologized for any inconvenience and gave her the memo with the exchange rate information to keep for future reference.
