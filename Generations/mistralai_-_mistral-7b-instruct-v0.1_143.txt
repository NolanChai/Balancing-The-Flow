 Yes, you are correct. The discovery of extremophile organisms such as the "Blow lake worms" or "Tube worms," which can survive in hydrothermal vents and support life in extreme conditions, has been hailed by some scientists as a potential model for extraterrestrial life on other planets. These creatures are able to survive in environments that would be toxic to most known organisms.
