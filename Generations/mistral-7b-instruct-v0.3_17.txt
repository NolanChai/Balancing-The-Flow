 That's an interesting development! The technology being referred to is likely ultraviolet light traps or similar methods for mosquito control. However, it's important to note that the goal is not to kill "millions" of mosquitoes indiscriminately but rather to target and reduce populations of disease-carrying species such as Aedes aegypti and Anopheles mosquitoes, which spread diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus.

This technology could have significant benefits in areas where these diseases are prevalent, particularly in tropical regions. It's part of the ongoing efforts to combat mosquito-borne illnesses and improve public health worldwide. As with any new technology, ethical considerations and potential environmental impacts must be carefully considered.
