Stevan Jovetic lit up the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening, giving an eye-catching all-round performance for Manchester City that merited his two goals in the 3-1 win. The Montenegrin striker has been used sparingly by Manuel Pellegrini since he signed from Fiorentina for a club record fee of £22m. He had previously started just one Premier League game this season before coming on as a substitute against Tottenham Hotspur last weekend.
However, Jovetic was given the chance to stake his claim for a regular starting place in the Citizens’ first team after being handed the nod ahead of Alvaro Negredo and Edin Dzeko. The 23-year-old didn’t disappoint, opening the scoring with an impressive header before adding another goal to his tally by converting from close range.
