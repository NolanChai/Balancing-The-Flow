Police auctions are a great way for the general public to get hold of some fantastic bargains and with over 8500 items currently available you could be sure of finding something you like at one of these events.

The police have said they would be open to selling any other unwanted goods if there was interest in doing so but only if the auction price would cover the cost of storing it, transporting it and then auctioning it off. They also insist that any items they do sell must be sold as new.
