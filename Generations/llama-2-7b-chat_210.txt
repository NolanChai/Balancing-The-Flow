President Obama called the meeting with top congressional leaders to discuss the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan, which has seen a recent surge in violence and a growing sense of frustration among the American public. As the war enters its 17th year, the President is under pressure to find a way out of the stalemate that has left both sides dug in and no clear path forward. With the Taliban showing resilience and the Afghan government struggling to assert control, the President will need to convince his guests that a new approach is necessary to turn the tide of the conflict.
