Zeidan's resignation came in a no-confidence motion put forward by his rivals, who demanded he quit because his government was too soft on Islamists and had failed to protect the nation from an array of militias. The move has thrown Libya into yet another phase of political instability less than three years after its revolution ended decades of authoritarian rule.
Zeidan said in a statement Tuesday that he would not resign. But within hours, he met with parliamentary speaker Nuri Abu Sahmein, who gave him an ultimatum to quit by Wednesday morning or face the motion again. A few minutes later, Zeidan left the meeting and announced his resignation on state TV in a short televised statement.
"I have decided that Libya needs new blood," he said, referring to a successor with a mandate from parliament. "This is what I have offered as prime minister."
