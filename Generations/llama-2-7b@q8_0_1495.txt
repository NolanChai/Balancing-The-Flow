Lille coach Ren√© Girard is still unconvinced about how far his team can go in Europe this season following their 3-1 defeat at the hands of Arsenal.
"We were not good enough against them," said Girard. "It was clear to see, especially in midfield where we made too many mistakes. We paid the price for that."
