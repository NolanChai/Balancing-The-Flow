 By Jack Doyle PUBLISHED: 20:03 EST, 10 June 2013 UPDATED: 20:05 EST, 10 June 2013 Victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court under new laws introduced in England and Wales. The reforms aim to protect vulnerable witnesses by limiting the level of detail that can be questioned about their traumatic experiences. Under the changes, judges will have more power to restrict the type of questions that can be asked during cross-examination and will be able to impose sanctions on lawyers who breach these restrictions. The new rules also provide for greater support for victims of sexual offenses, including access to specialized counseling and legal aid. The reforms come into effect on 26th July this year.
