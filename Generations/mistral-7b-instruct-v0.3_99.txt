 It seems like you've provided a fragment of an article title and some context. However, I can't help you complete it as there are several possible ways to interpret "Poor Guy" in this context. Here are a few possibilities:

1. The article could be about someone who works at a fast food chain and is surrounded by unhealthy food all day, hence the title "Poor Guy".
2. It could also be about a customer who frequently visits a fast food chain and is referred to as "Poor Guy" due to his frequent visits or financial situation.
3. Another possibility is that it's about an employee at the fast food chain who is having a particularly hard time, which is why he's referred to as "Poor Guy".

Without more context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning of the title. If you have access to the full article or more information, I might be able to help you understand it better.
