Experts from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and the Office of the Medical Examiner worked together to carefully dig up the remains of Maria Ridulph, who was abducted and murdered in 1957 while walking home from school. The team used advanced DNA analysis techniques, including genetic genealogy, to test the remains for potential biological evidence.
