The Rolls Royce RR4 is in the making but it will be a bit late to replace the Range Rover that's set to come out in 2008.

It won’t be until 2010, that Rolls-Royce will start building its first ever 4×4, codenamed the RR4. The ultimate luxury car maker is currently evaluating two possible engines: a BMW V8 or a Mercedes Benz V6 diesel.
The car would be the first four-wheel drive in the company’s history and the only off-road model, making it one of the most unique cars ever produced by Rolls Royce. The new model will also get an independent suspension with self levelling air ride, as well as a limited slip differential.
It is expected to weigh more than 2,600kg, making it 15% heavier than the Phantom and more than twice its weight. But don’t expect Rolls-Royce to abandon their reputation for luxury. The new car will have a price tag of around £140,000 ($280,000), making it even more expensive that the company’s current flagship car, the Phantom.
