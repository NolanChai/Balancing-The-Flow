 That's correct, Juan Mata scored a controversial second goal for Argentina in the FIFA World Cup match against England in 2014. The goal was awarded despite many English players and pundits claiming that Mata had been in an offside position when he received the pass that led to the goal. The decision sparked a lot of debate on social media and TV, with some people arguing that it was a clear case of cheating by the referee.
