 The fire at Rana Plaza, a garment factory in Bangladesh, has caused widespread shock and concern among those in the international retail and fashion industries who have sourced goods from the factory.

The factory had contracts with several major brands and retailers, including Walmart, H&M, and Benetton, which have all expressed their condolences to the victims of the fire and pledged to work with authorities to investigate the cause of the blaze.

However, some industry critics and labor activists have criticized the companies for not doing enough to ensure worker safety and protect workers' rights at factories in Bangladesh, where working conditions can be hazardous and wages are often low.

The fire at Rana Plaza is the deadliest industrial accident in Bangladesh's history, and has raised concerns about the country's ability to enforce labor laws and prevent accidents at garment factories.
