 It sounds like you're referring to the relocation of the Wasps rugby union club to the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, and the anticipation surrounding their first match there. The "noisy neighbors" comment might suggest that there could be some local competition or rivalry with other sports teams or clubs in the area.

The party atmosphere likely refers to the excitement and festivities associated with the opening of a new chapter for Wasps, as they move from their former home at Adams Park in High Wycombe. This transition could bring a fresh energy to the sporting scene in Coventry, adding another exciting team to the city's roster of sports clubs.

However, without more specific information about the context or potential competition, it is difficult to provide a more detailed analysis. I hope this helps in understanding the tone and implications of your statement!
