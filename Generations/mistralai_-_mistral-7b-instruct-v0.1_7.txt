 In space by NASA, making history as the first ants to ever leave Earth's atmosphere.

The ants, known as leafcutter ants, were placed inside a small container and attached to a rocket that launched from the Kennedy Space Center earlier this week. The rocket reached an altitude of about 15 miles before descending safely back to Earth.

Scientists hope the ants will provide valuable information about how organisms survive in space, as they are known for their ability to survive in extreme environments on Earth. The ants are also capable of building complex structures and working together in colonies, which could be useful for future space exploration missions.

This mission is just one example of how scientists are using new technology and techniques to study the effects of space travel on living organisms. Other experiments have involved sending microorganisms, plants, and even fish into space to understand how they adapt to the harsh conditions of spaceflight.
