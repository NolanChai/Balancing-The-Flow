 It seems like you've shared a news headline about a tragic skydiving incident. However, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or access specific articles unless they are provided to me directly. I can help you rephrase the headline in a more formal manner:

"A Norwegian Individual Suffers Fatal Accident During a Skydive as His Parachute Failed to Deploy After a Struggle"

In this rephrased version, the details of the incident are presented in a more professional and objective manner. If you need help with any other task or have questions, feel free to ask!
