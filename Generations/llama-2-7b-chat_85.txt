A Norwegian man died Thursday after his parachute failed to open during a skydiving jump in Norway, authorities said. The 42-year-old man, whose name has not been released, was participating in a tandem skydive with an instructor when the incident occurred, according to police in the city of Trondheim. The pair were jumping from an altitude of about 10,000 feet (3,048 meters) when the man's parachute failed to open, police said. The instructor landed safely on the ground, but the man did not survive the fall. An investigation into the incident is underway.
