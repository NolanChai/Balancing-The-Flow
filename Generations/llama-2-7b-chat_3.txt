TLC has pulled an episode of Cake Boss from future screening schedules after receiving complaints over a cake design that some viewers found offensive. The episode, which was set to air on Friday night, featured a cake with a design that resembled the Auschwitz concentration camp, complete with barbed wire and guard towers. The network said in a statement that it apologized for any offense caused by the cake and would not be airing it again in the future.
