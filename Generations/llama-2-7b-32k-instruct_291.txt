According to an affidavit filed in US District Court on December 1, 2013, the defendant, Anthony Michael Lopez, accessed a Royal Caribbean computer system and stole information about approximately 59,000 guests who were booked on 46 different sailings between February 2010 and April 2013.
Lopez then allegedly used the personal information to access victims' credit cards online and make fraudulent charges or withdraw cash from ATMs in their names. The total estimated losses are more than $56,000.
It was not immediately clear why Lopez stole the information or how he accessed it. Royal Caribbean said that their computer systems were secure and that they were "unaware of any vulnerability" prior to Lopez's arrest. They did not provide further details about the investigation, such as whether there had been a breach in security protocols.
Lopez was arrested on November 29 at his home in Miami, Florida by federal authorities and charged with wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. He is scheduled to appear before a federal judge in Miami today for his first court appearance. Lopez's lawyer did not immediately return calls seeking comment.
