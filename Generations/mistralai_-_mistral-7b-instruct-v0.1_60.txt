 The 28-year-old Montenegrin striker has struggled to find his form since joining City from Fiorentina in the summer of 2014, but he was outstanding on Monday night. He was a constant threat up front, dispossessing defenders and creating chances with his intelligent runs and one-on-one play. He was also a nuisance in the opposition half, winning back possession and closing down on defenders. His goals were the result of good teamwork and some clever finishing, and they gave City a vital lead over West Ham in the race for fourth place.
