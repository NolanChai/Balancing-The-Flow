##### Introduction
The victim in this case is John Eccles, a 35-year old man who was attacked by his former best friend. The assailant was under the influence of alcohol and had been drinking for a couple of days before the attack. The attack left him with a concave skull. I am going to look at what happened in this case and then consider whether or not there are any legal issues that need to be addressed.

##### Victim Statement
The victim was attacked by his former best friend, who had been drinking for a couple of days before the attack. He suffered from alcoholism and was often violent when under the influence. The attack left him with a concave skull.

##### Attacker Statement
The attacker stated that he did not remember what happened during the incident but does recall being very drunk at the time. He also said that he has had problems with alcohol in the past and feels like it was inevitable that something like this would happen one day.

##### Witness Statements
There were no witnesses to the attack, which took place behind closed doors. The only person who witnessed anything was John Eccles himself, but he cannot remember what happened due to his concussion.

##### Conclusions
The victim suffered from a concave skull after being attacked by his former best friend who had been drinking for a couple of days before the attack. There are no legal issues that need to be addressed in this case because it is clear that the attacker was under the influence and therefore not responsible for their actions at the time of the incident

##### Recommendations
The victim should seek medical attention as soon as possible so he can receive treatment for his concussion and other injuries sustained during this attack.

##### Conclusion
I believe that there are no legal issues that need to be addressed in this case because it is clear that the attacker was under the influence and therefore not responsible for their actions at the time of the incident
