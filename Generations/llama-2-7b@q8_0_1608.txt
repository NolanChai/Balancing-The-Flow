The publisher of the men's magazine Nuts has insisted it is not being boycotted by retailer The Co-operative Group because its editors are too liberal. The retail giant, which owns the Co-op Food brand, said in a statement on Thursday that Nuts would no longer be sold at its stores from next month because it did not 'conform to our corporate values'.
But now publishers IPC Media has released a statement saying its publications are 'subjected to rigorous censorship' by the retailer. A spokesman said: "The Co-operative Group does not like the way we choose to edit our magazines and that is why they have stopped stocking them.
"We publish stories on a wide range of subjects but no subject, however controversial, would ever be off limits."
The Co-op claims it will remove Nuts from its shelves in September because it 'contained too many references to naked women'. A spokesman for the group added: "Our ethical policy has always been clear. We are unable to stock any publication that does not conform to our corporate values."
Nuts, Maxim and Zoo - which between them sell 900,000 copies a week - are all owned by IPC Media. It also owns women's magazines such as Chat, Woman & Home, New! and Take A Break.
The Co-op Group has been at the forefront of the movement against lads' mags, but stopped selling Zoo because it felt that was being more liberal in its approach to pictures than Nuts or Maxim. In a statement issued on Thursday evening, IPC said: "The Co-operative Group is not boycotting any of our publications, including Nuts and Zoo.
"They have made this decision because they feel we are not applying the same rigorous censorship to our magazines as other retailers." The statement added that the retailer was "in a minority position", with the majority of retailers happy to stock them. It said: "The Co-operative Group does not like the way we choose to edit our magazines and that is why they have stopped stocking them.
"We publish stories on a wide range of subjects but no subject, however controversial, would ever be off limits." The Co-op has been at odds with Nuts in particular over its policy of publishing naked women. The supermarket group said the decision was taken following consultation with its staff and customers, while IPC claimed it had not received any complaints about the magazines from customers.
The Daily Mail newspaper first reported on Thursday that the Co-op would be removing Nuts and Zoo from its shelves after being contacted by an unnamed source close to the retailer. The Co-operative Group refused to comment on the move until it had issued a statement about the decision, which was released at 9pm on Thursday. A spokesman for the group said: "We have decided not to stock Nuts and Zoo in our stores because of concerns that they do not conform to our corporate values.
"The Co-operative Group is not boycotting any of IPC's publications, including Nuts and Maxim." A spokesman for IPC Media said the company had not been aware of The Daily Mail's story before being contacted by the Mail for comment.
IPC also owns glossy magazines such as Grazia, OK!, Look, Marie Claire and Heat. It was bought by German media group Bertelsmann in 1985 but sold a majority stake to venture capital fund Apax Partners in November last year, with Apax taking control of the business on June 30 this year.
