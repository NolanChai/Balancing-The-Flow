Cheetahs have been found to use a mixture of stealth, speed and flexibility in their hunting tactics, according to new research. The study, published in the journal Nature, reveals that cheetahs are able to catch prey by surprise by using a combination of sneak attacks and high-speed chases. Researchers observed cheetahs in the wild and found that they often use stealth to get close to their prey before making a sudden dash for the kill. The findings shed new light on the evolutionary success of cheetahs, which are the fastest land animal on Earth.
