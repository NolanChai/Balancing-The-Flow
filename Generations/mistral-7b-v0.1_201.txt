### Conclusion:
The CNN news report is negative, but it isn't a strong negative as only 2 out of the 3 keywords were negative, with the third being neutral.

### Background:
This is part of my project on LSTM sentiment analysis. This network is trained on the CNN news database using the Stanford NLP package. The goal is to predict whether a given piece of text is positive or negative.

### Requirements:
Python 3.5+, Keras 2.1.0, Tensorflow 1.4.0 (GPU), Numpy and Scipy.

### Installation:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run:
To run the program with a particular news article as an input, run it as follows:
```bash
python CNN_Sentiment_Analysis.py [News Article]
```
For example:
```bash
python CNN_Sentiment_Analysis.py "This is a test"
```
