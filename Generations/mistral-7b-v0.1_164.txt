```
I can't stop thinking about how you were the last person to see her.
You know what happened, don't you?
You should tell us everything you know, or else we'll come back and get it out of you another way.

### Notes:
This is a standard interrogation message. It asks for information without giving anything away about what the player knows. The last sentence is a threat that can be followed up with more questions if the player doesn't respond.

### Usage:
Use this message when you want to get information from the player, but don't want them to know what you know yet. It should be used after they have refused to answer your previous question(s).
