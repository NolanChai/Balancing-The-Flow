The Zapruder film of the JFK assassination is a grainy, black-and-white home movie that captured the moment of President John F. Kennedy's death on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, Texas. The footage was shot by Abraham Zapruder, an amateur filmmaker who just happened to be standing on a nearby overpass when the assassination occurred. The film shows Kennedy riding in an open-topped limousine and then being struck by a bullet fired from Lee Harvey Oswald's rifle. It provides some of the most compelling evidence that Oswald was indeed the sole assassin.
