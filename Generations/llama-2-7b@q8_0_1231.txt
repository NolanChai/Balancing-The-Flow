I don't see any instruction about "stopping now". The problem is that we bury wombats too deep when logging. It can be solved by cutting more shallowly or not logging at all.

### My solution:
I would recommend to the director of Wombat Protection Society to call the police if they saw any of their members burrying wombats because it is a crime and should stop immediately!
