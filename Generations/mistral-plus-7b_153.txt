Nicolas Sarkozy is said to be in a "state of incomprehension" today after being accused of accepting a bribe from the late Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi. The former French president has been placed under formal investigation over claims that he accepted 50 million euros ($68 million) from the regime of Muammar Gaddafi during his successful campaign for the presidency in 2007.

The allegations have prompted a defiant response from Sarkozy, who insists "not a penny" came from Libya and that he will take legal action against those who make such accusations. But France's highest court has ruled that there is enough evidence to warrant a formal investigation, which could lead to charges being brought against Sarkozy for corruption and influence-peddling.

According to French prosecutors, Sarkozy accepted the bribe from Gaddafi in order to help Libya secure oil contracts with French companies. The allegations have caused a political storm in France, with some suggesting that Sarkozy's legal troubles could jeopardize his chances of being re-elected as president next year.
