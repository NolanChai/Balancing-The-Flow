The former Archbishop Lord Hope of St Andrews was criticised in the report as being too soft on child sex offenders . 

### Answer: 
#### Reasoning: 
Four years after retiring from the Church of England's most senior Scottish post, he [the former archbishop] emerged yesterday as the man behind one of the most damning reports into clerical child abuse. The former Archbishop Lord Hope of St Andrews was criticised in a report commissioned by Scotland's Catholic Church for being 'too soft' on sex offenders and failing to confront allegations against priests. He is said to have covered up cases of sexual abuse by priests while he led the Scottish Episcopal Church in Edinburgh from 1984 until his retirement five years ago. He was even accused of allowing a paedophile priest, who had been jailed for sexually assaulting three schoolboys and a young woman in the 1960s, to escape punishment by resigning rather than being defrocked. The allegation against Lord Hope emerged in a report compiled by retired judge Lady Smith which was published yesterday . Scroll down for video . The allegations: Lord Hope is accused of covering up cases of sexual abuse by priests while he led the Scottish Episcopal Church from 1984 until his retirement five years ago . In the report, Lady Smith said that 'whistleblowers' in Scotland were being ignored by church officials. She added: 'There is a culture of silence and fear which has made it difficult for victims to come forward.' The allegations against Lord Hope emerged after he was asked to investigate claims that Cardinal Keith O'Brien, the former leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, had sexually assaulted some of his priests. Lady Smith's report found there was 'compelling evidence' that at least one of these men complained to Lord Hope about allegations of inappropriate behaviour by Cardinal O'Brien. The judge said: 'In the absence of any direct response from the former archbishop, it is clear to me that the church did not take sufficient action on this information.' Lord Hope was asked by Lady Smith to comment on these claims but he declined to do so because of his 'wish for confidentiality'. Lord Hope also told the judge she could rely only on a summary of evidence and had not seen any of the witness statements. In one case, the former archbishop allegedly allowed Father Davidson to resign from his post rather than being defrocked . The report said: 'Had he [Lord Hope] done so [seen witnesses' statements], I would have been in a better position to consider whether there was any basis for the concerns expressed.' Lady Smith also criticised Lord Hope's decision not to confront claims that Cardinal O'Brien had sexually assaulted at least one of his priests. She said: 'It is regrettable that the former archbishop did not seek more information about these allegations before concluding that there was no substance in them.' The report added: 'While there are many good things which have been achieved by the former Scottish Episcopal Church . . . it has not always made clear what to do or where to go when people complain of abuse. 'This may be because it is not a large organisation and therefore cannot afford to spend much time investigating such complaints.' Lady Smith said: 'There is a culture of silence and fear which has made it difficult for victims to come forward' . In one case, the former archbishop allegedly allowed Father Davidson to resign from his post rather than being defrocked. This man was jailed in 1982 after admitting abusing three schoolboys while he worked at St Bride’s College in Edinburgh between 1957 and 1964. Lady Smith said: 'Father Davidson should have been removed from his office as a priest but no attempt was made to do this.' The judge added that 'there were other opportunities for action' but the former archbishop 'did not take them'. Lady Smith also criticised Lord Hope's decision not to confront claims that Cardinal O’Brien (pictured) had sexually assaulted at least one of his priests . She said: 'The Scottish Episcopal Church has shown little willingness, or capacity, to come to grips with the issues raised by my report. It is now for others to consider what action needs to be taken to address these failings and ensure that they do not happen again.' Lord Hope declined to comment on Lady Smith's allegations but a spokesman said: 'The church has fully co-operated with Lady Smith's investigation.' He added: 'The former archbishop cannot reply in detail to her report as he is no longer part of the Scottish Episcopal Church. However, his attitude towards abuse by priests was always to take serious action against them if allegations were established.' The spokesman said that the church was taking steps to ensure the 'safety and well-being' of children at all its churches. Lady Smith's report also criticised the Roman Catholic Church for not publicly explaining why Cardinal O’Brien resigned last year as leader of Scotland's Catholics after admitting that he had sexually assaulted priests when they were seminarians in the 1980s. The report added: 'It is regrettable that the former archbishop did not seek more information about these allegations before concluding that there was no substance in them' . Lady Smith’s report also criticised the Roman Catholic Church for not publicly explaining why Cardinal O’Brien resigned last year as leader of Scotland's Catholics after admitting he had sexually assaulted priests when they were seminarians (pictured) in the 1980s . She added: 'If, as has now been suggested, there was some deliberate attempt to shield the cardinal from public criticism then this would not have reflected well on the church.' Lady Smith also criticised the Catholic Church for not making more public the details of an investigation into the allegations made against Cardinal O'Brien. The report said: 'I am concerned that the church has been slow in making public the terms of reference and conclusions of its own independent investigations, which have been conducted by a retired judge.' Lady Smith also criticised the Scottish Episcopal Church for not ensuring that all of its priests were vetted before taking up their roles. She said: 'The church must put in place policies to ensure that all clergy are subject to proper safeguarding checks.' The report added: 'This has not been done and, although it is now a priority for the church to achieve this, there does not appear to be much urgency about it.' Lady Smith said that she would report her findings to the Scottish government. She added that the Roman Catholic Church was also considering whether to make changes to its own policies on child protection following Cardinal O'Brien's resignation last March. The report, which examined 27 complaints against priests and church workers dating back to 1974, found that ten were substantiated but none of these involved any contact with a child. Lady Smith said: 'The Scottish Episcopal Church has shown little willingness, or capacity, to come to grips with the issues raised by my report' . The judge concluded that the church had acted properly in all 27 cases except for one when it failed to notify the police about claims of sexual assault against a child. In that case, she said, the victim was so traumatised by what happened to them that they did not want their name or the location of the alleged incident made public. Lady Smith added: 'While there are many good things which have been achieved by the former Scottish Episcopal Church . . . it has not always made clear what to do or where to go when people complain of abuse.' She also criticised a church-run organisation set up in 2010 to handle complaints and protect children. Lady Smith said: 'There was little understanding, within the former Scottish Episcopal Church . . . that people might want to talk about the abuse they had experienced without having it investigated or reported.' The report added: 'While there has been a lot of progress since 2010 there is still some way to go before the church is able to deal with complaints in a way which encourages those who have suffered from abuse to come forward and make their concerns known.' Lady Smith said that the Scottish government had given her discretion as to whether or not she should publish her findings. The judge added: 'I accept that there are some aspects of my report which need careful handling but, in general, I consider it important for people to know what happened in this period of time.' She added: 'The Scottish Episcopal Church has shown little willingness, or capacity, to come to grips with the issues raised by my report. It is now for others to consider what action needs to be taken to address these failings and ensure that they do not happen again.’ The judge's report comes four years after Lord Hope (pictured) retired as head of the Scottish Episcopal Church .
