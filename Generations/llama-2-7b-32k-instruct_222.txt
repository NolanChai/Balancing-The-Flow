I oppose the bill because it threatens individual liberty and creates a surveillance society in which our movements and communications are permanently monitored. In my view, this would damage personal freedom and could undermine fundamental human rights. It is also unnecessary, as other measures already exist to help catch criminals using the internet or by telephone.
