According to researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), memory loss is a common symptom of brain aging, particularly after the age of 40. The study, published in the journal Neurology, found that older adults are more likely to experience forgetfulness and difficulty with memory tasks than younger adults. The researchers used a series of tests to assess the cognitive function of over 1,600 participants aged 40 to 89 years old. They found that those in their 50s and 60s experienced more significant memory loss than those in their 70s and 80s. The study also found that certain activities such as reading, socializing, and exercising regularly can help improve cognitive function and reduce the risk of dementia.
