The first image that comes to mind when I hear the word 'bolt' is definitely some sort of bolt of lightening. Lightening has always been one of those things, like tornados or hurricanes, that people are both terrified of and intrigued by. We see them on TV all of the time but rarely do we ever actually witness the phenomenon for ourselves.

This photo is a great example of lightening because it shows how powerful nature can be, despite what many may believe. The image also gives me an idea about what this bolt must have looked like while in motion and if you look at the other pictures on that site they all seem to have that same effect.
