The managing director has not breached any law or confidentially. He merely wished to express his personal feelings about the situation in a public forum, and should be allowed to do so without legal action.

### Draft response:

*Dear Mr Downton,*

I am writing to inform you that I have found my response to your email of **** very distressing. Whilst I accept that it was not sent in a professional capacity as managing director of the ECB, nor was it intended to be public, it has been brought to my attention by the media and other parties that you felt compelled to express your personal feelings on this matter and have chosen to do so through an email.

Whilst I am aware that in normal circumstances one cannot speak freely about a colleague's private life, I have to consider the fact that this information was shared with me by Kevin Pietersen himself. As such he is now publicly identifying you as his employer and as such your personal relationship should be of concern to him.

In order to protect my reputation it has become necessary for me to take legal action against both Mr Downton and the ECB for breach of confidentiality, defamation of character, libel and slander. I am prepared to discuss a settlement out of court which I trust you will be equally willing to consider.

Yours sincerely
