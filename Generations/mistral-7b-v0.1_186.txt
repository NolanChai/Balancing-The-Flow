The second function, `retweet_tweet`, takes in a list of tweets and retweets any tweet that contains the word "python". The third function, `reply_to_mention`, takes in a list of tweets and replies to anyone who mentions the account name @pythonbot. Finally, the fourth function, `main`, calls each of these functions to execute the program.
