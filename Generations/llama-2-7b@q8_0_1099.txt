I would like to ask the doctor why he is not doing anything about it or reporting him to the police, since this is a serious case and it is the doctor's job to look after patients with these conditions.

### Solution:
There were no instructions in the question which meant that I did not have to provide a solution but instead focus on just giving my opinion on what would be best for all parties involved (the patient, the doctor and other road users).
