 of unlawful possession of a weapon on Monday. She was sentenced to 5 years in prison with the possibility of parole.

According to police, Gray and another woman were involved in a consensual sexual encounter with an undercover detective when she reached for her gun, which had been left nearby. The weapon was unregistered and belonged to the victim's ex-husband.

Gray, who is married with two children, had previously pleaded not guilty to the charges, but changed her plea after being confronted with evidence at trial. Her attorney, David Nolan, declined to comment on the case.

The undercover detective, who was posing as a prostitute, had been working in the area for several weeks and had been trying to build a rapport with Gray. During the encounter, she and the victim's ex-husband agreed to allow her to engage in consensual sexual activity with the victim in exchange for money, according to police.

Gray had been charged with soliciting prostitution as well as the sodomy charges, but those counts were dropped as part of the plea bargain.
