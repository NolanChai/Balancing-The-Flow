 Amir Khan, a boxing champion in his own right, took to social media to respond to Mayweather's comment. "I know you think you are the best but let me remind you I'm the most famous person from Pakistan and have sold out Wembley Stadium," he tweeted. "You've never been there so how do you know who's more famous?" Khan also pointed out that Mayweather has fought in a much smaller stadium than Wembley, adding to his argument of fame. The two boxers have a history of feuds and insults, with Khan often calling out Mayweather for being overly boastful and arrogant.
