Britons braved the chilly temperatures to enjoy a refreshing swim on New Year's Day. As temperatures soared to near record levels, many took advantage of the warm weather and dipped into local rivers and seas. One of the most popular spots was Brighton beach in East Sussex where hundreds of people took their annual dip in the sea, despite the cold water. In Cornwall, swimmers were seen enjoying a swim at Porthcawl beach while in Wales, many took to Cardiff Bay for a New Year's Day swim.
