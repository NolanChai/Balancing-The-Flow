Iâ€™m sorry but we cannot accept this offer at this time, the board have decided that Callum has to be given more chance in the first team and with James McClean and Marc-Antoine Fortune ahead of him he needs regular football. If you would like to come back in a couple of weeks then I will make sure that I bring it up again.
