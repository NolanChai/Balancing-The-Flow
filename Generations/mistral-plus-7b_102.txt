Bus passengers ganged up on some French tourists, even threatening to kill them, on an Australian train. They were travelling from Brisbane to Cairns when a group of 20-30 people boarded the train and began harassing the French tourists with verbal abuse. The tourists said they felt threatened by the behaviour of the group and told staff that they feared for their safety.

The incident happened on Sunday night at the end of the tourist season in Far North Queensland, which attracts many French visitors.

Police were called to the train and the passengers involved were removed from the service before it continued its journey. No arrests have been made at this stage.
