Six people were killed when a building being demolished collapsed Wednesday and nearly obliterated a large section of the street in downtown Philadelphia.
The collapse happened around noon, as two adjacent buildings on 22nd Street were being torn down. A building next door to the one being demolished also gave way, falling onto a crane that was lifting debris.
Seven people were pulled from the rubble alive and taken to nearby hospitals in critical condition. Two more workers were unaccounted for.
