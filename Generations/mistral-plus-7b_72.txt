After months of speculation that her relationship with Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews was on the rocks, Louise Thompson has confirmed she and her boyfriend have split up.
The 24 year old announced the sad news on Twitter today writing, “After a lot of thought it’s time to call it quits. I love you Spence.”
Made In Chelsea fans were left devastated for the couple earlier this month when Spencer was pictured getting close to another woman while on holiday in Greece.
