Teachers are being treated like ‘lab rats’ and stripped of their professionalism by government education policies.

The use of CCTV in schools has become increasingly common in recent years, with the aim of improving student behavior and safety. However, many teachers believe that this type of surveillance violates their privacy and undermines their professionalism. They argue that CCTV is a form of control that takes away their autonomy and ability to make decisions on their own without fear of being monitored or criticized by those in power.

Additionally, the use of CCTV can lead to an increased feeling of anxiety and stress for teachers as they are constantly aware that they are being watched and judged by others. This constant surveillance can lead to a decrease in job satisfaction and motivation, which could eventually result in burnout or attrition from the profession. Ultimately, teachers need to be trusted and respected for their skills and expertise rather than monitored and controlled like “lab rats.”
