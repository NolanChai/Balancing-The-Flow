Budget cutbacks to street cleaning programmes across the UK are causing public concern about the increasing problem of litter, according to a recent survey conducted by the Campaign for Better Transportation (CBT). 

The group claims that nearly a third of local councils have either reduced or stopped their litter pick-up programmes in order to make cost savings. Littering is seen as one of the major causes of blight and environmental degradation across the country.
