 The suspects were identified as 30-year-old Mark Daniel Huffman, 27-year-old Darius Wayne Taylor, 29-year-old Tavon Keith Taylor, and an unidentified male juvenile.

Dr. John Christopher Draper was killed at his home in the 1500 block of South Houston Parkway on Saturday afternoon. It's unclear what led to the shooting or if any of the suspects had any connection to Draper.

The Harris County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed Draper's death and said an autopsy was being performed Monday.
