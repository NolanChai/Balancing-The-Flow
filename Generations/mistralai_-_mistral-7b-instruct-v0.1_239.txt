 Yes, that's correct! On August 18, 2020, Paris experienced a horizontal rainbow known as a "fire rainbow." This type of rainbow is caused by the refraction and reflection of sunlight in ice crystals in the atmosphere. It is a rare phenomenon and can only be seen under certain conditions, such as when the sun is shining behind a layer of ice clouds. It's amazing how beautiful and unique natural events like this can be!
