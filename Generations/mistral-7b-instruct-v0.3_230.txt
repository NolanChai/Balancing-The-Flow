 It seems like you've presented a cryptic phrase. If we interpret "Upheaval" as a significant change or disruption, and "Wasps" as a resilient species known for adapting to changes in their environment, then the statement could mean that periods of upheaval or change are beneficial or well-suited for resilient entities. However, this is just one possible interpretation, and the meaning might vary based on the specific context in which it's used.
