I'm sorry to say that this is just sad.

### Explanation:
### Hints:
- We need the word count of a string. The string can have spaces but we don’t want to check if it contains any symbols or punctuation (‘ ‘, , :)
```python
def word_count(string):
    return len(string.split())
```
### Tests:
```python
assert word_count('  I LOVE MY GIRLFRIEND!') == 3
assert word_count('THIS IS A TEST SENTENCE WITH LOTS OF WORDS AND SENTENCES IN IT. IT'S REALLY BAD AT MAKING POINTS. THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.') == 20
```
