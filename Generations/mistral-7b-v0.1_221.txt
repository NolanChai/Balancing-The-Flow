### Description:
The South Korean family of the 2013 X Factor Australia winner has completed the almost impossible task of crossing the restricted North Korean border. In tense footage, singer Dami Im and her parents were seen walking through the demilitarised zone, where they had a brief meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
The meeting was organised by the South Korean government after Ms Im won the talent show in 2013, which led to her being invited to sing at a state banquet in Beijing last year, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency.
Ms Im said she had "always wanted" to go back to North Korea, where her parents were born, but never thought it would happen, the report said.
Ms Im was seen smiling and waving as she crossed the border into North Korea. She then greeted Mr Kim, who bowed to her before shaking her hand.
Ms Im's father is reported to have been a North Korean diplomat in Australia when she was born.
It is not clear why the family visited North Korea, but it follows reports that the Australian government has been trying to secure the release of a number of its citizens who are imprisoned in the country.
In June, Ms Im won a second series of X Factor Australia with her rendition of 'Diamonds Are Forever', sung as a duet with her idol Elton John. She was then invited to sing at the banquet in Beijing last year.
