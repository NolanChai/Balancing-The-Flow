Science is a wonderful thing that has allowed us to accomplish many things in our daily lives. However, science comes with its own set of consequences. The world may be better off without the technological advancements we've made over the years. For example, nuclear weapons have been used countless times throughout history and they continue to threaten humanity today. These devices can cause massive destruction on both a personal level (like when Fukushima was hit by an earthquake) or at a national level (like during World War II).

Science has also brought us some amazing inventions, like the iPhone. This device allows people to communicate with friends and family from all over the world through apps like Skype or FaceTime. Science has also been responsible for many medical advancements such as antibiotics that help fight off disease-causing bacteria in our bodies.
