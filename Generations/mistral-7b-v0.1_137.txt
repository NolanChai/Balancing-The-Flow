The first thing that comes to mind when thinking about this article is "What!?!?!" I mean really, what in the world would make you stay at a hotel where 200 guests had to be confined for an entire week because of the swine flu scare?? I mean if I had been one of those guests I would have been like "Hey I am not going to stay here anymore."

### Insight:
This article is interesting to me because I think that it is a little unbelievable. 200 people confined for an entire week and they are actually happy about it? If that were me I would be so upset and unhappy that I would have just walked out of the hotel with my bags packed.
