 Everton's worst fears about Kevin Mirallas have been realized as the Belgium forward faces up to eight weeks on the sidelines with a fractured ankle.

The 25-year-old sustained the injury while playing for Belgium in their World Cup qualifier against Cyprus last night and will miss at least six games for the Blues, including their next Premier League game against Stoke City on Sunday. 

Everton manager Roberto Martinez has expressed his frustration over the incident, saying: "We are very disappointed for Kevin and it's a blow for us because he's been playing really well this season."

Mirallas has been in excellent form this campaign, scoring five goals in 30 games for Everton. He will miss important matches against West Bromwich Albion, Manchester United, Arsenal, Liverpool, and Sunderland during his absence.

Everton's medical staff are working round the clock to speed up Mirallas' recovery process so he can return to action as soon as possible.
