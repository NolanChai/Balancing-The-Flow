A four-year-old girl is dead in the US state of Ohio because she tried to exit from a running motor vehicle while her mother was distracted and had forgotten to shut off the engine, authorities said Wednesday. The child, identified as Cameron Laughlin, died at about 4pm on Tuesday after she got out of the rear door of the Jeep Wrangler and walked around outside as the car was moving in a parking lot near her home.

The girl was found by her mother about one hour later, at which point medical personnel were called to the scene, said Deputy Chief Tom Johnson of the Richland County Sheriff's Office. The incident happened about two miles northwest of Mansfield and also involved an adult in another vehicle who witnessed what had occurred.

"The witness in this case heard her yelling from inside of a Jeep," Johnson told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday evening, according to the US local WCMH-TV 47 News, which obtained video footage of the scene via its website. "He found that vehicle parked on the sidewalk and called it in."

The child was taken to Ohio Health MedCentral Hospital and later pronounced dead, Johnson said. The mother was cooperating with authorities. He added that there were no signs of foul play or drugs involved in the case.

"It's a very tragic situation," he said. "There are no charges at this time."

The incident came just hours after Ohio Governor John Kasich signed into law legislation banning children from riding unrestrained in motor vehicles. The bill, which became effective immediately, also prohibits people from putting any child younger than six years of age on an adult's lap or in the back seat of a vehicle when there is no available safety restraint such as a seatbelt or car seat.

The law is aimed at addressing a problem that had become more frequent after US states were required by federal law to equip vehicles with three-point seat belts and other safety features.

"We're trying to get the word out," said Kasich, who was accompanied by several Ohio children during the bill signing ceremony in his office on Tuesday afternoon. "I think it's just something we need to do for our kids."

A number of US states have already had laws prohibiting children from riding unrestrained or without car seats. Kasich also said that he was concerned about other safety issues related to children in vehicles, including the lack of child booster seat use.

"The concern I'd like us all to focus on is getting those kids to be protected," he said. "We have a responsibility to make sure they're safe."

The accident comes as the US government warned last week that it could take another 40 years for child fatality rates in car accidents to reach levels seen in European countries, which are now lower than those in the United States thanks to improved safety features on vehicles and increased use of seatbelts.

"This is a public health issue," said NHTSA Administrator David Friedman, who also attended Tuesday's bill signing ceremony in Washington DC. "We want parents to know that there are steps they can take to protect their children."

In a statement provided by his office on Wednesday, Kasich offered condolences to Laughlin's family and said the law would help prevent similar accidents from happening again.

"While we cannot bring Cameron back, this law will hopefully ensure that others do not fall victim to the same tragedy," he said. "As a father myself, I want nothing more than for my daughters to be protected."

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also issued a statement on Wednesday saying it was aware of the death in Ohio and offered condolences to those involved, adding that it continues to investigate the incident. The agency did not immediately respond to further requests for comment. (AFP)
