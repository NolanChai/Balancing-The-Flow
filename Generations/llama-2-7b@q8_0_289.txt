This is the result of Israel's brutal aggression against the Palestinians, who had been protesting their oppression from Israeli occupation beforehand. They were not being violent towards each other and then Israel stepped in and attacked.
The Arabs are furious at this because they believe it was an unnecessary act and that if these people were left alone and allowed to peacefully protest there would be no war.
