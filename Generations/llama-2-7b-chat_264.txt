Victims of rape and other horrific crimes will be spared the ordeal of brutal cross-examination in open court under plans announced by the government today. The new proposals, which are intended to "protect the dignity and privacy" of victims, will mean that they can give evidence from behind a screen or via video link, rather than having to face their attackers directly.
Under the current system, victims of rape and other serious crimes are subjected to aggressive questioning by lawyers for the prosecution and defense, which can be deeply distressing and re-traumatizing. The new proposals aim to provide a more compassionate and supportive approach to victim evidence, while still ensuring that justice is served.
The plans are part of a broader review of the criminal justice system, which is intended to make it easier for victims to access support and justice, and to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the courts. The government has also announced plans to increase funding for victim support services, and to provide more help for victims of domestic abuse and other forms of violence.
The new proposals on cross-examination are likely to be welcomed by victims' groups, who have long campaigned for greater protection and support for those affected by crime. However, some legal experts have expressed concerns that the changes could undermine the fairness of the trial process, by limiting the ability of lawyers to challenge witnesses and gather evidence.
Overall, the government's plans are a significant step towards creating a more compassionate and supportive criminal justice system, which prioritizes the needs of victims while still ensuring that justice is served.
