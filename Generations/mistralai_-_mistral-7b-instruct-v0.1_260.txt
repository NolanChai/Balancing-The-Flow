 store staff were left stunned by the brazen thieves who used fake IDs and aliases to carry out their crime spree over a period of several weeks in London.

The gang, believed to be of Eastern European origin, targeted high-value displays on the department store's main floor, using crowbars and other tools to break open security cases. They then slipped on and off the premises undetected, thanks to their convincing disguises and meticulous planning.

"This was a highly audacious criminal enterprise," said prosecutor Oliver Cox. "These defendants dressed up as wealthy Muslim women in order to steal high-value watches from Selfridges."

Judge John Hillenbrand, who presided over the trial, condemned the gang's actions as "totally disgraceful" and "an offence that strikes at the very heart of this great city".

The judge also praised the efforts of store staff to prevent further thefts and apprehend the suspects. "I would like to pay tribute to the staff of Selfridges who worked tirelessly to stop these criminals and bring them to justice," he said.

The gang, known as the 'London Burka Gang', were jailed for a total of 46 years.
