The first step is to figure out what name he actually chose. The second step is to see if it was a good or bad name, and then come up with something better than his suggestion. I'm sure there will be some creative solutions!

##### Step 1: Figure out the actual name he chose

After consulting with NASA officials, we determined that Mr. Colbert had chosen "Colbert's Wing" for our new addition.

##### Step 2: Determine if it was a good or bad name

We consulted with experts in linguistics and semiotics to determine the meaning of this name. They concluded that "Colbert" is an adjective derived from the surname Colbert, which means "bright" or "shiny," but also has connotations of arrogance and vanity. The word "wing" is a noun referring to any of various parts of the human body used for flight or movement through space or air; it could be interpreted as representing one's ability to fly away from reality into fantasy worlds.

##### Step 3: Come up with something better than his suggestion!

We then asked our team of engineers, scientists and mathematicians what they thought about Colbert's suggestion for naming our new wing; most agreed that it wasn't appropriate due to its lack of specificity regarding the purpose for which this building would be used by astronauts aboard ISS.

So we came up with a few other suggestions:

-The Neil Armstrong Wing (for obvious reasons)

-The Buzz Aldrin Wing (also for obvious reasons)

-The John Glenn Wing (because he's an American hero!)

-The Yuri Gagarin Wing (because Russia is cool too)

-The Sally Ride Wing (in honor of America's first female astronaut)

-The Mae Jemison Wing (in honor of America's first black female astronaut)

-The Christa McAuliffe Wing (in memory of the Challenger crew)
