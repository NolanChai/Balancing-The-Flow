BMW has announced a global recall of more than 1.6 million cars due to concerns about potential defects with their airbags. The recall affects BMW models ranging from the 3 Series to the Z4, produced between October 2000 and December 2011, and includes approximately 850,000 vehicles in the US alone.

The company has said that some of the cars may have been fitted with airbags containing an inflator propellant that could become unstable over time and potentially cause the airbag to deploy with excessive force. This could lead to injuries or even death in the event of a crash.

BMW is working with Takata, the Japanese company that produces the airbags in question, to develop a fix for the problem. The automaker will notify affected owners and schedule free repairs at authorized dealerships as soon as possible.
