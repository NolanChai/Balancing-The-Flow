<p>The boy was caught on CCTV pulling the knife out of the victim's chest and then walking away, leaving the dying man with a large pool of blood.</p><p></p><p>The killer can be seen calmly walking back to his friends after stabbing Mr Bamforth, who was left to die on the floor without any first aid.</p>
<p></p><p>It is understood that he and two others were fighting over a cigarette outside the store in Manchester just before 9pm when they began to argue about money. One of them, believed to be a man known as "Nikky", was seen on CCTV putting a knife into his pocket.</p><p></p><p>A third suspect then pulled out a second knife and tried to hit Mr Bamforth with it - only for the victim to deflect the blow, hitting Nikky in the stomach. It was then that the teenager lunged at him, plunging the blade into his chest.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards he walked away from Mr Bamforth before returning to his friends and calmly asking if they could still get a lift home - with no sign of distress or remorse.</p>
<p></p><p>"He went back to the group, which included two women, and said 'can we still go?' with no reaction whatsoever," said Detective Sergeant James Lomax, who was in charge of the investigation.</p><p></p><p>"There was nothing to show that he had just murdered someone."</p>
<p></p><p>The victim was taken to hospital where medics battled to save him but he died an hour later. The teenager and another suspect were arrested in a house just one street away from the off licence, which is opposite a small parade of shops including a chippy.</p><p></p><p>Police seized several mobile phones as they carried out their investigation into the murder. The two other teenagers have been charged with affray and are due to appear at Manchester Youth Court later this month.</p>
<p></p><p>Yesterday, the victim's brother David Bamforth said his family were devastated by what had happened and that his 50-year-old sibling had been an "inspiration" to them all. He added: "I'll never get over it - he was my only brother."</p><p></p><p>The incident took place in the same street where a man was stabbed and left for dead last year, with police believing that the two incidents were linked.</p><p></p><p>"My son is a good lad but unfortunately he has got himself involved with some bad lads who have caused a lot of trouble," said Mr Bamforth's father David, 72.</p>
<p></p><p>Mr Bamforth was born in Manchester but grew up on the Isle of Wight. He is believed to have had an interest in boxing and wrestling as a teenager before becoming a barman and later working for a waste disposal company.</p><p></p><p>The killer was found guilty after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court last month and sentenced to life behind bars with a minimum term of 18 years. The other two suspects, both aged 17, were convicted on November 24 of affray and are awaiting sentencing.</p><p></p><p>"This has been one of the worst cases I have dealt with," said DS Lomax. "To think that a group of young people could be involved in such a horrific attack is really worrying."</p>
