[This is a sample response](http://www.cnn.com/2011/CRIME/10/28/ohio.death.sentence/)


#### Instructions:
- Create a [conditional statement](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#if-statements) to check if the value of `response` is in the `True` or `False`.
- If the response is `True`, print out "The CNN article has a response" and then print out the URL that we got from the API call.
- If the response is `False`, print out "No response found for CNN."

#### Hint:
- You may want to use `response` in the conditional statement, but you will also need to compare it to a literal value.
- You can use `print()` to output to the terminal.

#### Bonus Challenge:
- How would you have to modify your code if we wanted to get responses for multiple sites?
- If the response is `False`, print out "No response found for CNN and NYT" instead of just "No response found for CNN."

#### Solution:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=cnn&apiKey=1865302e9a9d4d89b47f163cbd5164c9"
response = requests.get(url).json()['articles'][0]['url']

if response:
    print('The CNN article has a response')
    print(response)
else:
    print("No response found for CNN")
```
