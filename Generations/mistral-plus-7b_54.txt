A breathalyser app that can automatically post results to Facebook or Twitter has been launched. While the device is not a replacement for the breath test, it uses the same technology and could provide law enforcement with another tool to enforce the law. The Breathometer smartphone attachment is a small, portable breathalyzer that plugs into the user’s iPhone. It measures their blood alcohol content by using an infrared sensor to measure the amount of ethanol in the user’s breath. When combined with an app, it can be used as a handy tool for monitoring one’s intake of alcohol. The app allows users to keep track of their BAC over time, set goals and receive personalized feedback on their consumption. It also provides helpful tips for staying within the legal limit. In addition to providing a convenient way for individuals to monitor their own BAC levels, the Breathometer can be used by law enforcement as an alternative to traditional breathalyzers. The device is small and portable enough to easily carry and use in any situation. It can provide quick and accurate results that are reliable and easy to interpret. With its unique design and advanced technology, the Breathometer could become a valuable tool for both individuals and law enforcement alike.
