 fast in our relationship and didn't give ourselves enough time to get to know each other better outside of the spotlight. We both agreed that it would be best for us to take a step back and focus on our individual lives for now. I wish Stephanie all the best, and I am looking forward to taking some time for myself and focusing on my personal growth and career.

In terms of any potential future relationships, I'm not rushing into anything at the moment. I have learned a lot from my previous experiences, and I want to take my time to find someone who is truly compatible with me and who I can build a meaningful and lasting relationship with.

I'm also excited about the upcoming season of "Made in Chelsea" and looking forward to seeing how the show unfolds this year. It's always a fun and challenging experience working on the show, and I'm grateful for the opportunity to be a part of it again.

Overall, I am feeling optimistic and excited about what the future holds, both personally and professionally. Thank you for your continued support, and I look forward to sharing more updates with all of you as they come.
