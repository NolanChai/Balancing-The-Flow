Yvette Cooper sparked aÂ  furious row over immigration last night by telling the BBC that "if we do not have more controls on migration then it will be impossible to cut welfare spending". The shadow home secretary said she was not opposed to migration, but that there must be a limit on how many people can come to this country. Speaking on Newsnight, she said: "Migration has been great for our economy and for our society and we should embrace that but I do think it is important that we have proper controls so that we know who comes here, when they come here and why they are coming here. Because if we don't then migration can be out of control."
