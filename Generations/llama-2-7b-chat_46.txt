The mayor of Naas, County Kildare, Ireland, Cllr. Willie Penrose, sparked outrage and controversy last week when he made a statement on social media that he would no longer represent the interests of people of black African origin in his town. Penrose's resignation was met with widespread condemnation from local residents, political leaders, and civil rights groups, who accused him of racism and discrimination.
