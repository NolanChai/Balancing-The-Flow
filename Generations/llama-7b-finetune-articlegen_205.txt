Edin Dzeko will miss out on a £4million move to Inter Milan after his agent suggested the player is more interested in playing for AC Milan than the Italian champions. The 23-year-old striker has been linked with the Serie A club since January but his representatives have now denied any interest from Jose Mourinho’s side, insisting he wants to join Milan instead. Wolfsburg coach Steve McClaren is hopeful Dzeko will stay at VfL Park and build on last season's 26 goals in 48 games that helped them qualify for next season's Champions League. ‘It is not a matter of money,’ his agent, Mujahid Halilovic, told Kicker magazine. ‘For Edin it would be better to play for Milan than Inter because he likes Italy more and the game is played in a different style there.’ Dzeko, who has won 21 caps for Bosnia-Herzegovina, came close to joining Chelsea on transfer deadline day but failed to agree personal terms with the Blues. His agent claimed at the time that the Stamford Bridge club had made an offer which would have seen him earn as much as £100,000 a week . The 23-year-old striker has been linked with the Serie A club since January but his representatives have now denied any interest from Inter Milan and insisted he wants to join AC Milan instead . He was also on target twice for Wolfsburg in their 4-1 Champions League win over FC Twente. It was not a great evening for new coach Steve McClaren, who watched the game from the stands after being handed a two-match touchline ban by UEFA earlier this week. His assistant, Carlos Queiroz, took charge of Wolfsburg instead and was delighted with their performance in front of an empty VfL stadium . Dzeko is due to face a disciplinary hearing on Thursday over an incident during the game against FC Bayern Munich last Sunday when he appeared to shove referee Felix Zwayer. McClaren said: ‘It was just two players talking and there were no words exchanged between them.’ Dzeko was sent off in last season’s Bundesliga clash with Schalke after headbutting goalkeeper Ralf Faehrmann, who is now at FC Koln. It was the Bosnian striker's second sending-off for Wolfsburg and he was suspended for four games as a result . The 23-year-old also netted twice for Bosnia in their opening Euro 2012 qualifier against Estonia last weekend, scoring with his first touch after coming on as a substitute. He could feature against the Netherlands next weekend when Wolfsburg play host to PSV Eindhoven . He was also on target twice for Wolfsburg in their 4-1 Champions League win over FC Twente.

It could be a tough season for McClaren as he faces the challenge of following up his success at Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich. The former England coach is well respected by the players, who have been impressed by his coaching and organisation. Wolfsburg’s new owner, Klaus Allofs, has backed him to the hilt, spending around £8million on new signings. One of them is Dzeko's international teammate Vedad Ibisevic, a former St Etienne player who scored 32 goals in all competitions last season and was loaned out to Marseille by Stuttgart. McClaren said: ‘We will have two very good strikers - Edin is a very complete striker with lots of pace and skill and Vedad has scored so many goals.’ The 31-year-old Bosnian has previously played in France for RC Lens and Le Mans .
