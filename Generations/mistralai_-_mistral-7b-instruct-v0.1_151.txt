 It appears that the article you are referring to was published in 2014 and is about the world's largest-selling cigarette brand, Marlboro, being under fire for various reasons.

One major concern raised against Marlboro is its heavy advertising campaign in developing countries where smoking rates are high. The company has been accused of promoting smoking among vulnerable populations who may not fully understand the risks associated with smoking. Additionally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has criticized Marlboro for targeting young people and low-income groups with its marketing efforts.

Another issue facing Marlboro is the increasing popularity of e-cigarettes and other alternative nicotine products. While these products are often marketed as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes, some concerns have been raised about their potential risks and long-term effects on human health. Marlboro has been accused of trying to suppress the growth of the e-cigarette market by engaging in anti-competitive practices.

Finally, there have been calls for greater regulation of the tobacco industry as a whole, with some advocates arguing that companies like Marlboro should be held more accountable for their marketing and advertising practices. The WHO has called for stricter tobacco control measures, including increased taxes on cigarettes, bans on smoking in public places, and restrictions on advertising and sponsorships.

Overall, the article suggests that Marlboro is facing a range of challenges related to its business practices and the changing landscape of the tobacco industry. While it remains to be seen how these issues will play out in the coming years, one thing is clear: the world's largest-selling brand of cigarette is under significant pressure to adapt and evolve in response to changing consumer preferences and regulatory environments.
