(CNN) -- Waving and cheering like survivors of some kind of disaster, 200 guests of a Hong Kong business hotel who were confined for a week due to a swine flu scare left the building Friday.

The outbreak had begun when a young American tourist staying at the Metropark Hotel in Kowloon tested positive for influenza A (H1N1), commonly known as swine flu. The virus has killed more than 600 people worldwide since it was first detected in Mexico in April, according to the World Health Organization.

The hotel was sealed off and guests were not allowed to leave. Hong Kong officials said Friday that the situation had been contained after all of the hotel's remaining guests were tested for swine flu and found not to have the virus.
