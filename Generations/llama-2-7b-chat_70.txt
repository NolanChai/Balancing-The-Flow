It seemed that turtle was definitely on the menu when one was cornered by two giant crocodiles. But little did they know, their savage predators were not the only ones with a taste for the slow-moving creature. As the sun began to set on the banks of the river, a group of sly otters snuck up behind the pair of crocs and made off with the turtle, leaving them to their dinner. The otters, known for their cunning and stealth, had been watching the scene unfold from afar, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. With their prize in hand, they swam quickly downstream, disappearing into the dense vegetation that lined the river's edge. The crocodiles, realizing too late what had happened, were left to contemplate their failure and vow revenge on the sly otters.
