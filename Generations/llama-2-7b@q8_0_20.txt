1. Colchester (/ˈkɒl.tʃɛstər/ or /ˈkoʊlstər/) is the largest town in Essex, England and a major settlement within the Borough of Colchester. It had an urban population of 75,066 at the 2011 Census,[3] while the total district population was 203,849.
Colchester has Roman roots, having been occupied by the Romans since their invasion of Britain in AD 43 and granted its first known municipal charter by King Edgar in AD 969.[5][6] During the Middle Ages, Colchester had several particular ecclesiastical functions, including being a diocesan see and the location of England's only cathedral chapter founded by Augustinian canons. The town was involved in many historic events, including being the last Roman capital, one of the earliest centres of Christianity, and having been sieged twice during the 17th century.[5] Colchester was granted city status in 2021 as part of the Queen's Platinum Jubilee celebrations.
