Myanmar, like many countries around the world, is undergoing an economic reform process that is creating more prosperity for some but also fueling inflation. Aung's sale of his house may have been a smart financial move but it was not the only choice he faced. In the past, selling land was often illegal in Myanmar and even if someone could sell their house, they often couldn't spend the money because of strict currency controls.
Aung has some options for what to do with his proceeds -- he can invest in a business or pay off debts, which he told CNN would be the best use of his money. But like many people in Myanmar, Aung will have to deal with how much inflation is eroding any profits that he makes and how to cope when prices go up, sometimes quickly, on basic necessities like food or water.
