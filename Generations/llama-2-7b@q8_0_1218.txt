+ The Coliseum was originally built for gladiatorial contests, not as a tourist attraction (and most certainly not so that it could be viewed via a Google Street View). So if it starts to collapse from the weight of snow, let them fall. It's no tragedy.
+ Snow is good for Rome. If we have no snow we have no water and the Romans had no other source except snow which they collected and melted down in these huge pools. I wonder how it would look now if they had all those pools still intact, as the ancient Romans did?
+ This is one of those things that you hear about happening in a third world country, but never here...
+ It's just another sign of global warming. The glaciers are melting and this snow will melt as well!
