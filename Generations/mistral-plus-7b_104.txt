Gunmen killed two Egyptian military personnel and injured a third when security forces raided a militant hideout on Wednesday, the Interior Ministry said. The raid was part of ongoing operations against militants in the Sinai Peninsula, where an Islamist insurgency has been gaining strength in recent years. The gunmen opened fire on the soldiers as they were approaching the building, prompting them to return fire and ultimately killing two of the attackers. The third soldier was injured in the exchange of gunfire. The raid took place in the town of Sheikh Zuweid, located in northern Sinai near the border with Gaza. The area has seen an increase in militant activity over the past few years as Islamist extremists have carried out a series of attacks against Egyptian security forces and civilians. The government has responded by launching military operations to crack down on the insurgency, but the violence shows no signs of abating.
