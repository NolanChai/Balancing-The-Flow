Mr. and Mrs. Welch both went to court last month after Mr. Welch was found guilty of driving an uninsured vehicle, but they did not attend the case because of a misunderstanding about whether he had insurance or not . Mr. Welch said he borrowed his friend's car but believed that his wife would cover him if there was any problems as she had done in previous cases . The magistrate accepted that and gave no punishment to either party . Lizzie Edmonds, a spokesman for the local council told reporters Mr. Welch has been given two weeks to produce evidence about the car being insured before he will face charges of driving uninsured . He also faces penalties if it is proved that he borrowed his friend's car without permission . She added: "This is an unusual case and we have never dealt with anything like this before"
