 That's correct! In the event of a building fire, time is indeed of the essence. First responders, such as firefighters and emergency medical services (EMS), are trained to prioritize swift action to minimize damage and save lives. They follow established protocols for firefighting and rescue operations, which include assessing the situation, containing the fire, rescuing occupants if necessary, and providing medical aid if needed.

It's essential for building occupants to have a well-practiced emergency escape plan, including knowing multiple exit routes, assembling at designated meeting points, and staying low to the ground when evacuating, due to hot gases rising during a fire. Regular fire drills and safety education can help ensure everyone is prepared in case of an emergency.

Additionally, building owners and managers should maintain fire safety measures such as working smoke detectors, fire alarms, sprinkler systems, and properly functioning fire extinguishers to minimize the risk of a fire spreading or causing significant damage.
