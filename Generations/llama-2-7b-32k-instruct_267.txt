A Tibetan man has been arrested for projecting the words "Free Tibet" and "Dalai Lama" onto the exterior wall of China's embassy. The protestor, who was identified as Tashi Dhondup, used a digital projector to display the images on 15th Street NW in Washington DC on Monday evening, in what was described by Amnesty International as "a peaceful act of defiance". According to Reuters, police responded quickly, arresting the protestor before he could complete his statement. Dhondup is due to appear in court tomorrow. The 25-year-old's protest comes just days after three young Tibetan activists were arrested for displaying a banned image of the Dalai Lama in Hong Kong. In Beijing, meanwhile, police have also detained at least four people who tried to protest in memory of those killed by Chinese forces during last year's failed uprising in Tibet. The three young activists were arrested as they tried to display a banned image of the Dalai Lama outside Hong Kong's police headquarters on Friday. According to AFP, officers bundled them into a waiting minibus and detained them for questioning at their office . Chinese authorities are currently hosting a five-day meeting with representatives from 19 countries, including Britain, Canada, France and the United States, in a bid to find "peaceful resolutions" to conflicts in Syria and Myanmar.
