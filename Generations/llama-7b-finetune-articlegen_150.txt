From Vladimir Putin as International Man of the Year to Kim Jong-Un as Humanitarian of the Year, a tongue-in-cheek list of GQ Awards' winner's have been revealed. The annual awards are handed out by the magazine in London and feature some rather surprising nominees. Among the winners are Russian President Vladimir Putin as International Man of the Year, US Secretary of State John Kerry as Political Leader of the Year and Kim Jong-Un as Humanitarian of the Year. Scroll down for video . Tongue-in-cheek: A tongue-in cheek list of GQ Awards' winner's has been revealed including Vladimir Putin, Kim Jon-un and John Kerry . The list of winners was compiled by editor Dylan Jones who said: 'I decided to give the awards this year as a sort of gift. 'This is not a joke; it’s actually the award-winners.' However, his tongue in cheek comment on Kim Jong-un's humanitarian win left many feeling unimpressed. GQ editor Dylan Jones said: 'He (Kim) has to be a humanitarian because of everything he’s doing for people and their livelihoods.' Many were uncomfortable with his nomination as the North Korean leader is infamous for starving his own people into submission and brutally murdering anyone who speaks out against him. One person tweeted: 'Kim Jong Un wins humanitarian of year award, it's a joke right?!' Another user asked how could such an appalling nomination be allowed to take place. They wrote: 'How on earth did Kim Jong-un win the GQ Award for Humanitarian of the Year?' However, many people were happy about Putin and Kerry receiving the awards. One person said: 'Good to see that Kerry's received an award.' Another user wrote: 'Vladimir Putin International Man of the Year! He can do no wrong in the eyes of GQ!' Jones explained how his annual list was put together with his fellow editorial team members. He told The Huffington Post UK: 'We compile it, we choose the winners, and then we invite all our friends to a dinner where we announce the awards. It is absolutely not a joke; it’s actually the award-winners.' But the North Korean leader's nomination for GQ magazine's top prize has been condemned by human rights organisations with Amnesty International calling for him to be tried in an international court. A spokesman said: 'Kim Jong Un has presided over a brutal campaign of torture, repression and crimes against humanity that have left the country traumatised.' The list also includes some well known faces in the film industry with Leonardo Di Caprio named as best actor for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street. Channing Tatum and Scarlett Johansson were both named as Best Actor and Best Actress respectively while Michael Fassbender won the title of Breakthrough of the Year. Scroll down for video .
