 It seems that John Terry, the captain of Chelsea FC, expressed his feelings about the absence of Frank Lampard, who was formerly Chelsea's vice-captain. According to Terry, it felt strange to return for preseason training without Lampard around. Additionally, Terry mentioned that he is not fond of seeing Lampard in a Manchester City kit, as Lampard now plays for the Sky Blues. This sentiment likely stems from their strong bond and shared history at Chelsea FC.
