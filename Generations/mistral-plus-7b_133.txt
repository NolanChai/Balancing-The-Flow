The family living on a busy road have called for the speed limit to be reduced following a string of accidents that have left them fearing for their safety. The residents, who live close to junction 45 of the A30, say drivers regularly exceed the current limit of 60mph and are putting pedestrians at risk. They want the speed limit reduced to 50mph in order to make it safer for those crossing the road, especially children walking to school. The familyâ€™s concerns have been echoed by local residents, who say that the high speed of traffic poses a threat to them and their loved ones. In response, Cornwall Council has agreed to review the speed limit on this stretch of road and will be conducting a full road safety audit in order to determine whether a lower speed limit would improve safety for all those using it. The council hopes that by reducing the speed limit they can create a safer environment for everyone who lives and travels along this busy road.
