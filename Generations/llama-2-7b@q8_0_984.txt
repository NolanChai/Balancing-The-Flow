### Explanation:
The family of South African jazz musician Hugh Masekela, who passed away this week, was named after the first leader of the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team.
Hugh Masekela's father, Harry, and grandfather, Solomon Kuti, were both jazz musicians in Johannesburg at a time when jazz had begun to take off in South Africa.
In 1953, as Hugh Masekela was beginning his career, the first leader of the Harlem Globetrotters basketball team was named Nelson "Shrimp" Kuti. His given name was actually Nelson "Gabby" Kuti but he took the surname Shrimp when he joined the Globetrotters because a previous player already used that moniker.
Hugh Masekela's grandfather Solomon was one of five brothers, and all had careers in jazz. The other four were named after Nelson. They were Joe, Teddy, Harry and John.
