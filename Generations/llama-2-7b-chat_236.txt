As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, a new report has revealed that the global population is expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, up from 7.9 billion in 2020. This rapid growth is being driven by several factors, including improved medical care and sanitation, as well as increased food production and distribution. However, experts are warning that this population boom could lead to significant environmental degradation and resource shortages if not managed properly.
