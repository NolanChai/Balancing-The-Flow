 that he first encountered a kangaroo. According to John Oddie, a former Australian Defense Force member who spent almost four decades in service, his initial encounter with a kangaroo was a memorable experience from his childhood growing up on rural land in Victoria.

John, now an accomplished wildlife photographer, shared that the encounter took place when he was just five years old while exploring the family farm. He vividly remembered the moment of awe and curiosity as he watched the large marsupial hop across the open field. This early experience with Australia's unique wildlife played a significant role in his lifelong passion for capturing and preserving the beauty of Australian flora and fauna through his photography.

Throughout his military career, John found ways to stay connected to nature, documenting various landscapes and animals during his travels around the world. Upon retiring from the Defense Forces, he dedicated himself fully to wildlife photography, capturing stunning images of Australia's diverse native species, including kangaroos, koalas, and emus.

John's work has been exhibited in galleries across Australia, showcasing his unique perspective on these iconic creatures and the landscapes they inhabit. His passion for photography not only serves as a tribute to his rural roots but also aims to raise awareness about conservation efforts and the importance of preserving Australia's biodiversity for future generations.
