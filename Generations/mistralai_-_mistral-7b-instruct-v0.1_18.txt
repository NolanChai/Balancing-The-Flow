 It looks like you are sharing a recent news article about the suspension of New York Yankees pitcher Michael Pineda for using pine tar on the mound. This type of behavior is considered unfair and against the rules of baseball, as it gives an advantage to the player who uses it. The Major League Baseball (MLB) has strict rules about what can and cannot be used in order to ensure fair play for all players. Pineda's suspension sends a clear message that these rules are taken seriously, and that players who violate them will face consequences.
