According to a recent study published in the journal "Food and Behavior," researchers found that people are more likely to indulge in unhealthy foods and drinks when they're traveling, especially on planes. The study surveyed over 1,000 adults and found that 75% of them reported consuming more alcohol while flying than they would at home. Additionally, 60% of respondents said they were more likely to order unhealthy snacks like chips or candy on a plane compared to when they're not traveling. So why do we tend to let our dietary habits go out the window when we hit 30,000 feet? According to the study's lead author, Dr. Kathryn L. Bradley, it may have something to do with the stress and monotony of air travel. "When you're flying, there's not a lot to do other than eat and drink," she explained. "People are looking for ways to cope with the stress and boredom of traveling."
