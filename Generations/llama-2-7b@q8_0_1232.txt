-1 : I think it is unnatural for people to get hurt or killed due to the natural world. If anything, we should be trying to keep humans from getting harmed by nature. If people are being killed because of dust storms or hurricanes or floods or earthquakes then that shows that something isn't right about our current society. It is not a good sign that people are dying due to natural disasters, instead we should be finding ways to prevent these deaths by creating new technology and inventions so that they will never happen again. If anyone dies as a result of the natural world it shows how much more work needs to be done in order for us all to live in harmony with our planet rather than trying to subjugate it as many people are doing nowadays because they want money or power over everything else including life itself.
