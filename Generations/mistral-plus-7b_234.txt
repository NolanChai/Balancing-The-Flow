Tourists are increasingly coming into contact with dingoes on Fraser Island, and their presence is having dangerous consequences. With the increase in visitors to the island comes an increased risk of dingo attacks. The popularity of selfies with these animals has only exacerbated this problem. Visitors should be aware of the potential risks when interacting with wild dingoes and take steps to minimize their chances of encountering one.

Dingoes are wild animals and can be unpredictable. They’re attracted by food and may approach if they think there’s a chance of getting some. When this happens, it puts tourists at risk for an attack. Visitors should never feed or encourage dingoes to approach them. If you see a dingo near you on the island, stay calm and move away slowly.

In order to reduce the likelihood of a dingo attack, it’s important for visitors to Fraser Island to follow some simple safety guidelines:

- Keep food locked up securely in your accommodation or vehicle at all times.
- Don’t leave garbage unattended.
- Stay on designated trails and campgrounds.
- Keep a safe distance from dingoes.
