 It seems like you're referring to a news story about Dami Im, the South Korean-born Australian singer who won The X Factor Australia in 2013. However, your statement about her family crossing the restricted North Korean border isn't accurate to my knowledge. Dami Im was born and raised in South Korea before moving to Australia, but there hasn't been any reported incident of her family crossing the North Korean border. If you have a specific news article or source that mentions this, I would be happy to help clarify further!
