As the economy continues to struggle and budgets remain tight, many people may be tempted to give up their dreams of owning a boat this summer. However, there are plenty of affordable alternatives to traditional boating that can provide just as much fun without the high cost. From stand-up paddle boarding to kayaking, there are many ways to enjoy the water without breaking the bank. Stand-up paddle boarding is a relatively new sport that has quickly become popular due to its accessibility and affordability. It requires very little gear and can be enjoyed in almost any body of water. Kayaking is another great option for those on a budget as kayaks are relatively inexpensive and provide an excellent way to explore rivers, lakes, and other bodies of water.
