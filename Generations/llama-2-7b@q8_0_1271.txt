These astonishing images show a traditional Indian buffalo race held in an Indian village following the annual harvest festival.
The village of Kheda, in Gujarat, India, plays host to the event where villagers run along a track littered with sharp cow dung to avoid being trampled by the speeding bulls.
The race is said to bring good luck for the next year and attracts people from all over the nearby area. The village of Kheda has been holding buffalo races since 2009 after it was revived by a local businessman who wanted to breathe new life into the tradition, which he hoped would draw in tourists to his resort in the area.
The winner receives money and a feathered cap from the village chief and the losing animals are given gifts of rice and milk.
