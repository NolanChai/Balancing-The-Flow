An aristocratâ€™s son has died while in police custody in Kenya after being arrested for allegedly assaulting a traffic warden.

Daniel Craig, the 20-year-old heir to an English country estate, suffered from head injuries and was taken to hospital where he later died.

Kenyan police claim that he had been drinking heavily before getting into a dispute with a traffic warden over a parking ticket.

The incident took place in the early hours of Thursday morning outside a nightclub in Nairobi, after Craig reportedly assaulted a policeman who was trying to stop him driving his car while intoxicated.

He was arrested and taken into custody but later died at the police station from injuries he sustained during the altercation.

The officer involved has been suspended pending an investigation.
