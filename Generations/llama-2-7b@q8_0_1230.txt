| 1 | 𝒞(𝑘,𝐶) = 2.649085e-37 &amp; 𝒟(𝑘,𝐶) = 2.649085e-37 | 𝒞 and 𝒟 are the same for this case. |
| 2 | 𝒞(𝑘,𝐶) = -1.943229 &amp; 𝒟(𝑘,𝐶) = 0 | This is the only one where the probability and the likelihood are not equal. I think this happened because of how I calculated it: I did 𝒞(𝑘,𝐶)/𝐵 and then took the reciprocal to get 𝒟(𝑘,𝐶). However, this was incorrect. I should have done 𝑖(𝑘)/𝑛 instead. |
| 3 | 𝒞(𝑘,𝐶) = -2.604178e-37 &amp; 𝒟(𝑘,𝐶) = -9.939714e-35 | 𝒞 and 𝒟 are different in this case. The probability is higher than the likelihood by quite a bit, which surprised me. This may be because of rounding errors when I calculated them. |
| 4 | 𝒞(𝑘,𝐶) = -2.793150e-38 &amp; 𝒟(𝑘,𝐶) = -6.178396e-35 | I've checked and made sure that everything is the same as it was in 3 except that I didn't round my numbers for some reason this time! |
