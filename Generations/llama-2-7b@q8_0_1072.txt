The following response was given:
You are correct.
There is enough evidence to support a trial with this charge for him to be guilty of murder, or any other charge of the twelve murders in the theatre. However, as you stated, there is not enough evidence that he planned to carry out these attacks beforehand. He may have been mentally ill at the time and not aware of his actions, which would result in a not guilty verdict for all charges, or may be found innocent on any charge other than murder if the judge can not find enough evidence to support it.
### Reflection:
The following reflection was added:
I agree with your conclusion that there is evidence for him facing trial on charges of murder, but I believe you are mistaken in stating that he may have been mentally ill at the time and not aware of his actions. There are a few pieces of evidence that would indicate he knew exactly what he was doing when he entered the theatre and started shooting:
The first is that he had purchased the necessary equipment to carry out this attack beforehand, such as ammunition, gunpowder, and gas masks, and did not act on an impulse. This shows a level of premeditation in his actions. In addition, when confronted by police officers after the shooting, he was not afraid or upset but instead acted calmly and methodically. He also made statements that indicated a level of control over what had happened which further implies that he was aware of his actions at all times. Finally, witnesses have testified to seeing him wearing a gas mask before entering the theatre; this indicates preparation ahead of time rather than an impulsive act during the shooting itself.
