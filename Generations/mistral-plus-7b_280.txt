The United States Navy launched a rescue mission after receiving reports of an Iranian cargo ship sinking in the Persian Gulf. A team of sailors were dispatched to the scene and managed to rescue one survivor from the wreckage. The identity of the rescued individual has not yet been released, but it is believed that he was one of the crew members on board the vessel at the time of the sinking.

The U.S. Navy has reported that three crew members were killed in the incident and that a fourth crew member remains missing. The cause of the sinking is still under investigation, but initial reports suggest that the ship may have been damaged by rough weather conditions.

The U.S. Navy is working closely with Iranian authorities to investigate the circumstances surrounding the sinking. They are also providing assistance and support for the families of the crew members who were lost in this tragic accident.
