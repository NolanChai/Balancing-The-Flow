An 'aliens' planet believed to be up to five times bigger than Jupiter has been detected 300 light years from Earth. The newly found planet, known as Kepler-78b is just one percent of the mass of its giant solar system neighbour but it still orbits its star in a mere five and a half earth days. Astronomers believe that this makes Kepler-78b the smallest known exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star, and may also make it the fastest moving planet ever found. Discovery: This image of Kepler-78b was released by NASA on Wednesday to mark the announcement of its discovery . The findings were announced in a press release from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. It reads: 'The new world is the smallest exoplanet orbiting a Sun-like star, and it may also be one of the fastest moving planets ever discovered.' A statement added: 'Because this tiny planet circles its parent star so quickly, it's likely that Kepler-78b has a strong attraction to the star. The tiny planet is so close to its parent star that if it orbited Earth instead of Kepler-78A, it would be inside Mercury's orbit.' Scientists believe that the extreme gravity on Kepler-78b could have stripped away much of its atmosphere and water. Dr Jerome Orosz, a researcher from San Francisco State University who led the project said: 'Because this tiny planet is so close to its parent star it's likely that Kepler-78b has a strong attraction to its star - this may be one of the fastest moving planets we have discovered.' Dr Orosz, whose team used NASA's Kepler space telescope and the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii to make their discovery added: 'The tiny planet is so close to its parent star that if it orbited Earth instead of Kepler-78A, it would be inside Mercury's orbit.' Dr Orosz's team also announced the detection of four other planets with sizes similar to Jupiter but at much larger distances from their stars. The four exoplanetary worlds are known as Kepler-19b, 21c, 35b and 47d - all orbiting Sun-like stars and described in a separate paper released by the journal Science . Another newly detected alien planet, known as Kepler-10b is thought to be three times more massive than Jupiter. The findings were announced on Wednesday at an American Astronomical Society conference in San Diego. Kepler-78b orbits its star once every 5.5 Earth days - just a fifth of the time it takes Mercury to complete one revolution around our Sun. According to NASA, this 'makes it by far the fastest known planetary orbit'. The discovery was made using data collected from NASA's Kepler space telescope between December 2009 and February 2013. In total, the study included 165 candidates that were eventually confirmed as planets. One of them is Kepler-78b - the first exoplanet with a five day orbit ever discovered. The new planet orbits its star every five days at an average distance of just over seven million miles (12 million kilometres). This makes it smaller than Jupiter but larger than Mercury which takes 88 Earth days to complete one revolution around our Sun.

NASA said that 'Kepler-78b orbits its star every 5.5 Earth days - just a fifth of the time it takes Mercury to complete one revolution around our Sun.' This means that its mass must be very small relative to other giant planets discovered so far. Dr Orosz's team also announced the detection of four other planets with sizes similar to Jupiter but at much larger distances from their stars. They are known as Kepler-19b, 21c, 35b and 47d and they orbit Sun-like stars described in a paper released by the journal Science on Wednesday . In a separate statement, NASA said: 'Kepler-78 is one of only two stars known to host multiple super Earths. The other star hosts four planets with sizes between three and six times that of Earth.' Kepler-78b was discovered using data collected from the first 165 candidates that were eventually confirmed as planets . The planet orbits its parent sun once every 5.5 Earth days - making it by far the fastest moving planet ever found according to NASA scientists . According to researchers, Kepler-78 is located about 300 light years from our Solar System. This means that if you could travel at a speed of one million miles per hour (1.6 million km/h), it would take approximately 54.2 thousand years to reach the planet . It will likely take astronomers another couple of days until all details about Kepler-78b are released to the public. NASA's Kepler space telescope has discovered more than 130 exoplanets since its launch in 2009. The US space agency plans to end its mission this fall, after detecting nearly half of its original goal - 1,700 new planets. The findings were announced at an American Astronomical Society conference on Wednesday . 'Kepler-78 is one of only two stars known to host multiple super Earths,' NASA said . The newly discovered planetary world orbits a star much smaller than the Sun with a mass about 63 percent that of our own star. It has been described as an orange dwarf star and it is located about 300 light years from our Solar System. This means that if you could travel at a speed of one million miles per hour (1.6 million km/h), it would take approximately 54.2 thousand years to reach the planet .

NASA said: 'Because this tiny planet is so close to its parent star it's likely that Kepler-78b has a strong attraction to the star - this may be one of the fastest moving planets we have discovered.' According to researchers, the exoplanetary world is believed to be 25 percent more massive than Jupiter but only 1.6 times its radius - making it by far the smallest known planet orbiting a Sun-like star in our galaxy . The newly discovered exoplanetary world was named after its parent sun - Kepler-78 (illustrated). It has been described as an orange dwarf star. According to researchers, Kepler-78 is located about 300 light years from Earth. This means that if you could travel at a speed of one million miles per hour (1.6 million km/h), it would take approximately 54.2 thousand years to reach the planet . According to NASA's calculations, Kepler-78 is located about 300 light years from Earth . The star was first observed in 2012 by researchers using data collected from the WISE mission that scanned the entire sky for signs of infrared emissions . Researchers used a variety of telescopes to confirm their findings and study the newly detected planetary body. This includes NASA's Kepler space telescope, the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii as well as other facilities around the world . The star was first observed by researchers using data collected from the WISE mission that scanned the entire sky for signs of infrared emissions . According to researchers, the star was identified as a candidate planetary host back in 2011. It was then studied using several telescopes including NASA's Kepler space telescope, the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii as well as other facilities around the world . In addition, Kepler-78 is believed to be about two billion years old and it spins so fast that a day on it lasts only four hours. It is also a member of a class of stars called red dwarfs - small and low mass stars that are very common in our galaxy. These include some of the oldest, coolest and smallest stars known to science . Kepler-78's star was identified as a candidate planetary host back in 2011.
