Tyson Fury is a 30 year old Irish-English professional boxer who currently holds the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO, IBO, The Ring and lineal heavyweight titles since defeating Wladimir Klitschko on 28th November 2015.

The former unified world heavyweight champion is known for his physical strength and possesses a high level of technical skill which he has utilised to great effect throughout his career. This was exemplified by the victory over Klitschko, where Fury showed he could adapt his game in order to out-box ‘Dr Steelhammer’ on occasion whilst still relying upon his trademark power punching as and when required.

Fury has stated that he is a naturally gifted boxer who trains hard but can fight intelligently too, citing his performance against Klitschko as an example of this: ‘I think my boxing ability is better than my physicality. I’m a very intelligent man and I know how to use my intelligence in the ring.’
