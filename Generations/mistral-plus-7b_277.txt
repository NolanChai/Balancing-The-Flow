If not for the Bible, the bullets would have gone right through his heart. Instead, as he fell to the ground, a piece of Scripture stuck out from under the jacket he was wearing. The police officers who shot him stopped and looked at it, then called their supervisor. As they knelt beside the dying man, one officer read the passage aloud: “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.”

The man had just been shot in the heart by police officers who were trying to subdue him after he’d tried to grab their guns. But before they could shoot him again, he pulled out the Bible and flashed it at them, showing that he was unarmed. They stopped and called for backup. It turned out that this man had been trying to help stop a robbery in progress and had been shot by the suspects while chasing after them. When the police arrived, he’d tried to get close enough to grab their guns so they could stop the criminals. He had saved lives with his bravery and faith.
