- The police are out of line and have been given too much leeway in using force against people.
- Police brutality is an ongoing problem in the US, where people with mental illness often end up dying instead of getting help.
- Police officers are trained to shoot first and ask questions later, which leads to a lot of unnecessary deaths.
- Police should be more careful when dealing with people who are mentally ill, as it can lead to tragic results.
### Alternative:
- The police should do more training on how to deal with people who are mentally ill or have a history of violence so that these kinds of situations don't happen in the future.
- Police officers need better tools for defending themselves when they are faced with an armed suspect, such as tasers and batons instead of guns which can be easily misused by officers under stressful conditions (e.g., after being attacked by someone wielding a knife).
