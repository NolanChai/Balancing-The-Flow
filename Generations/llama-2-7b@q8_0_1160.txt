I can tell that you are a true fan of Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) with your strong support on their players even though they have not yet won any trophies in recent seasons. I hope you will continue your support for PSG and be patient when the time comes for them to win the champions league in the future.

### Expected Answer:
I am glad that you are still supporting PSG despite their poor results recently, but I am afraid they might not have a good performance this season either if we look back at the history of other French clubs such as AS Monaco or Olympique Marseilles who were once champions but now have lost most of its titles to foreign teams like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich.
