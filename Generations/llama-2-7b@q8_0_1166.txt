(CNN) -- A Washington state lawmaker says he's received threats from parents of kids who attended an event where someone with measles was present.

### Confirmation:
(Washington Post) -- The Clark County, Wash., man who had a confirmed case of measles is one of 19 people in the state to have contracted the virus so far this year, public health officials announced Monday. That means Washington will set another record for cases in a single year, according to the Washington State Department of Health (DOH).
