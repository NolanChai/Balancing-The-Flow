The new version of Gorilla Glass, called Gorilla Glass 6, is just 0.1mm thick and offers four times the touch sensitivity of its predecessor, according to a company spokesperson. The new glass is designed to provide better durability and resistance to damage from drops and bumps, making it ideal for devices that are often used on the go.
"We're thrilled to unveil Gorilla Glass 6, which takes our industry-leading toughness to the next level," said John T.K. Chan, CEO of Corning Incorporated, in a statement. "With its thinner and more touch-sensitive design, this new version of Gorilla Glass is poised to revolutionize the way people interact with their devices."
The company claims that the new glass will be available in smartphones and other devices as soon as next month.
