The UK's coldest weather for more than two years is due to hit next week. The freezing temperatures will bring wintry showers and snow, with up to one inch expected across the country. Temperatures could drop by 15 degrees Celsius (6C) between today and Wednesday, as a huge cold front sweeps across the UK from Greenland. It is expected to be coldest on Sunday, when temperatures will fall by four degrees Celsius in one day. The freezing weather is expected to last for about five days. There will also be strong winds of 40mph (64kph) that could bring gale force winds to some areas. It will feel much colder than this and will cause travel disruption with snow and ice in places. The weather will improve on Friday, but will remain cold for the next week. This is due to a high pressure system over the UK bringing settled conditions for at least five days, bringing cool air from Greenland. The last time such freezing temperatures were seen was two years ago when it hit minus 9C (15F). A Met Office spokesman said: 'We are looking at low temperatures in parts of the UK with winds gusting up to around 40mph making it feel colder than this.' (dailymail.co.uk)
