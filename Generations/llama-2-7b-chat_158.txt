Libraries should pay authors a fair sum each time they lend out an e-book or writers will go bust, according to Harriet Arkell. As the head of the Society of Authors, Arkell believes that the current system of lending e-books without payment is unsustainable and could lead to the demise of many authors. "We cannot continue to rely on the goodwill of libraries," she said. "They need to find a way to fairly compensate authors for their work."
Arkell argues that paying authors a small fee each time an e-book is lent out would not only be fair, but also help to sustain the writing industry as a whole. "Without financial support from libraries, many authors will struggle to make ends meet," she said. "It's crucial that we find a solution that works for everyone involved."
The issue of e-book lending has been a contentious one in recent years, with some arguing that it is unfair to pay authors for work that is borrowed digitally rather than physically. However, Arkell believes that this argument is flawed. "Just because an e-book isn't physically loaned doesn't mean it's not valuable," she said. "In fact, many authors rely on e-book sales to make a living, so it's crucial that they are fairly compensated."
As the debate around e-book lending continues, Arkell's call for fair compensation for authors is likely to gather momentum. With the rise of digital publishing, it's more important than ever that writers are able to make a living from their work, and paying them a fair sum each time an e-book is lent out seems like a simple yet effective way to achieve this goal.
