Mayor Alan Farrell of Celbridge, County Kildare, said on Facebook that he could not represent the "large number" of black Africans living in the area because they have different values than the rest of the community.
Farrell posted the statement Monday and then apologized for his comments later the same day.
He wrote that "as a result of my post, I have resigned as Mayor of Celbridge."
