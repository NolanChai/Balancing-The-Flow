 The United Nations Security Council held a rare meeting on Thursday with heads of state, including US President Joe Biden, to adopt a resolution aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons. This marks the first time in history that a US president has led such a gathering. The resolution, which was adopted unanimously by all 15 council members, includes measures to strengthen existing non-proliferation agreements and to enhance global cooperation in this area. The meeting comes as concerns about North Korea's nuclear weapons program continue to grow, with recent tests of ballistic missiles and the apparent production of highly enriched uranium.
