Corinna Scott, the wife of murdered British businessman Neil Heywood, has said that she was not allowed to attend his funeral and was only informed of his death after it happened.

Scott told The Times of London that her husband’s body had been taken to China without any family members being present, despite the fact that he lived there for many years and had close friends in the country. She said she was not allowed to attend his funeral or cremate his ashes because of the ongoing police investigation into his death.

Scott also claimed that she only found out about her husband’s death after it happened, when she received a call from a Chinese friend who told her what had happened. The news came as a shock to Scott, who said she was devastated by her husband’s death and felt powerless to do anything about it.

Neil Heywood was found dead in November 2011 in Chongqing, China. His body was discovered in his hotel room with traces of cyanide in his system. Chinese police concluded that he had died from a drug overdose and no one has been charged with his murder.
