In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that the bi-sexual affair between General Petraeus and his mistress, Paula Broadwell, was orchestrated by none other than former President Bill Clinton himself. According to sources close to the investigation, Clinton had been secretly funding Broadwell's research on military history in an effort to distract from his own infidelity scandal that rocked Washington in the 1990s.
As it turns out, Petraeus and Broadwell first crossed paths during a 2010 visit to Afghanistan, where Clinton was also present for a meeting with top military officials. Sources say that the former President was immediately smitten with Broadwell's intelligence and ambition, and began secretly funding her research in order to keep her close.
Clinton's motives for involving himself in the affair are still unclear, but many believe he saw an opportunity to create a diversion from his own past indiscretions. The news has left many Americans shocked and confused, as Clinton had long been considered a champion of women's rights and gender equality.
Meanwhile, Petraeus' resignation has sparked a flurry of speculation about who will replace him at the CIA, with several high-profile candidates emerging as potential successors. Among them is former NSA head Michael Hayden, who has been mentioned as a possible replacement for Petraeus.
