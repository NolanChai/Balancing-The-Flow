The New York Knicks were given a timely boost when their star player Carmelo Anthony boarded the flight to London for their game against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday. However, it is unclear whether he will make it in time. Anthony had been seen at the NBA All-Star Weekend in Houston on Saturday, but did not play in the game at Toyota Center that day, and was last sighted in New York City on Tuesday afternoon. His teammate JR Smith also missed out on the trip due to his mother's death - a matter which has been compounded by Anthony's late arrival. Meanwhile, Bucks forward Kris Middleton was ruled out of the game for 'personal reasons'. The Knicks were not sure if he will be replaced in their line-up before tip off at 11am EST on Thursday morning and they are not expected to arrive into London until Wednesday.
