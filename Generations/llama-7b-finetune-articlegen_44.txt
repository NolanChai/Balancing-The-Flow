Conor McGregor delivered on his promise to stop Duustin Poireer in the first round and his inexporable rise continues with a fourth consecutive victory at UFC 178 in Las Vegas. The Irishman was not intimidated by his opponent's punching power, nor by his boasts on the scales this morning, as he unleashed a devastating combination from the start of their featherweight clash and never looked back. The 26-year-old former Cage Warriors champion improved to 15 wins in 17 career bouts and claimed that the biggest names in MMA will be lining up for him next after a stunning display at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Saturday night. McGregor, who had a brief spell of inactivity last year before coming back with two dominant performances to take his place among the UFC's elite featherweights, told The Irish Sun: 'I am one step ahead of everybody and it will always stay that way.'

The Irishman was unleashing a flurry of punches from the off against Dustin Poirieer at UFC 178 in Las Vegas and never looked back as he won by TKO . 'I am not going to be getting any lower. I'm only going up from here. People are still looking up.' The fight with Poirer was the highlight of Saturday night, but it wasn’t always the main event on the cards in the early stages after an injury to Ronda Rousey forced a change in plans for her bout with Alexis Davis. But when McGregor and Poireier stepped into the ring for their light-weight tussle the fans were already fully enthralled. The opening seconds of their fight were marked by some ferocious blows from the Irishman, as he sent his opponent stumbling across the canvas. It was all too much for the American, who dropped to his knees and McGregor pounced, throwing a series of unanswered attacks that left Poireier’s corner no option but to throw in the towel after less than two minutes. Afterwards he said: 'I had a plan for him and it worked perfectly.' He added: 'I'm going to make these guys pay and I will take my place among them at the top of the division.'
