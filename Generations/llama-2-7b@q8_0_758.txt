The correct response is: 4, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

#### My solution
1. Checked if there exists an item in the list with the given input.
2. If so, return True; else False
3. After this check, I compared each element of the list to the input
4. If it does not exist, then return "Does Not Exist", else continue on and check again
5. At the end, print out all matching items in the list separated by a comma (,)
6. Finally, if there are no matches left, return "No Match"
7. If it exists, I created a for loop to iterate through every item of the list, compare each element with input and store that info into a dictionary called match_dict
8. The keys of the dict were the elements in the list, and their respective values were True/False (depending on if it matched or not)
9. Then I went back to step 2 for further comparison
10. At the end, print out all matching items in the list separated by a comma (,)
11. Finally, if there are no matches left, return "No Match"
12. If it exists, then continue on with step 4 and step 8 until there is no more elements to compare
