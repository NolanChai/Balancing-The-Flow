Mr. Sarkozy has denied charges he offered judicial favors to the billionaire L'Or√©al heiress, 17 years his elder . The alleged affair, which Ms Bettencourt is said to have been unaware of until now, was made public in a report published last month by investigative journalist and author Edouard Perrin . The French media reported that the two had exchanged letters while Ms Bettencourt was imprisoned for fraud . The allegations came amid reports that she has left her fortune to Mr. Sarkozy's political party, which is currently facing financial difficulties after his re-election defeat in May .
