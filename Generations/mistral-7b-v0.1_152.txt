*The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, 1503.*

### Explanation:
The painting is a portrait of a woman sitting on a bench in front of a landscape. The woman has been identified as Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, and it was painted between 1503 and 1506. It is believed that Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa with a sense of humor, making her one of the most recognizable paintings in the world.
### Code:
```python
# Import libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy import ndimage
from PIL import Image

# Load image
img = Image.open("mona_lisa.jpg")

# Convert to array and remove RGB channels that are not used for segmentation
img = np.array(img)[:, :, 0]

# Compute difference between center pixel value and surrounding pixels
diff = ndimage.convolve(img, [[-1, -2, -1], [-2, 16, -2], [-1, -2, -1]], mode='constant')

# Find edges by comparing diff to threshold
edges = (np.abs(diff) > 30) * 255

# Plot image and edges
plt.figure()
plt.subplot(121), plt.imshow(img, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Original Image'), plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])
plt.subplot(122), plt.imshow(edges, cmap='gray')
plt.title('Edges'), plt.xticks([]), plt.yticks([])
plt.show()
