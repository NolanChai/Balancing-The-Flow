- What about all the evidence from interviews with UNC students?
  - Did these experts have access to the same interviews as the ones who provided this information for the investigation? (I doubt it)
  - I would not trust a study like this that ignores qualitative data, especially when there are allegations of misconduct on both sides. The authors have every incentive to "prove" that UNC did nothing wrong.
- Did these experts take the time to look at Willingham's data?
  - No they didn't
    - But even if she provided them with her data, I'm not sure it would matter because the questions are too subjective and the statistical methods used by these researchers would have a high probability of producing false results.
- If you believe in these experts, then why do you still think there is a problem?
  - Because the research shows that even though the athletes may be performing well academically, they are not able to read or understand complex material at all
