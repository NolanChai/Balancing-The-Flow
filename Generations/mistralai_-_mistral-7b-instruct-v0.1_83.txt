 the sidewalk in front of it. The incident occurred in the South African city of Johannesburg. According to authorities, the collapse was likely caused by human error during the construction process.

The victims of the collapse included two construction workers and four pedestrians who were walking on the sidewalk at the time of the incident. Several others were injured, including one worker who was trapped in the rubble for several hours before being rescued. The workers were part of a team hired to dismantle the building.

The collapse sparked outrage among locals and raised concerns about safety regulations in the construction industry. The building had been marked for demolition due to its age and structural issues, but some residents and workers claimed that they had not been properly notified about the impending demolition and had not been given adequate time to move out of the area.

The incident also highlighted the dangers of using improper methods and materials during construction projects. According to eyewitnesses, the building was being demolished using explosives, which may have contributed to the collapse. The use of explosives in construction is generally prohibited in many countries due to the risk of accidents and injuries.

The authorities are currently investigating the incident and conducting a thorough examination of the building site. They have also ordered a temporary halt on all demolitions in the city while the investigation continues.
