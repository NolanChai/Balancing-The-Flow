Hungarian national Andras Janos Vass was convicted on Wednesday in federal court in Buffalo, N.Y., of human trafficking and racketeering . Vass is accused of luring young gay Eastern European men to the United States for what he called a “sex camp” experience where he would allegedly force them to have sex with each other or face violence . He also allegedly extorted $150 from the men if they tried to leave the camp and threatened them with violence.

Vass faces a mandatory 15 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and three years of supervised release at his sentencing on March 8th. In addition, Vass must register as a sex offender for the rest of his life .

This conviction is part of Operation Safe Passage, an investigation that has resulted in charges against nearly two dozen people who have allegedly trafficked young men and boys from Eastern Europe to the United States for sex. The victims were often recruited through online dating apps or social media platforms and lured with promises of work opportunities, education or housing . Once they arrived in the U.S., many were forced to engage in commercial sex acts against their will.

The case is significant because it highlights the ongoing issue of human trafficking in Eastern Europe, particularly among young men who are vulnerable to exploitation due to economic and social factors. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies working together to combat this crime across borders.
