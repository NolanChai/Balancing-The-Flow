A multi-millionaire property developer's son is being questioned over the disappearance of a blonde waitress from a celebrity club popular with Premiership footballers and soap stars. Privately-educated Ben Brayley, 20, has been named by police as they try to trace Katie Lea , who was last seen in the VIP lounge at The Boombox nightclub in Bristol on Wednesday night . Mr Brayley - son of property developer Tony Brayley and grandson of a former Bristol mayor - is said to have been having dinner with friends when Ms Lea entered the club, which was also attended by players from Premiership football clubs Tottenham Hotspur, Wolves and Swansea City, as well as soap stars such as Hollyoaks actor Richard Lumsden.
