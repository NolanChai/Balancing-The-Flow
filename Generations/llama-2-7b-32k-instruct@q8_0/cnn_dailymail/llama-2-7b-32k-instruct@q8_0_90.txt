shows water filling up the tracks and station car park before eventually covering the entire area to a depth of at least 70cm - almost two metres. The footage was released by Transport for New South Wales on Thursday in an attempt to convince people not to drive to work during morning peak hours. It comes after more than 5,000 motorists were fined last week when a similar warning was issued. A spokesman said the flooding, at Penrith railway station, could happen at any of the city's train stations or busiest roads during heavy rain and traffic congestion. Incredible footage: The time-lapse video shows the water slowly filling up the tracks before it reaches a depth of 70cm (2m) in just over an hour Train station carpark submerged: A Sydney railway line has been flooded under heavy rain, leaving one train stuck in muddy water at Penrith station The footage was released by Transport for New South Wales on Thursday in an attempt to convince people not to drive to work during morning peak hours. It comes after more than 5,000 motorists were fined last week when a similar warning was issued Sydney commuters have been urged to ditch their cars and take public transport as the city continues its wettest start to summer for a decade - with more rain on the way. The footage of Penrith station being submerged during Wednesday morning's heavy storm sparked fears that other stations could also be affected. A spokesman said: 'The flooding is not just confined to Sydney, but could happen at any of our train stations or busiest roads in the city during a similar weather event.' He added: 'This footage should serve as a warning for drivers to leave their car at home and take public transport during this morning peak hour on Thursday .' The video shows water flowing down the tracks before it begins to flood the station car park. By 12pm, the depth of water reaches about three quarters of the way up train carriages - which are then submerged under a foot of water. At that point, a train is stuck in muddy water at the platform. A spokesman for Transport for NSW said: 'The video was recorded by one of our CCTV cameras on Wednesday morning and shows how quickly rain can cause flooding in rail tunnels .' The Sydney Morning Herald reported that there have been 87mm of rainfall at Penrith since Tuesday night. Commuters are seen walking through the station while others attempt to drive underneath low-hanging branches to reach their parked cars. Another man can be seen carrying a large umbrella as he makes his way across the tracks, which have become completely covered in water. One motorist attempts to leave her car after realising she's stuck in the station but soon turns around when it becomes apparent the road ahead is flooded too. The Sydney train network was not affected by the weather and services are running as normal today. But there has been a spate of traffic accidents due to heavy rain, causing congestion on roads across NSW. A woman was seriously injured in a car crash on Wednesday morning at Crows Nest after losing control of her vehicle while attempting to avoid another driver involved in the accident. The 23-year-old had been travelling northbound when she lost control near Woolwich Wharf Road about 10:20am. She was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital with non life threatening injuries. A male cyclist was also injured and transported to Hornsby Hospital as a precaution, police said.

It has been an incredibly wet start to summer in Australia, with the country having already experienced its wettest July since records began 145 years ago. The Bureau of Meteorology reported that Sydney recorded more than three times the average rainfall last month and had a total of almost seven inches of rain . It has also seen record temperatures with its hottest day for this time of year on July 16th - when it reached 89 degrees (32C). The city's Observatory Hill recorded an astonishing 14.5mm (0.57in) of rainfall in just 15 minutes between 9am and 9:15am that morning, which would be equivalent to nearly two weeks worth of rainfall in a normal year.
