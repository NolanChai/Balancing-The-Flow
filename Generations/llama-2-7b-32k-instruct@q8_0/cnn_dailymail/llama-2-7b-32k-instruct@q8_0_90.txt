Sydney Train Station Floods in Storm of a Decade (PHOTOS) 
A storm which dumped more than a year's worth of rain on Sydney in under an hour has caused widespread flooding and chaos, including water pouring into the train station at Sydney Central. The weather bureau recorded over one meter of rainfall at Katoomba in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, with 19 other sites recording more than 50mm (2 inches) of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday. Incredible footage of a Sydney train station flooding during the storm has been captured on CCTV. A time lapse video, filmed from the platform over a 45 minute period at 11am local time on Wednesday shows water slowly rising to within centimeters of the platform edge as cars and buses drive across in front of it. It's understood that rail services were affected throughout the day by flooding at stations in Sydney, Newcastle and Wollongong. "A number of train lines were closed and some station platforms were cut off," a spokesperson for NSW TrainLink told Sputnik, but added that all lines had reopened early on Wednesday evening after the rain subsided. A total of 67.5mm (2.6 inches) fell in Sydney between 9pm Tuesday and 10am on Wednesday morning, with a further 49.3mm (1.9 inches) falling at 9:40am local time. The wettest October day since records began in 1859 was recorded at the city's Observatory Hill station where 122.6 millimeters (4.8 inches) of rain fell over a four hour period between 1pm and 5pm on Tuesday. "A number of weather stations have recorded their wettest October day since records began in the early 1900s," the Bureau of Meteorology said Wednesday morning. Sydney was also hit by gale-force winds as well as heavy rain. The Australian Financial Review reported that a power surge affected thousands of businesses and homes on Tuesday evening, with blackouts hitting some buildings in the central city. A number of streets were closed due to flooding on Wednesday morning, including parts of Sydney's busy George Street.
