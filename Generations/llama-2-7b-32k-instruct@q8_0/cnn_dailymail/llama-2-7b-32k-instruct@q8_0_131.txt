Governors' reactions to the furor over the laws indicate they have failed to grasp public opinion and need to engage more deeply with citizens, according to experts. (CNN)The public outrage over the "religious freedom" bills recently passed in Arkansas and Indiana caught the governors of those states completely off-guard, judging by their confused and contradictory responses.

An analysis from The Washington Post shows that even if Republican Govs. Mike Pence of Indiana and Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas had known about the public's negative reaction to the laws -- which critics say would allow discrimination against LGBT individuals, women and minorities in the name of religious liberty -- they did not think their constituents felt strongly enough about it to make a difference.

Governors "don't often receive as much information on how public opinion is actually trending," said Bill Lichter, a political science professor at Emory University who has written several books on American politics and elections. "And even when they do have access to the polls, it's hard for them to understand what voters are thinking in the long term."

In Arkansas, Pence initially defended Hutchinson's signing of the bill as a governor who cares about religious freedom, but soon backpedaled after public outcry. He said that he would have vetoed it if he had known it would spark such controversy -- even though his staff had told him what was in the legislation and he signed it anyway.

In Indiana, Pence faced similar criticism for signing a bill that critics argued would allow businesses to deny services to LGBT individuals based on religious beliefs, but he later changed his stance as well. The Republican governor said the legislature should consider changing the law.

Lichter said governors rely on focus groups and polls, which do not always accurately reflect public opinion. He added that it's often easier for governors to respond to immediate changes in policy than long-term trends. And he pointed out that, even when they are aware of public opinion, governors don't have the power to make big shifts on their own.

"There's a lot of ways where we do see leaders like governors not really understanding how voters think or what motivates them," Lichter said. "And in fact, that's one of the problems with democracy -- it's hard to keep up." (CNN)Pence and Hutchinson have faced a firestorm for their respective votes on religious freedom laws, which critics say would allow businesses or individuals to discriminate against LGBT people based on religious beliefs.

The lawmakers who sponsored the bills insist that they were meant to protect the rights of conservative Christians in states where the LGBT community is becoming more vocal and visible, not to discriminate against gay, lesbian or transgender individuals. They argue that it's a matter of religious freedom.

In Indiana, a spokeswoman for state Sen. Travis Holdman said the legislation was not intended to allow discrimination but would protect people who are asked about their beliefs from being fired or penalized by employers or government agencies.

"This bill is in no way meant to promote discrimination, and we absolutely reject any notion that this bill allows for discriminatory practices," the spokeswoman said.

But opponents say the law's vague language makes it unclear whether religious freedom trumps civil rights protections in Indiana. They also allege that Pence and other conservative lawmakers signed a law that would allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT people based on religious beliefs.

The bills have sparked protests across the country, with celebrities including Bruce Springsteen and Ellen DeGeneres vowing to boycott the states over them. (CNN)Pence said Monday that he would sign a "clarification" of the law, which says that religious beliefs cannot be used as an excuse for discrimination against LGBT people or others.

In an interview with NPR, Pence said he had not planned to veto the original bill because it was introduced in response to a federal court ruling that struck down Indiana's law banning gay marriage in 2014 and would have restored what many conservative Christians see as traditional religious freedoms.

"My office didn't know about the implications of this legislation, but my office didn't write it," Pence said on NPR. "We had to move very quickly."

Pence has come under fire for saying that he would sign a version of the law that does not allow discrimination against LGBT people based on religious beliefs, as he initially planned to do before changing his mind amid public outcry over the weekend. He said it was the best bill possible given how fast the legislature moved, and the state's attorney general later released a statement saying that he had not intended for businesses to discriminate against LGBT people under the law.

A spokeswoman for Hutchinson told CNN in an email Tuesday morning that he had known of public opinion on the issue before signing the bill and did not expect it to spark controversy. The governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked about Pence's statement.

"This is not new. This legislation has been discussed and debated in Arkansas," Hutchinson told CNN affiliate KTHV earlier this month. "I was confident it would pass the House and Senate." (CNN)In Indiana, the issue took on a life of its own as opponents said Pence should not be able to change his mind after signing the original bill and called him out for changing his stance only days after the backlash began.

"What does it say that the Governor could sign legislation intended to discriminate, but then claim he didn't know what was in it?" asked Indiana Democratic Party Chairman John Zody. "The question is whether we have a governor who can't even be trusted to keep his word."

The outcry over the Indiana law has made Pence's re-election bid more challenging, according to CNN contributor David Gergen, who said that if he were advising Pence, he would suggest he "get a bigger tent" and engage with critics of the bill.

Gergen added that the outcry over the Indiana law will make it harder for Republicans to push other conservative legislation, such as repealing the Affordable Healthcare Act or changing immigration laws, because opponents can now use those issues against GOP candidates.

"They're going to have a very difficult time trying to move forward on any of these proposals that they want, including some of the really tough ones like (immigration), until this blows over," he said. "And I think it's just become one more issue that could cost Pence his job."

Pence is running for a full term in November. He was elected as governor in 2012, after serving four terms in the House of Representatives. (CNN)The Indiana state legislature on Tuesday passed a bill that clarifies that religious freedom does not include protection from discrimination against LGBT people based on religious beliefs.

It's unclear whether Pence will sign it, but the measure appears to be a compromise of sorts after the governor said last week he would veto any version of the law if it didn't include such language.

Hutchinson signed the bill Tuesday morning and praised its passage as "an opportunity for us all to come together" amid the uproar over the original legislation that sparked so much controversy. Hutchinson said he was confident Pence would sign it.

The new law still includes a provision allowing businesses to refuse services if they have religious objections, but opponents say it doesn't go far enough in clarifying that discrimination against LGBT people is not legal under the law.

"We are disappointed that it does not include explicit protections from discrimination," said Joshua Block, staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana. "It's still a concern for us."

The bill also includes language that says religious freedom cannot be used to discriminate against people based on race or sex. (CNN)Pence has faced criticism from opponents who say he signed a law intended to allow businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals, but now appears to want to sign another version of the legislation that would protect them from such discrimination.

Opponents argue the governor shouldn't be able to change his mind on the issue, especially after he defended his decision to sign it during a town hall meeting last week. When one critic told Pence to stop being hypocritical, the governor said: "I am not going to apologize for my position."

In Indiana, the issue took on a life of its own as opponents said Pence should not be able to change his mind after signing the original bill and called him out for changing his stance only days after the backlash began.
