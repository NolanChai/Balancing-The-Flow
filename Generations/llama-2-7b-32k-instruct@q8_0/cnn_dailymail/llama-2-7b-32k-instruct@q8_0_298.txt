The Montgomery Advertiser reported that prosecutors filed a motion with the Alabama Supreme Court this week asking it to vacate Anthony Ray Hinton's death sentence, citing a lack of evidence in his case. They also asked the court to release him from prison immediately because he has served so long on death row and there is no longer any reason to hold him without bail.

"I'm not bitter," said Hinton, 60, who was released Thursday night. "I just want justice."

Hinton has been a model prisoner, spending much of his time in solitary confinement and ministering to others while serving multiple life sentences for two murders he maintains he did not commit. Hinton's case became the subject of books including New York Times best-selling author Walter Mosley's 1993 "The Last Days of Mercy."

The state has executed eight men since restoring the death penalty in 1976, and had planned to execute an additional five, although Gov. Kay Ivey earlier this year halted those scheduled executions because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Hinton's case was not among them.

His attorneys said Thursday that they have been trying for years to get his death sentence vacated based on new evidence, including a ballistics report, that indicates he may be innocent. Prosecutors earlier this week agreed to reopen the investigation in Hinton's case but did not say whether they would seek the death penalty again if they found Hinton guilty of committing the two murders.

"We're just glad he will have a chance for freedom," said Bryan Stevenson, founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, which has represented Hinton since 1987 and filed a motion on his behalf last week asking that his death sentence be vacated.

Stevenson said there were two witnesses who claimed they saw Hinton with the guns used to kill two fast-food employees in a Pizza Hut restaurant, but both of those people were arrested for drug charges and neither could recall where they had seen Hinton earlier that day. The witnesses also described him wearing clothing he didn't have on the day of the murders, Stevenson said.

The other evidence against Hinton included a bullet fragment found in the Pizza Hut, which was not recovered from the crime scene until two years after the murders occurred, and fingerprints that were discovered on a box used to transport the guns to court -- but the fingerprints did not match Hinton's.

Stevenson said he has never seen such flimsy evidence used in a case involving the death penalty. He called for a special prosecutor to be appointed to re-investigate the case.

"Mr. Hinton should have been exonerated years ago," Stevenson said, "but we're happy that he is finally getting his day in court."

Hinton was sentenced to death by lethal injection on March 18, 1987 for the murder of two Pizza Hut employees at a gas station. Prosecutors alleged Hinton killed them during a robbery after being kicked out of the store because he did not have enough money to pay for food, but they did not present any witnesses who had seen him there that day or heard him say anything about it.

Hinton has maintained his innocence since he was sentenced to death in 1987. His lawyers argued in a court motion filed on his behalf last week that the state failed to investigate and test other potential suspects, did not obtain a statement from Hinton until five days after the murders occurred even though they knew they had him in custody and did not have fingerprint evidence linking him to the scene.

"The prosecution's case rested almost entirely on unsupported testimony by two witnesses who both admitted that they lied about what they saw," Stevenson wrote in a motion filed Thursday. "A ballistics report that should have been reviewed years ago revealed that the bullets taken from the crime scene did not match Hinton's gun."

Stevenson said it appears the state was trying to execute an innocent man for political reasons, but he also said that "the death penalty is too important a punishment to be imposed on the basis of unjustifiable evidence and circumstantial evidence."

"Mr. Hinton's case illustrates why this method of criminal justice has been plagued with problems," Stevenson wrote.

Hinton's case is just one of more than 100 capital cases that were identified last year by the Equal Justice Initiative in a review of Alabama death sentences and DNA evidence as "deeply flawed, possibly innocent" or subject to reasonable doubt based on the available facts. The state has executed eight men since restoring the death penalty in 1976, and had planned to execute an additional five, although Gov. Kay Ivey earlier this year halted those scheduled executions because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.

Hinton's case was not among them.

The Alabama Supreme Court agreed Wednesday that a new trial should be held for Hinton, but it did not immediately set one. It has more than 250 death row inmates, so any hearing would be delayed because of the pandemic and other issues related to scheduling, said Bryan Stevenson with Equal Justice Initiative.

"He could walk out of prison Friday," Stevenson said Thursday night. "We're hoping that will happen."

Hinton was first sentenced to life in prison but later was resentenced to death row for the murders. He had been scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on May 18, 2015.

In a court document filed Thursday, prosecutors asked the Alabama Supreme Court not to order that Hinton's sentence be vacated or commuted but rather for it to "be reinstated in an appropriate case." Prosecutors also said they would seek the death penalty if he were tried again.

"The State is confident in its case against Mr. Hinton," prosecutor Chilton wrote, adding that "there is no doubt Anthony Ray Hinton committed these two murders and therefore should be executed for them."

Hinton said Thursday that he spent 28 years on Alabama's death row before a federal judge ordered him to be resentenced. He was sent back to death row after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1995 that he had not received adequate legal representation during his trial, and again before being scheduled for execution in 2015, when prosecutors agreed to allow a new sentencing hearing.

Stevenson said Hinton spent 31 years on Alabama's death row -- including more than two decades after it was clear he did not commit the crime. Stevenson said the state has executed eight men since restoring the death penalty in 1976, and had planned to execute an additional five, although Gov. Kay Ivey earlier this year halted those scheduled executions because of concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.

"It's been a long journey," he said Thursday night. "I don't want to see anybody go through what I went through."

Hinton had 68 years to live and will be freed Friday, but Stevenson said Hinton's health has declined while on death row because of stress related to his case, including living in a windowless cell with no access to fresh air or sunlight. He was allowed outside just once every three days for an hour, and had to eat inside his 6-foot by 9-foot cell.

He said Hinton spent most of his time in solitary confinement because he feared other inmates would attack him because they were aware of the crimes he was accused of committing. He did not have any visitors or mail for years, and had no access to a computer.

"I've always been optimistic," Hinton said Thursday night. "I never gave up hope."

He also praised the work of Stevenson's organization, which has represented him since 1987.

"The Equal Justice Initiative is a wonderful group," he said. "They're always there to help."

Hinton was born in the small town of Holly Springs, Mississippi, and served in the U.S. Army during Vietnam before moving to Alabama at age 20 to live with his older sisters. He worked for 17 years as a maintenance engineer at a Pizza Hut franchise until he was convicted and sentenced to death, Stevenson said.

He had been scheduled to be executed by lethal injection on May 18, 2015. His case is just one of more than 100 capital cases that were identified last year by the Equal Justice Initiative in a review of Alabama death sentences and DNA evidence as "deeply flawed, possibly innocent" or subject to reasonable doubt based on the available facts.
