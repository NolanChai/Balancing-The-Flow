PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) — The crew of a replica pirate schooner were forced to abandon ship after their vessel lost power in rough seas off the coast of Maine.

Nine members of the Liana's Ransom were scooped up by Coast Guard 45-foot response boat on Sunday afternoon near Cape Neddick Light, about two miles east of Nubble Light, and brought back to shore, officials said Monday. The cause of the power loss was not immediately known.

The crew had been participating in a reenactment of the famous "Maine Wreck" when it happened, according to Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer 1st Class Jake Desens. In that event from October 1807, an American frigate was sunk by a British ship off the coast of Maine and the crew of 314 men were rescued by another American vessel.

A Coast Guard crew member, Lt. Chad Johnson, who helped rescue the Liana's Ransom crew, said he heard them yelling for help after their boat lost power Sunday afternoon. It was anchored off a beach because of rough seas when the engine cut out and it began to drift toward shore.

"The engine quit on us," Johnson said. "We had some challenges trying to figure out what happened but we were able to get all nine people aboard."

One crew member suffered hypothermia, but was stabilized by medics and treated at a hospital, officials said. No injuries were reported.

Desens credited the training of Coast Guard personnel with preventing any serious injuries in the rescue operation.

The boat is owned by Captain John Harmer and operated out of Portsmouth Harbor Marina in New Hampshire. It's a replica of the pirate schooner Liana's Ransom, which was built in 1710. The ship carries sailors dressed in period clothing and uses authentic sails, masts and rigging to reenact piracy at ports along the East Coast, according to its website .

"The vessel is designed for coastal sailing but not ocean voyages," Harmer said Monday on his Facebook page. "We will take a close look at this experience to see how we can improve our operations."

It's not clear whether the boat will be able to sail again this season, which runs through October.

The vessel was scheduled to dock Tuesday night at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, before heading to Boston for a weekend event at the Museum of Science, according to its website . It is not clear how much the replica ship will be delayed by the accident.

Coast Guard officials said they were grateful to the crew of another replica pirate ship, which was nearby and helped them rescue the Liana's Ransom crew. The crew of the Sea Gypsy had been sailing off Nubble Light with their own crew when they saw the Liana's Ransom drifting in rough seas near shore. They alerted authorities by VHF radio, Desens said.

The Coast Guard also got help from people on shore who called 911 to report the vessel drifting toward land. The two replica ships and their crews are based out of a marina about six miles apart in Maine and New Hampshire.

"We're always happy to be able to assist our neighboring marinas, especially when they have such an excellent safety record," Desens said.

The Coast Guard also has been involved with helping another replica pirate ship that ran into trouble off the coast of New Hampshire last week. The Sea Gypsy got stuck on a sandbar and had to be rescued by a Coast Guard boat crew. It was able to continue its voyage after being freed, officials said at the time.

PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) — The U.S. Navy on Monday announced that a replica of the USS Constitution will sail for the first time since 2012 after years of restoration and repair work by hundreds of volunteers at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine.

The 95-foot (28-meter) wooden ship, nicknamed "Old Ironsides" because it was invulnerable to cannonballs during the War of 1812, is expected to set sail from Portsmouth aboard a barge bound for the Boston Navy Yard on Thursday.

The replica was built in Portsmouth in 1995 with help from hundreds of volunteers and has been undergoing maintenance at the shipyard since it arrived there from California after its last sailing trip to Boston Harbor.

Constitution is scheduled to be present for the Tall Ships Boston festival next summer, which will feature a dozen historic replica ships from around the world on display in Boston . The ship has been owned by Maine-based nonprofit Sail Training International since 2006 and was built at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in 1995.

The first sailing vessel to be built in a U.S. Navy dockyard, Constitution is considered the oldest commissioned warship still afloat, according to the organization Sail Training International . It has been refloated and restored several times during its history.

Constitution was launched on Oct. 21, 1794 from the Boston Navy Yard in what became known as "the most famous launching in U.S. naval history."

The ship will be available for public tours after it is moored at the Boston Navy Yard. It's scheduled to set sail again next spring .

It was built out of southern yellow pine and white oak, which were harvested from trees in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont that were felled by a hurricane in 1938. It was originally commissioned as the USS United States on Oct. 21, 1794, and served until 1806 .

A total of 26 cannonballs were fired at it during the War of 1812 but none penetrated its sides . It was built with a 4-foot (1.25 -meter) thick hull because of rumors that enemy ships would be made out of iron, according to the USS Constitution Museum in Boston Harbor.

The ship's restoration at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has been overseen by volunteers from Maine and elsewhere who have put more than 200,000 hours into bringing it back to its original state .
