The crew of a replica pirate schooner were forced to abandon ship after their vessel lost power in rough seas off the coast of Maine. Nine members of the Liana's Ransom were scooped up by Coast Guard ships and taken to safety, reportedly unharmed. The incident happened Sunday afternoon near Freeport Harbor at about 1:30 p.m., according to a news release from the U.S. Coast Guard. A rescue boat was called after the schooner lost power while anchored in rough weather. The vessel's generator failed, leaving the sailors without any electrical systems or lights and unable to communicate with people on shore, according to reports.
