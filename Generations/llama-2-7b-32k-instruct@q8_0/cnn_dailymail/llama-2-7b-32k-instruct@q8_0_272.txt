"A Navy official says an Air Force pilot who crashed his plane while flying through clouds during an exercise off the California coast has been found dead."

"The aircraft was spotted by a Navy ship and a Navy helicopter. The helicopter sent divers to check on the plane after it landed in the water and they were not able to find the pilot, identified as Captain Charles E. Corcoran Jr., 45."

"Corcoran had more than 20 years of experience and was a member of the Air Force's Test Pilot School."

"His family said in a statement that Corcoran was 'a wonderful husband, father, son and brother who was extremely passionate about flying.'"
