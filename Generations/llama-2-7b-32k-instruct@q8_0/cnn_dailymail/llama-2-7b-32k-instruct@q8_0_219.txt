A 42-year-old man has been sentenced to life in prison for killing his girlfriend Sharon Winters, who was searching for her soulmate on an online dating website when she met him. Kevin Hawke stabbed her with a kitchen knife at their home in Pensacola, Florida, in 2015, and will serve out his life sentence without the possibility of parole or early release. The jury found him guilty for first-degree murder on Wednesday, WEAR reported . Sharon Winters' son Brandon said they never got to meet Hawke before she was killed. "I would have done something," he told Fox 10 in a statement after the verdict. "No matter what happened with us or with me and my mom I would have done something." He added that he will always think of his mother as "the strongest person I know." Winters' niece, Rachel McDaniel, was also close to her aunt. She said she wishes the pair could have had a chance to meet in person before Winters died. "I feel like my life was cut short," she added, "and it sucks that she won't be able to see me grow up." Hawke has been on house arrest since his arrest in 2016 and is now heading back to prison for the rest of his life after a jury found him guilty on Wednesday. A judge ordered him not to contact Winters' family or friends while he serves out his life sentence, and if he does so, the court will revoke his parole .
