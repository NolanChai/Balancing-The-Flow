a-half years prison earlier this month and fined 20 million kyat ($14,000) after being convicted under Burma’s strict laws on religious defamation.

Burma has a history of harsh punishment for offending Buddhism, with inmates known to have been sentenced to death for insulting the religion . The country is ranked 167th out of 180 countries on Reporters Without Borders' World Press Freedom Index.

The Foreign Office confirmed that they had not asked the Burmese authorities to release Blackwood, and said: ‘We are aware that a British national has been jailed in Myanmar (Burma) for breaching its penal code. The FCO has no role in seeking his release.’

Blackwood was arrested on April 17 at his hotel in Yangon's downtown Chinatown district, where he had a bar called The Square and A Half, by the local police who were tipped off to him using an image of Buddha as advertising. Blackwood denied any wrongdoing and insisted he was not aware that the image was in breach of Burmese laws. He was jailed on May 8, after a one-month trial at Insein Prison

Jim Shannon, who is MP for Strangford Lough, told The MailOnline: ‘I have written to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and got no response from them. It's a disgrace.

‘This case is not just about British citizens being arrested but what it means for people trying to promote freedom of speech in that country . This is a serious issue.’

Liz May, chief executive at the human rights organisation Burma Campaign UK said: ‘We are appalled that the Foreign Office seems to be abandoning Mr Blackwood. We need them to do more to campaign for him and other people who have been unjustly jailed in Burma.’

In a statement on Facebook, Blackwood said he had not received any support from the FCO since his arrest. He wrote: ‘I'm not sure why it is taking so long. I have tried many times to contact them but they are ignoring me’

A Foreign Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'The UK Government takes very seriously the safety and security of British citizens overseas . We take all concerns about the detention of foreign nationals abroad very seriously.'

May added: ‘We have been in contact with the Embassy in Myanmar since his arrest but they've said he doesn't need any legal representation, which is not right.’

She continued that Burma has a history of imprisoning people for offending Buddhism and the country should be condemned. She added: ‘If it's an issue about freedom of speech then we should speak out against this oppressive regime in Burma who have been taking a lot of people to prison over the last few years.'

The Foreign Office said it would not comment on any specific cases, but stressed that UK citizens detained abroad are protected under their Human Rights Act . It is illegal for anyone to insult the religion or image of Buddha in Burma. The country's military government has been accused of ramping up oppression since taking control from its last democratic government in 2011
