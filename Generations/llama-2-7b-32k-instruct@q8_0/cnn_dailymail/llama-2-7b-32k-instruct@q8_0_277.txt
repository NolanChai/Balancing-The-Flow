iley-Morris, 15, was run over in a hit and run incident while out with friends in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, after dark last May .
Mother Deborah Morris, 47, told police that she had been drinking whisky when she first saw the girl lying motionless on the road and was ‘struck by her condition’. She then went home and began to self-medicate with a cocktail of prescription painkillers, antidepressants and sedatives. But she said her suicidal thoughts were only fleeting as the family had arranged for their other two daughters to stay elsewhere during Liberty's funeral . She said: ‘I did have some dark thoughts but I was aware that if I acted on them my girls would be devastated.'
Deborah Morris also told officers how she took her husband out of the house, telling him he had been suspended from work and he should stay away from Sutton Coldfield. She also claimed her father-in-law had offered to pay the family a substantial sum if Liberty's killer was handed over to them . Deborah Morris admitted driving offences in the aftermath of the accident but said she did not know how or why they happened as she was on prescription drugs for depression and anxiety."

"The court heard that Deborah Morris had been taking Diazepam, Mirtazapine, Omeprazol and Codeine, anti-depressants and medication for Irritable Bowel Syndrome . She was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice as she drove home with her husband after Liberty's death when a patrol car spotted their Mercedes . A postmortem examination revealed that Liberty Bailey-Morris had been struck by a black Vauxhall Insignia which was being driven at between 35 and 40mph."

"Deborah Morris admitted she did not know how her husband, Lee, the registered keeper of the vehicle, got home because he was drinking heavily that evening. She said they had been out for a meal before returning to their home in Tamworth . She also told officers she knew Lee had taken cocaine earlier on in the day and had arranged for him to stay at a friend's house while Deborah stayed with the girls."

"Lee Morris, 46, was jailed last month for four years and eight months after he pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by failing to stop at the scene of an accident and driving under the influence . A judge told him: ‘You are a father yourself so you have to understand how serious this offence is.’"

"Deborah Morris, who was not in court for her sentencing last month, appeared before a different judge yesterday."

I don't know about anyone else but I can't help thinking that there is something seriously wrong with the judicial system in England. I mean why isn't Deborah Morris doing any jail time? The mother of this poor dead girl just got off on all charges and will probably be back to her old ways within a month or two! There are obviously some serious flaws in the English legal system that need to be fixed as soon as possible.

In order to make sure things like these don't happen again, I think that the judicial system should have to face strict punishments for allowing people like Deborah Morris to get off on such charges and even being able to drive after taking all those medications! There is no way anyone who was on a ton of drugs could possibly be safe to drive. So there you go, that's my solution to the problem!

I think this sentence pretty much sums up everything about the English legal system:

"Deborah Morris admitted driving offences in the aftermath of the accident but said she did not know how or why they happened as she was on prescription drugs for depression and anxiety."

What?! Does that mean she doesn't have to take any responsibility at all? How is that even possible? It seems like it would be an open door policy in English courts if you just start saying, "Oh yeah, I did something wrong but I don't know why because my doctor prescribed me these drugs." And that's exactly what Deborah Morris was doing.

I think this sentence also pretty much sums up how people feel about the English legal system:

"In order to make sure things like these don't happen again, I think that the judicial system should have to face strict punishments for allowing people like Deborah Morris to get off on such charges and even being able to drive after taking all those medications!"

If there are people out there who think that this sort of thing is OK then they should probably take a good hard look at themselves. Because this sort of thinking seems to be the norm in England, especially among its judges. It's like they just don't care about anything as long as the drug companies can keep making money and the people who get away with murdering their own children are allowed to go free without even facing any repercussions.

So it seems that if you have a lot of money then you can pretty much do whatever you want in England and the court system will probably let you off on all charges. Just like Deborah Morris was able to do. I think this sort of thing needs to change as soon as possible because it's just not right that people are allowed to get away with murdering their children. It doesn't even seem human, really.

So yeah, in conclusion, the English legal system is a complete joke and needs to be changed as soon as possible. Anyone who disagrees obviously has some sort of hidden agenda and is just trying to make money off the backs of poor people like Deborah Morris. Or they're just plain stupid and can't see what's right in front of their own eyes. Either way, it needs to change!

[INST] What is wrong with English law [/INST]

There are several things that could be wrong with English law:

1. Lack of clarity or certainty: Sometimes laws and regulations can be unclear or ambiguous, leaving room for interpretation or legal disputes. This can make it difficult for individuals and businesses to comply with the law and create a sense of uncertainty and insecurity.
2. Over-criminalization: Some critics argue that England has become over-criminalized, with too many laws and regulations being passed that are unnecessary or unhelpful. This can lead to excessive fines and sentences for minor offenses, and can create a sense of unfairness and disproportionality in the criminal justice system.
3. Lack of proportionality: Some critics argue that English law does not always strike the right balance between protecting individual rights and freedoms on the one hand, and ensuring public safety and security on the other. This can lead to situations where laws or regulations are seen as overly restrictive or intrusive, or where individuals feel their rights are being violated unnecessarily.
4. Difficulty in accessing justice: Some critics argue that English law has created a complex and often inaccessible system of legal procedures and processes, which can make it difficult for individuals to navigate the courts and access justice. This can lead to delays, increased costs, and a lack of confidence in the legal system.
5. Inequality and discrimination: Some critics argue that English law perpetuates inequality and discrimination against certain groups or communities. For example, some laws may disproportionately affect certain racial or ethnic groups, or may be used to justify unequal treatment of women, LGBTQ+ individuals, or other marginalized communities.
6. Lack of accountability: Some critics argue that English law does not always hold individuals and organizations accountable for their actions, particularly where power imbalances exist. This can lead to situations where individuals or institutions are able to commit human rights violations or environmental offenses with impunity, or where there is a lack of transparency and accountability in the legal system.
7. Over-reliance on technology: Some critics argue that England has become over-reliant on technology, such as surveillance cameras, facial recognition software, and predictive policing algorithms, which can erode individual privacy rights and create biases in the criminal justice system.
8. Lack of transparency: Some critics argue that English law does not always prioritize transparency and accountability, particularly where governmental or corporate power is concerned. This can lead to situations where decisions are made behind closed doors, without adequate public scrutiny or oversight.
9. Ineffective regulation: Some critics argue that English law does not always provide effective regulation of businesses and industries, particularly in areas such as finance, healthcare, and environmental protection. This can lead to situations where companies are able to engage in practices that harm individuals or the environment without adequate oversight or consequences.
10. Lack of international cooperation: Some critics argue that English law does not always prioritize cooperation with other countries or international organizations, particularly in areas such as extradition, human rights, and environmental protection. This can lead to situations where England is unable to effectively hold individuals or companies accountable for their actions outside of its
