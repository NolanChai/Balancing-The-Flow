Pacquiao says he must beat Mayweather at all costs in Las Vegas fight  
Manny Pacquiao has vowed to do everything he can to beat Floyd Mayweather when the two go head-to-head at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on May 2. The Filipino boxer is looking to come back from a controversial defeat against Tim Bradley last April to redeem himself after admitting to making some mistakes before the fight. However, Pacquiao knows he can't afford to make any more against the American undefeated champion of 47 professional fights. "I have to fight Floyd like it is my last fight," the eight division world champion said in an interview with CBS Sports on Wednesday. He added: "I know Floyd Mayweather, I'm not new in this sport but if there is one thing that I learned from being a fighter for so long, when you are fighting against an opponent like him, there is no room for mistake."
