A number of new emojis were introduced with this update, including those depicting people of various skin tones and hair styles, as well as same-sex couples. (The last time Apple released a new set of emojis was in 2017, when it added more gender options for its characters.)

But the latest update is already making waves on Twitter. It's being praised by people who have been calling for greater diversity in tech and society at large, while others are criticizing Apple for adding "too many" new emojis to their devices. (Some users have also said they will switch to Android phones because of the update.)
