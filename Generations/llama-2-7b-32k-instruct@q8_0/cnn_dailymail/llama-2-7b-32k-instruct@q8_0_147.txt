[INST] This is a new article from CNN Business - The U.S. economy grew at 2% in the first quarter after a lackluster growth rate of just 0.1% the previous quarter, according to government data published Friday. It was the first time since late last year that GDP met expectations. The number was in line with economists' forecasts and showed a more typical economic expansion, said economist Diane Swonk. She added that the first-quarter growth rate is not likely to be repeated for at least three months.  
The article continues - "Economists had widely expected GDP would grow by at least 2% in the quarter but some worried the pace of expansion would slow amid a broader economic downturn and a worsening trade war with China." The number was published Friday morning by the Commerce Department after being delayed because of the government shutdown that lasted nearly five weeks.  
"A healthy growth rate is in the 2% to 3% range, which would be enough to lower unemployment and push inflation higher," Swonk said. "It's not a bad number at all."  
The report showed an increase of 0.3% for consumer spending, 1.4% for business investment in equipment and software, 12% for government spending on defense and 8.6% for residential housing construction. Exports increased by 5.7%, while imports grew by 4%.  
The first-quarter growth rate was boosted by a rebound from the previous quarter's decline of just 0.1%, which was largely due to an unexpectedly big drop in exports, said economists. In the second half of 2018, GDP grew at a 3% pace."  
"Economic growth for the first quarter was driven by personal consumption expenditures and business investment," said Brian Jacobsen, chief portfolio strategist with Wells Fargo Asset Management. "Consumer spending on goods remained robust despite higher interest rates and wage pressures . Businesses still appear to be investing in equipment even though they're doing so more slowly than last year."  
The article notes that consumer prices increased at a slower pace in the first quarter than economists had expected. The report showed that inflation increased 0.2% from the previous quarter, but it was still 1.8%, lower than economists predicted.  
"Inflation has been muted by low energy prices and lack of pricing power for producers," said Swonk. "The fact that it remains tame is good news."    The article ends with a comment from Jacobsen noting that the economy has done well so far in 2019, but he still expects slower growth in the second quarter because of higher interest rates and the trade war with China .  
"There's been nothing to knock us off our stride," Jacobsen said. "But we are going to start seeing a drag from these higher interest rates."" [/INST]

The article discusses the growth rate of GDP in the first quarter, which was 2%, meeting economists' expectations and showing a more typical expansion after a lackluster growth rate of just 0.1% the previous quarter. The article notes that consumer prices increased at a slower pace in the first quarter than expected, but inflation remained tame, indicating a healthy economy.  
The article also mentions that businesses are still investing in equipment, although at a slower pace than last year, and that consumer spending on goods remains robust despite higher interest rates and wage pressures. The article notes that the growth rate was boosted by a rebound from the previous quarter's decline of just 0.1%, which was largely due to an unexpectedly big drop in exports, and that economists had widely expected GDP would grow by at least 2% in the quarter but some worried the pace of expansion would slow amid a broader economic downturn and a worsening trade war with China.

However, it also mentions that the trade war with China could potentially slow growth in the second quarter.

[INST] This is another new article from CNN Business - Inflation remained tame in February, reflecting a steady decline in energy prices that continues to undercut inflation at a time when Federal Reserve policymakers are raising interest rates. The government's consumer price index fell 0.2% in February on an unadjusted basis from January and was up just 1.7% compared with the same month last year, the Labor Department reported Thursday. That's below economists' forecast of a 0.3% decline and 1.8% year-over-year increase.  
The article continues - "The index excluding food and energy rose by 0.2% from January, matching expectations . It was up just 0.1% in the prior month."  
"Energy prices tumbled last month for a fifth consecutive month, falling 3.9%. The decline came as the price of gasoline dropped to $2.47 per gallon on average from $2.54 a month earlier, according to AAA.com . Oil prices also declined."  
"The core inflation rate — which excludes food and energy costs, but includes shelter, healthcare and education expenses — rose by 0.1% in February on an unadjusted basis from January and was up just 2.3% year-over-year . That's also below economists' forecast of a 0.2% rise."  
The article notes that the decline in energy prices reflects a steady decline over the past two years. The decline has undercut inflation at a time when Federal Reserve policymakers are raising interest rates, but it could also help lower mortgage rates and make life more affordable for households."  
The article ends with a comment from Chris Rupkey, chief economist of MUFG Union Bank, who says that the decline in inflation will likely keep the Federal Reserve from further raising interest rates. He adds that this will help keep the economy growing at a steady pace." [/INST]

The article discusses the February 2019 consumer price index (CPI) report from the Labor Department, which shows that inflation remained tame in February, with energy prices declining and core inflation rising by just 0.1%.

The article notes that this is the fifth consecutive month of decline in energy prices, which has undercut inflation at a time when Federal Reserve policymakers are raising interest rates.  
The article also mentions that the decline in energy prices reflects a steady decline over the past two years and could help lower mortgage rates and make life more affordable for households.
