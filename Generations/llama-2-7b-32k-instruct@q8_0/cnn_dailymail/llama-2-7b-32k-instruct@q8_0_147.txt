Vietnam War veteran Gary Dexter asked the Utah Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to approve a personalized license plate with the designation "1968 PH" for his 2021 Ford F-350 pickup truck, which he bought last month. The request was rejected by the DMV, but Dexter is unsure about why, as he said that the year in the plate would represent when he was wounded and awarded a Purple Heart during his time in service . In 1968, while serving in Vietnam as an infantryman with the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division, Dexter was wounded by shrapnel from a mortar attack, which left him with injuries to his right thigh and shoulder . He said that when he requested a personalized license plate, he did not think twice about using the year "1968" as a reference to that time. The DMV rejected Dexter's request for the personalized plate on February 23, citing concerns about the designation being misleading or offensive . In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dexter said he was taken aback by the denial of his request, as he had no intention to cause any disrespect or harm. The 71-year-old veteran said he feels that he has been singled out and that this issue is not a matter of free speech but rather about whether the government can dictate what people should say on their license plates . "I don't understand why it was denied," Dexter said. "It's just a personalized plate, it's my property." The Utah DMV did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the matter. However, in a statement, the agency said that it had received complaints about Dexter's request and decided to deny it "to avoid any confusion or potential misunderstandings" . While some have expressed their support for Dexter and his desire to commemorate his military service on his license plate, others have criticized the decision as insensitive to veterans who served in Vietnam. A group of veterans and supporters staged a protest outside the Utah DMV building on Friday, voicing their disapproval of the denial and calling for Dexter's plate to be approved . "We feel that this is an attack on Gary," said Larry Simpson, a retired colonel with the Utah National Guard who was among those at the protest. "He served his country honorably and deserves to have whatever personalized license plate he wants." The controversy over Dexter's request has highlighted the complexities of freedom of speech in today's society, especially when it comes to government regulation of language and expression . While many argue that the government should not be able to dictate what people can or cannot say on their license plates, others believe that certain designations or symbols may be offensive or inappropriate. As this case shows, these competing views can create tension and spark debate among members of society who hold different opinions on the matter .
