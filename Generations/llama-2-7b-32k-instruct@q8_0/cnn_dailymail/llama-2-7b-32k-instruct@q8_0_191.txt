The mounds were discovered on Monday and officers believe it may have been dumped over a period of months or even years. It is believed to be waste from a building firm in Colchester that closed down at some point. The huge amount of rubbish was found at the side of Station Road, in Ufford Park, where residents were left stunned and worried about what to do with it. One resident said: 'I'm not sure what happened here but they must have been dumping for a long time because that lot of waste didn't just appear overnight.' Another resident said: 'It's horrific, we are all so upset. We don't know where to start. It looks like it might be industrial waste and there is no way we can do anything with it ourselves.'
