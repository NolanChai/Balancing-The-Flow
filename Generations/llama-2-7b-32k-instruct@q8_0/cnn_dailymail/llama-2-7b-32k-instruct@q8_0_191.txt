has seen, were found last week in and around the town of Mildenhall.

The fly-tippers had dumped two separate truckloads of waste on roadsides at Brandon Road and Coney Lane close to the village of Whittlesey. A local resident spotted the rubbish piled up on a stretch of verge as well as inside hedgerows on nearby fields, sparking an investigation by police officers.

Another resident said: "They must have dumped more than 40 tonnes at least and it's absolutely disgusting - it looks horrific."

The rubbish included the remains of a concrete mixer as well as heavy bags of material from building sites, including bricks, stones and concrete. A police officer who attended the scene said: "This is one of the worst cases I've seen in Mildenhall. It looks awful - it must have taken at least two lorries to dump all this rubbish here."

The resident said she was worried that if animals had consumed any of the waste, there would be a risk to public health as well as the environment. She added: "We don't know where they got it from but we think it has been taken from nearby building sites. There are big signs saying not to dump waste here."

The rubbish was removed by environmental cleaning firm Total Waste Services, which had to use a specialist recovery vehicle and skip lorry to clear the waste. It is understood that Mildenhall councillors will be made aware of what has happened.

A spokesman for Suffolk County Council said: "We are not aware of any recent fly-tipping incidents in Mildenhall town centre but we would encourage anyone with information about the incident to contact us on 0345 608 2711. We also have a number of environmental enforcement officers that regularly patrol Suffolk's rural areas looking for signs of fly-tipping and are able to offer advice and support to residents when it comes to waste management."

A spokesman for the Environment Agency added: "If people spot fly tipping they should report it by calling 0800 807060 or report it online via our website. This will help us gather information that may be of use in future investigations into this type of crime."

Suffolk County Council said they would not comment further on the fly-tipping incident until after all necessary investigations had been completed. Suffolk Police said they were aware of the fly tipping and said officers had visited the area to take photographs and collect evidence, but added that they could not confirm any further details about it.

The town of Mildenhall has been blighted by a number of cases of fly-tipping in recent years. A Suffolk County Council spokesman said: "We are taking an increasingly tough stance on those who dump their waste illegally and we are working closely with the police to tackle fly tipping across the county."
