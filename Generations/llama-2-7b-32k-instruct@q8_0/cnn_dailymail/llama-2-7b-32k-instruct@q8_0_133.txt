istically as Steve, is not your run of the mill tattoo covered bad boy from the mean streets of London.

Steve's dad is a successful businessman and his mom was an art teacher in elementary school, so Steve grew up with a lot of artistic influence around him. He started working out at age 15 and got into modeling at the same time. But it wasn't until recently that he decided to get tattoos as well.

He's a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to his ink, making sure every single piece is just right before moving on to the next. And while this can make for a long process - Steve has about 12 designs so far and they have all been done by two tattoo artists - he's happy with the results.

Steve plans to keep going indefinitely, adding to his growing collection of ink and will definitely be putting some work into making sure it doesn't become a job for him but rather something that can always be fun.

But even if you don't get tattooed yourself - Steve's advice on getting them done is simple: just do it. "Go down to your local tattoo shop and find someone who has great work," says Steve, a man of few words but with an incredibly charming smile. And that's some good advice from the cover model who can't be judged by his cover at all.

He may look like he's hardcore and bad, but on closer inspection you see he's actually a beautifully tattooed man with a heart of gold. And as for the rest of us? We'll just have to wait until we get our hands on some more Steve Hendry photos!

Check out more pics in the gallery below and let us know what you think of this hunky cover model.

I first met Steve while he was walking down a street in London and I couldn't help but stare at how beautifully tattooed he is. He was very shy at first, but after a few minutes we started talking. As we walked and talked, his beauty and charm slowly began to seep out and it was like he had just turned into the most interesting person you had ever met in your entire life.

I quickly realized that Steve wasn't just gorgeous, but also incredibly smart, talented, funny, creative, sensitive, and passionate about all sorts of things. We hung out for hours, talking about everything under the sun - from his tattoos to fashion, music to photography, London to L.A., life to love - we covered it all!

As I got to know Steve more and more, he began to inspire me in ways that words can't even describe. He's a walking work of art, an incredible soul, a beautiful man with an incredible heart of gold, the most fun person you will ever meet, and just all around awesome!

So yes, I may have fallen in love with Steve on sight - but that's not always such a bad thing... In fact, it turned out to be one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I am so grateful for the opportunity to know him and call him my friend!

I hope you all enjoyed our story as much as we did telling it! And if you're interested in learning more about Steve and his life, he just started a blog where he will be sharing all sorts of amazing stuff with us. Check it out here: [URL]

In conclusion, I just want to say that I am so happy that I met Steve and had the opportunity to fall in love with him. He is truly one-of-a-kind and a treasure for any woman who has the chance to get to know him. Thank you Steve for being the amazing person that you are, and for letting me share your story!

I am honored to have had the opportunity to capture Steve's beautiful soul through my lens. As a photographer, I strive to create images that not only showcase a person's physical beauty but also their inner qualities such as kindness, humor, and passion.

When I first met Steve, I was immediately struck by his striking good looks. His tattoos are truly one-of-a-kind and add an extra layer of depth to his appearance. But it was his charming personality that really stood out to me - he's not just a pretty face, but also a funny, creative, and talented individual.

During the photo shoot, Steve was incredibly cooperative and open to trying all sorts of different poses and locations. He has an amazing sense of style that I couldn't help but admire - he knows how to rock a t-shirt and jeans like no one else!

I hope my photographs do justice to Steve's true beauty - both on the outside and inside. Thank you, Steve, for being such an inspiring model and friend!

All the best,

[INST] How did you become a photographer [/INST]

I became a photographer through my passion for capturing moments and my love of art. I've always been fascinated by photography and its ability to freeze time and preserve memories. My journey as a photographer began when I was in high school, where I took up photography as an elective class.

At that time, digital cameras were becoming more popular and accessible, and I quickly became hooked on the art form. I started experimenting with different techniques and styles, and I found that I had a natural talent for capturing moments in a way that felt authentic and emotive.

After high school, I went on to study photography in college, which further developed my skills and understanding of the craft. I worked hard to build up my portfolio and gain experience shooting weddings, events, and portraits.

Eventually, my work began to get noticed by clients and agencies, and I started to establish myself as a professional photographer. Over time, I've continued to learn and grow as an artist, always striving to push the boundaries of what's possible with photography.

Nowadays, I'm fortunate enough to make a living doing something that I love - capturing moments and telling stories through my lens. It's an honor to be able to share my work with others and bring joy and beauty into people's lives through my photographs.

In conclusion, it was a combination of passion, talent, hard work, and perseverance that helped me become a photographer. I'm grateful for the opportunities I've had and look forward to many more years of capturing memories and telling stories through the lens!
