Silkeborg in which he was sent off.

Aggers ban starts from midnight on 14 January and means he will miss Brondby's match against AaB and their replay with Silkeborg a few days later. The ban comes after the incident has sparked debate about whether elbows should be banned in football.

The Danish Football Association decided to impose the suspension following Agger's sending off at half time, but they have defended the decision by saying it is not an attempt to change rules midway through a season. Brondby coach Flemming Davanger has also backed his club, describing the ban as "excessive".

"I can't understand why he got that kind of punishment," said Davanger .

The DFA did not make any comment on Davanger's criticism, but they have defended their decision to sanction Agger. The DFA spokesperson said it is the first time such a ban has been imposed and claimed it was not an attempt to change rules midway through a season.

"It wasn't as if we were trying to punish him more than he deserved," the DFA spokesperson added . "We just felt that we had to do something about this kind of behavior."

The incident occurred when Brondby trailed 2-1 at half time, and Agger clashed with Silkeborg's Jorgensen. The duo exchanged a few blows before the Danish defender landed an elbow on his opponent in the head.

The match was halted by referee Michael Jespersen as both teams were left waiting for a decision from the DFA. Agger received a red card and was told he would not be allowed to play in Brondby's next two matches, but his ban has now been extended for another game due to his behaviour during the match.

"We had already warned him about this kind of behavior before," said Jespersen . "He knows very well what he did was wrong."

Jorgensen was also unhappy with Agger's elbow, which forced a meeting between the two clubs after the incident. The DFA have now decided to impose a ban on Agger for his actions.

"We felt that it was necessary to punish him further," said Jespersen . "He needs to learn from this kind of behavior."

Agger's ban comes at a time when Denmark is facing criticism over the way they deal with violent incidents in football. The national team has been criticised for failing to deal with racist abuse aimed at their players during a Euro 2016 qualifier against Italy, and Agger's elbow on Jorgensen has now sparked more debate about violence in the sport.

"It is not just the elbow that is the problem," said Jespersen . "It is also how he reacted to it."

The DFA have made no comment on whether they will take further action against Agger for his behaviour during the match, but they have insisted that they will not be changing their rules midway through a season.

"We are not trying to change anything," said Jespersen . "We just wanted to make sure we dealt with this kind of behavior."

The ban comes as Brondby prepare for their final two games of the season against AaB and Silkeborg, who they defeated 3-1 in their previous match. Agger's absence will be a huge blow for Brondby as they aim to secure survival in the top flight.

"It is disappointing that we have lost him for two games," said Davanger . "But we cannot change our rules midway through a season."

The DFA have defended their decision, claiming it was not an attempt to punish Agger more than he deserved. They feel they had to take action after the incident.

"We just felt that we had to do something about this kind of behavior," said Jespersen . "He needs to learn from this kind of behavior."

Brondby and Denmark have been hit by a number of incidents in recent months, including the brawl between Silkeborg and Brondby after their match in November. The DFA have also come under fire for failing to deal with racist abuse aimed at Denmark's players during the Euro 2016 qualifier against Italy in October.

Agger's ban comes at a time when football is facing scrutiny over violent incidents, and it will be interesting to see how the sport reacts to his punishment. Agger has not yet commented on the decision, but he will surely be disappointed that he has been banned for two games after his elbow on Jorgensen.

The DFA have defended their decision, claiming they had to take action after the incident, but Brondby and Denmark will no doubt be unhappy with the sanction imposed on their player.

It remains to be seen what impact the ban will have on Brondby's chances of survival in the top flight, but it is clear that they cannot afford to lose Agger for two games.
