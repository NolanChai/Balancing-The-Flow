[INST] can you tell me how to make a numbered list in a post? [/INST]

Sure, here are the steps for making a numbered list in a post:

1. Start by writing your list items in bullet points (e.g., "1. Item 1" and "2. Item 2").
2. To make each item a numbered list item, use the "numbered list" formatting option. You can do this by clicking on the "Format" dropdown menu at the top of your post editor and selecting "Numbered List" from the options there.
3. When you're done typing in all of your items and subitems, go back to the "Format" dropdown menu and select "Normal Text" to turn off the numbered list formatting.
4. Voila! You should now have a numbered list of items.

Here's an example:

* Item 1
	+ Subitem 1a
		- Subsubitem 1a.1
		- Subsubitem 1a.2
	+ Subitem 1b
		- Subsubitem 1b.3
		- Subsubitem 1b.4
* Item 2
	+ Subitem 2a
		- Subsubitem 2a.5
		- Subsubitem 2a.6
	+ Subitem 2b
		- Subsubitem 2b.7
		- Subsubitem 2b.8
Here's how the list looks like:

* Item 1
	+ Subitem 1a
		- Subsubitem 1a.1
		- Subsubitem 1a.2
	+ Subitem 1b
		- Subsubitem 1b.3
		- Subsubitem 1b.4
* Item 2
	+ Subitem 2a
		- Subsubitem 2a.5
		- Subsubitem 2a.6
	+ Subitem 2b
		- Subsubitem 2b.7
		- Subsubitem 2b.8
