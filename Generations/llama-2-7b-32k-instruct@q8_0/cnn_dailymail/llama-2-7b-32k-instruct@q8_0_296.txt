The remains of three women were found on Thursday night in a rural property near Canberra, Australia. The two men who owned the property were subsequently charged with the murders of the three women and an unnamed fourth person. In addition to these grim discoveries, a large industrial meat grinder was also found at one of the suspects' homes.

The remains of the victims, Eurydice Dixon, 29; Jai Courtenay, 29; and Khanda Bamber, 41, were discovered in bushland near Canberra. Police said that Dixon was a professional comedian who had been on stage at the UC Refectory only hours before her death. Her body was found in an area near the university campus. Courtenay's body was found about two kilometres away in the suburb of Kingston. Bamber's remains were found 25 kilometres from her home, also near Canberra.

The suspects are Rex Taylor and John "Garry" Louttit. Both men owned a rural property where the victims' bodies were discovered. Police said that there was evidence of sexual assault on all three women's remains. Investigators also found a large industrial meat grinder at one of the suspects' homes, which they described as having the same "capacity" and "motor size" as those used in abattoirs (slaughterhouses).

The police have not released any information about how the victims were killed. The discovery of the industrial meat grinder has raised concerns that one or both suspects may have been involved in the slaughtering of animals for consumption. Police believe that Louttit and Taylor lived together at their rural property but did not live there full-time. They also said that they had received information from members of the public about suspicious activity on the rural property.

The discovery of the three victims' bodies has shocked Canberra, a city that is generally considered to be safe and well-resourced. Police have not ruled out the possibility that there may be other victims who have yet to be found. The investigation into these murders is ongoing and police are urging anyone with information to come forward.

This case highlights the importance of community involvement in policing, as members of the public were instrumental in providing information that led to the identification of the suspects. It also underscores the need for effective policing strategies to address issues such as domestic violence and sexual assault, which can have devastating consequences for victims and their families.

In conclusion, this case is a reminder of the importance of community involvement in law enforcement, as well as the need for effective policing strategies that address issues such as domestic violence and sexual assault. The identification and arrest of the suspects highlights the importance of collaboration between police and members of the public in solving crimes and bringing justice to victims and their families.
