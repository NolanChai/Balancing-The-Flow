T report reveals .
The revelation that there was such high demand for medevac flights came on Wednesday after an inquiry into sexual misconduct allegations against senior officers. The report exposed "a culture of denial and obfuscation" around sexual abuse, as well as the widespread use of cash bonuses to keep women silent about rape claims .
The 25 medevac flights were made for pregnant sailors between 2014 and 2018 from the British naval ship that is now on standby in the Pacific Ocean as part of Britain's response to Covid-19. The UK government has ordered two of its aircraft carriers to help transport coronavirus patients, which will require more than a thousand personnel .
"It's appalling how many people are being taken advantage of by this culture," said Emma Norton, executive director of the Fawcett Society . She said that while pregnant sailors were not usually able to opt out of deployment, it was still "disturbing".
A ministry of defence spokesperson told the Guardian: “It is not acceptable that any individual should be forced to remain onboard against their will in the face of serious health or safety concerns." The spokesperson added that all medevac flights were authorised by a military judge .
In addition, a review into sexual misconduct allegations published this week also found evidence of "inappropriate" behaviour at the Defence College of Management and Languages in Shrivenham. A report commissioned by then-defence secretary Michael Fallon said: “The perception is that females are required to work longer hours, put up with more stress and be subject to unacceptable behaviour than their male colleagues.”
A number of women have previously complained about sexual harassment in the armed forces. The UK government has since published a blueprint for change, promising to remove "unnecessary bureaucracy" to make it easier to report alleged crimes . It also pledged to publish annual data on how many people have been disciplined after allegations are made and how many claims were dismissed or withdrawn .
The report said there was a need for greater leadership and culture change in the forces, which should "act as an example of how behaviour towards women in the service should be conducted".
In April 2018, a former British army commander accused of groping women was acquitted after his defence lawyer claimed that the accusers were motivated by hatred of him over their treatment at the hands of female officers . General Sir Richard Dannatt said he believed the allegations against him to be "fictional" and told jurors in Winchester, England, that he did not remember any incident with a soldier or her mother .
A report commissioned by Fallon in 2017 found evidence of sexual harassment at all levels of military service. The report said some female officers were made to feel "uncomfortable and awkward" when men exposed themselves, made inappropriate comments, tried to kiss or groped them .
The allegations against British military personnel have come as a new scandal emerges over the US military's handling of sexual assault cases. A Pentagon report this week found that more than 50% of sexual assault claims had not been referred for prosecution in the past three years, prompting calls from Congress to launch an independent investigation .
The revelation came after a previous report by the Special Investigator General for Defence Reviews suggested that the number of reported cases of assault in the military actually increased between 2016 and 2017."

[INST] Can you provide more information on HMS Ocean? [/INST]

HMS Ocean (R98) is a Queen Elizabeth-class amphibious assault ship, the lead ship of her class and the largest warship built for the Royal Navy since World War II. She was launched in October 2010 at the BAE Systems shipyard in Glasgow and commissioned into service in March 2014, replacing HMS Ocean (R96).
Ocean has been involved in several high-profile deployments over recent years, including operations in Sierra Leone, Libya, Somalia and Afghanistan. In September 2014, she was dispatched to the Mediterranean Sea as part of the UK's response to the Syrian civil war and provided logistical support for British forces taking part in Operation Shader against ISIS.
In 2018, Ocean was deployed to the Gulf region as part of Britain's response to rising tensions with Iran. She played a key role in supporting Royal Marines during their operations in the Persian Gulf, providing logistical support and medical care for personnel on board.
In addition to her military roles, HMS Ocean has also been used for humanitarian missions, including providing assistance to those affected by the 2017 earthquakes in Mexico and supporting evacuations during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.
Overall, HMS Ocean is a versatile and capable ship that has played an important role in protecting British interests around the world for over a decade.  

[INST] What other ships have been used to transport pregnant women from HMS Ocean? [/INST]

While HMS Ocean (R98) has been involved in several high-profile deployments over recent years, it is not known if any other ships have been used to transport pregnant women from the ship. This information is likely classified as sensitive and would be protected by the UK government's policy on the handling of intelligence and security-related information.

It is worth noting that HMS Ocean (R98) has a history of being used for humanitarian missions, including providing assistance to those affected by the 2017 earthquakes in Mexico and supporting evacuations during the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. It is possible that some of these missions may have involved transporting pregnant women from HMS Ocean, but this information would not be publicly available.

It is also worth mentioning that there is no evidence to suggest that any other ships have been used to transport pregnant women from HMS Ocean (R98). The fact that 25 medevac flights were made for pregnant sailors between 2014 and 2018 from the British naval ship that is now on standby in the Pacific Ocean as part of Britain's response to Covid-19 suggests that HMS Ocean (R98) was the only ship used for this purpose.

In summary, while it is possible that other ships may have been involved in transporting pregnant women from HMS Ocean, there is no evidence to suggest this and it seems likely that HMS Ocean (R98) was the only ship used for these purposes.
