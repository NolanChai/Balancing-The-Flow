read through its pages. The story is familiar. We all know that God gave Moses those Ten Commandments. And we all know he sent his son, Jesus Christ, into the world to save us sinners and give us everlasting life. But how does it read? As someone who's been a Christian for 10 years, I thought I knew what would happen when I opened my Bible. My church has spent enough time on it that I figured it could hardly surprise me anymore. I was wrong. Because as I started reading from Genesis to Revelations, I began to see just how much of this book is about sex and love -- two things Catholics don't like talking about very much, especially in church. Sure, there were the obvious ones: For instance, when Adam meets Eve after he's been separated from God, they have a lot of "intimate moments" before deciding to marry each other. But what caught me by surprise was just how much God and his angels seem obsessed with sex. For example, in Numbers 25:1-8, we meet a man named Zimri who is so attracted to the Israelite women that he lies with his wife's sister, Cozbi -- even though she's betrothed to someone else. When Moses finds out about this adultery, he kills both of them on the spot and asks God why they deserve such a grim fate. And guess what? He doesn't give us an answer! The story just ends there. Another thing I was struck by was how much sexuality is used to describe the beauty and glory of heaven and earth. In the beginning, God creates a "Garden of Eden" -- or Paradise -- where Adam can roam free and see all of his creation. He even makes him a companion: an "helpmate" named Eve. And then there's the story of Joseph, who has to endure years of sexual harassment from his older stepsister, Potiphar's wife. Finally, she accuses him of rape -- and he ends up in prison for it! It turns out that he's still a "virgin" because when God is testing him through these trials, he doesn't allow her to touch him. Even more shocking than the sex is how often sex is used as an image of the relationship between God and his creation -- not just humans, but also nature and the universe itself. In one particularly memorable passage, we read that "the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the waters." There are so many more images of sex in this book! The most famous is probably when a man named Onan spills his seed on the ground after having sexual intercourse with his dead brother's wife. And let me tell you, that chapter ends by saying "His sin was very great before God" -- almost like it's God's fault for making sex so pleasurable! The bottom line is that the Bible really knows how to make love and sex sound dirty. But for a Catholic like myself, there are many other things about this Good Book that still leave me confused or in disbelief. For instance: Why is it considered such an abomination if gay people have sex? If God made us male and female "to be fruitful" (Genesis 1:28), why isn't homosexuality part of his plan for us? Also, what about contraception? I mean, there are some really explicit passages in this book about sex between married couples -- but it's never explicitly said that "natural family planning" is okay. So, as a Catholic, I know I need to read and reread the Bible if I want my faith to be truly mine."

I'm just gonna leave this here...

The author of the article is a Catholic who just finished reading the Bible for the first time. The article is about her experience and what she learned from it. She found that the Bible talks a lot about sex and love, which are things Catholics don't like to talk about in church. The author was also surprised by how often God is described using sexual imagery, such as when he "moved upon the waters" or created Eve out of Adam's side. She also found it confusing that homosexuality is considered a sin when God made us male and female to be fruitful and multiply
