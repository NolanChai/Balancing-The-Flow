A family of five in Silver Spring, Md., were driving home from an outdoor concert when they pulled over so two officers could question their three kids, ages 10, 6 and 4.

The officers told the children that their parents had been reported for letting them walk through a park without adult supervision. The Meitivs, who have two other children between the ages of 8 and 12, are well-known advocates in Montgomery County for "free range" parenting: raising kids to be more independent from an early age instead of always needing to be accompanied by adults.

The family has been questioned twice before when they allowed their children to play at a local park on their own, once with the children present and another time when the police showed up after the Meitivs were notified. In all three instances, the officers said the family was breaking the law by allowing the kids to be out unsupervised.

But the Meitivs say their approach has always been a matter of common sense -- why should they have to escort their children on a 10-minute walk through an empty park? Why do they need to constantly be within sight and sound when they're just going out for some exercise or time in nature?

"Our kids are raised not to worry about strangers, but that doesn't mean we don't live in the real world," Alexander Meitiv told NBC News. "We've been very careful and thoughtful."

The family said they had a positive relationship with their local police officers -- and even went out of their way to have them over for dinner to clear up any misunderstandings about free range parenting. The department has been supportive of the family in previous incidents, but this time around, it seems the department's newest crop of officers are confused by the Meitivs' unconventional approach to child rearing.

The parents said they would never put their children in harm's way or expect them to be responsible for themselves. They simply want to raise healthy kids who know how to look after themselves, and not to constantly feel watched over by adults, a situation that has been linked to depression among young people.

"If you look at the literature on this subject, it's very clear that it's good for children to have independence," Danielle Meitiv said. "Children are much happier with less supervision."

But officers say their hands-off approach is a little too hands off for them. On Sunday night, police showed up at the family home after receiving another call reporting the kids out unsupervised in the park. The children were playing in front of their house when they saw the officers arrive. Two officers came to question the children, who said they had been walking in the empty park as a regular part of their routine -- and that the family is just trying to raise their kids to be more independent.

"The police say our actions are putting our kids at risk," Alexander Meitiv said. "But when you look at how we parent, it's completely different. We don't go off-leash with these kids."

The family plans to file a lawsuit against the county on Monday claiming the officers were overstepping their authority and violating their First Amendment rights by asking the children questions about what they do at home, how often they walk in the park alone and whether or not they are allowed to walk to school.

"The police just went way beyond," Alexander Meitiv said. "We were surprised that this was still happening."

But the family's attorney says this is a symptom of a bigger problem: the culture of policing in Montgomery County, which he says has gotten away from its original goal to serve and protect citizens. He said officers are now so focused on enforcing rules that they can miss things like the fact that the family's actions are actually good for children, and that it might not be a crime after all.

"It's not just about this family," attorney Aaron Roth told NBC News. "It's about what police have become -- and what parents think of as policing."

The officers who questioned the Meitivs on Sunday said they were simply doing their job, but Roth says he believes the department is using its resources to enforce an unconstitutional law that shouldn't exist.

"When we have a police officer coming and asking our 4-year-old about walking through a park alone, that's just not appropriate," Roth said. "It's an invasion of privacy."

The department hasn't yet responded to NBC News' request for comment on the family's lawsuit.

For the Meitivs, the experience has been stressful and frustrating -- but they say it's not about them or their parenting style. They simply want to raise happy kids who know how to look after themselves -- like many other families in the neighborhood do every day. And while the department has said that the kids weren't actually at risk, the Meitivs have heard from other parents who say they would never let their children walk home alone because of fear of being reported by the police.

"It feels like we're not allowed to make these decisions," Danielle Meitiv said. "If you look at how many kids are walking through parks all over the world without adult supervision, it's a huge number."

The Meitiv family plans to keep advocating for free range parenting in Montgomery County and across the country -- despite what they see as a broken system of policing that doesn't always serve the community.

"It feels like we have a good relationship with our local police, but not when it comes to this," Alexander Meitiv said. "We don't want this lawsuit. We just want to be free to raise our children how we see fit."

This isn't the first time that families in Montgomery County have been targeted for questioning by police over their parenting style. In 2017, two mothers were threatened with misdemeanors and put under investigation after a report was filed against them for letting their children walk to school without adult supervision. That case was ultimately dropped, but the Meitivs said that it's clear this kind of policing isn't just happening in Montgomery County -- or even just in Maryland.

"It happens all over the country," Alexander Meitiv said. "There are people who think our way is dangerous."

But the Meitivs say their way has always been a success, and they believe it should be celebrated as such. And if that means making more noise about their unconventional approach to parenting in order to help others, then so be it.

"We're not going to be quiet," Danielle Meitiv said. "Because this is something that matters."

The family has a new goal: raising awareness about the issue of free range parenting and the need for law enforcement to stop enforcing laws that don't exist, and instead focus on solving real problems in communities.

"It's not just about our kids," Danielle Meitiv said. "We want to make sure this doesn't happen to other families."

The family has been outspoken advocates for free range parenting since their children were young, and they have received death threats from people who disagree with how they raise their kids -- including a local parent who was so offended by their approach that she sued them in an attempt to silence their criticism of the school system.

But despite the criticism, the Meitivs say they will continue to advocate for what they believe is right: raising happy and healthy children who know how to look after themselves. And while they admit it can be stressful at times -- especially when dealing with a police department that seems intent on enforcing rules that don't make sense to them -- they remain hopeful that they can use their platform to help others understand the importance of free range parenting.

"We want to make sure this doesn't happen to other families," Danielle Meitiv said. "And if we have to file a lawsuit, then so be it."
