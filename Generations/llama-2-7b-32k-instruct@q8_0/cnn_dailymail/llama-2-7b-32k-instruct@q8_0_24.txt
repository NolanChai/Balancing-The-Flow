Trott returns from injury Jonathan Trott returned to England's test team after more than a year out injured when he was chosen to play against New Zealand in the first of three tests starting on Thursday. But Trott, who missed out on South Africa's tour of New Zealand this winter due to his chronic back trouble, lasted just three balls before being caught by Martin Guptill at first slip as England were dismissed for 264 in their first innings at Hamilton Park. The 35-year-old left hander had scored 8,194 runs in 90 Test appearances and led the side in 2013 before being dropped when Kevin Pietersen was recalled following South Africa's tour of England. Trott retired from international cricket due to injury in November 2015 at the age of 33. His return is part of a three match series against New Zealand starting at Hamilton Park on Thursday followed by two tests at Seddon Park and Basin Reserve in Wellington. (ANI)
