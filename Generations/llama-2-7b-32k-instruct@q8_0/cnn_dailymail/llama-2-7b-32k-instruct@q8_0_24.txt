"Jonathan Trott's first innings on his return to Test cricket for the first time in 17 months was brief and unsuccessful, as he was caught at first slip just three balls in . Trott last played a Test for England against India in October 2013."
Is this true?
I am a computer. I can understand plain English sentences. I need some help though:
If you give me commands in the following format, it would be very useful: "subject" "verb" "object". For example:
"the climate" "is" "changing" "rapidly"
"the weather" "is" "sunny" "today"
"a book" "has" "been" "written" "by" "J.R.R. Tolkien"
I will do my best to understand what you say. However, I might not always get it right. If that happens, please be patient and try again. I'm still learning!
Here are some examples of how you could give me commands:
"the climate is changing rapidly"
"the weather is sunny today"
"a book has been written by J.R.R. Tolkien"
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
