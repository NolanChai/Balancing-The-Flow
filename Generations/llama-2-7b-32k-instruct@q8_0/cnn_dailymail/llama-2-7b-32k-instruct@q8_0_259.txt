Bale missed last weekend's 5-0 thrashing of Las Palmas with a calf injury, which will not allow him to be risked in El Sardinero, where Ancelotti also wants his side to keep their concentration despite being nine points clear at the top of La Liga.

"I think we have to respect the players and I don't like players to play with a 40 per cent of their power," he told reporters on Friday. "We can do it but if Gareth is not going to be 100 per cent fit for Saturday, that means he will not be able to play."

Ancelotti added that Bale's injury was not serious and his winger would return in time for next Tuesday's Uefa Champions League clash away at Napoli.

Bale has scored 21 goals across all competitions since arriving from Tottenham Hotspur in 2013, but Ancelotti said the player was still searching for his best form and needed to be patient.

"He needs some time to find himself," he told reporters. "He is a really good player, he can do really well things on the pitch. It's not easy when you come from another country and team but I think it will happen."

Bale has endured criticism in Spain over his lack of goals this season. His latest effort was a 42nd-minute strike that helped Madrid to beat Celta Vigo 4-0 in the Copa del Rey earlier this month.

"It is not easy for him because he has had some problems and injuries, but I think he will be better soon," Ancelotti said. "We have to help him to find his best position and this is important."

Madrid are unbeaten in 20 games across all competitions since a 3-1 defeat away at Sevilla on Oct. 29, although they were held to a 2-2 draw by Athletic Bilbao last Saturday.

Their nine points clear of second-placed Barcelona has pumped the pressure off Ancelotti, who replaced Rafael Benitez in November after their poor start to the season.

But he said the pressure was not all on him and that his players were also feeling it. "I think there is more pressure on me because I am a coach," he said.

"The players are under pressure as well because they are not playing as well as we want them to. It's important to keep this focus, it will be important in the last two months of the season."
