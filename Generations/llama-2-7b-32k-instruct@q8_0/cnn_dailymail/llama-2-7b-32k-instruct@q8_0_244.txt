INT. BERLIN, GERMANY - DAY

A group of young people gather in an abandoned warehouse in the heart of Berlin. They are dressed in black, their faces hidden behind masks and goggles. Lilly (Sophia Lillis) takes the microphone and begins to sing a haunting melody in German. As she sings, the audience is transported back to the 1920s, when Berlin was a hub of art, culture, and revolutionary spirit.

As Lilly finishes her song, Max (Finn Wolfhard) takes the microphone. He delivers an impassioned speech about the power of music and creativity in the face of oppression. Olaf (Jack Dylan Grazer) joins them onstage, spinning records that blend German folk music with avant-garde beats. Anja (Chesley Sullenberger) dances gracefully across the stage, her movements a mix of modern and traditional dance techniques.

Hans (Miles Gaston Villanueva) stands in the shadows, his face hidden behind a balaclava. He watches the performance with a mixture of pride and concern. He knows that the cabaret is a risky enterprise, but he also believes that it's their only hope for survival.

Eva (Madison Wolfe) joins them onstage, her movements fluid and sensual. She sings in Spanish, her voice full of longing and heartbreak. Paul (Jack Reynor) takes the microphone next, delivering a fiery political speech that rallies the crowd. Brigitte (Sarah Paulson), the owner of the café where they meet, looks on proudly from the back of the room.

As the performance ends, cheers and applause echo through the warehouse. The young people gather together for a celebratory dance party, their faces radiant with joy and defiance. But as they dance, they can't shake the feeling that they're being watched.

Cut to: A Nazi soldier, his uniform stained with blood, stands in the shadows outside the warehouse. He watches the young people with a mixture of anger and disgust. He knows that their cabaret is a symbol of resistance against the regime's oppression.

FADE TO BLACK.

As the judge sentences them to prison terms, Brigitte looks on with a mixture of sadness and anger. She knows that they will never forget what happened here tonight. As they are led away, the young people sing a final song together, their voices echoing off the walls.

The sound of marching boots echoes through the streets as a group of people gather in front of the police station where the young people were detained. They are dressed in black, their faces hidden behind masks and goggles. Brigitte stands among them, her eyes fixed on the building.

As they wait for the prisoners to emerge, they hear the sound of a distant voice echoing off the walls. It's Lilly, singing a haunting melody in German. As she sings, the crowd joins in, their voices blending together in a defiant anthem.

The doors open, and the young people emerge, their faces bruised and battered
