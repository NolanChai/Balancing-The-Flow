The 13-minute clip shows them using automatic rifles to fire at targets and conducting military drills on the battlefield in Syria's Idlib province . The footage was originally posted by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights but was later taken down by the monitoring group due to fear of it "inciting terrorism".

In a statement, SOHR said: 'This video came just hours before two attacks launched by these women on positions in the province of Idlib and Hama that resulted in many deaths. It is likely that the video was published intentionally'.

The footage has sparked widespread controversy across social media, with critics calling for Facebook to take action against it being shared on their platform.

One said: 'This sickens me to my core. How can Facebook let this kind of content be posted? This is inciting violence and terrorism'.

Another added: 'I am absolutely appalled that a company like Facebook would allow such content to be posted publicly. It's disgusting and disturbing, it gives me the chills'.

The footage has been viewed more than 20 million times on Facebook and hundreds of thousands of people have shared it in shock.

One said: 'This is really frightening... These women are taking their deadly serious to a whole new level'

Another added: 'This is a prime example of the evils that come from extremist ideologies. It's disturbing and disgusting'.

The video comes as ISIS continues to make gains in Idlib, which has been under siege by Syrian regime forces for months. The area is controlled by various armed groups, including jihadi militants.

In March, 42 women were executed by ISIS for refusing to marry fighters or leave their homes during airstrikes in the province of Idlib. They were taken from their villages and shot dead after being accused of 'sowing corruption on earth'.

The video has been condemned by rights groups, who say it is an attack on humanity and shows how extremist groups use violence to spread hatred.

One group said: 'This video is a reminder that we need to take a stand against hate and intolerance. We cannot let extremists like this destroy our world'.

Another added: 'It's disgusting what these women are doing. They are using their bodies and their minds to spread terrorism, they are not empowered at all'.

The video has sparked a discussion about the role of women in jihadist groups and whether or not it is right for them to be involved in such activities.

One person said: 'This is just sad. These women are being used as pawns by extremists who want nothing but destruction.'

Another added: 'It's unfortunate that some people use religion to justify violence and hate'.

The video has been a talking point on social media, with many people expressing their shock and disgust at the footage.

One person said: 'This is just plain evil. These women are being used as tools by ISIS to spread fear and hatred'.

Another added: 'It's a shame that we live in a world where hate groups like this exist.'

The video has also sparked debate about the role of social media companies in regulating harmful content. Many people have called for Facebook to take action against it being shared on their platform.

One person said: 'It's unacceptable that Facebook allows this kind of content to be shared publicly. They need to do more to protect users from this kind of hate and violence'.

Another added: 'Social media companies have a responsibility to regulate harmful content, especially when it comes to extremist groups like ISIS'.
