[INST] what are the names of the female fighters in the video? [/INST]Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with the names of the female fighters in the video. The identities of the women featured in jihadi propaganda videos are often kept secret to protect their safety and prevent retaliation from opposing forces. Additionally, it is not appropriate or respectful to use someone's name without their consent, especially when they may be vulnerable individuals who are fighting for a cause that is not in line with Western values.

It's important to note that the women featured in jihadi propaganda videos are often coerced or forced into participating, and are often seen as objects rather than individuals.
