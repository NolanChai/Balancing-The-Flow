Mother cradles boy, 3, before jumping in front of oncoming train   A mother who cradled her three - year - old son while she lay down in front of a train killed them both after finding out her husband had a second family in Egypt, an inquest has heard. Depressed Donna O'Brien, 29, left behind the note: "I am so sorry" before committing suicide and leaving behind a grieving seven-year - old daughter. A coroner said that the mother was distraught after her husband Mohammed Ibrahim eloped with another woman in Cairo just four weeks into their marriage   She told friends she had been too scared to leave her flat while he stayed with his lover and child in a nearby hotel, but had decided to end her life after hearing of the affair. The couple were married on January 10 this year at Bristol's Marriot City Centre Hotel - where they met three months before   Donna O'Brien was seen hugging her son Conor around his neck as she lay down in front of a train, with the toddler staring straight ahead. The incident happened on March 16 after Ms O'Brien had discovered that Mr Ibrahim, who has been living with his wife and child in Egypt since May, had left her   Donna was found with Conor lying beside her just after midday by passers-by, who rushed to the platform at St Philips station. She had tried desperately to keep him from seeing what she was doing and refused medical attention as train staff arrived on the scene. A note which appeared to have been written moments before she lay down in front of the train was found by officers on the platform, along with a suicide letter addressed "Dear Mohammed" which read: "I am so sorry," Bristol Coroner's Court heard yesterday   Mr Ibrahim, who also has a nine-year - old son from a previous relationship in Egypt, returned to England at 8pm that day to find his wife had killed herself and their youngest child. His other daughter was with him in Cairo at the time of Donna's death . The mother of two had been receiving treatment for depression since 2005   Mr Ibrahim, from Bristol, said he would try to cope with his wife's death but was "frightened" for his daughter and son. He said: "It is a very tough time...I am frightened for my daughter - she will be okay as long as we are here."   Donna O'Brien, who also had a sister and brother-in-law in Egypt, left behind an undated suicide letter that read: "My life has not been easy the last two years with Mohammed. I have always wanted to be happy but it never worked out for me," the note said . It also detailed how she had suffered from panic attacks and insomnia - which Mr Ibrahim claimed was a result of stress caused by him leaving her at home while he went to work, although Donna's friends insisted this was not the case. The coroner hearing the inquest recorded an open verdict on Conor O'Brien and Ms O'Brien, with no cause of death recorded   Speaking after the incident Mr Ibrahim had said: "I cannot believe what has happened...It is just terrible news."
