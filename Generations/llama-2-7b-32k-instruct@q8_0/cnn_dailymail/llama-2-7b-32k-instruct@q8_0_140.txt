Liverpool booked its place in the FA Cup semi-finals by defeating Blackburn Rovers, which lost its first match under new manager Gary Bowyer. Philippe Coutinho scored two goals and added an assist in a 3-0 victory at Ewood Park on Saturday that puts Liverpool into the final four of the competition for the first time since 2012. Jordan Henderson also got his name on the scoresheet, giving him four goals this season. Blackburn lost its opening game under Bowyer as it fell behind with Coutinho's goal in the ninth minute and never recovered. Liverpool took control of the match with a second-half rally that included James Milner's effort to make it 2-0, then Henderson's pass to set up Coutinho for his second goal in the 70th minute. The Reds are in their first FA Cup semi-final since reaching the final against West Ham United in 2015 and they will next face Middlesbrough, which beat Bolton Wanderers, in April 1996. Liverpool also advanced to the quarter-finals of the Europa League on Thursday with a 1-0 win over Astra Giurgiu in Romania.
