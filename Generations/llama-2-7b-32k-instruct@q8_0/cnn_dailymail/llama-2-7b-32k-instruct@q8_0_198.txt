MI5 is concerned that terrorists or hostile states might try to enlist British citizens to commit atrocities under their own names on foreign soil .

The warning comes days ahead of a report expected by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee into why MI5 failed to prevent the March 24 crash. The findings could also highlight risks in the UK itself, for example from terrorists or rogue employees in Britain’s nuclear deterrent Trident submarines or public services such as railways and airlines.

MI5 says there is a “risk” of Britons being targeted by overseas intelligence agencies seeking to carry out attacks abroad with the UK government’s knowledge . In an assessment published last year, MI5 warned that the risk of foreign powers using UK nationals as assets in sensitive roles was real.

MI5 is also concerned about foreign states “cultivating” British citizens for intelligence gathering purposes and potential compromise to provide access to sensitive information . Foreign governments might seek to target people with knowledge of sensitive technology or policy matters, MI5 said in the document published last year as part of its annual assessment.

In a statement on Wednesday, an MI5 spokesperson said: “MI5 is aware that British citizens may be exposed to coercion and exploitation by foreign states seeking to commit acts against UK interests abroad and has assessed this risk .”

The agency says it works with other intelligence organisations including the FBI, Germany’s BKA federal police force and France’s DGSI.

MI5 said the threat from rogue workers was also of concern in Britain itself but did not provide further details. The document published last year said that British citizens were at risk of being targeted by foreign governments seeking to recruit them as agents, with the potential for compromise of sensitive information or technology.

It also warned that hostile states might seek to co-opt members of the public to carry out attacks against UK interests on British soil “including nuclear weapons systems”, though it did not specify when this was likely to happen.

The disclosure comes a day after former prime minister Gordon Brown said in an interview with the BBC that he would be willing to take risks if they could prevent future airline terrorism but only if it had been proven that terrorists knew of and exploited security loopholes when planning the attack.

Brown, who is now a Labour lawmaker, was appointed chairman of Britain’s Intelligence and Security Committee last year . The ISC will publish its report on the plane crash in October. (Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Hugh Lawson)<s>
