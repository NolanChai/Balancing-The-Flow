As a result of the incident, the government is considering legislation to prevent terrorists from taking jobs that involve handling large quantities of radioactive material or explosives. MI5's director general, Andrew Parker, has previously warned about the risk posed by rogue workers with access to sensitive information in public service jobs, including the health and transport sectors. Lubitz was a German citizen who had worked as an airline pilot for Lufthansa until 2008, when he was forced out of his job over allegations about his mental health that were not fully investigated by the company at the time . Lubitz is believed to have been suffering from severe depression in recent months. He was declared unfit to work after a string of incidents in which he was found asleep during flights, but returned to work in 2013 with the blessing of his employers and his union . Although there had been suggestions that Lubitz had links to Islamist extremism, the Bavarian Criminal Police said on Thursday they were investigating whether this might have played a role in his actions. The crash is also being investigated by Austriaâ€™s counter-terror agency, which has so far found no evidence of any terror links .
