A woman who was tragically killed when her car washed away in flood waters has been identified as an elderly great-grandmother who was popping out for milk.   Anne Jarmain, 86, had gone missing after heavy rain caused the water levels to rise in her local suburb of Maitland on Monday evening (19 January).   The woman's daughter Susan said she went missing around 4pm that day and she did not return home until Wednesday morning.   She added: "I rang Anne last night at about four o'clock to say goodnight - that was the last time I spoke to her."   She said the family had no idea of what happened but believed a waterlogged bridge may have been a factor in her disappearance.
