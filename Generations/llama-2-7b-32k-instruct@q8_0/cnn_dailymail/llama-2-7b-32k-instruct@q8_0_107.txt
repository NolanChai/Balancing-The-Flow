of their company's main social media account this morning following the incident, which is believed to have been caused by hackers who infected the worker's computer with ransomware, according to The Guardian .

A video posted on Scooter's Facebook page showed a woman speaking in a sexually explicit manner and using sexual terms for body parts as the background changed from the coffee shop's usual logo and colour scheme to pornographic images. It was not possible to tell when the hack took place, but it is thought that an employee clicked on a malicious link sent via email . Scooter's Coffee was founded in 1998 and has more than 200 franchises across the US, according to its website . The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The pornographic video, which had been removed by this afternoon but a copy of which remains available online, also appears on Twitter as well as Pornhub and Xvideos websites. It shows an adult film actress named Karla Kush speaking in a sexually explicit manner and using sexual terms for body parts while images of naked women appear on the screen behind her. A video with similar content was uploaded to Scooter's YouTube channel, which has also now been removed . The company said that it had contacted law enforcement officials after discovering the hack and was working to restore its social media accounts and protect customers' personal data .

"The incident is not a reflection of our team members' values or behavior. We have worked hard for many years to establish strong, trustworthy relationships with our guests. This is an unfortunate situation," Scooter's said in a statement released on its Twitter account. "We are taking immediate steps to address the issue and will be implementing new measures to ensure these types of attacks can not occur again."

In a second statement, the company added that it would work with law enforcement agencies as well as external experts to investigate how the hack was carried out . It also apologized for any distress caused by the incident. The pornography video was removed from Scooter's Facebook and Twitter accounts within hours of its uploading . It remained on the company's YouTube channel, however, where it has more than 10,000 views to date.

Scooter's Coffee said it had not received any reports of customers affected by the incident or their personal information stolen . The company also declined to say how much ransom was paid for unlocking its Facebook account, and did not state whether it had used backup data to restore the account following the attack. A security researcher at Malwarebytes Labs tweeted that Scooter's was infected by Emotet, a banking trojan . "Emotet is able to install other malicious software on infected systems which can be anything from keyloggers to ransomware," he said.

"Sending an email to someone you know with a link to the latest Avengers movie trailer, and asking them to click, might seem harmless enough. But clicking that link could lead to Emotet infecting your system."

The company has been asked for further comment via social media but has yet to respond. The pornography video was first flagged by Twitter users on Wednesday morning, with many of whom suggested it may have been an attempt at a "sextortion" scam . Users also shared memes mocking the coffee shop chain and others making sexual references."
