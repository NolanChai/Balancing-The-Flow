A former production assistant on "The Weinstein Company" television series "Project Runway" says she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein and is now working with a lawyer to report him to police in New York City for misconduct, according to reports. (Published Wednesday, Oct. 10, 2018)

An attorney for Weinstein, who was fired from "Project Runway" over the harassment accusations last week, declined to comment Tuesday on whether his client plans to take legal action against his accuser or on how the lawsuit might affect Harvey Weinstein's upcoming trial in New York on charges he raped and sexually assaulted two women.

Weinstein is set to go before a jury next month for a criminal trial on three charges of predatory sexual assault, which could bring him life imprisonment if convicted. He has denied the charges against him, as well as accusations from more than 70 women that he sexually harassed or sexually assaulted them.

In a statement released Tuesday by attorney Ben Brafman Jr., Weinstein's lawyer said "he denies each and every allegation of nonconsensual sexual contact" made in the lawsuit and was looking forward to his trial on Jan. 7, 2019 . The lawsuit also claims Weinstein had an outburst during a meeting with the woman, who worked at the firm where he is a client, when she declined his offer of assistance.

The attorney said that "the decision was made to settle this case in order to avoid further costly litigation and distractions," but Brafman would not elaborate on how much Weinstein paid to make the settlement happen or who represented the plaintiff. He also declined to comment on whether Weinstein plans to take legal action against the woman for defamation after she made her claims public in a New York Times op-ed published last week and gave an interview about the incident to the New Yorker .

The lawsuit, which was filed Tuesday morning in federal court in Manhattan, alleges Weinstein "forced himself" on her in his office while she was alone with him in October 2016, when she was just 22 years old and he was 65. She says he "thrust his tongue into her mouth," groped her chest and groped herself underneath the table where she sat before telling her to leave the room while continuing to grope himself through his pants .

Brafman said that Weinstein had been at a meeting with law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison in New York City when he and the woman, whose name is not publicly known because she wants to remain anonymous, were alone together for a few minutes. Brafman did not elaborate on why they were alone or where Weinstein was before the alleged incident occurred . He said that after the woman left his office, Weinstein "had an outburst."

"He became enraged and screamed at me in front of my supervisors," she wrote . The lawsuit also claims Weinstein tried to reach out to her on social media but she blocked him. It alleges he sent a text message reading: "I am so sorry you had such an awful experience. I want to personally apologize and make this right."

The lawsuit also claims Weinstein is trying to intimidate the woman by "taking legal actions against her, filing defamation suits against her and making false allegations about her that she did not make in her article or interview with the New Yorker." She said that as a result of his alleged conduct toward her, she has been unable to find work in her field .

The woman told The New York Times last week that Weinstein called her into his office and asked if "he could give her a massage" when they were alone at the law firm one day after he had met with his attorney. She said no, but as she was getting up to leave she said he grabbed her breast, placed it on his crotch area and said "just like that."

She said Weinstein told her "things would be different" if they worked together in a meeting room, though the door had been closed during their conversation . She did not report the incident to her superiors.

The woman also wrote in an interview with The New Yorker that when she walked into his office and saw him alone, he immediately asked her "if he could give her a massage or if she needed anything else." She said no and tried to leave after saying hello but Weinstein kept insisting on giving her a massage until she said OK.

She said during the massage, which was done through his pants while they were seated in chairs across from each other, he "put his tongue into my mouth" before she felt him trying to get her breast out of her shirt and move it towards his crotch . She says she froze but as soon as she thought about leaving the room, he moved his hand away.

She wrote that afterward Weinstein continued to make "inappropriate comments," telling her "'I'm a famous movie producer,'" "You should not dress like this if you want to meet with people'" and that he could help her get work as an actress because she was so beautiful."

The woman told The New York Times that at the time of the incident, Weinstein was helping her find work on movies and TV shows through his company, The Weinstein Company. She said when he made a comment about her breasts she "thought it was an insult," but thought nothing more of it until months later when other women came forward with similar stories .

Weinstein has denied the charges against him, as well as accusations from more than 70 women that he sexually harassed or sexually assaulted them. The lawsuit also claims Weinstein is trying to intimidate her by "taking legal actions" against her and making false allegations about her, but she denies those claims.

Brafman told NBC News in a statement that "there was no settlement" and that the case had been settled with an offer of mediation . He also said he would not comment on whether Weinstein plans to take legal action against his accuser for defamation because it is part of a private matter.

Weinstein's attorney declined to elaborate further on the matter, but Brafman did say that "the decision was made to settle this case in order to avoid further costly litigation and distractions."
