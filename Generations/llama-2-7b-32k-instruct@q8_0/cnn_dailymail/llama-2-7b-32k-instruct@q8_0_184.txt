Russian Space Agency Attempts to Regain Control of Spinning Out-of-Control Cargo Ship   The Russian space agency, Roscosmos, is attempting to regain control of a spaceship that is spinning out of control in orbit. Progress M-27M appears to have suffered a major malfunction moments after lifting off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome on Dec. 30. The Soyuz rocket was carrying 6.5 tons of cargo to the International Space Station (ISS). Russian officials say they were aware of the problem before launch, and had expected it to occur once in every four or five missions. They also noted that this particular mission's flight computer had been replaced three times before the launch due to repeated failures. The incident marks the first time that a Progress spacecraft has failed in orbit since 2015, when two of them were lost due to technical issues. Progress M-27M is now flying at an altitude of about 243 miles (390 km) above Earth's surface and is expected to reenter the atmosphere within a week. The spacecraft contains toxic fuel that will pose a hazard if it falls to the ground, so Roscosmos plans to bring it down in a designated area, most likely over the Pacific Ocean.
