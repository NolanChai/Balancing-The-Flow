As of now, there is no confirmation of any astronauts on board Progress M-27M. The spacecraft was launched in January 2018 and was supposed to remain in orbit for two months before returning to Earth with cargo and experiments. However, it appears that the spacecraft suffered a major malfunction moments after 16:05 UTC (13:05 Moscow time), and has not responded to commands from the ground control station.

Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, is attempting to regain control of the spaceship, but it is unclear if there are any astronauts on board at this moment. The incident has caused concern among experts in the space industry and the safety of the astronauts remains a top priority.

It is important to note that Progress M-27M was not carrying any humans when it launched, but it did have cargo and experiments on board. The spacecraft was scheduled to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) in February 2018, where it would remain for two months before returning to Earth.

The incident is a reminder of the risks involved in spaceflight, and highlights the importance of careful planning and maintenance. The ISS has been visited by numerous spacecraft over the years, and it remains one of the most important platforms for scientific research and exploration.

Roscosmos has stated that they are taking the incident very seriously, and have launched a investigation into what went wrong. It is unclear if there were any warning signs before the malfunction occurred, but it is possible that the spacecraft was not properly maintained or serviced.

In light of this incident, it is important for space agencies to take steps to ensure the safety of astronauts and cosmonauts. This includes regular maintenance and testing of spacecraft, as well as careful planning and coordination between ground control and mission control.

The ISS has been visited by numerous spacecraft over the years, and it remains one of the most important platforms for scientific research and exploration. It is hoped that this incident will serve as a reminder to all space agencies of the importance of safety and preparation in spaceflight.

In conclusion, the uncontrolled spinning of Progress M-27M is a concerning development in the world of space travel. Roscosmos is taking steps to regain control of the spacecraft, but it remains unclear if there are any astronauts on board at this moment. The incident highlights the importance of careful planning and maintenance in spaceflight, and serves as a reminder of the risks involved in exploring the final frontier.

As the investigation continues, it is hoped that lessons will be learned from this incident to ensure the safety of future astronauts and cosmonauts. The ISS remains an important platform for scientific research and exploration, and it is essential that space agencies continue to work together to ensure its safety and efficiency.

In the meantime, it is important to remember that the crew on board the International Space Station remain safe and are not affected by this incident. It is also hoped that the investigation will provide a better understanding of what went wrong with Progress M-27M and help prevent similar incidents in the future.
