izarre phenomenon ‚Äì which has been dubbed a ‚Äòwarm blob‚Äô as it hovers over the Pacific Ocean just south of Alaska and is hotter than usual ‚Äì could be linked to the freak winter weather in parts of Europe and North America, scientists say

This map shows where the warmer-than-usual water masses were found at the end of 2013 and beginning of 2014. The area of warm ocean is labelled ‚ÄòBlob‚Äô

The blob measures around a hundred miles across, but has a radius of around 1,500 to 2,000km, which would make it roughly the size of France or Spain.

It was first detected in September last year by scientists aboard the research ship R/V Thompson while they were carrying out work for the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

They have said that the warm blob could be responsible for causing a 20% rise in sea-surface temperatures over a large part of the Pacific. They also found that winds blowing away from the Blob were pushing it further south than usual, which has led to warmer conditions along California and Washington State.

However, scientists are not sure whether the blob is linked to this winter‚Äôs freak weather events in Europe, such as the exceptionally cold temperatures and snowfall at Christmas which caused chaos for many people. They have also been studying whether it could be responsible for California having its worst drought on record .

The Blob has already been studied by scientists in a paper published earlier this year in Science . Dr Josh Willis, from NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., and an author of the paper, said: ‚ÄòBecause of the size of this blob we‚Äôre wondering whether it may be responsible for recent weather patterns.

‚ÄòFor example, a warmer ocean might delay or prevent winter storms that would normally cool things down.‚Äô

He said he was not sure how the blob had formed, but that it seemed to be linked with an El Nino phenomenon which occurs when winds blowing in from the Pacific cause upwelling of colder water from deeper down. He added: ‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt know exactly what happens as a result, but maybe we have warmer sea-surface temperatures.‚Äô

They said that the blob could have caused California to experience its worst drought on record . The researchers also say it may be linked with volcanic activity near Japan which occurred between 2012 and 2014. Dr Willis added: ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs an interesting mystery. We don‚Äôt know whether this will help explain the weather patterns we are seeing in Europe or California, but I think there is definitely a connection.‚Äô

NASA‚Äôs Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheric Sciences in Maryland said the blob may have been caused by volcanic activity near Japan which occurred between 2012 and 2014, although it has not ruled out other causes. The laboratory added that it was still trying to figure out how exactly the blob had formed.

It added: ‚ÄòThe Blob is an example of a recent phenomenon known as a warm anomaly in the ocean; the term refers to changes in sea-surface temperature in parts of the Pacific Ocean that are much warmer than expected.‚Äô

It is not the first time a warm blob has appeared, but it seems to be one of the largest. It would seem that there have been similar blobs around 1905 and 1947, which did not cause extreme weather events.

This is really bad news. I hope scientists are able to figure it out soon! The weather has been so crazy this winter! ‚òîÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

The blob could be due to a slow down in the Gulf Stream which will eventually lead to a cooling of Europe and the east coast of America. If that happens then there is likely to be an ice age again. The warm water in the Atlantic will mix with cold water from Greenland and Antarctica. It would take about 20 years for this process to complete.

I think what you're saying is correct, but I also think a warmer ocean may delay or prevent winter storms that would normally cool things down." It doesn't sound like the blob is responsible for causing these storms though! They're just speculating as to whether it might be contributing.

I don't understand how a blob could cause climate change? The article didn't really explain it at all, and I would love to learn more about what's happening with our oceans lately! Can you help me understand this more please? üåäüí¶‚òÄÔ∏è
