4-match pre-season tournament from July 21 to August 6, along with three other teams yet to be confirmed .

The International Champions Cup will be played at a number of venues across North and South America including the Hard Rock Stadium (Miami Gardens, Fla.), FedExField (Landover, Md.), MetLife Stadium (East Rutherford, N.J.) and Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, Calif.).

Manchester United has signed a new deal to play at Hard Rock Stadium for two years until 2019. The American side said that the club will participate in all four of their home games next year.

Chelsea, meanwhile, is set to play in Miami on July 28 and will also take part in an International Champions Cup match at MetLife Stadium on August 4th . Both clubs have already confirmed they'll be playing in Sweden and Norway prior to the International Champions Cup. Manchester United has been scheduled for matches against the New York Red Bulls in Gothenburg, Sweden on July 25 as well as a match against AC Milan in Oslo, Norway on July 30th .

The full schedule of the tournament will be announced by the end of April with tickets available from May 1st. The matches are not expected to count towards the Premier League or UEFA competitions.

It's worth mentioning that both Manchester United and Chelsea have participated in this type of tournament in recent years, but never together. Chelsea has been taking part in the International Champions Cup for four years running while Manchester United joined forces with AC Milan to compete against each other two times. The last edition was held between 2014 and 2015 when both teams played in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Manchester United's Manager, Jos√© Mourinho will be taking part of the International Champions Cup for the third time while Chelsea's Maurizio Sarri is set to take his team to America after having been announced as manager on July 2nd .

Sarri will be taking over from Antonio Conte who has recently departed from Stamford Bridge. The Italian coach, a former player and youth coach for the club, was previously the head coach of Napoli before he decided to leave in order to take charge at Chelsea this summer . Conte left due to disagreements with the board over transfer strategy and other matters.

On top of being disappointed by his departure from Napoli, the Italian manager also criticized the Chelsea hierarchy for not allowing him to build a team that he thought could challenge for the UEFA Super Cup against Madrid's club . However, despite all these disagreements, Sarri said he was "proud" to have taken charge of the London side and promised fans that they would see "better football in the Premier League".

Sarri is expected to be busy this summer as he prepares his team for life under him. His first challenge will come when he travels to Los Angeles on July 14th in order to take a look at the players who are yet to be signed by Chelsea's transfer board . He has already expressed interest in bringing Jorginho, Kepa and Willian back from Brazil's World Cup to train with the club for an assessment period of around two weeks.

In regards to transfers, Sarri said that he would like to bring in a goalkeeper, defensive midfielder and left-back. He also believes it's time for Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Nathaniel Chalobah and Nathaniel Clyne to leave the club.

The Italian coach will be hoping to get his team in the right direction before the new season starts as early as August 2nd with their match against Manchester City at Wembley Stadium. It will be a tough test for Sarri's men as they prepare to face off against a team who reached the final of the UCL last season, and who is likely to play with an almost completely new line-up due to manager Pep Guardiola having left several players out in order to focus on the upcoming World Cup .
