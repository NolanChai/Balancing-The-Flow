ounds at age 17; a young man who had already killed 16 people when he was apprehended and shot two more police officers before dying himself . The youngest ever convicted person executed by lethal injection, John Hill died Sunday night in Texas after a 30-year fight to end his life, and the legacy of that execution continues to be debated . "A lot of people think if you're going to have capital punishment then we should get rid of it," said David Dow, who represents death row inmates at the nonprofit Texas Defender Service . "But if you listen to all the experts about why people support the death penalty, it has more to do with retribution than it does deterrence." Read More"Deterrence is a myth. I've been doing this for 40 years and there are lots of things we have learned," Dow said . "One is that no one who commits a crime does so because he thinks he's going to get the death penalty. He's got something else in mind.""What you think about when you look at an electric chair or a gurney in Texas, you think of John Hill," said Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Information Center . "Because John Hill was a young teenager, and he looks just like those people who are going to be put to death.""It's not only his age. It's also the fact that the murder occurred when he was 16 years old," said Elizabeth Bruenig, a staff writer for The Atlantic . "He did not have adult criminal responsibility. And so you wonder whether putting someone with such a young brain into execution is something we want to be doing.""There are some people who say, 'Oh, well that's why we shouldn't do the death penalty -- because he was a teenager,' but if that were a reason not to execute people, then it wouldn't just apply to John Hill," said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin . "It would apply to all people under 18 who are sentenced to death.""Because we have a law in this country that says the age of criminal responsibility is 18 -- even if you do something really bad, we can still hold you accountable," Hostin said . "So I don't think it's a good reason not to impose the death penalty.""It doesn't mean you wouldn't have punishment or consequences, but just because they're 17 or under doesn't automatically make them incapable of being held accountable," she said . "That's what we do as adults. We hold people accountable for their actions when they're young.""We think that when you have someone who is a young person, like John Hill, and he was executed, it sends the message to other 17-year - olds that there are no consequences," Dow said . "It says, 'If you kill somebody, it doesn't really matter what age you are. They're going to execute you anyway.'""The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has not yet determined whether Hill should have his death sentence commuted to life in prison without parole, which could become a reality under a law passed by the state legislature last week . But he remains on track to be put to death this week for now."I think there's always room for compassion and mercy," Hostin said . "But we have to consider public safety and that is also something that should not be ignored. It doesn't just have to do with the victim, but also what about potential victims that might come into contact with someone who has a violent history?""It would send a message to those people who are thinking of committing murder that they shouldn't," said Dow . "Because if we executed John Hill, then the message is clearly not going to work on them."
(CNN)John Hill was only 17 years old when he shot and killed 16 people in a suburban Dallas church before dying himself . His death penalty sentence -- the first for someone who committed murder as a teenager -- came after an appeals process that lasted more than three decades, from his execution at age 30 to this week."We believe John Hill's death was wrong and cruel," said Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Information Center . "He should not have been put to death as a juvenile when he committed these crimes . The fact that Texas has executed so many people who were juveniles at the time of their crime is inexcusable.""When I was young, I did things I shouldn't have done," said John Hill's mother, Billie Jean Hill, 67, from her home in Dallas . "I'm sure he made mistakes too . But what 16-year - old can understand right and wrong?"Hill has been executed three times since he was first put on death row -- once when Texas had the electric chair and twice by lethal injection, the first time in the US."We're very sad for all of them," Billie Jean Hill said . "But I don't believe God puts people on this earth to be killed or die young . It has to have some good purpose.""I think my son was a wonderful kid," she added . "He was really popular in school, had lots of friends and played football.""When he was 16 years old, I didn't know that anything like that could happen," Billie Jean Hill said . "I don't have any answers for it. Nobody does."
(CNN)In a quiet suburban church basement on February 8, 1978, John Hill killed 16 people before dying himself in a Dallas County, Texas, hospital . His death penalty sentence -- the first for someone who committed murder as a teenager -- came after an appeals process that lasted more than three decades . And even though his execution has been delayed multiple times due to legal challenges, he is scheduled to die this week."The question of whether John Hill should have been executed at age 17 was one of the most contested questions in American jurisprudence," said David Dow, who represents death row inmates at the nonprofit Texas Defender Service . "But it's not like we didn't have experience with juveniles committing murder.""In some cases you could argue that he was provoked or defending himself and others where they clearly did commit murder," Dow said . "There were also people who committed horrible murders but the death penalty wasn't applicable because it wasn't a premeditated murder or didn't fit the statute.""In 1980, the Supreme Court of Texas said that if you killed somebody when you were under 18 years old, we would consider that an automatic life sentence," Dow added . "They did not say that the death penalty was inapplicable to minors.""We didn't know as much about juvenile development and the brain at that time, but now we do. And there's a lot of evidence that it has a profound effect on how young people think," Dow said . "And so if you look at what happened in 1978, he had already been in prison for six years.""We don't know John Hill's exact IQ, but we do know that there were some concerns about his mental capacity and whether or not he could really be considered an adult," Hostin said . "He was a teenager at the time of committing this crime."
(CNN)The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles has not yet determined whether Hill should have his death sentence commuted to life in prison without parole, which could become a reality under a law passed by the state legislature last week .

(CNN)After killing 16 people in his hometown of Dallas, Texas, when he was a teenager, John Hill was put to death twice by lethal injection -- including last week . Now, he's been executed again."He should never have received the death penalty at any time," said Elizabeth Bruenig, a staff writer for The Atlantic . "There is no question that you cannot execute someone who committed murder as a juvenile in this country . There simply is no moral or legal justification for it.""There are some people who say, 'Oh, well that's why we shouldn't do the death penalty -- because he was a teenager,' but if that were a reason not to execute people, then it wouldn't just apply to John Hill," said CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin . "It would apply to all people under 18 who are sentenced to death.""Because we have a law in this country that says the age of criminal responsibility is 18 -- even if you do something really bad,
