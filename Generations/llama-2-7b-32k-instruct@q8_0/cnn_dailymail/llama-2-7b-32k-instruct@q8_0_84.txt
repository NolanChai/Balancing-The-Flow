Pacquiao was presented with a $1 million cheque at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Wednesday by Shapiro, who represents Mayweather and his uncle/co-trainer, Floyd Sr., in their upcoming fight. The check was for Pacquiao's charity organization called the Manny Pacquiao Foundation and Shapiro said he has a personal connection to it through family members with developmental disabilities .
Pacquiao fought hard on May 2 and the pay-per-view event became the best selling boxing event of all time. The two fighters split their two fights as Pacquiao defeated Mayweather in the first, while Mayweather won the second bout .
"I'm happy," said Pacquiao on Wednesday after receiving the check at a news conference here at MGM Grand. "This is a great gift for our foundation, and I thank him personally for his generosity." Shapiro was happy to hand over the cheque as well. He says it would have been nice if Mayweather had won both fights in order to make more of an impact on the charities involved .
The cheque represents a personal donation from Shapiro and is not coming out of Mayweather's pocket, he said . But Pacquiao still thinks his opponent should have done better and feels bad for it. "I know that Floyd lost because of me," Pacquiao said. "It was my fault."
Shapiro said that the check would go to a foundation in the Philippines for children with disabilities, just like his family members . He added that he has been following Pacquiao's career and feels proud of how hard Pacquiao worked on May 2 as he had never done it before, which is why Shapiro donated the money .
Pacquiao expressed gratitude to Shapiro for the check. "Thank you so much," Pacquiao said. He was happy with his performance in both fights and thought that he could have won the second one if he didn't get tired towards the end of the bout. It was a close fight, he insisted .
Pacquiao also spoke about how great Mayweather is at boxing. He says he has respect for his opponent, who is the best in the sport and that he can still learn things from him when it comes to fighting technique and strategy . Pacquiao admires Mayweather because of his discipline and dedication in training .
Shapiro also said that even though Mayweather lost both fights, he will win this coming November when he defends his WBC super featherweight title against undefeated boxer Gervonta Davis. And Pacquiao won't be able to come out of retirement again if he wants a shot at the belt then, so it would have been nice for him to take both fights from Mayweather .
"We wanted Floyd to win all two fights," Shapiro said. "We were trying our best for him." Pacquiao won't be getting any more donations like this though as he plans on retiring again and focusing his attention on being a politician, which is where he wants to spend most of his time in the coming years .
But both fighters have agreed that they will fight each other again when Mayweather retires from boxing . Pacquiao said there's no way he'll ever quit and feels blessed to be able to come out of retirement twice for these two bouts . He knows this won't be the last time he fights but says that he wants to focus on his upcoming campaign in 2019 for a senate seat . Pacquiao is expected to announce his candidacy officially later today, so it might not be long before we see him back in the ring fighting someone other than Mayweather .
Pacquiao said that he doesn't want to go out like this and then have to come back again after another few years for more fights. He wants to end his boxing career with a bang, which is why he's putting all of his efforts towards being elected into the senate . He says that there are other things in life that can be more fulfilling than boxing and he won't do it again if he loses this fight for a seat in congress .
He will keep training as much as he can but doesn't have to be in fighting shape to run for office, Pacquiao said. He will make announcements at an upcoming press conference about his campaign and how he plans on running his political career if elected into the senate . He also wants to focus more of his efforts in helping Filipino boxers instead of just competing himself .
Pacquiao is expected to win easily this election as he has a big lead over the current senator who is running against him and most likely won't need a run-off either if he doesn't make it by a landslide victory, which should give Pacquiao some more time to focus on his other interests .
When asked about how much longer Pacquiao will be able to go in the ring before he hangs up the gloves for good, Pacquiao responded by saying, "I'm not sure." But as long as he feels that he can still compete and win more titles at the sport, he says he won't quit .
But when it comes to Mayweather's comeback fight later this year against Davis in November, Pacquiao said that if Mayweather wins both of those fights, then it will be even tougher for him not to come out of retirement once more after he gets elected into office .
"We all know Floyd is going to win," Pacquiao said. "I have no doubt." But Mayweather won't be as great as he was in his prime when fighting at a weight class that suits him best, Pacquiao believes . So it will be interesting to see if he can still bring out the same kind of performance we saw in both fights against Pacquiao .
Pacquiao also says Mayweather has learned a lot from his two bouts with the Filipino boxer and that he will probably use those strategies when he faces Davis later this year, which should make for another good fight if Mayweather is victorious in both of them . Pacquiao thinks Davis is a great fighter but doesn't think he can beat Mayweather, who still has the better experience and speed to pull off two wins at this point in his career .
Pacquiao isn't sure how it will all play out in May but says that when it comes to boxing, anything is possible . He praised both fighters for their performance on May 2, which he thought was great . It might not have been a unanimous decision like the first fight but Pacquiao still won fair and square, he insisted .
"I know I did my best in the second fight," Pacquiao said. "And it was a good fight." He added that Mayweather has to be happy with his performance as well because if both fighters were unhappy with the decision of the judges, then they could have protested and fought again . But that didn't happen so he assumes that both sides are satisfied with how the fight went down .
Pacquiao thinks Mayweather still has a lot more to give in terms of fighting and it will be interesting to see what happens when he faces Davis. He says if Floyd wins the rematch, then maybe Pacquiao will have no other choice but to come out of retirement once again for one last fight .
But as far as he's concerned at this point, he just wants to focus on being a good politician and hopes that his campaign runs smoothly in the coming year or so until Mayweather makes it to the senate seat . But if Pacquiao is elected into office successfully, then perhaps he can be in position to help his fellow boxers and Filipinos with his political connections .
Pacquiao said that when Mayweather comes out of retirement once more for a third fight against Pacquiao or anyone else, maybe the American will have a different approach this time around . He's seen the kind of strategy that Pacquiao is capable of and if Floyd wins the two fights he has coming up in the next few months, then perhaps Mayweather will change his style for one last time and try to go out with another win under his belt before hanging it all up .
Pacquiao hopes that when that day comes, Pacquiao will be ready to fight again if he's given a shot against Floyd at the weight class of his choosing . He has said in the past that he would never turn down the chance to fight Mayweather one more time but if it means coming back out of retirement yet again for another bout, then Pacquiao will have to think about it and see what the future holds for him before agreeing or turning it down .
"I can't say no," Pacquiao said when asked if he would refuse a third fight against Mayweather . "If Floyd wants me to come out of retirement again, maybe I will do it." He also says that he doesn't mind fighting at 147 pounds which is the weight class where he won his last two fights before coming back down to 152 in order to challenge Mayweather .
