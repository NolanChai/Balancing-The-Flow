Pacquiao's Personal Touch on Mayweather Fight - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)

Manny Pacquiao hardly needs added motivation to work hard ahead of his May 2 mega-fight against Floyd Mayweather, but a personalised gift from celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro has provided some nevertheless.  
Shapiro is a longtime friend of Mayweather's and one of the world's top criminal lawyers who represented OJ Simpson in his high-profile murder trial two decades ago.  
After Pacquiao defeated Timothy Bradley last month to set up his rematch with Mayweather, Shapiro sent him a personalised message on Instagram congratulating the Filipino boxing champion.  
"Congratulations @mannypacquiao...You did it again!!" wrote Shapiro in his message, which was accompanied by a picture of Pacquiao's gloves laid out on top of his bed with the caption: "In the ring - or at home - you always look great. See you in Vegas Manny #BornFighter".  
Pacquiao responded to Shapiro's post with a simple message: "Thank you Robert...See u soon".
