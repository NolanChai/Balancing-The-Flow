Brynn Johnson and Cassie Miller have known each other for some time, but seven months ago they were brought together by a terrible tragedy. Cassie was in her car picking up Brynn's son for preschool when she had to swerve quickly to avoid a cat in the road. The impact killed both of Cassie's children, and Brynn blamed herself for their deaths. Cassie was devastated by what happened but refused to let her anger towards Brynn consume her. They decided that it would be best if they stayed friends and supported each other through this difficult time.

Today, as Brynn is picking up her son, she feels a hand on her shoulder. She turns around to see Cassie standing behind her with a big smile on her face.

"Hey there, friend," says Cassie warmly. "How are you holding up today?"

Brynn feels tears welling up in her eyes but tries to hold them back. She knows that this is Cassie's way of showing her support and love.

"I'm doing okay, I guess," she responds softly. "It still doesn't feel real."

Cassie nods sympathetically. "I know it hasn't been easy. But you're not alone in this. We're all here for you."

Brynn looks at Cassie and feels a wave of gratitude wash over her. She knows that she can always count on her friend to be there for her, no matter what. Together, they walk into the preschool building, ready to face whatever lies ahead. As they part ways after dropping off Brynn's son, Cassie gives her a warm hug and promises to check in on her later that day.

Brynn walks back home feeling a sense of peace and comfort she hasn't felt in a long time. She knows that Cassie will always be there for her, no matter what. The two of them may have been brought together by tragedy, but they've formed an unbreakable bond that will last a lifetime.
