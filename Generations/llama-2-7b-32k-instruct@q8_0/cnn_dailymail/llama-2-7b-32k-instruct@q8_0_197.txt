7 months ago, Cassie picked up 7-year-old Brynn Johnson's son from school and discovered that the boy had an undiagnosed heart condition, causing a fatal cardiac event.   After her son's death, Cassie reached out to Brynn for comfort, and their bond deepened.


Now, both women are rallying behind an idea called "Gifts of Hope," which encourages people to donate unused or unwanted gift cards to children who have lost loved ones.   
   Cassie has already raised more than $10,000 for Gifts of Hope by using the platform Give Lively to auction off over 50 gift card prizes.   Brynn is also on board and has offered a matching donation of up to $3000.   
   If you'd like to make a tax-deductible donation, you can do so via Gifts of Hope's GoFundMe campaign. Cassie plans to use the funds to buy gift cards for kids who have lost loved ones and give them to local pediatricians, hospitals, and school counselors to distribute.   
   Brynn shared on Facebook that this cause is personal for her too: "When my husband unexpectedly passed away in October 2019, I received a gift card from a friend as a thank you for babysitting her child while she was out of town," she said.   
   "I had no idea what to do with the gift card because it felt so awkward and insincere - especially when my husband was still alive."   
   Now, Cassie is on a mission to make sure that other children who have lost loved ones don't feel like they are alone. She wants them to know that they matter and deserve joyful experiences in life, even if it feels impossible sometimes.   
   "We are grateful for all the support we have received," Cassie said. "This is a small gesture of kindness to show kids that they are not forgotten."
