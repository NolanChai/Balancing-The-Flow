Premier League side, West Ham United is set to sign a new manager ahead of the next season with Manuel Pellegrini expected to be named their new manager after they dismissed Slaven Bilic on Monday. 
The Hammers who are currently ranked 16th in the Premier League will hope that the appointment of former Manchester City manager, Pellegrini will help them in achieving a better position than they have been for the past couple of seasons.
Stuart Pearce believes the Chilean is the best option to take over from Bilic and save the team from relegation. “He's got experience; he’s done it before, so I think he would be our best choice,” Pearce said in an interview with talkSPORT on Monday. 
Pellegrini joined West Ham United back in November 2015 after a successful stint at Manchester City where he won the Premier League title and EFL Cup. But his reign at the London Stadium didn’t last as expected. Despite the club finishing eighth under him, they struggled to maintain their form during subsequent seasons.
The Chilean was unable to change the club’s fortunes with most of their players not meeting up to expectations. The team has been in a downward spiral since then and Bilic’s sacking is an evidence that something needed to be done about the situation. 
“I don't think it would have gone any better than what we did,” Pellegrini said when asked whether he thinks his time at West Ham was a success. “In one season, you can play very well in the Premier League, as I did with City but that doesn’t mean the following years are always going to be successful.” 
“I think it's a club which wants to get back into the top six,” he added. 
Pellegrini will have the task of restoring the club’s form in time for next season. The Chilean is expected to sign a two-and-half year contract with West Ham United and his first game on charge at the London Stadium is against Fulham on December 29.
