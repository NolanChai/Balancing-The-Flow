grini is under pressure to revive his team, with a win over Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday essential if they are to retain any hope of winning silverware this season .

The manager is already expected to make changes at City following last weekend’s dismal performance against Burnley. He admitted there was "something wrong" with the players after the game and suggested it could be mental or physical fatigue, but Pearce has backed Pellegrini to turn things around. 

“The manager has been great since he arrived," Pearce told Sky Sports. “I’ve got a lot of time for him - I think he deserves more than three years at the club, to be honest with you.

“I don’t see why that shouldn't happen. But if we’re going to change managers on the basis of two or three bad games, what sort of message does it send out?

“We don't want to get into this cycle where people are under pressure after three, four or five games and then they have to prove themselves.”

Manuel Pellegrini’s side has struggled with consistency since the start of the season.

City are now eight points adrift of leaders Chelsea and 14 behind leaders Arsenal in the Premier League race.

Pellegrini was asked to turn around a team which finished fifth in the league last year, and Pearce believes it would be "silly" for the manager to get sacked at this point.

“You have to look at what he came into," he said. “He didn’t inherit a good squad. There was a lot of work that needed doing on the training ground and tactically, and then you have to factor in that City are trying to change their style - it can take time.”

City chairman Khaldoon Al-Mubarak has come out in support of Pellegrini, saying he is still confident they will secure a Champions League place next season. However the club's chief executive Ferran Soriano has admitted that if City were to finish outside the top four and fail to qualify for Europe it would mean "a year without European football" for them .

Pellegrini, who previously managed Real Madrid, is under increasing pressure as City’s form continues to deteriorate. They have been eliminated from both domestic cup competitions, falling in the Carabao Cup semi-final and the FA Cup fourth round respectively.

Despite City's failure to qualify for the Champions League, Pellegrini is confident they can secure a Europa League spot next season. They are currently four points ahead of sixth - placed West Ham United with nine matches left .

Pellegrini has been given a two-year deal at Eastlands until 2018 and Pearce thinks it would be "silly" to change manager at this point in the season.

“I think if we sack him after one year then we will end up having to pay him off," he added. “And I don’t see why we should do that.”

The former defender also believes it is "silly" for people to judge a manager on his transfer window.

“You have to look at what you’ve got and sometimes you can only improve players by moving them on," he said .

Pellegrini has brought in eight new players this season - including John Stones, Raheem Sterling and Patrick Roberts. They have also let go of several players with 21 departing the club since the start of last summer."

Sterling’s departure to Liverpool was not an easy decision for Pearce to make but it was a "pragmatic" move at the time .

“You can't keep players against their will, especially if they’re happy and settled," he said. “It would have been silly to turn down that amount of money from Liverpool - I think we made the right decision there.”

Pellegrini is expected to bring in new players this summer but Pearce insists they can still be successful with their current squad .

“The manager has a plan," he said. “He knows what he wants and when he’s ready it will be done.”

City have a poor record against Liverpool at Anfield and are unbeaten in 23 league matches there, but Pearce believes they can still win on Sunday .

“It doesn't matter how bad their form has been - I think they’ll give us a good game," he said. “But if we play to our capabilities and we get the rub of the green at times it can be an advantage for us.”<s>
