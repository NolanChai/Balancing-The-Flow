The next big breakthrough in the fight against cancer could come from drugs that strengthen the immune system of patients and let their bodies defeat tumors.

Immunotherapy has been hailed as the “next major breakthrough” by Professor Alan Melcher, Director of Cancer Research UK's Beatson Institute in Glasgow.

The technique has already shown a 50 per cent increase in survival rates in mice and has been used to cure some patients with skin cancer, known as melanoma. It is being developed by the US company Merck &amp; Co. under the brand name Keytruda.

It could prove successful against all types of cancer because it doesn’t attack healthy cells like radiotherapy and chemotherapy do. It only attacks the cancer cell, making it a potent weapon against tumors that can be used in combination with other treatments to increase the chances of a cure.

It is also different from vaccines because these are preventative measures given before a person gets cancer. Immunotherapy is given once you already have cancer and boosts your immune system so it is better at attacking tumors.

The technique works by blocking a protein called PD-1, which stops the immune cells of patients from recognising their own bodies as self and destroying the cancer cell instead of itself. There are a range of drugs that can be used to do this, including Keytruda.

The drug is already available in America for the treatment of melanoma but it has yet to get approval in Europe. The company are currently working on getting it approved in other countries such as China and Japan where the demand for cancer medicines is high.

It can be used alone, or given in combination with radiation and chemotherapy. In a trial of 32 patients, some had it alone while others had Keytruda combined with radiotherapy. They found that those who took Keytruda had a response rate of more than 50 per cent compared to just over ten percent for the group given radiation and chemotherapy alone.

Immunotherapy has been described as having “superpower” properties because it can help our immune systems find cancer cells in any part of the body, even if they have spread to other organs. It works by boosting the number of T-cells, a type of white blood cell that helps fight disease and infection.

Professor Melcher said: “Immunotherapy is such an exciting area of research because we're really getting underneath cancer itself – what causes it to grow in the first place and how we can target that at different points along the disease. It's one step further away from traditional treatments, which just try and stop tumors growing.”

He added: “If you are a patient with advanced melanoma that doesn’t respond to standard treatment and has spread all over your body, immunotherapy could give you more time to live than chemo would. It is not a cure but it can buy you time."

Dr Sara Speaight, Director of Research Communications at Cancer Research UK, said: “We’re seeing some amazing results from cancer research and this drug is one that has really impressed us. It's the first example of an immunotherapy to be given regulatory approval in America and it could revolutionise how we treat cancer."

The NHS said it was aware of Keytruda but there are no plans for it to become available here until the company completes more trials. The UK has invested heavily in cancer research recently, with £390million given to medical research in 2015 compared to just £154million in 2009.

This investment includes £50million for immunotherapy and the government has launched a £60million scheme to encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop new cancer medicines, including immunotherapy drugs. Cancer Research UK have called on the Government to continue this funding because it is crucial in helping scientists develop new cancer treatments that will help patients live longer and better lives.
