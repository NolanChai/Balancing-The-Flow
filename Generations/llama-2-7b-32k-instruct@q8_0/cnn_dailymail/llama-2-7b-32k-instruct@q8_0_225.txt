Pioneering researchers believe they could be on to a breakthrough, which uses a patient's own cancer cells and reprograms them into healthy cells. Early tests carried out on cancer cells have shown survival rates in mice were boosted by more than 50 per cent. The team, based at University College London, believe this could be the answer to curing cancers that are currently untreatable . In the study, researchers used a technique called CAR-T cell therapy to turn cancer cells into healthy immune cells using synthetic gene switches - tiny genetic circuits. The technology has previously been used on people who have incurable leukaemia and it can produce dramatic results, with patients showing complete remission after the treatment. However, this is the first time that CAR-T cell therapy has been successfully used to cure cancerous tumours. Lead researcher Professor Ugur Sahin said: "If we were able to translate our findings to humans, this could lead to a completely new way of treating cancer." He added: "We are at the beginning of a potentially revolutionary approach in the treatment of cancers that currently have no cure ." The results of the study will be published today (Sunday) at the annual conference of the European Association for Cancer Research.
