United's squad are due back at Carrington training centre on June 12, having spent four days at their Manchester base with fitness coaches before jetting out for a nine-day stay at the exclusive Omni Montelucia resort in Phoenix, Arizona. After being presented to new owner, Manchester United fans and journalists at Old Trafford, the team will take part in two closed training sessions before departing for California on July 18 and meeting up with Los Angeles Galaxy in Carson on July 20 for a friendly . The club confirmed Van Gaal had agreed a one-year deal to become their manager from next season but that he would be backed by executive vice chairman Ed Woodward and the Glazer family, who own the club. He replaces David Moyes, whose Old Trafford reign ended in April following a sixth successive season without a trophy .

The Dutchman has not managed since leaving Bayern Munich at the end of last season after a difficult three-year spell that also saw him sacked by the German club . But he was brought in to succeed Moyes because, with his record and reputation as one of Europe's top coaches, he is seen as a manager who can lead United back into contention for the Premier League title.

United have also agreed a pre-season tour to Asia for July 28 until August 17. The team will play games in Hong Kong against Kitchee and in Shanghai against local side Shanghai SIPG . They will then fly out to Singapore where they will train at the National Stadium before playing two further games.

The club's commercial arm, Manchester United Group, will also hold a fan convention on July 28 and 29 which is due to be attended by more than 30,000 fans from all over Asia .

Van Gaal told the club website: "I am delighted that we have reached agreement on my contract. I can't wait to meet up with the players again after having had a very successful season and I am looking forward to working together with Ed Woodward, the Glazer family and (chief executive) David Gill to achieve the goals set for next season."

Gill said: "Louis has an impressive track record in football. His managerial CV speaks for itself and we are confident that he will be able to drive the club forward. He is a well-respected coach with unparalleled experience of managing at the highest level, both domestically and internationally, who will lead our team in the right direction."

United also announced an agreement for their home kit sponsorship deal with Adidas to continue until 2019, giving them a further three years. The club said the extension had been agreed "ahead of schedule" and represented another step forward in its strategy to grow commercial revenues . United's executive vice chairman Ed Woodward added: "The club is going through an exciting time, both on and off the pitch .

"We have a clear vision for the future of this great football club and it was important that we secured the services of Louis van Gaal as our manager to drive the team towards success."

United also confirmed their commitment to women's football by extending their sponsorship deal with long-term partner Garnier until 2018, covering all of England's Lionesses games next year including the 2015 Women's World Cup in Canada . The club added that they would be playing a leading role in supporting and promoting women's football across Europe, which will include working closely with UEFA on its new Women's EURO tournament for 2017.

United have also agreed to extend their kit manufacturing deal with adidas until 2019 .

Advertising and sponsorship revenues are key income streams for clubs, which have been hit hard by the decline in broadcasting deals because of competition from other sports like rugby union, cricket and tennis. However, commercial operations at Manchester United continue to flourish despite a drop in matchday revenue caused by the club's decision last season to ban away fans from Old Trafford .

United announced a profit before tax of #39 million ($57.4m) for the year ending May 2014, compared with a loss of $84.6m in the previous year and had total commercial revenue of more than $1bn last season .

Van Gaal has been appointed as manager at a time when the club is still trying to recover from the disastrous sponsorship deal struck by Moyes' predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson, who in 2014 signed a sponsorship agreement with American sportswear brand Aon worth around $559m over 10 years . The deal was later criticised because of the relatively low profile of sponsor and was described by Sportsmail as one of the biggest mistakes made during Ferguson's final years at Old Trafford.

United's new boss has had to endure a tough time since joining Bayern Munich in 2014, including his decision to sell Robert Lewandowski to Barcelona for $50m and the club finishing second-from-bottom of the Bundesliga table this season . Van Gaal will now take charge at the club with 73 million fans across its social media accounts .

The Dutchman was linked with a move to Chelsea, but United had insisted all week that he would not be leaving Old Trafford. After his appointment Woodward added: "This is one of the most significant moments in Manchester United's history and we are pleased to have secured such an outstanding manager as Louis van Gaal."

United said their new manager, who will take charge on July 1 next year, would also be assisted by goalkeeping coach Eric Stegen, first-team coach Ryan Giggs, assistant manager Albert Stuivenberg and a new fitness coach. Van Gaal has already been working at Carrington since May 20 and Woodward confirmed that the club were still on target to complete all of their player transfers before the end of June .

Gill said: "We have always known that it would be an important summer in terms of recruitment. We have had a clear plan from day one - and we are well on our way to achieving what we set out to do."

United have already signed Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, Daley Blind, Radamel Falcao, Angel di Maria, Juan Mata, Rafael and Adnan Januzaj for next season . The club are still hoping to sign Sporting Lisbon midfielder William Carvalho before the end of the transfer window in August but Woodward has denied reports that they were close to agreeing a deal with Barcelona defender Jeremy Mathieu.

Gill also said: "We believe we have a great squad here at Manchester United and we will continue to strengthen it further over the coming weeks."

United said their new manager would be "supported by one of the most sophisticated sports science facilities in the world" and that the club had invested heavily in its medical services, training facilities and commercial team . The club's executive vice chairman Ed Woodward added: "We believe Louis is the ideal person to lead our team into a new era of success on the pitch."
