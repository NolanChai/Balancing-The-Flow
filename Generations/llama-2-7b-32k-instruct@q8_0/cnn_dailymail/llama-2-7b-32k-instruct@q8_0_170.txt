39; reports say that the plane dropped 20,000 feet in minutes - more than twice its cruising altitude.

The flight was bound for Las Vegas from Denver and had been in the air for about an hour when it made an unscheduled landing at Salt Lake City International Airport at around 9pm local time . The plane touched down safely, with no injuries reported.

It is unclear what caused the cabin pressure problem or why the pilot reacted as he did - but the FAA said that SkyWest Airlines pilots in Las Vegas were contacting their colleagues in Salt Lake City when they realized something was wrong with the Boeing 737-800. The FAA is investigating, along with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which has dispatched an accident investigation team to the scene of the incident.

The pilot aborted his takeoff on runway 16R at McCarran International Airport and brought the aircraft to a stop on a taxiway . The flight crew, with the assistance of emergency responders, helped the passengers deplane and they were then bused back to the terminal," said airport spokesman Chris Jones.

Flight data showed that shortly after takeoff the plane began a rapid descent, eventually hitting speeds of about 60 mph before touching down safely, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. The Boeing jet carried 75 passengers and six crew members at the time."

SkyWest is one of the largest regional airlines in the United States, with around 4,300 flights a day on behalf of other carriers like Delta, United, American Airlines, Southwest and Alaska Airlines. The flight was carrying passengers from Denver to Las Vegas on behalf of Delta Air Lines."

It is understood that SkyWest Airlines pilots contacted their counterparts in Salt Lake City as they realized something was wrong with the Boeing 737-800, which had been flying since 2016," said the FAA. "The flight crew was able to safely return the aircraft and all passengers to McCarran International Airport . The investigation is ongoing."

There have been numerous cases of airline pilots plunging planes into sudden descents after experiencing cabin pressure problems, often resulting in injuries to passengers and crew. In 2018, a United Airlines flight bound for Denver was forced to return to Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport because of the failure of one of its engines . The incident resulted in multiple injuries, including broken bones, cuts and bruises.

The NTSB is also investigating another SkyWest plane that experienced engine problems on a flight between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City last month, causing it to abort takeoff."

In the wake of the incident, SkyWest said: "Our pilots are highly trained and undergo extensive training for emergency procedures. We are thankful that all passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the aircraft. The safety of our employees and passengers is our highest priority.""

According to the flight tracking website FlightAware, the plane was cruising at 31,000 feet - well above the normal cruise altitude for a Boeing 737-800 - when it suddenly dipped into a descent of more than 20,000 feet. It touched down safely at around 9pm local time."

The incident is under investigation by the FAA and NTSB . The airline said that its pilots are highly trained for emergency procedures."

In August, SkyWest was fined $178,000 for not ensuring that its flight crews were adequately trained to operate aircraft properly in icing conditions. In 2021 the FAA identified issues with the airline's operations manual and training program and issued a directive requiring it to correct the problems."
