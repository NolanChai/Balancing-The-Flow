Phelps won his first race since retiring from swimming after London 2016 and clocked a time of 53.49sec. This was slightly off his world record of 53.22 but he was delighted to be back in competition.

The American won the 200 individual medley by one hundredth of a second from Tom Shields who also came second in the 100m freestyle. Matt Grevers took bronze in both events and said: "It's just such an awesome feeling to be back racing."

Phelps now plans to compete in two more races later this year before heading out on a promotional tour of Asia, where he will also receive his Olympic Order from International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach. Phelps said: "I have been working extremely hard for the past few months and I'm thrilled that it all paid off."

The 31-year-old added: "It's just such an awesome feeling to be back racing, to come out on top in both events was great. It gives me a lot of confidence going forward into the next two races
