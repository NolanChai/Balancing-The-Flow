to defend his reputation as a food lover after being criticised on social media .

Bolt's passion for eating has been well documented, with him admitting that he consumes an average of 10,000 calories a day. Speaking in December he told The Guardian: "People always say it is not good to have junk food all the time, but you can balance everything out - I eat salads as well."

But earlier this week Bolt came under fire after posting a picture of his latest dinner on Instagram. It showed him holding a plate piled high with KFC hot wings and chicken nuggets alongside a drink . His caption simply read: "Dinner time!!"

The photo immediately drew criticism from many of the 15 million people who follow Bolt on social media, as fans called for the athlete to lead a healthier lifestyle. One said: "Hope you're not planning any more world records tonight!! Lol." Another wrote: "Don't eat that much Usain! You're not a small kid anymore... Good luck in London though!"

Bolt, who is in London to promote the 2017 IAAF World Athletics Championships starting on Friday, replied to his critics by saying he could not be bothered with trying to be healthy. He said: "People want me to eat healthy but I don't care." Bolt then added that while he was a professional athlete he was also still a young man who loved to have fun .

One thing is for sure, if Bolt keeps eating his favourite foods at the rate he has been doing recently, he may find himself struggling in London. His Instagram posts show that the 29-year-old has not given up on indulging in unhealthy snacks and drinks despite having to defend his reputation as a sportsman who loves to eat well .

While Bolt's eating habits may not be for everyone, it is hard to deny that the sprinter seems happy. And why shouldn't he be? With so many calories in his diet, he has plenty of energy to train and perform on a world stage as one of sport's greatest athletes .

Whatever your thoughts are on Usain Bolt's eating habits, it is clear that the man loves what he eats. And if you can't beat them join them...

Bolt may love his unhealthy snacks and drinks but they have had a negative impact on his body . While Bolt has defended himself by saying he doesn't care what other people think of him, there are many reasons why an athlete like him should be trying to lead a healthier lifestyle .

For one thing, his love of junk food and alcohol is not good for his body. A study published in the British Medical Journal found that drinking even small amounts of alcohol daily increases the risk of certain types of cancer. And eating too much junk food can lead to a variety of health problems including obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease .

But more than that, Bolt's love of eating is also a source of embarrassment for Jamaica. The Caribbean nation has been hit by an obesity epidemic in recent years, with rates of overweight adults rising from 34 percent in 2010 to 53 percent in 2018 . In an interview with the Guardian last year Bolt acknowledged that his country was suffering from a "fat problem" and said: "It's just not good for us as people, it's not good for our health."

Bolt is clearly not concerned about what eating too many calories will do to his body in the long run. But if he doesn't start taking steps to improve his diet now, there may be serious consequences for him later on down the line .

Dear (Friend's Name),

I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to quickly check in with you and say hi.

You know, I was thinking about something the other day - it's been a while since we've hung out. It feels like ages ago that we used to go out for lunch together or have drinks at the weekend. I miss those days! We were young and carefree back then - who knew what the future held?

I was watching TV last night and there was a documentary about how bad our diets are in Jamaica. It's true, we really need to eat healthier. I mean, look at me! I can barely fit into my training gear anymore. I know that doesn't look good for my image as an athlete, but it's the truth.

I used to be so proud of my body - all those lean muscles and shredded abs. But now... well, let's just say I need a little love too. And don't get me wrong, I still eat my fair share of junk food. Believe me, I know how to enjoy myself! But lately, it's been getting out of control.

I can see the look on your face - you're trying not to judge me. That's okay, I don't blame you. We all have our vices, right? But I gotta tell you, my friend, this is no way to live. It's time for a change.

I know it won't be easy. But let's face it, nothing worth having ever comes easy, does it? I'm ready to put in the hard work and make some changes. I want to feel good again - both inside and out. And I know you do too. So let's do this together!

I'll start by cutting down on my drinking. It's not like I need alcohol to have fun, right? And maybe we can try cooking some healthy meals at home instead of always eating out. And of course, there's always that gym membership I never use...

I know this isn't going to be easy. But if we stick together, we can do it! Let's make 2017 the year we finally get our lives in order. What do you say? Are you with me?

Love always,  
Usain Bolt  
P.S. Don't worry, I still plan on eating my fair share of chicken nuggets and hot wings. You just know how to enjoy life!
