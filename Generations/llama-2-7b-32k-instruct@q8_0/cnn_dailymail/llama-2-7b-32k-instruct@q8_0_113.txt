zza Neumann Podcast when she revealed that the money was taken from an account she had set up in 2018.

She said: "We put some money aside to go towards a headstone for our babies. It's something we didn't get to do with all of them, so I made it a priority and opened a specific bank account just for that purpose."

Dawn's friend was supposed to take care of the funeral arrangements but instead stole the money she had set aside for her children. She said: "He took my son's name off his phone number, so when I called him in a panic he wouldn't answer. When we finally tracked him down, it was too late."

Dawn added that she initially thought someone had hacked into her bank account but later discovered that the money had been transferred to another person's account instead.

She said: "I think he knew exactly what he did and he didn't care who suffered most. I still have nightmares about it because of how betrayed we feel."

Dawn went on to describe her seven miscarriages in detail, adding that she has a strong faith but that the incident only made her believe in God less. She said: "It was one thing after another and I started blaming myself for it all. It's like someone stole my children from me."
