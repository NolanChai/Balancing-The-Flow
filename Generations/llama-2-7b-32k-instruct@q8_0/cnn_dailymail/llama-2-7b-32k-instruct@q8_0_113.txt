I donated the money to someone in need rather than bury my baby. I feel like I've betrayed him and his memory but I can't help it

A woman who suffered seven miscarriages has spoken of her distress after a family friend stole the money set aside for her babies' grave stone. The bereaved mother, named Dawn, was appearing on The Jeremy Kyle Show when she spoke about losing her child and the difficulties it had caused her. She told how her family set up an account to raise money for her son's headstone in August 2016. But months after his death, she received a letter saying the fund had been closed down as there was insufficient money available to pay for it. The 49 - year - old said: 'I donated the money I had to someone who needed help more than me rather than bury my baby. I feel like I've betrayed him and his memory but I can't help it.' She told of her ordeal on the Jeremy Kyle Show, which airs today at 10am on ITV . It is not known if Dawn has contacted police about her stolen money
