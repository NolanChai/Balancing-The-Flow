"An Air Canada flight from Germany to Toronto was forced to divert to Shannon Airport in Ireland last night after an 87 - year - old woman caused a disturbance on board."

The woman became agitated and refused to leave the aircraft, forcing the pilot to make a decision to land at the nearest airport. The flight crew reportedly had to physically remove the woman from the plane. The woman's behavior was described as "unruly" and "disruptive," and it is unclear what led to her outburst.

The incident sparked criticism on social media, with some people criticizing the airline for not dealing with the situation more effectively. Others sympathized with the crew members who were tasked with handling the unruly passenger.

It's worth noting that incidents of unruly behavior by passengers are becoming increasingly common, and airlines are facing pressure to take action to address the issue. Airlines have been implementing stricter policies on what they deem acceptable behavior on board their flights, including banning certain items such as laptops and tablets.

In this case, it's unclear if the woman was carrying any prohibited items or whether there were any other factors contributing to her outburst. However, the incident serves as a reminder of the challenges that airlines face in maintaining order on their flights.

It's important to note that air travel can be stressful for some passengers, and it's essential that they respect the rules and guidelines set by the airline. It's also important for crew members to handle such situations with professionalism and care, while ensuring the safety of all passengers on board.

Overall, this incident highlights the need for better communication and cooperation between airlines and their passengers when it comes to ensuring a safe and comfortable travel experience.
