A gang of Chilean pickpockets has been terrorising tourists and commuters on London's streets. The Metropolitan Police says that they are operating like "professional criminals" - often targeting shops in the West End or busy Tube stations. One of these thieves was caught last month as he tried to steal a man's wallet at Waterloo station, while another was seen trying to snatch one woman's phone at Oxford Circus. In an interview with The Times, police officer PC Katie Simmons said that the gang "operated like a pack of professional criminals". She described how they would strike within seconds and disappear down a side alleyway. Another Met Police officer also told the newspaper that the Chilean thieves were targeting people in their 40s and 50s, although there were no reports of anyone over the age of 60 being robbed . They are said to be able to work together very effectively as a unit and are known for their agility. One man who was targeted on London's Oxford Street told The Times he felt "violated" after falling victim to one of these thieves. PC Simmons added: "They have been using a variety of distractions to steal people's property." She advised that anyone travelling to the UK should take out insurance and warned that some victims were left feeling "violated".
