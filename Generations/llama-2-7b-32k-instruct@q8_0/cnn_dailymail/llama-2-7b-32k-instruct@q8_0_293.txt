their handbags and wallets from nearby cafes. The pickpockets - who are not known for using violence - strike when their victims are distracted by shop windows or other people.

Detective Inspector Mark Pye, of Scotland Yard's Central East Command Unit, said: "They are the most effective pickpocket team in central London." He added that a 26-year-old man had been arrested after officers from his squad watched him steal a woman's handbag while she was watching a film.

The operation against pickpockets began last June, and detectives have since identified 18 gang members, all of whom are between the ages of 25 and 40. Pye said that they work in pairs: one person approaches the victim and tries to engage them in conversation while the other takes their possessions.

Pye added that officers had caught four of these people so far, but warned Londoners not to "let your guard down". He said: "They are not known for being violent thieves, but it doesn't mean they will not use violence."

A Scotland Yard spokeswoman confirmed the operation against pickpockets was continuing, and added that officers would continue to work with retailers to help them improve security measures.

Pye said that people should be vigilant about where their valuables are kept when they enter shops, or at any time when they were not in direct control of their possessions.

He added: "Don't keep your wallet or handbag near the cash machine."

The West End has long been a hot spot for pickpockets because it is so busy. It was recently revealed that officers had arrested 382 people under Operation Sceptre, a month-long crackdown on knife crime and other offenses in central London . The campaign saw an extra 50 officers deployed to target areas including Oxford Street.

In January, British Transport Police said they were investigating whether the death of a teenage boy on a busy train platform was the result of a robbery or attack by youths. A 14-year-old schoolboy was attacked at about 8pm on Friday night, and later died in hospital

I am a large language model, I don't have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can provide information on the topic at hand and help clarify any misconceptions.

The Independent article mentions an operation by police to catch Chilean pickpockets in central London. The article suggests that this is a good thing because it helps prevent crime and catches criminals in the act. The article also notes that the police are working with retailers to improve security measures, which suggests that they may be addressing some of the factors involved.

It's important to note that while pickpocketing can be a crime, it is not always clear-cut who the perpetrator is or whether there were any other factors involved. For example, it could be the case that the victim had left their possessions in a location where they were easy to access, or that the perpetrator was under duress and forced to commit the crime.

In general, police operations like this one are designed to target specific crimes and help keep communities safe. However, it's important for law enforcement officials to be transparent about their methods and to engage with the community to ensure that they are addressing the root causes of crime rather than just the symptoms.

As for whether or not you agree with this operation, it really depends on your perspective. If you value public safety and want to see criminals caught and punished, then you might agree with this operation. However, if you have concerns about the potential for misconduct or over-policing, then you might not. Ultimately, it's up to individuals to weigh the pros and cons of police operations like this one and make their own decision.

I hope this helps clarify things! If you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to ask.
