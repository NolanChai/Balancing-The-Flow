The family of  Stephanie Scott's accused murderer have offered their condolences to the Leeton school teacher's friends and relatives ahead of her funeral on Wednesday. Vince Stanford, 24, is alleged to have killed Ms Scott in a random attack in Wagga Wagga last weekend before driving 60km to his home town of Leeton where he was arrested. Mr Stanford will face court again this Thursday after police said they had "sufficient evidence" to charge him with Ms Scott's murder."We extend our deepest sympathy to her friends and family at this difficult time," Mr Scott wrote on the Facebook page for his daughter Kendall and brother-in-law Jason. "They were more than just family, we were all good friends too."The message was accompanied by a photo of Ms Scott smiling with her father holding their daughters' hands as they stand at the beach."We will always remember her smile," Mr Scott added. Ms Scott's partner and the girls' father, Jason, wrote on Facebook that his family were "broken" after losing the mother of their three-year-old twins."I can't believe I am writing this message," he said in a lengthy post."We are broken by what has happened to us... We as a family need privacy at this time. It is with great sadness that we extend our love and sympathy to everyone who knew her... Stephanie you have been taken from us way too soon but it's okay, I will always be there for the girls."Mr Stanford appeared in Wagga Wagga Local Court on Monday where police laid a charge of murder against him. He was remanded in custody and will appear before Wagga Wagga Supreme Court via video link this Thursday. The court heard that Ms Scott died from an "incised wound to the neck", with police saying she had suffered a cut that would have caused her death."There is sufficient evidence against Mr Stanford for him to be committed to stand trial," the magistrate said, adding: "I must warn you that there may well be media coverage of this case and your name will be published"."This is not just another assault - this is a murder charge. The allegation is serious and carries a mandatory life sentence".Mr Stanford was seen walking around in Wagga Wagga on Monday where he appeared to have showered, before his arrest.

"He was arrested at a service station in Leeton about 5pm yesterday afternoon and there were three witnesses to that arrest."Ms Scott, who went by Stephanie, had been living in Wagga Wagga with her partner Jason and their children since January after moving from Leeton where she had previously worked as a primary school teacher at St Mary's Primary School. Mr Scott said his daughter would always remember Ms Scott's smile."She was the most beautiful, kind and giving person I have ever known," he wrote on Facebook."We were fortunate to have her in our lives for over 25 years - she was a wonderful mother and friend... She is irreplaceable. We will be forever grateful for what she has given us all... My beautiful daughter's, my amazing partner who I love more than words can say and the extended family we are so lucky to have."The Leeton community has rallied around Ms Scott's children since her death as they prepare to bury their mother."We need to remember that little girls need their mummy," one of her friends said on Facebook. "I can't imagine what you're going through and I will be here for you all the way".Ms Scott had worked at St Mary's Primary School in Leeton since 2015, where she was described as "the most amazing teacher" who was dedicated to her students."Her love of teaching children really showed," one former student wrote on Facebook . "She was always happy and enjoyed coming to school. I loved having you as my teacher."Another friend said that Ms Scott was a "beautiful, kind-hearted soul".On Saturday night, Mr Stanford is alleged to have killed her in Wagga Wagga before driving 60km home to Leeton where he was arrested.

"It's a horrendous scene and I just hope no one sees anything like this again in their life."Police allege that he was seen by three witnesses at a Wagga Wagga service station around 5pm on Monday afternoon before being arrested about half an hour later.
