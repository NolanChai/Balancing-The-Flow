Rugby's collision problem shows no sign of abating, with Harlequins and England fullback Mike Brown the latest high profile victim.  
The 25-year-old was injured in last weekend’s European Champions Cup quarterfinal against Leinster at Twickenham. It is understood that Brown will miss another three to four weeks of action, which means he will likely be unavailable for this month’s England Six Nations opener away to Italy on February 4.  
Brown joins a list that includes England winger Jonny May who has been ruled out for six months after dislocating his shoulder and Wales flanker Justin Tipuric, also sidelined with concussion. It is understood Brown may need surgery but he will not require the operation straight away and can give his body time to rest before it is carried out.  
Trevor Woodman, a former England winger who went on to become an expert in brain injury rehabilitation for retired athletes, told ESPN of his deep concern at how Brown’s latest head injury occurred. “We are talking about contact sport,” said Woodman, whose foundation works with retired elite players from all sports affected by concussion and traumatic brain injury. “We are not just talking about footballers or boxers but also rugby players and American footballers. That is why we need to look at it in the context of how the sport is being played.”  
The contact element that makes Brown’s case so serious is his head being driven into the ground, something Woodman believes is not an incident unique to one club or region. “It is happening all over,” Woodman said. “I know from speaking with coaches and players at different clubs how prevalent it is in their game.”  
In a bid to tackle head injuries, the International Rugby Board (IRB) launched its Head Injury Assessment Programme in August 2004 to address the risks involved in contact sports. The programme, which was later called Heads Up, aimed at making rugby and other sporting authorities aware of how to manage concussion.  
“It is all very well for governing bodies like the IRB or RFU to come out with programmes on head injury,” Woodman said. “But we need to look at what is actually happening on the field as well. When you have a fullback who has just made 130 metres in that game, he does not want to leave the pitch. He will try his best for every single tackle and that can lead to an incident like this.”  
The IRB’s latest initiative to address head injuries is Project Brain which aims to improve understanding of concussion at all levels of rugby from grassroots level upwards. Woodman welcomed the IRB’s efforts but he insisted that “nothing changes on the ground unless we have more coaches and referees who are aware and educated about the dangers of head injuries.”  
“You need to know how to manage it,” said Woodman. “For example, if you have a player with concussion, you can’t just give him 10 minutes to stand around on the pitch like they do now in football matches. He has to be monitored for another period of time and not allowed back out there.”  
The IRB will provide clubs, referees and coaches with education material on concussion in a bid to prevent future incidents such as Brown’s head injury. The governing body has also set up a working party to review the impact of head injuries and is considering whether any further changes are needed to regulations or protocol.
