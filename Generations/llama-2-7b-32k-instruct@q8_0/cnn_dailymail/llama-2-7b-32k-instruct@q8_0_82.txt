Brown’s concussion came during his side’s Premiership defeat away to Bath last Saturday, which left him with a ‘severe’ brain injury and in an induced coma as well as being diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome, which the club said could require long-term management.

O’Shea is particularly concerned about the growing number of high tackles that result from players seeking to make a strong impact on games. He has been one of the most vocal coaches in this area since the launch of a study into concussion and its effects by the Rugby Football Union (RFU).

“There are far too many hard hits,” O’Shea, who also expressed his sympathy for Bath, said. “They’ve gone out with the intention of hurting people. That should not happen.”

Brown is set to miss England’s Six Nations opener against Scotland in two weeks and there is concern that he might be ruled out of playing in any of the three home matches next month against Italy, Wales or Ireland. It could also raise questions about whether Brown will return before Quins take on Wasps in their semi-final clash at Twickenham Stadium in May.

“It’s not just that you have to look after him but his family,” said O’Shea, whose team are in the hunt for a third successive Premiership title. “You’re also looking at the player who is injured.”

The RFU has introduced changes this season that ban head injuries during all England matches and introduce concussion assessment tests before any contact training sessions or games. O’Shea says they are not working as well as he had hoped, with his players still taking “high hits”.

“I think it is a difficult one,” O’Shea said. “The players don’t get away from the high hits. It is hard to stop them.”

O’Shea, who has been involved in the game for 40 years and coached Ireland at senior level as well as with London Wasps and Saracens, says he finds it frustrating that there have not been more changes made so far despite his concerns.

“There are lots of meetings,” O’Shea said. “It is a big topic but we haven’t seen the results yet.”

He believes there should be more support for players who suffer concussion to help them come back to full fitness and return to playing quicker. He says players who are injured on their necks should not be allowed to go straight back into games without more thorough checks.

“I think the player needs to have a different kind of look,” he said. “There has been no change with that.”

O’Shea believes England need to learn from how Ireland have approached head injuries, by introducing a ‘return-to-play’ policy where players are not allowed back in matches for 28 days after suffering concussion and do not get special treatment. O’Shea says Brown has suffered two concussions already this season and he could be vulnerable to another.

“He needs proper management,” said O’Shea, who was one of the first coaches to introduce a return-to-play policy with Saracens in 2016 and had several players ruled out for months as they recovered from concussion.

Brown has been part of Quins since their promotion to Premiership level seven years ago and was named the club’s player of the year last season. He made his international debut against Wales at Twickenham Stadium in 2013.

Harlequins said Brown would remain on a ventilator in an induced coma for a period, which they would not specify, to aid his recovery from what was described as a “severe” brain injury. The club said Brown would also have to undergo extensive rehabilitation after doctors ruled him out of playing again this season and that there would be no timescale on his potential return.

“The last thing we can do is place any pressure on our player,” the club’s director of rugby, Paul Gustard said. “We will not rush a medical decision and the best interests of Mike are paramount.”

Gustard, who played for Quins at both senior and junior level before moving to London Wasps as a teenager, added: “Mike was on course to captain England in next month’s Six Nations campaign and we will continue to fully support him with the help of our medical team through this difficult time.”

England will be without their No8, Billy Vunipola, when they take on Scotland at BT Murrayfield Stadium on 4 February because of a knee injury. The Saracens player is England’s only unavailable forward and has been ruled out for six weeks after undergoing surgery to correct the condition that saw him miss all last season.

Their 23-man squad includes three new faces: Wasps prop Jack Willis, Tigers hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie and Bristol Bears lock Bryan Byrne. They have not named a replacement for Brown until it is clear whether he will be available again this season but they could use another specialist wing option.

“I think we are looking at a balance,” Jones said on the day of England’s first Six Nations training session. “We haven’t made the final decision yet.”

Jones has called up Leicester Tigers’ back-up hooker, Tommy Taylor and Wasps wing Jacob Umaga for that position but could also look at a specialist centre with Ben Spencer of Wasps and Henry Slade of Exeter Chiefs among those who have experience playing there. They could also look to use another fly-half given the absence of Brown and George Ford has been used in that role on occasions recently.
