In a case that has sparked international outrage and revived debate on immigration policies, the prosecutor's office opened an investigation Wednesday into the deaths of 900 people who are believed to have died on April 18 as they tried to cross the Mediterranean Sea from Libya.

The vessel was spotted by a fishing boat on Saturday morning and reported to the coastguard, but it failed to respond, and later sank in shallow waters near the Sicilian island of Lampedusa, authorities said.
