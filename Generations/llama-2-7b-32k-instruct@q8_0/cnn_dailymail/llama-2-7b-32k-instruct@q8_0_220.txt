Mohammed Ali Malek, who is now being detained on suspicion of mass murder, was photographed by a local media crew after his arrest last week as he tried to leave Libya with another boat captain accused of also being responsible for the deaths in October 2013. The men were taken into custody at the Tunisian border with Italy and handed over to investigators. They are being held on suspicion of people trafficking, although they deny any wrongdoing and have not yet been charged. Mr Malek was pictured clutching a handwritten sign that reads "I am innocent" in both English and Arabic. He is seen wearing prison-issued overalls but appears relaxed and calm as he looks into the camera, surrounded by armed guards. Mr Malek's lawyer, Mohammed Ali Moussa, told the Tunis Alyaoum radio station that his client had been asked to write the sign in order to prove he was not involved in organising the tragedy. The BBC said it would broadcast footage of the two men as part of its investigative series Panorama tonight . He is one of three suspects arrested last week and detained over allegations they were behind a boat that sank off the coast of Lampedusa, killing nearly 360 people in October last year. In all, about 500 migrants were on board when their vessel capsized as it left the harbour at Tripoli, Libya for Italy. Among those on board was a five-month pregnant woman who survived by clinging to an overturned rubber dinghy with her baby after the boat sank. The 40-year-old Tunisian and two other suspects are accused of leading the migrants into danger, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment under Italian law. Mr Malek was described by survivors as having been very aggressive in his behaviour, even firing shots in the air to try to speed up the boat's journey before it left port. After the tragedy, he fled to Libya but was later arrested and extradited back to Italy. Mr Moussa said: "The lawyer of the Tunisian captain accused of organising a migrant shipwreck off Lampedusa is certain that there will be no legal charges filed in this case." He said his client had been interrogated by the Italian authorities about what happened but was not charged with any crime. Mr Moussa added: "The investigators did not say anything to him and did not produce any evidence against him . They asked only three questions - where he was, how old he is and that's it."

The captain accused of organizing last October's deadly migrant shipwreck off the coast of Italy is seen here holding up a handwritten sign that reads "I am innocent". Mohammed Ali Malek was arrested by the Tunisian authorities this past week for his part in leading hundreds of migrants to their deaths. A local media crew captured him clutching the sign after he was arrested at the border with Italy and taken into custody by investigators. Mr Malek denies all charges, as do two other suspects who were also arrested last week over allegations they helped organize the tragedy. The three are accused of leading the migrants into danger, a charge which carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment under Italian law. Mohammed Ali Moussa, lawyer for one of the suspects, stated "the investigators did not say anything to him and did not produce any evidence against him . They asked only three questions--where he was, how old he is, that's it."

It remains unclear what charges the captain may face or whether he will stand trial for his alleged role in the tragedy.
