2019 group stage match, will be looking to add another three-digit score to his record at this level. He has scored one century and four fifties in 25 Tests he has played so far, but hasn't had much success overseas in South Africa or England. Guptill joins a strong batting lineup for the Blackcaps, which includes openers Martin Guptil and Henry Nicholls, and senior batsmen Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor and Tom Latham. In addition to Guptil, Nichols has been called up as an all-rounder who can bowl part-time spin in case of need. With the series against England coming up after that, it will be interesting to see how they perform against two quality Test sides.

Guptill, a right-handed batsman, made his debut for New Zealand back in 2013 and has been a regular member of their limited overs side ever since. He is a hard hitter and can also play the cut and pull shot with ease. However, he hasn't had much success in Test cricket, averaging just over 25 in his 25 appearances for New Zealand. He will be hoping to improve on that record and make his mark in the longer format of the game.

In addition to Guptil, Nichols has been called up as an all-rounder who can bowl part-time spin in case of need. Nicholls is a left-handed batsman who made his Test debut for New Zealand in 2018 and has since played six Test matches. He has scored two fifties and a century, but his batting average is still under 30.

The Blackcaps will be hoping that Guptil can provide some much-needed firepower at the top of the order in their upcoming series against England. With a strong bowling attack led by Trent Boult and Tim Southee, they will be confident of winning both Tests against England.

In conclusion, Martin Guptill's recall to the New Zealand Test squad for the upcoming two-match series against England is a positive move for the Blackcaps. With his powerful batting and ability to score quick runs, he could prove to be a valuable asset for New Zealand in their quest for victory. The addition of Nichols as an all-rounder will also provide some much-needed depth to the squad. It remains to be seen how Guptil and Nicholls perform in this series and whether they can make a lasting impression on the Blackcaps team.
