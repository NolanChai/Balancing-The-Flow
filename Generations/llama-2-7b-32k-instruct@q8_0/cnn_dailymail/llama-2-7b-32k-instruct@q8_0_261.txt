Hugo Lloris, the Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper, is not interested in playing for Manchester United according to his agent, Mino Raiola . This revelation will likely increase the likelihood of Tottenham holding onto their French No.1 despite interest from the Red Devils and Chelsea.

Manchester United fear Daniel Levy will play hardball should they decided to pursue their interest in Hugo Lloris. And their worries look set to be realised with Spurs planning to slap a £35million price tag on the World Cup winner, according to the Mirror .

The England boss is not interested in playing for Manchester United according to his agent, Mino Raiola . This revelation will likely increase the likelihood of Tottenham holding onto their French No.1 despite interest from the Red Devils and Chelsea. 

United were believed to be keen on Lloris but this was always going to prove difficult due to the sheer cost and the player's lack of desire. However, the Spurs chairman - who is known for his hardball negotiating tactics - has increased their chances of holding onto one of Europe's best goalkeepers by revealing that he would be willing to listen to offers.

The 29-year old signed a new five-year contract at White Hart Lane last year and is looking forward to staying in London for the long term despite rumours surrounding his future. He wants to continue his development as a footballer, which he sees happening by remaining with Tottenham. "I am very happy here," Lloris said . "I have everything that I need, on and off the pitch."

"I think it's been a good start in London for me and I'm enjoying my time there," he added about Spurs. "I've always had this idea of being at Tottenham. My first thought was to come here and give everything I have to the club. For me, the future is looking good."

The French international has made 173 appearances for his club in all competitions since joining from Lyon five years ago, with Spurs not losing any of their 24 matches where he played. He has been a key component of Mauricio Pochettino's side which are currently top of the Premier League and on course to qualify for next season's Champions League competition.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy was keen to play hardball with Tottenham's rivals last summer when they were interested in their English defender, Toby Alderweireld. They finally signed the Belgian international from Southampton at a price tag of £13m pounds, which was well above his release clause of just under £5m.

Lloris is keen to remain with Spurs and believes they have a good project ahead of them under Pochettino, who he feels is the "best coach" for him . He is happy at White Hart Lane where the club are looking to improve their facilities in order to stay competitive against Europe's top clubs.

Lloris signed his new deal with Spurs last year and has said that there is no reason to leave Tottenham, who he feels offer him the best chance of progressing as a football player . "I have two years left on my contract," he explained . "So I feel comfortable."

The Frenchman insisted it was not a coincidence that his new deal happened before Spurs signed their new stadium sponsorship deal with AIA . This is because Tottenham wanted to reassure the player that they are moving in the right direction as a club by investing heavily into both the squad and the infrastructure.

Their long-term project was confirmed when Lloris signed his five - year extension, which will keep him at Spurs until 2023 . The deal is understood to be worth £16m per season, making it one of the best deals in Tottenham's history. 

The player said he wanted to feel secure and happy with his future at the club before committing to a new five - year contract."I want to have everything organised," Lloris explained . "It was important to find the right balance, not only on a football level but also for my family. My children are settled here in London."

Lloris's current deal runs until 2019 and Tottenham are still considering an extension despite interest from United and Chelsea who both wanted to sign him this summer . Lloris was interested in a move away from White Hart Lane last year but eventually decided that he would remain at the club, even though it meant missing out on a move to Paris Saint-Germain.

Tottenham are still weighing up whether they should cash in on their goalkeeper this summer despite his desire to stay put and be part of Pochettino's exciting project."It is always difficult when you have a player that wants to leave," Levy admitted last week . "But we will not do something if it doesn't make sense for the club. The important thing is to make sure we are in the best position for our players and our club going forward."

United were believed to be interested in signing Lloris at the end of last season but Pochettino blocked any move, as he did not want his player leaving mid-season . However, this summer Levy may have something planned for his star keeper as they look to challenge for a top four finish in the Premier League and qualify for next year's Champions League competition.

The North London outfit will be hoping to build on their success by challenging for silverware again next season, whilst also having one of Europe's best goalkeepers who is looking to continue his development as a footballer at White Hart Lane. Lloris has been instrumental in Tottenham's rise since joining the club five years ago and looks set to stay put .

The Frenchman could be a key component for Pochettino moving forward, with Spurs still looking to improve their squad ahead of next season."We are always trying to do our best," Levy admitted last week . "You have to find that balance between being competitive and also investing in your club. When you are doing well on the pitch then it gives you the opportunity for everybody to feel good, both off and on the pitch. That's when you can move forward."

Tottenham will be hoping to secure Champions League football next season as they look to improve their squad ahead of what should be a competitive campaign in 2019/20 . The club have already signed Giovani Lo Celso from PSG and Ryan Sessegnon is expected to arrive soon. They are also looking to bring in another central defender and a winger, although they face competition for both of these positions with other clubs, including Manchester United and Liverpool."There is not one position that we need to improve," Levy said . "You have to look at all areas because if you don't improve then the rest will get better too. So it's a question of getting the balance right."

Tottenham face stiff competition in the race for next season's Champions League spot with Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal looking to finish ahead of them . However, they have a good chance of achieving their goal if Pochettino can guide his side into top four finish by next May, whilst also ensuring that Lloris remains at the club for at least another five years.
