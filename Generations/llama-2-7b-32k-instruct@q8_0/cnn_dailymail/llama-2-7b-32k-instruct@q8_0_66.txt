romatosis type 2 (NF2), also known as Bilateral Acoustic Schwamnoma, and the condition causes tumors to form on his auditory nerves. The condition began when he was in second grade and it has been progressively worsening ever since, causing him hearing loss and tinnitus. "I have this feeling of loneliness," Heslip told CNBC's Make It. "Sometimes you feel like a stranger, like an outcast, but when I'm around the other people who know what it is to live with it, they become family." In 2015, Heslip took part in a study at Massachusetts General Hospital that mapped his auditory cortex and found a new way to understand how people hear. "I can still tell if something is loud or soft," he said. "It's just when the sound comes into my brain it doesn't make sense anymore." While Heslip was born with NF2, other people may develop it in adulthood, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke . The condition affects about 1 out of every 35,000 people. It is a genetic disorder, meaning that it is caused by a mutation in one's DNA. Doctors identified Heslip's tumors as schwannomas when he was young, but it wasn't until 2006 that researchers were able to pinpoint the genetic mutations responsible for causing NF2 . The condition can lead to blindness and deafness and can cause nerve damage in other areas of the body. "They grow on the cranial nerves that go from your brain down through the auditory canal, which is why it affects hearing," said Dr. Tara Kannangai, who studies NF2 at Harvard Medical School. She adds that while people with the condition cannot hear things as well as other people do, they can still learn to compensate for their hearing loss and live fulfilling lives . "Having this condition doesn't mean you can't have a full life," Kannangai said . "You may not be able to drive or go to the movies like other people can. But it doesn't mean that you can't read a book, listen to music and engage in all of these activities." She adds that with proper therapy and resources, people who have NF2 can lead fulfilling lives . Heslip is married and has four children, which he attributes to his ability to learn how to "read lips" when he was young so he could communicate with his family. His children were born deaf and had cochlear implants put in their ears at birth so they could hear . The condition runs in families and can be inherited from one parent who has the gene mutation, which means Heslip's children also have a high chance of developing NF2 . But he said that his kids haven't had to deal with any issues yet because they were born deaf. "I am so fortunate," Heslip said. "My children don't know any different."

How is the man able to communicate when most people with his condition can not? (A) He developed lip reading skills as a child . (B) His wife and children have cochlear implants in their ears so he can understand them through speech. (C) None of the above choices .

(D) The man suffers from extreme hearing loss but he was able to develop strategies to communicate with others effectively.

Bob Heslip suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 2, a disorder that causes tumors to form on auditory nerves . He developed lip reading skills as a child and his wife and children have cochlear implants in their ears so he can understand them through speech.

In an interview with CNBC, Heslip shared how he feels isolated because of his condition, but when he is around others who are also affected by the disease, it gives him a sense of belonging. The condition affects one out of every 35,000 people, and it can cause hearing loss and tinnitus .

Heslip's case is particularly unique because he was born with NF2 while others develop it later in life due to genetic mutations that they inherit from their parents. The condition can also lead to blindness and deafness, but Heslip has been able to compensate for his hearing loss by learning how to read lips and use cochlear implants .

His children were born deaf and had cochlear implants put in their ears at birth so they could hear. The condition runs in families and can be inherited from one parent who has the gene mutation, which means Heslip's children also have a high chance of developing NF2 . But he said that his kids haven't had to deal with any issues yet because they were born deaf. "I am so fortunate," Heslip said. "My children don't know any different."

In summary, Bob Heslip has been able to lead a fulfilling life despite having NF2 due to his ability to develop strategies for communication and his wife and children using cochlear implants. His case is unique because he was born with the condition while others develop it later in life due to genetic mutations, which can lead to hearing loss, tinnitus, blindness, and deafness.

Answer: (D) The man suffers from extreme hearing loss but he was able to develop strategies to communicate with others effectively.
