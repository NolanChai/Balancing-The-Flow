AC Milan salvage draw with late equaliser against Sampdoria   By Andrew Dampf in Milan   26 October 2011   Last updated: 26 October 2011   The Independent   
An audacious, acrobatic overhead kick from Nigel de Jong nearly proved to be the winning goal for visiting Sampdoria in this weekend's Serie A fixture at San Siro. As he rose high above the Milan players with only a minute remaining, De Jong managed to poke the ball just wide of the near post before it rebounded away and into the waiting arms of AC Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati . Sampdoria had the best scoring opportunity of the night in the 83rd minute as Massimo Cassano headed a cross from Cristian Chivu over the top of the net. But with less than five minutes remaining, it was Milan that equalised through an unfortunate deflection from an acrobatic header by former Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o . After the game Sampdoria manager Sinisa Mihajlovic lamented his team's poor finishing as they failed to convert on a number of chances in the second half. But he was pleased that his players remained positive and aggressive throughout the match despite Milan dominating possession with 56 percent of the ball . The draw leaves Sampdoria in eighth place while Milan maintains its third-place position with five points behind leader Juventus, which has won all six games played so far this season. "This is a big result for us," said De Jong. "We were close to winning the game but it wasn't meant to be tonight ."
