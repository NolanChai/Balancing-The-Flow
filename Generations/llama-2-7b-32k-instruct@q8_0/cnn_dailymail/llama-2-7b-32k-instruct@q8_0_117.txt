Balls has been criticised for his comments about Labour's disastrous financial forecast, which was published in 1983 and revealed how quickly the country could run out of money if spending went unchecked. Asked by journalist Andrew Neil at a Business for Britain debate whether the note - widely referred to as Project Treasury - was still relevant today, Balls said: 'I don't think it is a joke that there are people who believe in Project Treasury and say, "If only we'd gone on borrowing like this..."' The shadow chancellor added: 'It's an absurd thing to say. It's not true.' But Balls has been accused of treating voters with 'contempt' after dismissing the note as a 'joke'. Former Labour MP John Woodcock said Balls' remarks showed he did not understand how serious the issue was and that they were out of touch with ordinary people. He said: 'In my experience, most voters are not laughing about Project Treasury. They may find it amusing to hear Labour politicians make jokes about it, but their real concern is the debt burden we're saddling our children and grandchildren with.' The note - which was published in 1983 by Labour's Treasury team - revealed how much government spending would have to rise year on year to keep up with inflation if taxes were not increased. It warned that a 'continuing fiscal deficit' could result in 'serious problems' such as higher interest rates and slower economic growth. Labour leader Ed Miliband has also dismissed Project Treasury as a joke, telling Andrew Marr on Sunday: 'I think it is a great piece of political satire.'
