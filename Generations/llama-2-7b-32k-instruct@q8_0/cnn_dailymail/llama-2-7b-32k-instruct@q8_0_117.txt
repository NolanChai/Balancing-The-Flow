Ed Balls, who is standing down from his position at the end of this Parliament, has been accused of treating the public with contempt after dismissing as a "joke" the infamous Labour note admitting the party had blown the nation's finances.
The shadow chancellor said those responsible for printing the note - which was sent to Ed Miliband and the unions ahead of an interview in 2013 in which he admitted Labour would not balance the books if it came into power - were "naive". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme:
"I don't think anyone at that time in our party thought this was anything but a joke.
"It was a note, an email to Ed Miliband and the unions saying 'We've got a problem, we can't promise to balance the books'. It was not intended to be made public - it was not taken seriously."

Labour sources pointed out that Balls did not try to disown the document until the row erupted following publication of the Panama Papers last year. A spokesman said: "The Labour Party is now run by a new team under Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell and Ed Miliband has made it clear he believes there must be fiscal responsibility in government."
But the Conservative Party's chairman of the Treasury Select Committee, Andrew Tyrie MP, said: "If he really meant that the note was a joke, then he has treated the British public with contempt.
"There is no excuse for putting out such a document - it was reckless and irresponsible."
A former Labour minister added: "I am appalled at this attitude from someone who wants to be Chancellor of the Exchequer in five weeks' time."
The source said Balls had been warned by his own advisors that printing up a note admitting they would not balance the books if they came into power was a political suicide. But he went ahead anyway. "It just shows what an idiot Ed is," added the former minister.
A Labour insider added: "This kind of arrogant attitude from Ed Balls has been the problem all along. He thinks that because he's seen as an expert on the economy, then no one can question him. The public don't like it when you are condescending towards them."
Balls said it was "completely wrong" to suggest Labour had a fiscal credibility crisis - despite being left with the biggest debts in its history by 2013. He told Today: "Labour will run a responsible and balanced government, we'll balance the budget in the next Parliament."
Asked about his decision not to disclose the note until it emerged as a result of the Panama Papers last year, he said: "That was a mistake. I wasn't involved with that decision - those people weren't working for me at the time."
Balls is due to give evidence to Mr Tyrie's committee on Monday over Labour's record on tax and spending. The committee has been investigating Labour's financial management since 2013 when Balls was shadow chancellor under Miliband.
Mr Balls was also grilled by the committee last week about his decision not to allow an audit of Labour accounts after taking over as the party's general secretary in 2011. He told MPs it was a "mistake" which he regrets and insisted that Labour's books are now independently audited each year."

A number of comments from British newspapers follow, including:
* The Sun: 'Balls mocked as his excuse for why he didn't tell anyone about the note admitting he couldn't balance the country's books is laughable.'
* Mail on Sunday: "'Ed Miliband and Ed Balls had been warned the document was a political suicide and yet they published it anyway. The Tories will be laughing all the way to the polls'.
* Daily Telegraph: 'It seems that Mr Balls has forgotten what Labour’s manifesto pledges cost . He can try to blame others but there is no excuse for this sort of incompetence.'"

The text of the note in question: "There is no way to hide what will happen to us if we win the election," it read. The email was sent just a month before Ed Miliband gave an interview promising not to "reinvent" Labour's spending plans as part of its 2015 election campaign, sparking fresh controversy over the party's financial management."
