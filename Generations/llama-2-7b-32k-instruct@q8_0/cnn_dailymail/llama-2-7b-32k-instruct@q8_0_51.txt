Jamie Carragher believes Chelsea captain John Terry is the best defender to have ever graced the Premier League.   Terry, 34, has enjoyed another impressive season at Stamford Bridge and was the star player in his team's runners-up finish in last year's competition.   The Englishman also led Chelsea to a record fifth Champions League title and Carragher believes he is the finest defender to have ever graced England's top flight.   "He has won every honour there is, other than the World Cup," said Carragher in an interview with Sky Sports.   "His record at Chelsea speaks for itself - a Premier League title, five Champions Leagues and four FA Cups."

"Terry's impact on the dressing room has been huge because he's won everything there is to win as a player . He's not just one of the best centre-backs that England have ever had; he's probably one of the most important players the Premier League has ever seen," added Carragher.

Terry, who has spent all of his senior career at Stamford Bridge, is yet to win the Premier League Player of the Year award but was named in the 10-man PFA Team of the Year for four consecutive seasons between 2007 and 2010.   Carragher believes he has won the award's equivalent in Chelsea colours - the Players' Player of the Season award .   "If Terry didn't have that award at Chelsea, I don't think anybody would ever talk about him," added Carragher."
