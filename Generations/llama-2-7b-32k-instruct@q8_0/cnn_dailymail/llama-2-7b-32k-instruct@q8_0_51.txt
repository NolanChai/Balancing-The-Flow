former in his side's 5-1 humbling of Manchester City on Saturday . Carragher told Sky Sports: "I think John Terry is probably the best defender that England have ever had or ever will have. His record is phenomenal, he has won all the honours there are to win at club level and for his country."

Carragher added: "He's 34 years of age now but he still looks like one of the top centre backs in the Premier League, that's a fantastic achievement . It's no surprise he is the England skipper. If you look at the centre-back positions that have come and gone over the last few years - Sol Campbell, Rio Ferdinand, Ledley King, William Gallas, Jaap Stam, Alan Shearer - nobody has done as much or achieved so much . I think he's the best."

Carragher was full of praise for Terry and believes that he is now playing better than when he won his first England cap in 1997. Carragher said: "He's one player who has been around long enough to know what it takes . He's the complete defender, a great reader of the game, gets the ball out of defence well and is a good passer."

Carragher added that Terry remains the best in the business at clearing the ball from danger: "No-one is better than him when it comes to clearances - he's probably got to be the best in Europe. His anticipation for getting the ball out of defence is incredible . He's also very comfortable on the ball, which gives him an edge."

The former Liverpool defender was full of admiration for Terry: "His record speaks for itself - he has won every major honour there is to win at club level and for his country. That tells you everything about the man . The way that he's conducted himself over the years as well, both on and off the pitch, I think it just shows how good a person John Terry really is."

Carragher was also full of praise for Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho who he believes has played an important part in Terry's development: "In his time at the club, which dates back to 2004 when he joined from Charlton Athletic, I think you could say that he's got better and better . He's had a brilliant relationship with Mourinho. They have worked together so closely over so many years."

Carragher believes Terry remains the best at what he does: "He has the ability to win tackles - he was always very good at that, his anticipation is still there and I think you can see him getting better with age . He's got a bit more time on the ball now as well which makes it difficult for defenders."

Carragher added: "The best players are those who have longevity and Terry has done that. It doesn't matter if he's playing in a two or three-man defence, at right back or left back . He just gets on with his job week in, week out . That tells you everything about the man."

Carragher was also full of praise for Chelsea team-mate Gary Cahill who has had another impressive season: "You look at someone like Gary Cahill as well - he's got an excellent record since coming into the Premier League and it's been very much a case of 'keep it simple'. It's not rocket science, it's just getting the ball out from defence to midfield quickly and efficiently . I think Gary Cahill is probably one of the best at that."

Carragher added: "He has got good pace, he has got a lot of strength, he can read the game well. It doesn't matter whether it's in an attacking sense or defending - he gets himself into the right position and he is always there to help Terry out . He's a very important part of that back four."

Carragher also praised Cesar Azpilicueta for his contribution at Chelsea this season: "I think Cesar Azpilicueta has come into the team as well and he looks like he was signed to play centre-back, not wing back . It's been a brilliant signing from Mourinho. I think you look at a player like him as well who has adapted so quickly - it's incredible."

Carragher said: "He is playing in an unfamiliar position for the first time this season and he looks very comfortable there . It's been a brilliant signing from Mourinho, that's a great bit of business, to get him at such good value. He has come into the team as a left back and now it seems like he is settled in at centre-back."

Carragher believes Azpilicueta is an example of how Chelsea have managed to develop some outstanding young players from their academy: "They've got some terrific players coming through, they're all good footballers and they know what it takes . They know the standards that are expected at this club. It's not just about being quick or having good feet - there has to be a lot more."

Carragher praised Azpilicueta: "He's had a terrific season, I think he can play both positions and it shows the versatility that Chelsea have got . It's something they are really proud of. They've got some very good young players coming through who all know what it takes to be a professional footballer at this club."

Carragher believes Azpilicueta is an example of how Mourinho has managed to get the best out of his players: "It's been another terrific season for Jose Mourinho - he can be criticised for being stubborn with regards to his tactics but you look at the way that Chelsea have played this season and they are a very, very good team . They are strong defensively and in attacking areas . Their balance has been good throughout the season."

Carragher believes Azpilicueta is another example of how Mourinho's man-management skills have helped Chelsea achieve success: "You look at a player like Cesar Azpilicueta and how quickly he has come to grips with this game, you've got to give it to the manager. He's managed to get his players to buy into what he wants from them . You see the balance of the team."

Carragher believes Azpilicueta is an example of how Mourinho has helped Chelsea maintain their winning mentality: "There is a terrific spirit in that dressing room - they're all good footballers, they are good professionals and they know what it takes to succeed at this level."

Carragher believes Azpilicueta has played an important role in Chelsea's success this season: "He has been a key player for Chelsea this season, he's had to adapt and learn quickly but he's done it . He's been very good."

Carragher said: "I think you can see the progress that they've made since last season - that is what Chelsea are all about. They're trying to build for the future as well as being successful in the present . You look at a player like him who has come from nowhere and he's playing first team football."

Carragher praised Azpilicueta: "He's had another terrific season, he's got great pace, strength and power - it's unbelievable . I think you look at him as a defender but he has also got an attacking threat which is very rare . He is very much a modern day full-back."
