ations (DPP) for England and Wales, said:
"I am going to seek judicial review of any suggestion that I have acted improperly or irrationally."
Lord Janner, who died aged 87 in December 2015 while facing sexual abuse charges, was found "not fit to plead" at the Old Bailey in June. He has been accused of sexually assaulting and raping boys between the ages of eight and 16 while he was a Labour MP in the 1970s.
The DPP told a packed press conference she had not sought permission from her boss, Attorney General Jeremy Wright QC MP, to bring proceedings against her critics who have questioned her decision to not prosecute Lord Janner over the allegations, and said the case was "not about me".
"It is not about whether or not I am a fit and proper person to hold my post," she said.
She said the court challenge would be about her legal obligation to consider whether there is sufficient evidence for the criminal standard of proof - which requires a jury to believe allegations are true beyond reasonable doubt, "beyond all reasonable doubt" .
The DPP has already been accused by Janner's supporters of over-turning decades of prosecution policy in relation to sexual abuse cases. She said: "It is not an attack on me or the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service)." The case would be about her interpretation of law, she added, and whether it was appropriate for Lord Janner to stand trial at all given his age and ill health.
Asked if there had been any interference in the decision not to prosecute, she said: "None whatsoever." She added that "the only thing which will be reviewed is my decision - nothing else".
The DPP told journalists it was a "tricky" decision and would have been taken by anyone of her rank. Lord Janner's accusers are understood to have been offered financial compensation for the collapse of prosecution proceedings in return for withdrawing their complaints against him, but they refused the offer.
Janner, whose death led to renewed demands for a public inquiry into decades of allegations of institutional abuse and neglect at Westminster, was investigated by North Yorkshire Police until 2014. He denied all the allegations against him.
The police had recommended his prosecution on three counts of indecent assault against two complainants in the early 1980s but the Crown Prosecution Service decided he should not be charged . The decision was reached after a review by the CPS' specialist Rape and Serious Sexual Offences Unit, which concluded there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Lord Janner over any of the allegations.
In February 2015, the DPP agreed that her office would consider whether it had enough evidence to charge him with one or more offences under Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which deals with sexual activity by a person in position of trust towards their victim.
The CPS said: "In reaching its decision not to prosecute Lord Janner in respect of any allegations made against him prior to his death, the CPS was required to make an assessment as to whether there is sufficient evidence available for the criminal standard of proof - that is, evidence which would provide a realistic prospect of conviction.
"This test is applied consistently across the country in all areas of prosecution work and to cases of this nature."<s>
