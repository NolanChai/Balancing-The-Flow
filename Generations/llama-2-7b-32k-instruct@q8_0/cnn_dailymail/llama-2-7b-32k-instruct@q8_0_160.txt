Saunder's is a career prosecutor who has worked for more than two decades. She was hired by CPS last year to lead its review of allegations against Janner. The agency announced in February that it would not bring charges because of concerns about the late peer's health and ability to mount a proper defense if he were charged, despite a large volume of evidence. The decision prompted accusations that Saunder's was protecting an ally, after she had earlier said Janner should face trial, reports BBC. "If people have got problems with what we've done, they are free to challenge me in court," Saunders told the Guardian newspaper. "I'm not going to say any more on it." The director of a pressure group that represents victims of abuse said she should resign. She had earlier defended the decision by saying that prosecuting Janner was unlikely to result in a conviction, while his health would prevent him from being able to adequately defend himself. Saunder's is not the first career prosecutor accused of protecting powerful figures, reports BBC
