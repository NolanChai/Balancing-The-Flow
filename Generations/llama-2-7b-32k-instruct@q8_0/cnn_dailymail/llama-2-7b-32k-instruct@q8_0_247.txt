lt walk 200m was spied by officers out on an enforcement patrol.

A man who said he couldn't walk more than 200 metres because of his arthritis has been fined £795 for fraudulently claiming a blue badge . Paul Gregory, aged 51, of Bedford, was given the opportunity to explain why he should not be held responsible for a criminal offence when he appeared before Luton Magistrates' Court last week (23/06).

Gregory said that his arthritis had been "flaring up" but told officers his condition did not prevent him from walking more than 200m as claimed on the application form for a blue badge . Gregory, who works at a garage and does DIY in his spare time, was fined £795 and ordered to pay costs of £148.36 after pleading guilty to fraudulently claiming he had a permanent disability that prevented him from walking more than 200m on 7 July last year at the end of the Chilterns Way in St Albans, Hertfordshire .

He told officers he was unaware it is an offence to make a false claim for a blue badge and that he had been using his sister's vehicle when the offence happened . He said he applied for a blue badge as he wanted to park in St Albans city centre, where there are very limited parking spaces and he was asked to provide evidence of need.

Officers were on an enforcement patrol that day when they spotted Gregory walking along the Chilterns Way. He had his badge displayed in his car windscreen . A check with the DVLA revealed the badge was valid at the time he was seen driving on 7 July but had expired a few days later on 11 July.

Anna Fear, prosecuting for Central Beds Council, said: "He made a false declaration to claim he needed to use it and it has been used fraudulently."

Gregory told officers that his sister had used her badge but had returned it when she was given a disabled parking permit by her doctor. He claimed he had only used the badge once while visiting St Albans and did not know if the number on the application form corresponded to the one on the badge .

He told officers: "I would like to apologise for any inconvenience this has caused." A spokesman from Central Beds Council said it had received an 82pc success rate in recovering blue badges which had been misused or fraudulently obtained. The council can take away a person's blue badge if they have been accused of abusing it .
