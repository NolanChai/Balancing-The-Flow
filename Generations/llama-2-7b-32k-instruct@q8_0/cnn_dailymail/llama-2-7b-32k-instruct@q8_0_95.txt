What are these vessels made of? Can you give us a description?

- The vessels are made out of driftwood, which we picked up along the Auckland coastline from beaches at Te Atatu to Karekare, on both sides of Auckland . We didn't want to use anything artificial or man-made.
- They were made from some pieces of furniture and old doors that had been in storage for 20 years. I don't know about their construction methods, but they looked very sturdy! The vessels are made out of driftwood. It was just something to do."
- We didn't have a lot to work with at the time so we used old furniture from our house . We picked it up off the beach and built them on site using nails and screws. They were fairly large - about 5m long and 4.5m wide.
