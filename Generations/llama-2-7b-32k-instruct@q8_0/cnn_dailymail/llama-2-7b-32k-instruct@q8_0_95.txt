Title: Title: Good product but...
Review: This is a good product for what it claims to do, i.e. to remove dirt and water stains from clothing or carpets. However, there are some problems with it that I hope will be addressed by the company in future products. The first problem is that after using it on my clothing it tends to dry them out too much and makes them feel like cardboard. This causes an unpleasant feeling against your skin when you wear clothes that have been cleaned this way, and if worn for any extended period of time can be very uncomfortable. The second problem is the smell. There is a distinct smell to the detergent which is unpleasant when first opened, although it does fade over time (I had to keep reopening the bottle every day or so for about three weeks until the smell was no longer noticeable). I have cleaned my clothing with this product several times now and all of them still retain a faint hint of the unpleasant smell, which can be quite distracting. I would recommend this product to those who are looking for something relatively inexpensive to clean their clothes quickly, but there must be better options out there.
Is the review positive or negative?
