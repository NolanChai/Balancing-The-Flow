Ball tampering scandal: South Australia coach steps down (CNN) Paul Downton, coach of South Australia since 2015, has resigned following the ball-tampering scandal that has engulfed Australian cricket.   He had been under intense pressure to leave after a Cricket Australia investigation into the affair found "serious errors" in judgment by several players on his team . The report also criticized the coaching staff and said they had "failed in their duty of care."   Downton said he was resigning because "I cannot provide leadership that will get this group to a level I want it to be at." "My job is to take the heat out of it for them and I've obviously failed in that," he added .   Australian Cricketers Association chief executive Paul Marsh said Downton had made the right decision, although he said more heads should roll. "We need to get this behind us, we need to look ahead to what needs to be done in cricket," he told a news conference .   The investigation into the affair was led by former Australian High Court judge Mark Livesey and released its findings on Wednesday after Cricket Australia suspended Smith and Warner for a year and slapped a lifetime ban on coach Darren Lehmann, who had resigned earlier this week. The report found that the team's leadership group and support staff failed in their duty of care to Smith, who was caught using sandpaper on the ball during last month's third Test against South Africa in Cape Town .   In addition, the report criticized the coaches for "their failure to adequately prepare players for the pressures of playing at such a high level," as well as failing to ensure that Smith and Warner understood the gravity of the offense they were committing. Downton had been with Cricket South Australia since 1987, starting out as coach of the state's under-age teams before moving into senior coaching positions . In recent years he has served as the national team's batting coach and as head coach for South Australia's domestic team, but his stint in the latter role was marred by the scandal.   Cricket Australia chairman Earl Eddings said the board was grateful for Downton's service to cricket . "It is clear from the report that Paul has been an outstanding servant of Australian cricketers and South Australian cricketers," he said in a statement .   Cricket South Australia chief executive Keith Bradshaw agreed, saying: "He will be missed, particularly by those who have had the good fortune to know him."   Earlier this week, Australia's former coach Justin Langer expressed his surprise at Downton's decision not to resign after Smith and Warner admitted they had erred in judgment.   Smith was named as captain of Australia in August 2015 but is set to step down following the ball-tampering scandal, with Cricket Australia saying it would appoint a new leader for its team in due course .
