ippy-top resorts like the One&Only Reethi Rah in the south and Soneva Fushi on the Baa Atoll can be like stepping into another world. Even at budget end, the overwater villas of the larger resorts make for a memorable stay. And the food! If you're looking for a relaxing vacation in paradise, this might just be your place.

But don't let the hype fool you; there are some major downsides to visiting the Maldives: It can be expensive, especially if you want to stay on one of those overwater bungalows or in a beachside resort with private pool access. There isn't much to do other than lounge by the pool and eat at fancy restaurants. You could also find yourself having to pay $30 for a glass of wine (in 2014) when you might be used to spending half that in Bali or Thailand. And while there is good snorkeling off the beaches, you'll need to pay for snorkel gear ($8-$15).

That said, the Maldives is a bucket list destination for many and worth visiting if you can afford it. Some of the resorts are more affordable than others; the cheapest room at the One&Only Reethi Rah costs about $300 per night. It's also possible to book on a budget, but expect to stay in an overwater bungalow with a shared pool and pay upwards of $150 for breakfast (which is included) if you want a hot meal rather than fruit and yogurt.

You should still read this guide before going to the Maldives to get some tips on how to stay comfortable and make the most of your trip.

When to visit the Maldives
Most people traveling to the Maldives spend their days by the pool, lounging in an overwater villa or in a hammock by their beachside bungalow, but there are plenty of things to do on land as well: tennis, basketball, and volleyball are all available at most resorts. You can also book excursions like fishing trips ($60 per person), snorkeling trips ($8-$15), or private boat tours for $130 per person (the cost is higher if you stay in the north).

The Maldives' rainy season lasts from April to October, and there are some downsides: It can be windy on the island, which means it might be less pleasant by the beach. Plus, mosquitos breed during this time as well, so you may want to bring bug spray (or a mosquito net if your resort doesn't provide one). You should also check for deals on accommodations that are available during these months and save some money in the process!

There is also an additional surcharge of $40-$50 per night from December to April, because this is high season. If you stay in a villa with your own pool ($135 per person, minimum 2 nights) or have breakfast included in your rate, it's more affordable during these months.

When should I visit the Maldives?
If you want to go swimming every day and avoid spending much time indoors due to bad weather, then visiting in July would be ideal for you. The water is warmest at 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 degrees Celsius) around this month. If you want more of a cultural experience, January might be better for you; it's not peak tourist season, so there will be fewer crowds and the locals will have their own holiday celebrations to attend!

What should I pack for the Maldives?
The Maldives is warm throughout the year, but it can get windy during April through October. Bring a lightweight sweater or hoodie to wear in the evening, and be prepared for rainy days with umbrellas and light layers. If you're planning on swimming daily, bring some sort of swimsuit cover up to protect your clothes from getting wet when it rains. You may want a beach bag for carrying around your phone, wallet, etc. It can get windy at times so also pack a hat or sunglasses!

How much should I tip in the Maldives?
At budget end resorts like Club Med Kani, tipping isn't as necessary because they have a low staff to guest ratio and don't provide many services. But if you want to leave some extra cash for the maids or pool attendants who help keep your villa clean and tidy during your stay, it's not a bad idea! You can also tip at higher end resorts like One&Only Reethi Rah where there are more staff and they provide personalized services such as packing and unpacking your clothes.

How to save money in the Maldives
It might be tempting to book on the cheapest resort you can find, but this will leave you with less space in your wallet for other expenses like snorkel gear ($8-$15), activities like fishing or snorkeling excursions ($60 per person), and even drinks. You might also have to pay a higher room rate if the resort is located on an isolated island, since you'll need to factor in the cost of boat transfers (usually around $20-$35 each way) from Male Airport.

A common trick is to find accommodations that include meals and drinks in the price. Even a $130 per person per night room at the One&Only Reethi Rah comes with all-day dining, unlimited alcoholic drinks (including champagne), and non-alcoholic beverages.

You can also book excursions on your own if you're a thrifty traveler to avoid paying resort prices, but this may require some haggling skills since many tour operators will have little competition when it comes to the price they charge guests of their hotel. A snorkeling trip that costs $60 per person in the Maldives can be as low as $35-$40 on your own (ask for cash payments, since credit card fees can be 10% or more).

Finally, consider shopping for accommodations in the north of Male Atoll where hotel prices are cheaper due to less demand. If you book a package deal with an airline, then you'll get even better deals. Some Maldivian resorts also offer discounted rates if you book at least 30 days in advance.

How do I get around the Maldives?
If your resort is on the main island of Male or nearby islands, it will be very easy to get around via speedboat ($16-$42 per person roundtrip). If you stay on a more isolated island, like Vilu Reef in the North or Nika Island in the South, then you'll need to book a domestic flight from Male Airport. Expect to pay at least $300 for a one way ticket and plan ahead since flights sell out quickly (especially on weekends).

How do I get to the Maldives?
Most people traveling to the Maldives will arrive in Mal√© International Airport, which has direct flights from major cities like Dubai and Bangkok as well as many smaller islands in the region. The airport is located on Hulhule Island, just 2 km away from Male City.

You can also get to the Maldives by boat or plane from Colombo, Sri Lanka (you'll need to take a ferry if you choose this route).

How do I stay safe in the Maldives?
It is extremely unlikely that you will experience crime during your trip; even with so many tourists flocking to the islands it remains one of the safest countries in the world. The biggest safety concern in the Maldives would be jellyfish stings, especially if you decide to snorkel or scuba dive without a wetsuit (jellyfish stings can cause itchy welts that last for days).

You should also keep your valuables and important documents safe since there are many pickpockets in Male City. And remember: Don't drink the water! Some tourists have even fallen victim to "water scams," where they were served bottled water with a hidden camera inside (and taken for thousands of dollars).

Is the Maldives worth it?
If you can afford it, then definitely book that trip. The Maldives is a bucket list destination and most people leave saying they'd return in a heartbeat! Even if it's not entirely within your budget, consider getting creative with some of these tips to make the most of your trip:

* Book on an off-season deal or with an airline package (this will also save you from paying that extra $40-$50 per night surcharge)
* Look for resorts located in the north of Male Atoll where hotel prices are cheaper due to less demand.
* Opt for a budget end accommodation like Club Med Kani which comes with all-day dining and drinks included ($135 pp, min
