Neymar had 30 goals and 15 assists for PSG last season. His numbers were also better than Lionel Messi's at Barcelona, with whom he played for four seasons before joining PSG two years ago. Neymar has been criticized by some fans and pundits of the French club, but he still holds a special place in Paris Saint-Germain’s history books.

In 2018, when he was offered to Barcelona, it seemed like the perfect fit: PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi had been able to buy Neymar for €222 million thanks to Qatar Airways, which holds a stake in his club and has ties to Barcelona.

But things did not go as planned with the Brazilian. The 30 - year - old, who arrived at PSG for the first time from Santos, was expected to become the face of the French club. He soon found out that there are a lot more faces in Barcelona and he wasn’t among them.

It didn’t help that Neymar had never been a leader or captain. His best years were behind him and he needed some time off in order to recover from injuries, so it was not surprising when the Brazilian struggled to adapt to his new environment. He also lost touch with Lionel Messi, who is one of the world’s most important players at Barcelona.

The two had been close since 2013 when Neymar moved to PSG for €57 million. But they slowly drifted apart and things reached a boiling point last year in Paris Saint-Germain’s first meeting with Barcelona. The Catalan club won that game 4-0 at the Parc des Princes, but it was Neymar who stood out: he had four shots on target, five key passes and two assists in addition to his two goals. He even celebrated one of them by taking off his shirt as a tribute to his friend and teammate.

PSG fans were furious at the Brazilian’s behavior after the game. Neymar was even criticized for not helping out his teammates when Barcelona came on top 10 minutes into extra time in PSG’s home ground. But Barcelona’s Lionel Messi didn’t seem to mind, as he smiled at his adversary and walked over to congratulate Neymar after the game, putting an end to what was a fierce rivalry between both players for a long time.

Neymar's performance against Barcelona at Parc des Princes was not only memorable because of his four goals and two assists. He also showed a lot of character in the face of adversity. The Brazilian scored all his goals from inside the area, making him one of the few players to do so in European football’s elite club competition.

The forward also had the best dribbling ability with nine completed dribbles and was able to create a total of 15 goal scoring chances. Neymar has not been able to replicate his performance against Barcelona ever since he joined PSG, but one thing is certain: he will always be remembered for his game at Parc des Princes in the Champions League quarter-finals between both clubs two years ago.

Neymar and Barcelona have a long history together. Both players were teammates for four seasons at Santos. But it was Neymar who left first to join Barcelona, making him one of the most expensive transfers of all time when he arrived in 2013.

The Brazilian’s arrival didn’t go as planned with Barcelona, either. After his €57 million transfer from PSG, Neymar struggled to find a place among Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez and Andres Iniesta at the Camp Nou. The Argentinean was not happy about the fact that he had to play in front of him and wasn’t used to it anymore.

In addition, Neymar had some clashes with Luis Enrique, his coach, after he returned from a knee injury that kept him out for nine months at the end of the 2016 - 2017 season. Neymar also was criticized by Barcelona fans for being too greedy and selfish, but it all changed when the Brazilian scored four goals in PSG's first meeting with the Catalan club at Parc des Princes on February 14th, 2018.

Barcelona and Neymar were on a collision course ever since that game. The player had been linked to Barcelona again for months after his lackluster performance during PSG’s season at the 2022 World Cup. Rumors of a possible return to Catalonia even sparked when the forward was seen having dinner with Lionel Messi and Joan Laporta, Barcelona’s president, last summer.

But Neymar chose to stay in Paris after all and it seems like that decision worked out better for him than it did for Barcelona. The Brazilian led PSG to a Ligue 1 title with 30 goals and 15 assists. It was not his best season at the club but he still had an amazing year, even if many fans don't agree.

Barcelona is not giving up on Neymar just yet, though. The Catalan club has been linked to him for a long time and they are aware of his situation. They could sign the Brazilian at the end of this season for €30 million plus €10 million in add-ons, which would represent an incredible bargain considering what PSG paid for him four years ago.

Neymar has been criticized by Barcelona fans and even some teammates due to his performances against them at the Camp Nou. The 30 - year - old didn’t score in two games between both teams last season, but he did have an impressive performance against Barcelona at Parc des Princes. It seems that it is only a matter of time until Neymar and Barcelona meet again and we will know if the Brazilian has made up his mind about his future.

Barcelona was the team who gave Neymar his chance to shine in European football. He played 42 times for the Catalan club in La Liga, scoring 15 goals and providing nine assists. In addition, he also scored eight goals in other competitions with Barcelona, including five games in the Champions League, two games in the Copa del Rey and one game against Napoli in the Europa League.

It seems that Neymar still has a special place in his heart for Barcelona, but it will be PSG who decides whether he stays at Parc des Princes or if he goes to Catalonia next summer. Barcelona is still hoping to sign him, though, as they are aware of the Brazilian’s situation and know that he can improve their team by giving them the creativity they lack in La Liga.

Barcelona’s failure to convince Neymar to return to Spain has led many fans to ask if he is still a Barcelona player or not. The Catalan club did everything they could, but it seems like PSG isn’t willing to let their star player go just yet.

Neymar's time at Paris Saint-Germain has been an interesting one. He joined the French team for €222 million and had a very successful first season with them, leading the club to their first ever Champions League final. But it seems that things have gone downhill since then as PSG failed to win any of the four competitions they were in this past year, which has led many fans to ask if he is still a Paris Saint-Germain player or not.

The Brazilian signed a contract with PSG until 2025 and his current salary is €36 million per season, according to reports from Mundo Deportivo. But it seems like Neymar will leave PSG for Barcelona in the near future if rumors about him joining the Catalan club are true, as he has always wanted to play with Lionel Messi again.

Neymar is still a key player at PSG and can improve their team by giving them the creativity they lack. He had an impressive performance against Barcelona in 2018 and even scored four goals that night. His decision not to join Barcelona last summer, though, has made some fans question his loyalty towards Paris Saint-Germain.

It seems like Neymar's time at PSG is coming to an end and many fans are wondering if he will be playing for Barcelona next season. He still wants to play with Lionel Messi again and it seems that Barcelona might be the best place for him, especially since they have been linked to him for months now.

Barcelona has not given up on signing Neymar yet as they are aware of his situation at PSG and know that he can improve their team by giving them creativity that they lack in La Liga. It seems like Barcelona's failure to convince Neymar to return to Spain has led many fans to ask if he is still a Barcelona player or not, but it seems like PSG isn't willing to let the Brazilian go just yet.
