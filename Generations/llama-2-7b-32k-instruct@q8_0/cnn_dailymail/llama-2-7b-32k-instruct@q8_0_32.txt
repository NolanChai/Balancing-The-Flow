Barcelona are no stranger to Brazilian players, with the likes of Romario, Ronaldinho and Rivaldo all having graced their ranks over the years . And they have also managed to fend off interest from Paris Saint Germain when it comes to Neymar.

As Neymar is in his prime – and not yet ready for a new challenge at Barcelona after spending four seasons with PSG since 2017 – PSG will need to be patient when they come calling again at the end of this season, while Barcelona may also need to be clever in their approach.

What have we learnt from Barca’s handling of Neymar?

The key lesson from Barcelona’s previous dealings with Paris Saint Germain and Neymar is that they should not give away too much in a transfer fee. The Catalan club reportedly offered €120million for the Brazilian winger in 2017, which was rejected.

Barcelona should have known that PSG would be able to afford Neymar’s release clause of €222m after signing Qatari investment firm Qatar Sports Investments as a minority shareholder. As a result, Barcelona needed to play hardball in negotiations.

As it turns out, Barcelona got their way, with PSG eventually settling for €80million and Neymar ending up at the Parc des Princes . But Barca had made their interest public knowledge – something they needn’t have done.

In order to avoid putting themselves in a compromising position like that in the future, Barcelona must make sure not to give PSG any idea of what they would be willing to pay for Neymar again, especially since the Ligue 1 side know they can simply sign him next summer by triggering his release clause.

Neymar has also shown in the past that he isn’t afraid of taking on Barca – as was evident when PSG beat them in the Champions League last year . But Barcelona need to show that Neymar doesn’t have the upper hand if they want him back at Camp Nou next summer, and their handling of his previous transfer has shown them how.

The Blaugrana are also set for a major clearout this summer as a result of the financial impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on football . The Catalan club have already cut staff numbers by 12% in recent months, and further departures could be made if they continue to struggle financially.

As such, Barcelona must also decide how much money they are willing to spend on Neymar and whether he is worth it at all as they look to make the club more financially sustainable . For now, it seems that the winger won’t be back at Camp Nou next season, but PSG will need to keep their interest in him a secret.

PSG are currently top of Ligue 1 and are also the reigning French champions after winning last year’s title, and they would look to Neymar to make the difference as they chase another success. They have already qualified for this season’s Champions League competition but will need to win it in order to get revenge on Barcelona for their 2017 defeat.

Barcelona must therefore not let PSG use Neymar to beat them and, instead of letting the French side dictate terms like they have in previous transfer negotiations, should try to turn the tables this time around. They will need to be smart if they are going to get what they want from the dealings with Neymar.

In order to do that, Barcelona must make sure not to give PSG any idea of what they would be willing to pay for Neymar again, especially since the Ligue 1 side know they can simply sign him next summer by triggering his release clause . And while he is undoubtedly one of Europe’s best players at present, Barcelona must also decide how much money they are willing to spend on Neymar and whether he is worth it at all as they look to make the club more financially sustainable.

Barcelona can only afford to do business with PSG if it makes financial sense for them . The Catalan club’s finances have taken a hit because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the sale of Neymar could help them balance their books . And while it seems that he won’t be back at Camp Nou next season, PSG will need to keep their interest in him a secret.
