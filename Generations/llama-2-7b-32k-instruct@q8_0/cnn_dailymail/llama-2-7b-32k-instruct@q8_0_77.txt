Denver protesters clash with cops; police arrest nine (CNN) -- A few dozen people at a rally in Denver on Wednesday night began smashing windows and looting businesses after the main demonstration dispersed.  Police arrested nine people for charges including assault of a police officer, robbery, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, officials said.  Some protesters clashed with cops as they tried to make their way downtown from the state Capitol building, where a march had been held earlier in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The event was the first one of three planned for this week by Black Lives Matter Denver, which is seeking justice reform and an end to police brutality against black people. It has not commented on Wednesday's events.  Police were forced to respond with pepper balls and tear gas after protesters threw glass bottles and rocks at officers downtown in the area of Colfax Avenue and Grant Street, CNN affiliate KMGH reported. The confrontation started when police told a group of demonstrators that they had to leave an alleyway where they were blocking traffic, CNN affiliate KUSA reported.  Authorities said five people were hospitalized, including three police officers. It's unclear if the injuries were caused by the pepper balls or other factors.   At least four businesses were damaged in the area around the clash, and some of the damage was "significant," Denver Police Chief Robert White said.  The demonstration was largely peaceful with about 10,000 people marching from the Capitol building to Civic Center Park downtown, KMGH reported.
