Title: England star believes Bath can use pain from Europe as spur for Premiership glory

England wing Anthony Watson believes the pain of Bath's European Champions Cup exit can be a driving force in their push to make this season's Aviva Premiership play-offs.  
Watson and company were left heartbroken after blowing a 25-3 lead at home against Toulon on Saturday, eventually losing 41-0 in the Champions Cup quarter-finals. But Watson feels Bath can take heart from that performance and use it as motivation for the rest of their campaign.  
"It hurts because we know how good we are," said Watson. "We're not a team that doesn't get into positions, we have done it time and again in the past four years. It just so happens this weekend wasn't our day."  
Bath will be aiming to secure an immediate top six finish in the Premiership when they host Worcester Warriors on Friday night as they look to put European disappointment behind them, and Watson feels their failure could also act as a motivator.  
"It will give us a little bit of drive, maybe," he said. "The lads know what we're capable of doing. If you start looking at the positives we have had an excellent season so far. But there is still more to come."  
Watson feels Bath can use their European experience in the Champions Cup against the lessons learnt by Newcastle Falcons from last season to be successful in the Premiership play-offs, should they make it that far. The Falcons crashed out of the competition at the first hurdle after losing 54-19 away to Munster but bounced back with a win over Scarlets at Kingston Park, and Watson feels their success can inspire his side.  
"The Falcons played in the same pool as us," he said. "They have had a fantastic season this year and it has given them drive for next season. It will be good for everyone involved if we get over that hurdle of being knocked out of Europe."
