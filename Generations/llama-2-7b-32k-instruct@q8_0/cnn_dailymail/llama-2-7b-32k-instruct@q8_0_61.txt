"Secret" Drawing Reveals Pilot's Guilt Over Bombing Japan (Reuters) Reuters - A drawing and several letters that belonged to the co-pilot of Enola Gay, the plane that dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945, have surfaced revealing that he was deeply affected by his role in killing thousands. 

The drawings and letters belonged to Robert Lewis who flew as co-pilot with Col. Paul Tibbets, the pilot of Enola Gay.  
"There are several letters which Mr. Lewis wrote home after the war which express a great deal of sadness about what he had done," said David Reynolds, chairman of the National Atomic Museum Foundation and author of "Japan's Longest Day: Hiroshima and Nagasaki." 

The first bomb was dropped on August 6, 1945. The U.S. Air Force named Enola Gay, a B-29 Superfortress, after Lewis's mother  
"(Enola) was the name of his mother," said Reynolds, who wrote a book about the mission . "He wrote letters home to that effect and the letters clearly express a great deal of sadness over what had occurred." 

Lewis died in 1970. His drawings were discovered by a friend of his granddaughter.  
"We got these from a man named Carl Duckett, who is a good friend of (the) grandchildren," said Reynolds . "He was the one that found them and they had been stored away for many years." 

Reynolds said it was not clear why Lewis hid his feelings after dropping the bomb. He speculated that perhaps he felt guilt over the fact that more people were killed by the bomb than originally thought, or that the mission was kept a secret from him.  
"I think that perhaps what happened is that Captain Lewis got so involved in carrying out this mission that he had no idea of the thousands and thousands who would be dead," said Reynolds . "And I can speculate that maybe afterward when he saw pictures of it, or talked to people back home, he became aware of the enormity of what happened." 

The museum foundation has been trying to buy Enola Gay's flight log since last year.  
"We had a contract on Enola Gay's flight log," Reynolds said . "But we are not sure if she still exists or not."  
Reynolds said the drawings and letters were first made public in 1976 by Lewis's son, Robert Lewis Jr., who published them as part of a book about his father. He died last year at age 85.  
"(The drawings) have been floating around for years," Reynolds said . "I don't know how many people had seen them, but clearly it is something that was hidden."  
Reynolds said the foundation will display the letters and drawings in an exhibit next year at its museum in Las Vegas.
