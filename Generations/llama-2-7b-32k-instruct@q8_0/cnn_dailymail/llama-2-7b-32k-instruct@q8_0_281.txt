Title: England captain Cook reaches ton after slow start in first innings against Windies
Asked about a possible extension for Rex Tillerson, US President Donald Trump said Tuesday he is looking at "a lot of names" to replace the outgoing secretary of state. Tillerson has come under pressure following a string of policy reversals and personnel changes by Trump. He told reporters that the process would take time but that his eventual choice would be based on "principle, reason and judgment".
"We're looking at a lot of names," Trump said when asked if he was considering extending Tillerson's mandate as secretary of state beyond the end of this year. But he also praised Tillerson for doing a "great job" and expressed confidence that his successor would do likewise in reorganizing the State Department . Trump has often criticized his department's bureaucracy, complaining it was too slow in carrying out his foreign policy agenda and not tough enough in dealing with US adversaries such as North Korea and Iran.
Tillerson will step down on December 31 after nearly two years at the helm of State, one of the least popular posts among his predecessors. He clashed openly with Trump on a number of issues from climate change to the president's decision to pull out of the nuclear deal between Iran and world powers that he had helped negotiate in 2015 . His departure will give Trump room to bring more hawkish views into his administration, particularly on North Korea.
In recent weeks, Tillerson has sought to ease tensions with Beijing over its trade practices by meeting China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi and calling for greater US investment in the Indo-Pacific region -- a message that did not please Trump, who has frequently railed against Chinese trade practices . Trump also sent Tillerson to visit NATO ally Turkey last weekend, where he was seen as a mediator between Ankara and Washington following a failed military incursion by Turkish forces in northern Syria.
"The secretary of state does an outstanding job," said Trump, who has also named Pompeo as his special representative for North Korea policy. "But we're going to have a separate special representative for North Korea . That would be Mike Pompeo." The president added that Pompeo would lead the charge in the "most likely" scenario of talks with Pyongyang, which has conducted multiple missile tests this year.
Last week Trump ordered Tillerson not to attend a meeting of foreign ministers from North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries in Brussels due to scheduling conflicts -- a move that drew criticism and highlighted the distance between Trump and his secretary of state . Asked about it, Trump said he did not tell Tillerson to skip the gathering because of his differences on Russia.
"We just felt we had other things more important at this time," Trump said of the meeting . He then pivoted to accusing former President Barack Obama's administration for allowing Turkey into NATO in 1952, saying: "They should never have let them in." Asked whether he still considered Turkey a member of NATO, Trump said yes . But the US leader also expressed concern that Ankara had failed to meet its obligations with regard to joining a multinational coalition against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria.
"Turkey is not doing what they should be doing," he said of Turkish troops on the border between Turkey and Syria . He also blasted Ankara for allowing Russian warplanes to use its air bases, saying: "We don't want them to buy anything from Russia, we don't want them to get along with Russia."
Trump also said he was considering whether to reimpose sanctions on Iran and would decide his decision by November 4. The United States has repeatedly violated the terms of a 2015 agreement between six major powers and Tehran, which lifted most international sanction in exchange for guarantees that Iran would not develop nuclear weapons .
"We're going to see what happens," Trump said when asked if he planned to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, saying: "They were terrible deals, the sanctions. They didn't work out too well." The US leader also spoke of a number of other global issues, including China and its trade policies.
"We have some pretty big problems with China," Trump said, adding that he would meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at a G-20 summit in Argentina later this month .
On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the US president stressed his administration's desire to "make peace." He also referred to Israel as "the only democracy" in the Middle East. Trump has frequently called for Palestinians to recognize Israel before moving forward with any negotiations on a peace deal .
Lastly, the US leader touched upon Russia and its alleged role in trying to influence the 2016 presidential election by meddling on social media. He said he had been "very nice" to Russian President Vladimir Putin even though Moscow "may have meddled." Asked if he still believes the Russians interfered, Trump replied: "I don't know."
Trump then slammed his predecessor Obama for not doing anything when he learned that Russia had meddled in the election, saying: "Why didn't President Obama do something about it? He knew about it far longer than the American people knew about it. And he did nothing about it."
Asked whether there was a quid pro quo with regard to his 2016 campaign, Trump replied that he had not discussed Russia or Ukraine with his former personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen . But Trump said: "I do not know" if there would be any form of cooperation between the two countries in return for him lifting sanctions.
Asked about Russia's alleged efforts to influence the election by interfering on social media, Trump said he had been told that Russian authorities were responsible for those actions . "I have no doubt, but it could be other people and/or countries also -- not just Russia," the US president said.
Trump was speaking after meeting with his Cabinet members at a breakfast session at the White House before heading to the United Nations. Earlier Tuesday morning, he spoke briefly with reporters in the Oval Office before departing for the U.N. where he will meet with leaders from several countries including Saudi Arabia and Israel. He was due to deliver remarks at a meeting on peace and security at the United Nations later in the day.
Tuesday's meeting came amid reports that his own department is considering revoking the security clearance of former CIA Director John Brennan, who has been highly critical of Trump since taking office . The Department of Homeland Security said Monday it was "reviewing" whether Brennan's clearance should be taken away.
The move comes after Brennan called Trump an "utterly unfit" and "dangerous" leader in a CNN interview last week, prompting the president to respond on Twitter by saying his accuser had been "totally politicized against me and is a mere pawn for the Democrats as opposed to a serious CIA person who spent 25 years building up our intelligence."
Brennan was appointed CIA director in March 2013 under former President Barack Obama. Trump has also said he would consider revoking the security clearance of former National Intelligence Director James Clapper, whom he said was "the leaker" and a "liar."
Trump had harsh words for his predecessor in office, accusing him of doing nothing to stop Russian meddling while it allegedly occurred. Obama has repeatedly dismissed the notion that he did not know about Russia's actions .
The president also defended his personal lawyer Michael Cohen as a "good person" despite claims by Brennan and others that he acted unethically in arranging hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy playmate Karen McDougal in the final days of the 2016 presidential election campaign, when Trump was the Republican candidate . Cohen's attorney Lanny Davis has said that neither his client nor the president had prior knowledge about the payments, but they did eventually learn about them."
The decision to revoke Brennan's clearance came in the wake of a scathing report from Special Counsel Robert Mueller into Russia's role in interfering with the 2016 presidential election campaign that was released last Friday. The report did not find evidence of collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow, but it said there was no exculpatory evidence to refute obstruction of justice charges against Trump .
Trump has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the Russia probe, which he called a "total witch hunt."
