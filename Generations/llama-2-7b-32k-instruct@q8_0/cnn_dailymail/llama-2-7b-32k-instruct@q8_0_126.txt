th century LGBTQ history: the 1984 Miners’ Strike.

The film tells the story of activist Mark Ashton (Ben Scholfield) and the London LGBT group OutRage!, who travel to mining communities in Wales to set up a support network for striking workers. They become embroiled in local politics and are invited by local councilor Dai Donovan (Paddy Considine) to march at the annual Newport Pride event.

It was originally conceived as a documentary, but Scholfield and co-writer Stephen Beresford turned it into a film after they received access to new footage of Mark Ashton shot by his lover Ian Grant in 1984, which was obtained from the National Trust for Wales.

Ed Miliband has since revealed that he ‘blubbed’ when watching Pride on TV and described it as a ‘great film’. He also admitted that he cried at an earlier screening of Pride during the LGBT History Month in Westminster Hall, where Labour MPs watched the film with activist Mark Ashton’s sister and husband.

But what exactly made this film so special? Why was Ed Miliband moved to tears by it? And how does Pride fit into 20th century LGBTQ history? Here are three reasons why you should check out Pride today:
1) It tells the story of Mark Ashton’s life and death.
Mark Ashton was a founding member of OutRage! who worked with miners in South Wales during the 1984 strike. After returning to London, he became co-chair of Stonewall UK until his sudden death at age 26 from an AIDS related illness in 1987.
Pride tells Ashton’s story and is dedicated to him by his husband Ian Grant (the man who filmed Mark in Wales). The film shows how Ashton’s love for the mining communities and activism inspired many people, including Dai Donovan himself. But it also reminds audiences of a time before LGBTQ people had equal rights to everyone else, when they were criminalized for their sexuality.
2) It brings together local politics and gay rights in one story.
Pride depicts the intertwining of local politics and LGBTQ activism during the 1984 strike in Wales. The miners are fighting to protect their livelihoods, while Ashton is working with them as a fellow working class person who shares their political beliefs. Dai Donovan gets involved with OutRage! when he attends the Newport Pride march and finds out about local activism that’s benefiting miners and other marginalized workers.
3) It shows how LGBTQ people were criminalized for their sexuality in the 20th century.
The film portrays a time before LGBTQ people had equal rights to everyone else. Mark Ashton is arrested by the police when he visits a local gay bar and his partner Ian Grant films the arrest, which takes place outside the miners’ strike. This scene depicts how LGBTQ people were criminalized for their sexuality even though they were fighting together with working class people against the same oppressor: capitalism.
Pride is a heartwarming and inspiring film that tells a story of 20th century LGBTQ history through the eyes of Mark Ashton. It depicts how LGBTQ people were criminalized for their sexuality, but also shows how they fought back against oppression by organizing together with working class people in local communities and at international pride events.

The film tells the story of how Ashton's life and death inspired Dai Donovan to become involved in local politics as a councilor and to join the fight for LGBTQ equality during the 1984 Miners’ Strike."
