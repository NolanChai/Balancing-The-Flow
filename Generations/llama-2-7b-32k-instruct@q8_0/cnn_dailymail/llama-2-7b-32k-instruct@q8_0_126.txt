Miliband says he cried because the film was so moving and he “identified with” it.

The Labour leader told the BBC: ‘I am a very political person and I think that we can be quite cold about things. I think sometimes it’s good to see something like this where you just go, "That's right, I agree".'

He said he ‘blubbed’ but added that his wife told him to “stop being such a wimp”.

Pride is a British film released last year which tells the story of gay and lesbian activists who in 1984 travelled to Minsk, Belarus, in support of workers on strike. It was based on real events. The UK’s Lesbians and Gays Support the Mining Communities campaign ran between June 1984 and March 1985 .

The film follows a group of LGBT activists who travelled to Poland in 1984 to support striking miners . They found common ground with the miners, who were struggling against an oppressive regime. The group later became known as “the Lesbians and Gays Support the Mining Communities campaign” .

The film was directed by Stephen Beresford and stars Bill Nighy, Imelda Staunton, Dominic West, Andrew Scott and Paddy Considine. It was released to mixed reviews from critics but became a box office hit in the UK .

The Labour party leader has previously admitted that he “cried like a baby” when he watched The Great British Bake Off last year. He said the programme reminded him of his late mother’s cooking, who died in 2018 .

He added: ‘My mum was a brilliant baker and I miss her terribly so it brings back really nice memories.’
