unting journey to recovery began in February after an accident on an ice rink left her brain dead for more than four months, a fate doctors warned her family against hoping for. The mother of the pregnant 20-year-old said she didn't listen to them and never stopped praying for Anna Moser to wake up. "We were not going to give up," Moser told NBC News.

The pregnancy was a shock, but doctors say it would have been more of one had they realized Anna was carrying twins when the accident happened in February. Anna and her unborn babies were able to thrive inside her womb because of the "wonderfully miraculous" medicine that kept her alive, Dr. Tamer Malik told NBC News. He led the team of physicians who oversaw Anna's treatment at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center for four months until she finally opened her eyes on July 17. "We had hoped that she would survive," he said. "But we didn't know if the babies would make it."

"They were amazed when they looked in the ultrasound, and Anna was alive at the time of the accident," Moser said. She said her daughter was excited to meet them after she gave birth in September. Her pregnancy went full term and she delivered twin girls named Abigail and Ashley on Oct. 31. The sisters were born prematurely at 29 weeks and spent time in the neonatal intensive care unit before they were released to their home, Moser said.

"We are truly blessed," Moser told NBC News about her family's miracle story. "It's just so wonderful."

Anna Moser is now a full-time mom to two daughters and continues to recover from the accident that left her with paralysis in one arm, speech problems and some short-term memory issues. She said she has no regrets about deciding to have the babies when doctors initially told her it would be too dangerous because of her condition. Moser said she's happy to hear stories from other families who were unable to have children after tragedy, such as a brain injury that happened during childbirth or a stillbirth.

"It makes me feel really good to know they can start over and be blessed like we are," she said. "That's what we try to live by."

Dr. Malik said he doesn't believe there have been cases in which doctors were wrong about the possibility of pregnant women waking up from a coma, but that they haven't seen many cases like Anna's either because it's so rare and she was very sick when her accident happened. She was also born with a heart defect called transposition of great arteries that Dr. Malik said he believes saved her life by slowing the bleeding in her brain.

"She is a little miracle," Dr. Malik said. "I'm happy for all of them."

Anna Moser said she was inspired to read an essay about another young woman who also woke up from a four-month coma after being brain dead and went on to become a successful author and motivational speaker. She hopes to do the same someday, but doesn't know what path her life will take now that she's had twins. "We are just enjoying our new life," Moser said.
