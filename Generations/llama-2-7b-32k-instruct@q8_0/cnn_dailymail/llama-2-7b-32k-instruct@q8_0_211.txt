The agreement was struck in 1993 between the prime minister of Australia at that time, Paul Keating, and the premiers of all six Australian states. The move meant Anzac Day would no longer be a public holiday in all states on a Saturday or Sunday from 2004 onwards. The deal has caused anger among many Australians who believe the day should be a public holiday regardless of which day of the week it falls on . Former prime minister Scott Morrison admitted last year that he regrets not cancelling the deal, saying it was "a mistake" and "should have been torn up".

This has sparked outrage amongst many who believe those states should have scrapped the deal in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and rising case numbers."
