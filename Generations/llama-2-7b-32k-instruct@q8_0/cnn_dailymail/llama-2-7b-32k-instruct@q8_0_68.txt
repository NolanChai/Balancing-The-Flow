zone.

Crystal Palace have now moved within seven points of safety while Bournemouth are just four points shy. Burnley are still at risk but would need some help, while Hull and Swansea may need to be considered as relegated already. West Ham United look the most likely to make a late surge for survival - they have 26 points and can probably scrape into safety if they keep winning their last four games.

Sunderland (15th, 30 pts) v Bournemouth (11th, 37 pts)

Palace have the best form in the league with five wins out of six since Alan Pardew took over as manager and he will be determined to keep that going. The pressure will be on Sunderland boss David Moyes at this point but the Scot has already guided the Black Cats to seven points in his past four games against Bournemouth, including a 2-1 win earlier this season.

Prediction: Draw

Burnley (13th, 26 pts) v West Ham United (9th, 34 pts)

This game could have an impact on the title race but Burnley will be more concerned about securing their safety first and foremost. The Clarets are four points adrift of Bournemouth in 16th place while West Ham are six points ahead in eighth - both teams would like to close the gap a bit more this weekend.

Prediction: Burnley 0-2 West Ham

Brighton and Hove Albion (9th, 34 pts) v Crystal Palace (10th, 36 pts)

This game has been dubbed the battle of the Seagulls with two teams that like to fly high. Brighton have lost their last three games but it's hard to argue they haven't had a good season given they've made their Premier League debut and have just missed out on European football by one point. Palace meanwhile are in decent form, having taken 14 points from the past 10 games.

Prediction: Brighton 1-3 Palace

Swansea City (18th, 24 pts) v West Bromwich Albion (9th, 35 pts)

The Swans are in a state of crisis after three consecutive losses and have been linked with sacking manager Carlos Carvalhal. Meanwhile, West Brom need to keep picking up points if they're going to stay above the relegation zone and this is a game they must win - they cannot afford a fourth straight loss here.

Prediction: Swansea 1-2 West Brom

Hull City (17th, 24 pts) v Leicester City (8th, 36 pts)

This is another relegation six pointer where Hull have to win at the KCOM Stadium. The Tigers are in terrible form and it seems like they've lost their way over recent months. However, if anyone can help them out of this mess, it could be Leicester who will also be eager to take three points here as they try to secure a top six finish for next season's Europa League competition.

Prediction: Hull 0-1 Leicester

Watford (8th, 36 pts) v Southampton (25th, 22 pts)

The Saints are on the brink of relegation after a run of six losses in eight games but their last win was against Watford in November. The Hornets meanwhile have been inconsistent all season and must find form if they're to avoid finishing outside the top 10, which is likely to lead to Javi Gracia being sacked.

Prediction: Watford 2-1 Southampton

Manchester City (4th, 53 pts) v Liverpool (6th, 51 pts)

Jurgen Klopp's side have been excellent since the turn of the year and this is their last chance to finish above Man City for third spot. The Reds have won six out of eight games but they were unlucky not to draw against United on Monday and will be hoping Raheem Sterling can shake off a back injury in time for Sunday's match at the Etihad Stadium.

Prediction: City 2-0 Liverpool

Manchester United (1st, 67 pts) v Tottenham Hotspur (2nd, 59 pts)

United will be looking to maintain their unbeaten home record against Spurs this season and that means a victory for Jose Mourinho's men is the most likely outcome. Tottenham have a lot of confidence after winning at Bournemouth but they know United have been hard to beat since the turn of the year, with just three losses in 15 games.

Prediction: Man United 2-0 Tottenham Hotspur

Chelsea (5th, 53 pts) v Newcastle United (16th, 28 pts)

Alvaro Morata is finally hitting form after a slow start to his career in England and will be determined to take advantage of the Magpies' defensive woes. Rafael Benitez's side have let in 43 goals this season - second only to West Brom - and it won't be pretty if they are on the end of a hammering here.

Prediction: Chelsea 2-0 Newcastle

Arsenal (6th, 51 pts) v Everton (7th, 52 pts)

The Toffees have had an impressive season but they have slipped up in recent weeks and could be without Oumar Niasse against the Gunners. They're unlikely to make much of a difference at the Emirates Stadium though and Arsenal should win this match comfortably, ending with their sixth straight victory.

Prediction: Arsenal 2-0 Everton

Stoke City (14th, 36 pts) v Huddersfield Town (15th, 30 pts)

Both teams are struggling to avoid relegation and this one is crucial for both sides. Stoke have had a terrible season and their only win in the past four months was against West Brom in mid-February. Huddersfield too have been poor but they've picked up more points than their opponents here, so could be on course to secure safety if they take three points this weekend.

Prediction: Stoke 1-0 Huddersfield

Southampton (25th, 22 pts) v Bournemouth (11th, 37 pts)

The Saints have been a different team since the arrival of Mark Hughes and they'll be hoping that continues here against a Bournemouth side who have lost three in their past four. It should be an easy game for Southampton on paper but both teams have had poor defensive records this season, so it could easily end up as a draw or even a close defeat for the Saints.

Prediction: Bournemouth 1-0 Southampton

West Ham United (9th, 34 pts) v Burnley (13th, 26 pts)

The Clarets have struggled to find the back of the net over their last three games and that could be a big problem against West Ham who have netted seven goals in the past five Premier League matches. The Hammers have also been good at home this season with eight wins from 12, so will fancy their chances here.

Prediction: West Ham 3-0 Burnley

Swansea City (18th, 24 pts) v West Bromwich Albion (9th, 35 pts)

The Swans have been poor of late but this is the perfect time for them to get back on track. They've beaten West Brom twice this season already and will be hoping Gylfi Sigurdsson can continue his good form after an injury layoff in mid-February. The Baggies meanwhile need to keep their safety hopes alive with another win here.

Prediction: Swansea 2-0 West Brom

Watford (8th, 36 pts) v Newcastle United (16th, 28 pts)

This is a huge game for both sides and the Hornets will be hoping Troy Deeney can return to the team after an injury. They are four points off the drop zone while Newcastle have been on the brink of relegation and need to start picking up points if they're going to stay in the Premier League.

Prediction: Watford 2-0 Newcastle United

West Ham United (9th, 34 pts) v Burnley (13th, 26 pts)

The Clarets have struggled to find the back of the net over their last three games and that could be a big problem against West Ham who have netted seven
