The title race appears to be over, but what about the fight to stay in the Premier League? No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone . The Black Cats' last-gasp win at Stamford Bridge was the latest example of the unpredictability that makes this season so compelling . Jermain Defoe gave them hope with his winner, but there is still plenty of drama to come. With 15 games left and seven points separating third bottom Sunderland from safety, there are likely to be some twists and turns along the way.

Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal admitted on Wednesday that this season has been "a disaster" after a run of five losses in six league matches, which includes a 3-0 defeat at Chelsea . Van Gaal had made five changes from the side that started the 4-1 defeat to Newcastle and the Dutchman was still searching for his first win since taking charge at Old Trafford.

Chelsea meanwhile go into the winter break top of the table, four points clear of nearest rivals Liverpool who were beaten 0-2 by Southampton on Wednesday . The Reds have only picked up a point from their last three matches and Jurgen Klopp is under increasing pressure.

Manchester City are five points behind Liverpool in fourth place after the champions lost ground with a 3-1 defeat at Newcastle on Monday night, while West Ham sit in sixth with eight points separating them from the relegation zone .

Tottenham Hotspur, who were beaten by Stoke City on Saturday, are another team looking to make up ground before the winter break. The Londoners trail fifth-placed Liverpool by 12 points but have two games in hand and Mauricio Pochettino's side remain in a strong position .

Swansea City and Hull City also have points to prove having suffered defeats at Aston Villa and West Ham respectively. Paul Clement's Swans are still looking for their first win since November but they sit five points clear of the drop zone, while Steve Bruce has seen his Tigers plummet from 10th place last season to 15th .

Elsewhere, Bournemouth beat West Bromwich Albion 2-0 at the Vitality Stadium on Monday night as they look to build on a superb run of form, while Burnley drew 0-0 with Crystal Palace and Southampton edged past Liverpool.
