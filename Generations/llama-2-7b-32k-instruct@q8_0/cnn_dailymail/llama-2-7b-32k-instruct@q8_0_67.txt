The 13-year-old boy allegedly stole a $25,000 stack of cash from his grandfather and handed it out as tips to friends at school. The unnamed child from Medina, Ohio, gave out $100 notes in the classroom on Monday. He then tried to return home with the loot but was denied entry by his father.

The boy's grandfather told police he left his house keys and money in a shoebox while performing repairs at the home on Sunday night, only to return that evening and discover the money gone. The teenager said he took $25,000 in cash from the box before going to school Monday morning.

The boy told police he gave away between five and 10 $100 bills during school hours, including at least one to a teacher. He admitted the money came from his grandfather's shoebox but said he didn't know where his grandfather kept it beforehand, according to WJW-TV.

Police also discovered the teenager had tried to return home with the loot after school ended and was denied entry by his father. He told police officers that he planned on keeping $10,000 of the money for himself but didn't say what else he did with it, according to a copy of the police report obtained by WJW-TV.

The boy has been charged with felony counts of grand theft and forgery. He was released into his father's custody after a court appearance on Monday. The judge told him that if he breaks any laws in the future, the judge would send him to juvenile jail. His next court date is scheduled for July 24.

The grandfather told police that the boy had recently been grounded and had received several warnings about his conduct. He also said the child often took money without permission. The grandfather was not named in the report because he is a co-victim.

The grandfather, however, said he never expected his grandson to steal from him. "I didn't think that would happen," he told WJW-TV. "Never, ever."
