"It'll end up in the bin. I'm going to strangle him with his own tie," Clarkson said on the BBC show Top Gear of the producer who had intervened to prevent a stunt involving a Toyota Hilux 4x4 truck and a cow.

Clarkson has been suspended from presenting duties at the BBC until an internal investigation into the incident is carried out, although he will still receive his full pay packet.

A corporate media relations source told The Telegraph that "the BBC management do not think it was funny."

The episode of W1A, a satirical comedy set in the fictional BBC centre known as 'Whistlewood One', has been written by Chris Moyles and is due to be broadcast on Friday at 10pm.

A source close to the programme told The Telegraph: "It's an episode all about Jeremy Clarkson, his suspension and the incident with the cow in Spain - it couldn't have come at a better time."

The source added that while the programme would be "a bit cheeky", he doubted whether it would lead to any reprisals from Clarkson or his fans.

Moyles, the former breakfast DJ who is also known as "the voice of W1A" in the programme's title sequence, told The Telegraph that although he was aware of the controversy surrounding Clarkson, he had not written about it directly.

"There are so many things that have gone wrong with Jeremy and his team on Top Gear but there isn't a Jeremy Clarkson episode," Moyles said. "The thing is that in a way there's been a bit of an outcry against the BBC for trying to control what we can and cannot say on W1A, so we thought - why not?
"We're just going to go through some things that have happened recently and make a little joke."

Asked whether Clarkson himself could be involved in the episode, Moyles said: "No he won't. He wouldn't be caught dead here. But we'll use Jeremy as an example of how not to do PR."

The corporate media relations source told The Telegraph that the BBC had made light of Clarkson's attack on its own staff by using a fictional character in the show, rather than allowing it to be made about "a real person who has been suspended from his job".

"Jeremy Clarkson is now part of corporate PR. You can't make up a story or write a scene based on him because you might upset him," he said.

Moyles said that he and the W1A scriptwriting team were "not trying to pick a fight with Jeremy".

"We weren't even going to use his name until we realised he was suspended and we thought - if only he knew."

He added: "The BBC don't really have a sense of humour. They can't take jokes about themselves."

W1A is made by the BBC's In House Comedy Team, which has previously produced shows such as Outnumbered and The Sarah Millican Television Programme for the corporation. It is due to be broadcast on BBC Two in August.

Broadcasting House (the corporate media relations source) said that W1A was not "a lighthearted comedy" but rather a "serious corporate drama".

Although he will still receive his full pay packet, the former presenter of Top Gear was suspended from the show as part of an internal investigation into Clarkson's comments about a BBC producer who intervened in a stunt involving a Toyota Hilux and a cow.
