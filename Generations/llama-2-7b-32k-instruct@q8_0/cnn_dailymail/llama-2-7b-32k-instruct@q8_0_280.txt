ian-themed luxury home, called Mansion of Dreams, is owned by former professional wrestler Scott Hall and his wife, Donna, but also acts as a training school for strippers looking to expand their income to include lap dances. Now, the school will be forced to close its doors.

"I am not a fan of what they were doing in there," resident Mark Levin told WPTV after finding out about the training classes. "They were very loud and it would go on all night."

Levin added that he called local authorities, who showed up at the mansion to check it out. He also filed a complaint against the property owner with the city of Port St. Lucie.

According to City Commissioner Christine Banks, the city is now taking legal action against Hall for holding such business classes in his home. The commissioner claims that there are "certain requirements" that need to be met when it comes to running a strip club or training school like this.

Hall was not around to answer questions on Wednesday afternoon; however, he told WPTV earlier that the mansion is located in a residential neighborhood and that he is simply using the home as a way of getting away from his wrestling businesses. The former wrestler said it's legal for him to run whatever classes he wants.

Hall also pointed out that there are other homes in the area where people host businesses, including churches and schools.

But Banks responded by saying that these types of businesses don't usually last long in a neighborhood. She added that they "certainly" don't belong on residential streets.

Levin says he is not trying to stop the business from operating; however, he wants to make sure that everything is above board with city codes and regulations.

Hall said his home was not meant for commercial use, but rather as a place where Hall could live while also working on the wrestling businesses he owns.

City commissioners will meet Monday night to discuss what action they should take against Hall's strip club training school.

Banks said she would prefer that Hall find another way of doing business in Port St. Lucie, because "those type of activities aren't consistent with the city's code."
