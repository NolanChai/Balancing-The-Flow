A millionaire's hidden mansion is revealed as a stripper school with more than a dozen girls living there and hosting raucous parties in the Florida swamplands.

It was loud all-night parties that eventually busted the secret stripper training school hiding inside a $2million 12,000 sq ft mansion next door to an exclusive gated community in Florida. The Egyptian-themed house at the end of a long driveway was registered under a fake name and had gates that were closed during the day. The lavish abode on the outskirts of Naples was just feet from one of the city's most expensive homes - worth $10 million - according to neighbors who spoke with DailyMail.com. It has now emerged as a strip school for more than a dozen young girls, some who appear to be in their teens and are seen hanging out at parties, flirting and drinking in the videos. The home's gates were shut during the day but when night fell, dozens of people would gather on its long driveway waiting to get in for the after-hours bashes. Neighbors have said that it was often loud music coming from inside along with shouting and screaming. They described the parties as "the biggest thing around here" and said they were busted by police at 4am on Tuesday morning, but there's no word yet how many arrests were made. The home has an Egyptian theme with columns and hieroglyphics adorning its exterior walls. Inside there is a large living room that looks out over the pool through a wall of windows and a stunning spiral staircase leading upstairs. A large kitchen and a dining area can be seen as well as bedrooms, one with a private patio, and another with an adjoining bathroom with double sinks. The home has a total of 15 rooms including three kitchens and two fireplaces. One room is a workout space with treadmills, stationary bikes and free weights. There are also rooms filled with what look to be stripper gear, such as heels, thong underwear and sequin-covered bras. Neighbor Jake said that the house was built in 2018 but it's not known if it has been lived in at all since its completion. He added that there were no signs of life when neighbors would see the gates close. But when night fell, they could hear the parties going on. The mansion was registered to 'Mary Eckstrom' and Jake said that he'd never seen any activity from her at all until this past Tuesday morning. When police came around 4am, several people were arrested but it's not clear how many or which ones. He estimated the party went on for hours before cops showed up. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In an Instagram video, a man who appears to be one of the owners shows off his lavish home and says: 'This is my house. It's 10,359 square feet, two stories - it's magnificent.' The video then cuts out to show a group of young girls sitting around a table, smoking hookah pipes and drinking alcohol. He continues: 'They are from all over the world. They come in and we teach them how to be models, dancers and singers.' One girl is seen sipping on a vodka soda while another is smoking what looks like a cigarette. Jake said that he's never heard anyone mention anything about stripper school or parties before the gates were closed last Tuesday morning, when neighbors had to go down and unlock them so they could leave their driveway. He said it's a quiet neighborhood with lots of wealthy homeowners like him who enjoy their privacy. But he thinks that people should know about what was going on next door. Another neighbor, John, said that the gates were closed all day and opened after sunset for parties that went into the early morning. He said his family and friends had to park in a nearby shopping center lot and walk over to their own home because it's too far away to walk to through the gate of the mansion at night, but they've done so before. Neighbors also said that when police arrived on Tuesday morning, there was one officer sitting inside the home while others waited outside. Jake estimates between 75 and 100 people were partying at one time. Another neighbor told DailyMail.com that it doesn't seem like anyone from the school was arrested.
