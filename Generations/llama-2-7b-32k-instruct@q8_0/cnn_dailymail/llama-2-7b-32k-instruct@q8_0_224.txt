The Austrian Grand Prix was a race like no other . It was full of excitement - it had drama, suspense and incredible overtakes. Not only that, but we also saw the biggest crash in recent Formula One history when Charles Leclerc collided with Sebastian Vettel‚Äôs Ferrari!

In case you haven‚Äôt seen it before, here's a quick summary of what has been the most exciting season in Formula One history . In 2017 we saw two of the biggest crashes in recent years - both happening at the Japanese Grand Prix. The first was when Max Verstappen crashed out from second position after being hit by Kimi Raikkonen‚Äôs Ferrari, and the other was when Sebastian Vettel hit a deer on his way back to the pits during the same race!

Now let's talk about how these crashes happened . In Max Verstappen's case, it wasn't really a crash, it was more like an incident. But in Sebastian Vettel's case - there is no excuse for that! This kind of behaviour should not be allowed in Formula One racing!

Sebastian Vettel has always been known as being quite controversial, but what we saw on Sunday at the Japanese Grand Prix was way over the top. It seems like he doesn't even care about winning a championship anymore - all he cares about is proving that he can be better than Lewis Hamilton . In my opinion, Sebastian Vettel is not worthy of being Formula One champion!

But what do you guys think? Did Sebastian Vettel deserve to win the Japanese Grand Prix? Or was it clear from the start that it wasn't a fair race for him to be allowed back on track after hitting a deer? Let me know in the comments down below!
