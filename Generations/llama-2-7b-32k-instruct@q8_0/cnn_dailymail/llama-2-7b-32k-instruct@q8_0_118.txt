Review title: WONDERFUL!
Product review: I found "The Little White Horse" while searching for something else on Amazon and, after reading it's description and reviews, decided to order it immediately. What a wonderful book. The story is well written and told in a way that will have the reader cheering for the protagonist, Maria Merryweather as she tries to discover her fate . The descriptions are vivid and I enjoyed the characters of Pax and Fidget very much. Even though this was written long ago it still feels very contemporary because the values of honesty, kindness, and adventure that are exhibited in the book are sorely lacking today and seem to be forgotten as the world moves faster than ever before. I would recommend this book highly to anyone who loves fantasy and has a love for the natural world .
