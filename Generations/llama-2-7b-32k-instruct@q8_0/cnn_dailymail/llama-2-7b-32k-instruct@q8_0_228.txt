Zaman, 29, and their four kids aged between three months and eight years were detained after arriving at the Istanbul airport on Monday afternoon, according to a report by the Daily Telegraph newspaper. The arrest came shortly before a flight bound for Islamist-controlled Syria was scheduled to depart from there. Turkish police reportedly confiscated the family's passports and are trying to determine whether they were planning to join Isil fighters in the conflict. It is claimed that the couple have been on police bail since December after their arrest for allegedly planning an illegal trip to Syria with the children, but were ordered not to leave the country, according to a source. The family's disappearance was reported by British newspaper The Mirror last Wednesday (May 25).

An online profile published on a matchmaking website for Muslims states that Asif and Sara met through the website in March 2011, when he was living in Sheffield and she was studying at the London School of Economics. They got married in May 2014, according to the site.

The family's disappearance comes as a new government report revealed that around 90 young people from Britain have left the UK for Iraq and Syria to join Isil.

Asif and Sara could not be reached for comment on Tuesday night. A Foreign Office spokesman said: "We are aware of these reports."
