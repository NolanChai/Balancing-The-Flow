Netflix has emerged as one of the most popular streaming services, with nearly 65 million subscribers around the world . But while Netflix may be well-known for its original movies and TV shows, it also pays some of the highest salaries in the business. According to Glassdoor, a job search website, the median base pay at the company is $180,000 a year, putting it among the top five companies that offer the highest salaries for employees.

Netflix has been known for its original content, such as "House of Cards" and "Orange Is the New Black." It also has been expanding into other areas, such as film production, which may be why it was able to offer high salaries to employees, Glassdoor said.

Another company that offers a median base pay of $180,000 is Google . Other companies on the list include Facebook and Amazon.

Netflix has been growing rapidly over the past few years, which may explain why it was able to offer such high salaries. It also has been expanding into new markets, such as Asia, which could help it further grow its business.

Overall, Netflix's high salaries are a reflection of the company's success and popularity. It shows that the streaming service is willing to invest in its employees and offer them competitive pay.
