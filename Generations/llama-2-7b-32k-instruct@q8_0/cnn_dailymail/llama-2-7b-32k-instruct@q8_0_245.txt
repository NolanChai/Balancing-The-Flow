Police in North Carolina say a married couple is dead after an Amtrak train hit them on Easter morning as they lingered on the tracks. Derek Lowe, 38, and Tina Lowe, 33, were hit shortly before 10am on a railroad crossing in rural Moore County. Police said both had been drinking. Neither wore any kind of reflective gear that would alert motorists to their presence, the police department said.
