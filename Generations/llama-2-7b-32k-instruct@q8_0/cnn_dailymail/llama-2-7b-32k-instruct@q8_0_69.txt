In an interview with L’Equipe, Geronimi said: "Thiriez should leave his position at once. It is disrespectful to the president of a club and to French football as a whole."

On Saturday, Lyon won the 2018-19 Coupe de France final in front of their home crowd against Paris Saint Germain (PSG) despite being down two goals to nil at half time. PSG fought back but failed to overturn the deficit and were held to a 6-5 shootout loss after extra time.

The match was played on Saturday evening at Lyon's Stade des Lumieres, which had a crowd of approximately 49,000 fans in attendance, according to the French football federation.

Geronimi said that he has sent Thiriez an email asking him to come down to the pitch to shake the players' hands after the final, but his request was ignored by the LFP president who instead chose to watch the match from a VIP box on the upper deck of Stade des Lumieres.

Geronimi said that it is "unthinkable" for Thiriez to behave in such a way when the players and the fans have been waiting for him. He added that he was disappointed by Thiriez's lack of respect towards the French league, its clubs and their supporters.

Geronimi also mentioned that Thiriez had previously sent an email to Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas asking him to come down and shake hands with PSG players at the start of extra time after a similar incident happened at the 2019 Coupe de France final between PSG and Rennes.

Lyon's coach Bruno Génésio said that he was also disappointed by Thiriez's absence, but he did not want to talk about it because it is "not relevant".

Thiriez has yet to comment on the matter.

The incident has sparked a debate among football fans and professionals about the importance of respect towards players and clubs at all levels of the game. Many have criticised Thiriez for his lack of respect towards Lyon, PSG and French football in general.

In a statement released after the final, Lyon's communications director Frédéric Dupraz said: "We are disappointed by the attitude of Frederic Thiriez during the final. We expected him to show more respect towards our club and its players. It is not acceptable for a president who represents French football to behave in such a way."

The LFP has also been criticised for its lack of transparency and communication with clubs regarding the protocols for Cup finals, as well as for the absence of Thiriez at the Stade des Lumieres.

The LFP's disciplinary committee is expected to meet soon to discuss the matter and decide on any possible sanctions against Thiriez. (ANI)
