A police spokeswoman said: "The suspect entered the victim's driveway and stole two Pekingese dogs from the front yard."

She later received a phone call from a woman who claimed she had bought the animals for $100 (PS62) and then handed them over to another man who offered her cash money. Police spokeswoman Sgt. Michael Alvarez said: "The victim was told that the suspect sold the dogs back to a different person, and he paid an additional $35 more for the Pekingese ." The owner has now been reunited with Marley and Mitzy after their return but it is not known if they had any physical injuries.
