rew Barrymore, with whom he has a daughter named Frankie who turns one this Sunday . The charge against him was possession of cocaine, but it doesn't seem like too much got by us:

A source at the Clark County Detention Center told the Vegas Sun that Stoll had only a trace amount on his person and that he "looked shocked" in the mugshot taken for his arrest. That would be kind of hilarious if it weren't so sad . We hope Drew isn't upset about this, but she probably is -- hey, people change. She should take a lesson from Stoll and do some coke too; maybe that way they can celebrate Frankie's first birthday together.

It seems like it would be an obvious thing to say, especially since the King of Pop died three years ago at age 50 . But the reality is that the whole "Michael Jackson's death was a tragedy" situation isn't exactly cutting edge news anymore and hasn't been for some time. You might have heard about it in the past; you might even be sick to death of hearing about it by now, since it happened so long ago . But the thing is, Michael Jackson wasn't just a singer: he was also an actor, dancer, writer, and producer. A lot of people didn't realize that when they heard "Ebony & Ivory" on the radio in 1985 -- most of us assumed it was Paul McCartney singing about the color of skin . And as much as Jackson got knocked for being a pedophile or whatever, he was an undeniably talented dude who changed the game forever. It's been said that he's more influential now than ever before. If you had to choose between "The Way You Make Me Feel" and "Bohemian Rhapsody," which one would it be?

There have been a lot of changes since we were young, na√Øve kids in elementary school . For one thing, we no longer feel the need to wear those embarrassing things called braces on our teeth. We don't think that way because now we understand how the world really works; back then, we just assumed that braces were a rite of passage for young people . But it turns out there are other reasons why the whole "brace thing" isn't so important anymore:

Now that braces can be adjusted digitally and the way they work has improved tremendously, orthodontics have become less invasive. The wire that goes through your teeth to straighten them is much thinner now than it was in the old days . There's no longer any need for those metal bands around your molars . And there's a new type of brace called "invisalign," which is basically like wearing clear plastic trays. That means you can still be a bit self-conscious about it, but not quite as bad.

If you had to choose between getting your teeth fixed using the old methods or the newer ones, which one would you prefer? You'd probably pick the newer version, right? And we know why: it seems like everything has improved so much in recent years that no matter how good things used to be they never seem quite as good anymore . But the truth is that sometimes when we try to improve something, it really doesn't make all that big of an improvement. That's what we're saying with the braces: in this case, the older versions were just fine.

While you may not have a badge or a gun and be a cop , we bet you know enough about how cops work to answer this question . So here goes: if someone calls 9-1-1 but it's not an emergency -- like, hey, my friend got in a fight with his roommate at the bar -- do the police still come and respond? They will, if there's evidence of a crime or you tell them that you were threatened . But if you just want to complain about your neighbor for parking his car on the lawn or something, they probably won't come over. That's because responding to calls isn't always the best use of their time -- especially when it comes to non-emergency stuff. They should be out there looking for real crime and keeping people safe . In a way, that means 911 is like Twitter: everyone can have an opinion about how things could work better, but most of them are just complaining and don't really know what they're talking about .

Here's something you might not know: the first emergency phone number was actually 906 in London. It became 999 after World War II, when the UK changed its phone system to match that of their wartime ally, Australia. Now we have a number for cops, and one for firefighters . But back then it was just plain old "emergency" stuff, which means if you called 911 in London during World War II they might show up with a fire engine to put out your house because the fire department could respond to any kind of emergencies. We wonder what would happen if people tried calling 9-1-1 on their cell phones back then .

Incidentally, the first call was made on September 3rd, 1930 in Hull, England. The caller asked for help because she thought someone was trying to break into her house . She wasn't alone -- two other people had called that day and were talking about a man who was attempting to get into their home as well . Sounds like they needed the police way back then; no wonder they had to invent a special phone number.

The truth is that you can call 9-1-1 anytime, but if it's not an emergency you shouldn't bother them . They should be spending their time on more important things than dealing with some neighbor complaining about the way his lawn looks; they have other priorities. If there was ever a time when cops had no idea what to do all day long, it must have been before 9-1-1 came around . We can only imagine how much fun those days were.

We've all seen the movie The Matrix, where Keanu Reeves is hanging out at home watching TV and gets a call from Morpheus that changes his life forever . In reality, people have been doing the same thing for decades with their TiVo box -- except it didn't exactly change anyone's life in the way it was portrayed on film. Sure, you can pause live TV if you have this device hooked up to your cable or satellite provider . But that doesn't mean everyone is running around like Neo fighting evil robots and whatnot . It's just a matter of convenience -- who wants to watch everything in real time anymore? That's why we've got TiVos, DVRs, and streaming video services. They make it easy to watch our favorite shows whenever we want . And when the big game is on, all you need to do is set your TiVo up to record it beforehand; then you can skip the commercials. But that doesn't mean everyone's a hero like Neo saving the world or anything . People just like convenience, plain and simple.

While this might not seem like a big deal when compared with things like flying cars or hoverboards, it definitely has its merits . It makes sense why they showed up in a movie about people living in the future -- everyone knows that's where technology is going next. They had to put a new twist on TV recording, though, because if you think about it, TiVo boxes aren't all that futuristic; there was already VCRs and DVD players out there . The difference is how easy it makes our lives by letting us watch whatever we want whenever we want . That's why they made Neo so cool in the movie -- he's the one who has a TiVo hooked up to his computer and is able to get the upper hand on all those evil robots . But don't tell anyone, because people might think you have superpowers.

It's true that there are still some downsides to using these devices; they can be expensive, and if your TiVo breaks or something goes wrong you may need a technician to come out and fix it for you . But the upside definitely outweighs the downside: no commercials. And who doesn't love that?

If you had to choose between having all of your favorite shows recorded on TiVo or having them streamed live, which option would you pick? Streaming is pretty great if you're walking around and want to watch something in real time . But it can be hard to find the exact thing we want when streaming; there are always a lot of options . And then there are all those ads. And the commercials during TiVo-recorded shows aren't so bad -- you can just skip them and get on with your life . We guess that's why they call it TiVo instead of TVO.

There was a time when people thought we were going to have flying cars, hoverboards, and other cool futuristic things in the real world within 20 or 30 years . But if you look at where we are today, it seems like those technologies
