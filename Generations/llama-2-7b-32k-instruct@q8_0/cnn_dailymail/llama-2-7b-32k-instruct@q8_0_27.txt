A Wisconsin church's four-decade tradition of people mud-wrestling pigs at a summer fundraiser has been cancelled after complaints the animals were 'punched in the face, body slammed and jumped on'. Salem United Methodist Church in Waukesha had been hosting its annual event for 40 years and it involves volunteers dressing up as Roman gladiators, wrestling pigs to win prizes and eating the bacon afterwards. The fundraiser was to be held in August but was cancelled last week by church officials after a Facebook video showing one of the animals getting punched went viral. It also prompted an animal rights group to call for protests outside the church this Sunday, but that's been called off too, according to NBC News.

According to its website, Salem United Methodist Church in Waukesha has a summer fundraiser every year with activities like 'pig wrestling', mud volleyball and hayrides. A Facebook video of the event from last year shows people dressed up as gladiators throwing pigs around an arena while others try to catch them and eat their bacon afterwards. The video was posted by a Facebook user on 2016, but it's only gone viral recently, which prompted an animal rights group called the Animal Recovery Mission (ARM) to protest outside the church last weekend.

The animal rights group says that they spoke to several witnesses who claimed the pigs were mistreated at this year's fundraiser and demanded for it to be shut down. The event was cancelled after officials heard of their complaints. ARM had also planned a protest on Sunday but have now called off the demonstration too following discussions with the church.

The pastor at Salem United Methodist Church, the Rev. Steve Schields said in a statement to NBC News that they take animal welfare very seriously and would never condone any mistreatment of their animals. He added that they have been working with the Wisconsin Humane Society to improve their pig wrestling procedures following complaints from ARM.

'We are committed to ensuring that we provide a fun, safe environment for people, regardless of how our fundraiser is structured,' Schields said in his statement. The church had previously invited animal rights activists to the fundraiser to talk about their concerns and work with them on improving the procedures.

Pigs are considered livestock animals under Wisconsin state law, meaning it's legal for farmers to treat them however they please and even use them as a form of entertainment, but that doesn't stop animal activists from protesting against mistreatment of pigs or other animals. Last year, the Animal Recovery Mission also protested outside a Wisconsin dairy farm following claims by whistleblowers that cows there were being abused and had broken bones.

Schields told NBC News that they have been working with ARM to improve their procedures ahead of this Sunday's fundraiser, which is not expected to go on as planned after all. The church will instead hold a barbecue in the parking lot where people can eat bacon sandwiches and watch movies about farm animals instead of wrestling pigs
