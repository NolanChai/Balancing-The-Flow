45 years ago, a small church in Wisconsin was struggling to raise funds for its community. So it decided to host a unique fundraising event: people would wrestle pigs at their annual barbecue festival.  
The church called the event "Pig Wrestling" and invited local residents to participate. The rules were simple: participants had to use only their arms to pin down or hold onto the pigs, who were let out of their pens during the festivities.  
Over time, Pig Wrestling became a beloved tradition in the community. People would gather together to watch as contestants took on the challenge and try their hand at wrestling the pigs. The event was so popular that it drew in participants from all over the country - including celebrities like comedian John Pinette and actor Jeffrey Jones, who both tried their luck at Pig Wrestling.  
However, recently some animal rights activists have spoken out against the event, claiming that it is cruel to the pigs. They argue that the animals are subjected to physical harm during the wrestling match and that it is inhumane to treat them as mere props for entertainment purposes.  
In response to these concerns, the church has announced that this year's Pig Wrestling event will be cancelled. The church's pastor, Reverend Tim Hetzner, issued a statement saying "We take the ethical treatment of animals very seriously and have decided to discontinue this tradition as we strive to ensure that all who participate in our events are treated with respect and dignity".  
While some people have expressed disappointment at the cancellation of Pig Wrestling, others have praised the church for its decision. They argue that it is important to prioritize animal welfare and avoid activities that may cause harm to animals.  
As the world becomes more aware of animal rights, traditional events like Pig Wrestling are being questioned and reformed. It remains to be seen whether this event will make a comeback in the future - but for now, it appears that Wisconsin's beloved Pig Wrestling tradition has come to an end.
