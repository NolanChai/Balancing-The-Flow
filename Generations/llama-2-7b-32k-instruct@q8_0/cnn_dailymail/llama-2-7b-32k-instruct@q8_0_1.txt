Title: Baby-Faced Gangsta Gets 10 Years in Prison for Tweetup at School

Sixteen year old Jeremy Johnson of Memphis Tennessee has been sentenced to ten years in prison for a tweetup at his school last year.   The young boy, who had thousands of twitter followers and was known as "Young Gangsta" used the social media site to organize the party which took place on October 4th at Hamilton High School.   Police say he invited dozens of friends in a series of tweets that included information about where to meet, what to wear and who to bring . The gathering was raided by police officers who were alerted after a tip was received through Twitter, said police spokeswoman Karen Rudolph .   Johnson pleaded no contest on Wednesday to aggravated assault charges in a separate case for an incident that happened the same day as his tweetup . Police say he threw a shoe at an officer and then punched him. In addition, Johnson was sentenced to five years of probation with a condition that he stay out of trouble and not use social media sites or electronic devices.   "He will be removed from society for quite some time," Rudolph said . "Hopefully it will serve as an example to others."

According to police, Johnson was in a vehicle when the officer tried to stop him for speeding and running a red light. When officers approached the car he threw a shoe at them and then punched one of the officers before driving off in a friend's car .   Rudolph said that it appeared Johnson wanted to show up his friends after he was thrown out of a party earlier in the night because he had not been allowed inside.   "He has not learned his lesson," Rudolph said.    The sentence imposed on Johnson is consistent with Tennessee juvenile law, according to the Associated Press .   It is unclear how many other students were at the tweetup and whether they will face any charges or if there are others involved in the assault on the officer that was not part of the planned event.

The 16 year-old boy had faced aggravated assault and criminal conspiracy to commit aggravated robbery, but those charges were dropped by prosecutors before sentencing .   Johnson's attorney, Chet Pleger said that he was surprised at the sentence imposed.   "I think it is too much punishment for a kid," Pleger told local newspaper The Commercial Appeal." He feels like we've gone back in time to the old days of the 19th Century and put this young man away for life, for a momentary lapse of judgment ."    Pleger said that his client would probably have been given less punishment had he not been known as "Young Gangsta."   He said it was Johnson's decision to use Twitter to promote the event and bring attention to himself, but it was unfair that the maximum penalty for him was the same as an adult facing similar charges.    "There is a disproportionate sentence here," Pleger told The Commercial Appeal . "They are treating this young man like he's 23 years old and not a 16 year-old juvenile."

On his Twitter profile, Johnson identified himself as an African American.   A Twitter search of the user name @Jeremy_Johnson shows that the boy had tweeted about guns, drugs, money and gang violence in the weeks before he was arrested .    In one case on October 3rd, he tweeted: "Just shot up at a house with my homies lol."    Another tweet from September 20th said: "I don't do nothing but chill wit da real n*****s. I got too much money to hang out wit the fake ones."   On October 8th, Johnson tweeted about the assault on an officer and called it "nothing personal".    In a letter that he wrote for his sentencing hearing last week, Johnson admitted that he was wrong and said "I need to learn to not make decisions in my life" . He apologized to police officers and also thanked them for their service."

Johnson's sentence came as the result of an investigation by Memphis Police Department's Crime Reduction Unit.   The department announced that they had uncovered a series of tweets from Johnson during the same time period when he was organizing his school party .    In one case on October 2nd, police said that Johnson tweeted: "B****** I got so much money it's crazy lol. And all my homies got money too."   Police also discovered that he had tweeted about other violent incidents and weapons in the weeks before his sentencing, but they did not provide any more details about these cases to ABC News .   Rudolph said police received a tip about Johnson's party through Twitter on October 4th and raided the school where Johnson was meeting friends .    "He didn't learn from that incident," Rudolph told reporters." It is apparent he wants to be known as gangsta. He wanted to do it again in the same way."

Johnson had been arrested three times before for various charges including trespassing, shoplifting and drug possession .   A search of his record shows that he was also arrested on suspicion of sexual assault in 2013 when police said that they found him with a girl who was underage at the time."

Johnson had been held in custody since October after pleading no contest to the aggravated assault charges against an officer . He was given credit for 95 days of time served, according to the court transcripts .   The sentence imposed on Johnson will allow him to apply for parole when he is 21 and then again at age 25.

The sentence has sparked criticism from critics who claim that police officers have overstepped their bounds in trying to shut down a social media account because of an unauthorized gathering .   "It is another example where the police are using excessive force to stop free speech," said Eileen O'Neil, a criminal defense lawyer at Memphis Area Legal Services." The idea that he was going to harm the officer by punching him or throwing a shoe at him does not make sense."

Rudolph said it was "unfortunate" that Johnson had used Twitter in such a way and that his sentence had sparked controversy. She said there are rules when it comes to using social media for illegal purposes .   "He can't use it as a means of committing crime, that is what he did," Rudolph told ABC News." It was not appropriate behavior."

According to court records obtained by ABC News, Johnson has been placed in a juvenile detention facility since his arrest and will remain there until the sentencing hearing on Wednesday.   His social media account has been deleted.
