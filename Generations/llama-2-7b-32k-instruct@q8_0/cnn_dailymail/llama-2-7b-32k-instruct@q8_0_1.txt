fuls of marijuana on the website he set up under a pseudonym @MemphisFinest_. His 40,000 Twitter followers include law enforcement agencies in California and Texas, but also hundreds of young people drawn to his account by the promise of a look behind the scenes at criminal activity.

A recent tweet reads: "Went through about 10 bags of weed today . . . That's not even half." Another boasts: "Got over a lil m on me in cash rite now!" His followers are encouraging him to expand his operation and he promises to provide them with pictures of the drugs, guns and cash as soon as possible.

But it is all a lie, says Memphis Finest's Twitter bio: "Follow for some Gangsta shit!! But not like in the real life kinda way...Lol...I don't do that type of stuff though!!" The account has been set up as a publicity stunt by Memphis rapper Yo Gotti and his friend, social media specialist Kyle Crosby. They are using it to promote the musician's new album called "Live from the 36 Chamber".

But they have no idea who will believe them - or what kind of impact their hoax has had on the world at large, which is still reeling from a real school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.

The boy, whose identity remains a mystery, is an aspiring rap artist and could be as young as 12 years old, but his age doesn't matter to Crosby or Gotti. They hope he can get them the publicity they need for their new album. "We don't know who he is, we just know that it's a kid that wants to do something different," said Crosby.

Crosby says he and Gotti came up with the idea after hearing about other musicians using Twitter to promote their music. They also wanted to bring attention to the "gangsta" lifestyle, which they say is becoming increasingly popular in the US. "We think it's funny," Crosby told FoxNews.com."

In an interview with TMZ, Gotti said he hopes his hoax will make people think twice before glamorizing crime on Twitter and to realize that some tweets are not real. "I hope they get the message that there are kids out here who really are living that kind of life," said Gotti.

The duo's stunt comes as America is still reeling from a school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut on Friday when 20-year old Adam Lanza killed 26 people before killing himself. The nation was shocked by the news that a teenager would carry out such an atrocity.

This isn't the first time Twitter has been used to hoax police officers and the public. In October, a man tweeted about being raped in a Starbucks restroom in San Diego using the name "AJ". But it was later revealed that he was actually a woman pretending to be a man on social media.

But Gotti says his hoax is not meant to mock the victims of crime, but rather to shine a light on how some people choose to live their lives and what they get into when no one's watching - like a school shooting. "We don't do anything serious," said Gotti. "It's just for fun."

Memphis Finest's Twitter account has since been suspended but Crosby hopes the hoax will be remembered as the day Memphis rapper Yo Gotti and social media specialist Kyle Crosby pulled a publicity stunt that made people think twice about believing tweets from anonymous sources.

"We're trying to let people know, even though Twitter is fun, you should be careful what you believe," said Crosby. "A lot of things on social media are not always real."

This article appeared in the Southport Broadcaster, a weekly newspaper in Maine and published by the same group that owns Fox News. It's not clear how widely read this story was but it does suggest that the fake Twitter account is actually based in Maine. 

It seems that many people still believe that the original article appeared on the front page of the New York Times.

The person who created and maintains Memphis Finest's Twitter account did not respond to my email requesting an interview, but I was able to find his other social media accounts. According to the bio on his YouTube channel, he is a "rapper" from Texas and has been arrested for drug possession in the past. He does not appear to have many followers though, so it's unlikely that these tweets were picked up by many people. 

It seems unlikely that the original article appeared in the New York Times, but it could be possible that Memphis Finest was published on another website that has a large audience. Since this story is still being circulated widely online, it's impossible to say for sure where it first appeared. In any case, it's clear that Memphis Finest and the rest of Twitter are not to be taken seriously.

This person's YouTube channel also contains links to songs by Yo Gotti. If you go to his SoundCloud page, there is a song called "Forever Young" which features him rapping over the same beat as Yo Gotti's song "Love". 

It seems likely that this person created Memphis Finest and is using it to promote himself and his music. The account itself has been suspended, but the tweets still exist on the web. It may be that no one will ever know who was behind this stunt, but it's clear that anyone interested in finding out would have a hard time doing so.

This story is interesting because it shows how easily people can spread information on Twitter without verifying any of its contents or sources. The person who created Memphis Finest could very well be a criminal pretending to be an aspiring rapper, but that doesn't mean the story itself isn't true in some form. It seems likely that this is what happened. 

This story is also interesting because it shows how quickly something can go viral online and create a false impression of reality. Memphis Finest has over 40,000 followers on Twitter who may believe the account's tweets are real based solely on the number of people following it. This should be a warning to anyone who believes what they read on social media.

It seems likely that Memphis Finest was created by someone with the intent of causing controversy and publicity for Yo Gotti and his friend, Kyle Crosby. If this is the case, it's interesting that people still believe the account to be real even though it has been suspended. It seems that some people will go a long way to get attention and this story proves they are willing to lie in order to do so.
