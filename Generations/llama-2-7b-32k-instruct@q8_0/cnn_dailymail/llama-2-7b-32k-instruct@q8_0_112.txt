Eden Hazard has become the youngest player to reach 25 Premier League goals when he netted Chelsea's second goal in a 2-0 victory over Stoke City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.  
Hazard, who turns 23 later this month, beat his own record of being the youngest ever scorer in Premier League history, previously set when he netted against Aston Villa in August 2014. The Belgian has been a constant threat since joining Chelsea in January and wasted no time in putting Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham out of the way, beating Hugo Lloris to give his side a deserved lead inside three minutes of play.  
Stoke pressed hard for an equaliser but were unable to break down a Chelsea defence which held firm, with Nathaniel Clyne and David Luiz both on hand to clear off the line as well as John Terry having to make two blocks to deny Marko Arnautovic. A second goal was required by Tony Pulis's side but it never came in the 86 minutes played and Chelsea, who finished with 10 men after Willian was sent off for a wild tackle on Mame Biram Diouf as he was about to take a corner, held on.  
With their third defeat of the season, Stoke now find themselves in the relegation zone having been undefeated in their previous four games in all competitions, while Chelsea climb to sixth place in the table and up to 13 points adrift of league leaders Manchester City.
