Chelsea are now level on points at the top of the Premier League with Manchester City who lost 4-1 away against Leicester and Liverpool who drew 1-1 in a fiery Merseysiders derby with Everton. The win puts Chelsea back into pole position for the title race given they also have a game in hand on both of their rivals, however, City are still top of the goal difference chart and lead by 10 goals from Liverpool who are two down on Mourinho's men.

Chelsea were without key man Diego Costa but Hazard led the line well and showed his class with a performance full of creativity and flair. He had been criticised for some poor displays recently, including during the 1-0 defeat against Crystal Palace in their previous league match. But he responded in style here with an all round display that saw him win man of the match.

The Blues had to weather a strong start from Stoke who dominated early on and played some crisp passing football, but eventually Chelsea broke the deadlock when Hazard was played through on goal and tucked home calmly after 17 minutes. His second came nine minutes before half time as he rose unmarked to head home a corner from Cesc Fabregas who had been a lively performer in midfield once again for Mourinho's side.

Stoke pulled one back after the break as Walters nodded past Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois following a low cross from Ibrahim Afellay. The home team were struggling to find a way through and some fine saves kept them in it but they couldn't find an equaliser despite having enough chances.

Jose Mourinho had made one change to the side that beat Manchester City with Kurt Zouma replacing Nathaniel Clyne at right back for what was a very solid Chelsea defence performance. Thibaut Courtois also kept up his fine form in goal as he made save after save including a brave stop on Afellay's shot.

Marcus Bettinelli played in goal for Sunderland who lost 4-0 at Middlesbrough while the other two relegation threatened teams, Norwich and Aston Villa also went down to defeat against Brighton and Swansea respectively.

Southampton scored four past Watford at St Mary's as Graziano Pelle grabbed a hat-trick and Dusan Tadic added another in the Saints 4-0 win. It keeps them in touch with Liverpool in the race for the final Europa League place and they will be pleased to see fellow rivals Swansea go down again following their loss at Swansea.

There was more bad news for struggling Sunderland as Jermain Defoe couldn't find a goal for his new club and missed a good chance on the way to Southampton also going down 3-0 away against West Brom. He had scored six goals in two games before this game and has now gone nine Premier League games without scoring.

Bournemouth beat Crystal Palace at Dean Court with a 1-0 win through Junior Stanislas' strike in the second half. The south coast club are still looking for their first league goal of the season after six attempts but they picked up three valuable points which takes them out of the relegation zone into 15th place.

Arsenal bounced back from consecutive defeats with a 2-0 victory over Bournemouth at the Vitality Stadium in Dorset on Saturday . The Gunners took their first lead through Theo Walcott and then wrapped up all three points late on, thanks to a goal from Alexis Sanchez.

Arsenal's win lifted them out of the relegation places after Bournemouth, West Ham and Swansea all slipped down in recent weeks . Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe will be frustrated his side failed to take advantage of their opponents poor form following a run of 15 games without a win.

In the other game, Everton beat Leicester City at Goodison Park with an emphatic 4-0 victory over Leicester. Romelu Lukaku and Yannick Bolasie both scored two goals each for Ronald Koeman's side as they put their poor form behind them in a dominating performance against the Foxes .

It is alleged Mourinho approached Bilic and made a gesture towards him which was seen as provocative by the Hammers manager.

Chelsea were without Diego Costa, who served the first game of his three match suspension following his red card at Vicarage Road against Watford last month. Kurt Zouma replaced Nathaniel Clyne in defense and Cesc Fabregas returned from injury to replace Ruben Loftus-Cheek who played well in a central midfield role when Costa was suspended.

Stoke City were without Glen Johnson who served the second of his three match suspension. Ibrahim Afellay came into the side for Marko Arnautovic and Peter Crouch was recalled to partner Saido Berahino up front in place of Bojan on the bench.

The two teams have met 46 times, with Chelsea winning 21 games to Stoke's 13. Stoke won their last meeting at Stamford Bridge and have had success over Chelsea in recent seasons so Jose Mourinho will be looking for a response from his players after a poor run of form that has seen the Blues concede five goals without reply in the past two games.

Stoke boss Mark Hughes also has injury worries with Erik Pieters, James McClean and Peter Crouch all out injured while Bojan is on the bench and Saido Berahino will be looking to start after coming off the bench last weekend against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium.

The game kicked off in front of a sell-out 41,750 crowd as both sets of fans had high hopes for their team's performance before kick-off with Chelsea fans confident they can win their third Premier League title this season and Stoke looking to stop them winning it.

Chelsea started the game strongly but couldn't make any headway against a tight defense in the opening minutes, however, their persistence paid off when they took the lead on 17 minutes after a well-worked corner from Cesc Fabregas with Eden Hazard getting between two defenders to tuck home into the bottom right hand corner.

Stoke City responded well and were looking dangerous on the break with Saido Berahino making some runs through the middle, however he was unable to convert a cross from Charlie Adam on 28 minutes as Thibaut Courtois made a good save. The Belgian goalkeeper has been in fine form all season and had another superb game against Stoke City to keep Chelsea ahead at half time.

Stoke City kept up the pressure after the break and were rewarded when Jonathan Walters was able to get on the end of a cross from Ibrahim Afellay on 69 minutes to make it 1-1. Stoke should have gone ahead moments earlier but Adam shot wide when one on one with Thibaut Courtois before Chelsea regained their lead.

Cesc Fabregas was the architect as he played a great ball through for Eden Hazard who showed his composure in front of goal to score an equalizer nine minutes after the break and send Stamford Bridge into raptures. The Blues were on top but Stoke still had chances as Saido Berahino couldn't find space to work against Thibaut Courtois on 81 minutes before he was substituted off.

Stoke City pressed for an equalizer with Charlie Adam and Ibrahim Afellay having some good opportunities but it wasn't to be as Chelsea held on to win the match by a scoreline of 2-1 after 90 minutes. It was an important victory for Mourinho and his side who showed their quality in front of goal when they needed it most.

The Blues are back in top spot and now have a game in hand over Manchester City who lost 4-1 to Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Wednesday night whilst Liverpool's Merseysiders Derby with Everton ended in a draw at Goodison Park. With the title race as close as it has ever been, the Blues now have three games left in which to secure their third Premier League title under Mourinho and they will be hoping that their winning habit returns over the coming weeks.
