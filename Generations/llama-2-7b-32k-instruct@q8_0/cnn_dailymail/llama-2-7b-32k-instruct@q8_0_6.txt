The 26 - year old has been a regular for England in previous seasons but has failed to make Gareth Southgate's squad for this summer's World Cup . Walcott was an unused substitute in England's first two group matches against Tunisia and Panama, which were both won by the Three Lions . The winger is yet to make his senior debut but has played three times for England U21s. Wenger revealed: "I will speak with him about it (his form) of course because I believe that confidence is very important in football."
