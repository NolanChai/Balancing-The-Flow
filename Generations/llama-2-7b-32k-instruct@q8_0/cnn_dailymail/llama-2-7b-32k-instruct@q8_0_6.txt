underland clash next month when the player returns to club duties following the international break .
Wenger was scathing in his assessment of Walcott’s showing on Sunday, when he had to be replaced by Danny Welbeck after 53 minutes against Lithuania at Wembley. England lost their Euro 2016 qualifier 2-0 and Walcott, who has played just two games for club in the past season, failed to make an impact against a side ranked 84th in the world.
The winger was not in the starting line up at the start of the match but came on as England’s first sub when they were already trailing and was substituted before half-time. The 25 year old has only played two games for Arsenal this season because of injury problems, making a total of just three starts in all competitions last term.
Arsenal have been linked with moves for the likes of Wilfried Bony and Mario Gotze in attack to replace Walcott but Wenger insists that no-one will be signed until January . Speaking about Walcott’s England woes, Wenger said: ‘He has not had a great deal of playing time at Arsenal. He is now struggling for confidence and rhythm and you can see it in his game. We have to support him because he needs it at the moment.’
Walcott, who scored 14 goals last season but only played 25 games, was a late call-up to Roy Hodgson’s England squad for Sunday’s game. He was signed by Arsenal in 2006 from Southampton for £12million and has been a regular since the start of the 2008/9 season. Wenger, speaking about Walcott, added: ‘He is at a difficult moment so we have to help him back . He needs to regain confidence because he played very well in the past.’
Walcott has scored 37 goals for Arsenal since his move from Southampton and has been directly involved in almost one goal every two games. The forward’s best ever season was in 2012-13, when he netted 14 times and assisted six more in the Premier League. He is not alone at Arsenal suffering an injury crisis with the likes of Laurent Koscielny, Aaron Ramsey and Francis Coquelin all still out for long periods this season.
The manager has to juggle his squad carefully when a number of players are missing for international matches which Wenger feels does not allow him enough time to prepare . He said: ‘I don’t know if it is the best situation but I think in England we have to live with that as well. It is very difficult because there will be games where you cannot make any changes.’
Walcott, who was a key figure for the Gunners under Wenger when he took over at the club in 1996 and played a major role in their successes including three Premier League titles and four FA Cups, has suffered from fitness issues in the past. He missed most of last season because of an Achilles problem, the first time it had flared up since his debut in 2003 .
‘It’s difficult with players when they have come through like he did,’ Wenger said. ‘He is a player who has done extremely well and he still has a lot to give but as you get older, the body has its own way of getting more vulnerable. I believe Theo will be okay but he needs some time to recover because it’s not just about fitness.’
Arsenal travel to Wembley on November 29 for their first Premier League game since that humiliating defeat by Bayern Munich in the Champions League . Wenger, who has a record of four wins from nine competitive games against Sunderland as Arsenal manager, added: ‘We will not change our style because we had no choice to do so. We played with 10 men for the last 45 minutes at Bayern and were still in the game.
‘It was a big blow mentally but I think it made us stronger.’

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger believes he is on course for a fourth Premier League title in his tenure as the Gunners look to end their nine-year wait for the top prize. He has guided them to consecutive victories over West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace, who both finished just outside the relegation zone last season . The 64-year-old Frenchman, who celebrated his 64th birthday in June, was linked with a move to Bayern Munich before committing to a new two year deal at Emirates Stadium.
Ahead of Arsenal’s trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday he is now targeting an eighth FA Cup win. The Gunners have played down suggestions they are out for the title and are instead focusing on their domestic cup competitions . Wenger said: ‘You don’t focus on the title when you are 10 points behind because it means you have to win all your games by a big distance while the other teams will lose some of theirs. ‘We look at every competition as an opportunity.’
Arsenal lie in fourth place, four points off Manchester City and seven off leader Chelsea after playing one more match . Their 2-0 victory over Palace on Wednesday took them to eight wins out of ten games but Wenger conceded his team have not been at their best this season. The manager also admitted that Arsenal are currently a team with weaknesses which they want to sort out.
The north London club have suffered from injuries, and other issues like the loss of Alexis Sanchez for four games because of Chile’s participation in the Copa America. Wenger said: ‘We don’t hide our problems and we know where we are weak . We need to improve but I am convinced we will improve.’
Wenger was confident that they can still win a domestic title this season as well, despite their poor start . He said: ‘I believe we have the capacity to do it because we have had the mental strength to come back from difficult moments in the past. We have always been strong when it mattered.’ Wenger insists he has not been affected by his team’s slow start and will remain focused on their goals.
The manager also praised young players like Alex Iwobi, Reiss Nelson and Joel Campbell who have stood out so far this season and are ready to step up to the senior team . He said: ‘They all have a bright future ahead of them . They are good boys as well which is important.’
