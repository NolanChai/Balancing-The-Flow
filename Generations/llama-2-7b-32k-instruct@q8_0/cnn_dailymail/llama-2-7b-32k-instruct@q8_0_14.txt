he delivers a speech in which he will pledge to get Britain out of debt.

David Cameron is expected to attack the Government's record on welfare, saying it has been ‘over-generous with people’s money’ and failed to cut the deficit quickly enough . He will say:
‘This country needs a government that understands what hardship means. That understands how important every penny is.’

He adds: ‘I think we should be ashamed of some of the wastefulness in public spending over recent years.’

David Cameron will also attack Labour’s record on tax, saying that it has raised income tax three times since 1997. He says that this has meant the average family pays £50 more a month because of Labour’s policies .

Mr Cameron is expected to say: ‘Britain deserves a government that will not squander your money.’

The Tory leader will say that he would have cut the deficit faster than the coalition has done, and argues that it should not take 15 years for a country’s debts to be eradicated . He will say: ‘I think this is immoral. I think we have got a responsibility as politicians not just to look after our own political future but actually to do the right thing by people.’

The Tory leader is expected to claim Labour’s decision to increase taxes on income and savings was wrong, saying it hit families hardest. He will say: ‘What we need now is a government that will make sure that when you have worked for your money, it stays with you rather than being taken away.’

The Conservative leader also says the Government has been too generous to people who claim benefits . He adds that Labour’s record on welfare shows its ‘love affair with welfare is over’. He will say: ‘I think we can’t take any more of this sort of thing.’

The speech comes as 14 million working households are given a tax cut worth an average £250 by the Government’s new child benefit scheme . Under the new arrangements, couples earning over £60,000 will see their income taxed in the higher rate band. The change will affect 75% of taxpaying families and means many people will get a tax cut without doing anything at all .

Mr Cameron is expected to say: ‘I want you to think about this - how would it feel if someone were to offer you a gift, but as soon as you tried to take possession of it, they snatched it away? That’s what the Government has done with your money.’

He adds: ‘The people who are hardest hit by these tax rises are working families.’

David Cameron will also attack the Government for failing to meet its deficit target last year . He is expected to say: 'I think we should be ashamed of some of the wastefulness in public spending over recent years.'

Mr Cameron says a Tory government would not squander your money. The Conservative leader will claim he has already got his priorities right by putting cutting the deficit first, saying: 'I think this is immoral . I think we have got a responsibility as politicians not just to look after our own political future but actually to do the right thing by people.'

Mr Cameron also says the Government has been too generous with benefits, and adds: 'We need to change the way government thinks about welfare. The love affair Labour had with welfare is over - it's time to get a grip on this benefit culture. We can't take any more of this sort of thing.'

In his speech, David Cameron will say: ‘If I was Prime Minister right now, I would be ashamed that we didn’t cut the deficit faster than we have done over recent years...I think it should not take 15 years for a country to get out of debt. And I don't just mean national debt - I also mean family debt.'

David Cameron will say he wants to make sure that when people earn their money, they keep more of it and pay less tax as part of his approach to 'mending the broken society'. He is expected to claim: 'What we need now is a government that will make sure that when you have worked for your money, it stays with you rather than being taken away.'"
