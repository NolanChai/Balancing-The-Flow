Southampton

Ronald Koeman called on his players to show "maturity", "nous" and "respect" as the club fight off a reported takeover by Chinese investors. The 54-year old manager has had a tough few weeks at St Mary's after failing to secure European qualification and then seeing his star midfielder Victor Wanyama linked with a move away from the club this summer, according to Sky Sports News HQ.

Southampton have denied reports that the Kenyan international has been told he will be sold, despite it being claimed by Spanish newspaper Sport on Monday that Southampton had received an offer worth 50 million Euros for Wanyama from Chinese Super League club Beijing Guo'an . However, Koeman has not taken kindly to what he described as "rumours" in the media and called on his players to give the team a boost by winning at West Brom this weekend.

Speaking ahead of Saturday's Premier League match with Alan Pardew's men, Koeman said: "You have to show maturity, you have to show nous, you have to show respect and we can do that tomorrow against West Brom," the Dutchman told Sky Sports News HQ .

"We have got a big week ahead of us and there will be some important games. The Premier League is not over yet, it's just starting now for everyone and I think we have to be ready. "Our first target was to finish in the top 10 and that's done. Now we can talk about finishing as high as possible."

Southampton are currently 12th in the league standings, five points ahead of West Brom who are fighting relegation. The Baggies have had a difficult season after being one of last year's surprise package - they were tipped for a top six finish by some and finished seventh just two seasons removed from relegation.

Koeman was keen to play down his team's position in the Premier League table, pointing out that it would be unfair on his players if they are written off as already being dead and buried ahead of what will be a crucial summer for Southampton, who will lose key players such as Wanyama and Nathaniel Clyne.

"We can't talk about the position in the league table," he said . "We have had some great performances this season but there are always things to improve on. It's not enough just to say it's been a good season or you finish in the top 10 - we need to look at it and see what is right and wrong."

Koeman also refused to get involved in Wanyama speculation, adding: "I have nothing to add. You know that I don't like to talk about players who are not ours or players who might come in the summer."

Southampton host West Brom at St Mary's on Saturday looking for their fifth home win of the season and a fourth successive victory over the Baggies, who will be hoping for three points to help ease the pressure ahead of the final run-in.

West Brom have won just four of 12 away games this season, while Southampton are unbeaten in seven home matches since October . The Saints have failed to win any of their last six Premier League matches against West Brom but did beat Pardew's men in the corresponding fixture a year ago.

West Brom will be hoping they can continue where they left off after the 3-1 victory over Swansea City, a game that saw two goals from James McClean and one from Matt Phillips earn them a deserved three points . The Baggies are looking to build on a run of five unbeaten Premier League games against Southampton, their best ever sequence.

Southampton have won 10 of the 24 matches between the two clubs and West Brom have lost only seven out of 17. Saints, however, are unbeaten in each of the last six meetings with West Brom at St Mary's, a run stretching back to 2009.

Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand will miss the game against his former club through injury . The 28-year old was signed by West Brom in January of last year before being sold to Saints at the end of the season, having made only four appearances for Tony Pulis' team.

Southampton's Nathaniel Clyne and Dusan Tadic will be hoping to return to the starting line-up after being rested against Watford in midweek while Shane Long is expected to lead the line up front, with Charlie Austin out due to a hamstring injury . For West Brom, Saido Berahino remains the only absentee for their trip south.

West Brom's key man has been Hal Robson-Kanu who has scored six goals this season and assisted a further three as Pardew looks to him to provide some spark and flair in what has otherwise been an average campaign at West Brom. Robson-Kanu was linked with a move away from the Hawthorns but instead signed a new contract earlier this month that will keep him at the club until 2021 .

Pardew also faces a decision over whether to recall Jonny Evans, who has been out since New Year's Day due to a calf injury and made just two appearances for the Baggies before that. The defender joined West Brom from Manchester City last summer for Â£6 million but his career at the Hawthorns could be nearing its conclusion given he is out of contract in the summer.

The two managers have been involved in a spat over Evans' potential availability with Pardew accusing Koeman of not making it clear if he was interested in signing him as Saints prepare for life without Wanyama, Clyne and Nathaniel Clyne after their contracts expire at the end of this season.

"I had an honest conversation with Ronald," Pardew said last week . "Ron's made his mind up about Victor (Wanyama). He hasn't played him much, he doesn't like to play him and I think that has something to do with the fact we may be losing him."

Koeman responded: "It is not my decision . He is a Southampton player. It has nothing to do with me or the board or anything else ."

Pardew added on Friday: "We've been very open and honest with them (Southampton). I think we have shown what kind of club we are."

Koeman was asked if he had ever made an approach for Evans before the 31-year old defender joined West Brom in 2017 . "I don't need to say that. If I would tell you, it would be a lie," Koeman said. He added: "The manager is not the owner and if there are any bids for players or something else, it has nothing to do with me."

Southampton are 12th in the Premier League standings but have been linked with a move away from St Mary's by Chinese investors. Koeman believes that speculation is not affecting his team . "I think that the players know what I expect of them and there are no doubts about it," he said .

"We had some rumours about Victor, then we heard something with another player, then another thing - but for me it's not important. There will be many more things in the future."

The Dutchman also played down any potential links between Southampton and a takeover bid from China . "I don't know what is happening," he said . "There are rumours, there could be some truth to it or not . It has nothing to do with me as I have other things to deal with."

Koeman was then asked if the club had been approached about a takeover bid and whether that would affect him in his job as manager. Koeman said: "I am focusing on Southampton, I don't need to think about that. What is important for me now is the football."

"It is not easy (to deal with speculation), but it has nothing to do with the players," he added . "They have to concentrate on football and we will see how the summer goes - if there are offers or bids or something like that, I don't know. It is not my job."

Southampton defender Matt Targett believes his team should focus more on themselves rather than worrying about what might happen in the future . "We need to be playing as well as we can and keeping ourselves in a strong position," he said . "I think it's important that we don't lose too much of our identity. We have been successful over the last couple of years so hopefully we will keep doing that."

The 23-year old defender has not played since November, having joined Southampton from Championship club Birmingham City in January . He was a target for West Brom who looked set to sign him but Saints managed to beat them to his signature after offering the former England U-20s star a longer contract than Tony Pulis' team. Targett said:
