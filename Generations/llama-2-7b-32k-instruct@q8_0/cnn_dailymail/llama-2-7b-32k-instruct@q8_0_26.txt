Ronald Koeman called for Southampton's players to show maturity, nous and respect after Victor Wanyama's future came under question. This weekend brings with it arguably Saints' biggest match of the season: a Premier League clash at Manchester City, where they will be hoping to prove their manager wrong in his assessment that they are too good for them. The Dutchman is expected to name a team full of youth against Pep Guardiola's side but has also admitted that he cannot predict what will happen as the match may not be played if the weather turns nasty, as the forecast suggests it might. "I don't know whether we will play or not," said Koeman. "It is a question of respect for Manchester City and their fans." The Southampton manager added that he hoped his team would play and show respect to City but would not compromise on safety, meaning he will have no option but to postpone the game if necessary. Wanyama has been linked with moves to Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Liverpool over the past few weeks. He is out of contract at St Mary's in the summer and while Southampton have yet to make a decision on his future, they are likely to be under pressure from their fans to sell him - despite Koeman insisting that he would not want to lose him. "I am happy with Victor," said the manager. "He is one of those players who can help us achieve our dreams if we have patience." Saints, who were in Champions League contention for much of last season, are currently in 12th place and seven points off the top four. They will be hoping to emulate their heroics against City in the same fixture in November when they won 4-2 with Wanyama on target twice as well as goals from Nathan Redmond and Shane Long. Saints have lost both meetings this season, though, conceding seven goals without reply at St Mary's while being held to a goalless draw at City. Koeman said his team would need to play "mature" in order to win at the Etihad but that their chances of doing so are not helped by having no senior players available on the bench. He also pointed out that, with a number of their key youngsters away with Holland Under-21s, he will be unable to call upon any experience from his own time as an international footballer in the game, which he insisted was "very important".

The Premier League has confirmed Southampton's match against Manchester City on Saturday will go ahead despite snow. The decision means that a number of Premier League matches scheduled for this weekend will take place, with Crystal Palace away to Bournemouth and Chelsea at home to West Ham also going ahead as planned. However, Swansea v Everton, Watford v Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United v Newcastle have been postponed due to the weather in those areas. Southampton are yet to make a final decision on their team for this weekend but Koeman revealed earlier that he will be without Nathaniel Clyne (back) and Charlie Austin (groin). City have also confirmed that they will name a strong XI, with Guardiola looking forward to the challenge: "We cannot think about it," said the manager. "It is an important game for Southampton, important for us. They are in a good moment, we are in a good moment." Guardiola has admitted that he would have liked more time on his hands but says he accepts the decision to go ahead with the match.

City also have injuries and will be without defender Bacary Sagna who suffered a calf injury while on international duty for France last week, although he is not expected to require surgery. City's full-backs have been troubled by fitness problems this season and Guardiola has had to play Fernando Reges in recent weeks due to a lack of options at right back. Sagna may be forced to watch the match from the bench and it remains to be seen who will be used in his place, with Pablo Zabaleta likely to start. The defender could also move into midfield if Guardiola sees fit. He has already hinted that City's 28-year-old attacking midfielder Kevin De Bruyne - who he says is now a top player after his breakout season in 2016 - will be one of the key men for the match, while Raheem Sterling could also start. "He [De Bruyne] has to do that," said Guardiola about the Belgian's role against Southampton. "In some games he plays right back and in this game he will play as a midfielder." City are the top scorers in the Premier League with 34 goals so far, two ahead of Manchester United who have played one game more than Guardiola's side. Wanyama has not scored for Southampton since October but Koeman insists that the Kenyan is still a key player for his team. "He is good enough," he said. "We all know what he brings to the team, we just have to give him time." The 26-year-old was out of action with a knee injury last season and Koeman feels it was difficult for him to re-find his form in his first year back from international football. Southampton will be hoping Wanyama can get on the scoresheet against City after he managed seven goals in the 2016/17 season.

Koeman also insisted that he would not mind if the match is played at a later time, as long as it was safe. The match is due to kick off at 3pm local time (4pm GMT). "I don't care what time it is but only one condition - we have to be able to play," said Koeman. "The game has to go ahead on Saturday afternoon." City will host Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday, December 16 at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (3pm local time). Southampton currently sit 7 points adrift of fourth place Liverpool after just picking up 14 points this season. Guardiola's team are top of the table with an incredible 40 points in total, despite being one game down on their rivals. In recent news, Koeman was asked about Wanyama and whether he would be playing in City. He said that while Victor is out of contract at St Mary's Stadium come the summer, his team will respect Manchester City too much to put out a weaker side against them. "I am happy with Victor," said the manager. "He is one of those players who can help us achieve our dreams if we have patience." As for City, Guardiola has revealed that De Bruyne and Sterling will both be key men against Southampton.
