The investigation continues into all of the circumstances leading up to her death."

Another neighbor said she would occasionally see Ghassemi outside riding her bicycle nearby."

"I didn't think anything of it," said Karen Hinkle, who lives near the crime scene . "When I saw the news about what happened to her, I was just like shocked...Just because you don't know somebody doesn't mean they wouldn't help you when you needed them.""
