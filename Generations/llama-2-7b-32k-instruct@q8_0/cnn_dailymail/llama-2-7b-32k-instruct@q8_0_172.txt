An ex-convict who told cops he fatally stabbed his ex-girlfriend, then cooked and ate some of her organs, may now also be charged with raping her. Joseph Oberhansley, from Jeffersonville, Indiana, is accused of killing 46-year-old Tammy Jo Blanton on June 18 after the two broke up last year. The mother-of-three had been dating Oberhansley for several months before he allegedly strangled her to death at their shared home in Jeffersonville, Indiana. After her death, police discovered that Oberhansley cooked and ate parts of his ex's body, including her heart, lungs, and brain, which were found frozen and covered in plastic wrap inside his fridge. Now, it seems he may face more charges - as Blanton's family claim she was pregnant with their child, and they are devastated at the news that Oberhansley killed her while she was carrying his baby. "She was about five or six weeks along," said Tammy Jo's uncle, Donnie Foster. He told the Indy Star: "I don't know what she would have done with it but we were happy and excited at the prospect of her having a child by Joseph." Blanton had two sons and one daughter from previous relationships, while Oberhansley has five children already. "We're just heartbroken right now," Donnie told WDRB.
