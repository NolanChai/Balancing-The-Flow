18-year-old cousin, who made it on his own, has a much better life here than me, which makes me wonder if it was worth it at all. He's healthy and strong -- the only one in our family to make it without help from his parents or others. I'm proud that my 15-year-old sister managed to get herself pregnant in order to go with him, but she shouldn't have had to. She is still just a child.""I would do it again," said the 21-year-old. "Even if I got locked up and had to leave my baby behind, I would try again because it was better than dying in Mali or being a slave here in Libya. But I don't think this is the answer for everyone.""The truth about migration is that most people do not want to emigrate," said Abdullahi Abubakar Gaye, president of Gambia's National Alliance for Campaign Against Trafficking in Persons (NACAT), which provides services to migrants. "But because they are poor and uneducated, they cannot find jobs or improve their lives where they live. The traffickers prey on that poverty and ignorance.""It is sad for us as a society when young people have no other choice but to take those risks," said Yankuba Colley of the Gambia Association for Migration, which helps migrants."The European Union has been spending millions of dollars to make Libya a safer place for migrants and refugees to live in. It's also giving money directly to local authorities there," he said ."But that money is not being used effectively or efficiently because the GNA [Government of National Accord] itself doesn't have enough power to be able to enforce rules."The government has been trying to make life more difficult for people trafficking in Libya, but it hasn't had much success. A 2017 United Nations report on human rights in the country said the police force "does not effectively investigate or prosecute crimes committed against migrants and refugees.""I have been told that there are many more smugglers than policemen," one resident of Tripoli's Tajoura neighborhood told CNN . The neighborhood is home to thousands of African migrants, some of whom were recently detained by authorities in a makeshift prison that was supposed to hold no more than 50 people ."In the beginning there were only four police stations and now there are about nine," he said."Many young boys have been kidnapped and sold into slavery, which is why they are being taken away from the area."According to Gaye of NACAT, traffickers "see migrants as a commodity -- that's how they make their money ." In addition to selling them into slave labor or forcing them to sell their organs, traffickers also prey on people who have run out of food and water."They'd be weak, unable to walk far, then the smugglers come along in a car with food and water for 500 or 600 euros," he said ."That is what they do with migrants, but it doesn't happen here. Our people have better values."A few weeks ago, Gambian President Adama Barrow flew to Libya in an effort to try and resolve the crisis there . "He brought back a lot of people," Gaye said, adding that he was able to help 62 migrants return home with him on his flight back home."I don't think this is a situation that will end soon. But I do hope it gets better."
(CNN)African refugees and migrants in Libya are being sold like chickens, one of the leaders of Gambia's National Alliance for Campaign Against Trafficking in Persons told CNN."We have received many complaints from people who have been sold by smugglers against their will," Abdullahi Abubakar Gaye said . "Sometimes it is to pay off a debt, other times they are sold to someone as a wife for $500, but in any case they are not told about the arrangement beforehand."According to Gaye, migrants can be trafficked into slavery simply by being sold or kidnapped, and are often forced to sell their organs . The trade is also facilitated through social media sites such as Facebook ."Whenever people are looking for jobs in Libya they usually put adverts on Facebook," said Gaye, who added that the ads sometimes include the names of the person being trafficked."People have been told by friends to take a job but when they arrive they are kidnapped and sold ." The victims then find themselves locked in shipping containers without food or water until their families pay the ransom."This is just one example. There are so many stories," Gaye said, adding that his group tries to help migrants who have been trafficked into slavery .According to him, these types of crimes tend to happen in areas with a large concentration of Africans living there and where there are no Libyan police stations."The government is not effective in protecting us," said one resident of the Tajoura neighborhood in Tripoli where thousands of migrants live . "There's only four policemen, but 10 smugglers and they are all armed with AK47 guns.""People are dying here every day. Somebody will shoot somebody at random because he is angry," the resident said . He added that the neighborhood has a local police station where people go to lodge complaints but, in some cases, those who have been killed end up getting their families killed as well."We have had a lot of deaths," Gaye told CNN . "Some were shot by smugglers and others died from lack of food or water. Some are still missing."One man in Tajoura said he knows someone who was taken away by traffickers because his family could not afford to pay the ransom."They took him three weeks ago," he said . "He has now been sold again and again, first for $300 and then for $500. We have not heard from him in days ."A resident of Tajoura said that there are people who have been trafficked into slavery that don't even know they have a family back home waiting to pay the ransom."They were taken here against their will and nobody knows them," he said ."There is no government here, so we are on our own. We are not safe anywhere; if you go outside at night you will be shot at by smugglers."According to Gaye, there have been some improvements in the treatment of migrants in Libya since the Government of National Accord came into power in 2016 ."They made it illegal for them to treat people this way," he said."But they do not have enough police on the ground and lack the ability to enforce those laws ."According to Gaye, migrants are often sold by smugglers after they arrive at their destination in Libya, where they pay for passage out of a detention center."They are taken to another place -- if there is no money then they are held and their organs harvested," he said ."We have been able to rescue many migrants from that situation, but we can do nothing if the smugglers kill them first . We do not know how widespread this is, because most of the migrants come from countries where there are no media or human rights organizations."
(CNN)African migrants in Libya -- people who were once hopeful they could make a better life for themselves through migration to Europe -- are now living lives that are even more precarious than before .In many cases, the only thing keeping them alive is the money their families send from back home ."The truth about migration is that most people do not want to emigrate," said Abdullahi Abubakar Gaye, president of Gambia's National Alliance for Campaign Against Trafficking in Persons, which helps migrants."But because they are poor and uneducated, they cannot find jobs or improve their lives where they live .

"I don't think this is a situation that will end soon. But I do hope it gets better ."
(CNN)As violence continues in the South Sudanese capital of Juba, some 10,000 refugees have sought safety at the United Nations base."It was very frightening," said one refugee who was forced to leave her home after being caught up in the fighting."When we arrived, I saw people whose heads had been cut off and women with their breasts cut off . We also saw some people with no legs or arms. It was terrible, especially because we did not know where they came from and what they had gone through."The UN refugee agency, UNHCR, reported
