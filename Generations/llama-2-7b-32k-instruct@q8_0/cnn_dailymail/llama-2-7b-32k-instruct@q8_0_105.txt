Stoke City's manager Mark Hughes was quoted in The Telegraph as saying that Tom Jones is stopping Stoke City from qualifying for Europe. Stoke City are a professional football club based in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire that play at the Britannia Stadium and have been runners-up in the Football League Cup competition four times.

Hughes also said that Tom Jones stopped Manchester United players from playing on the green grass of home during their 1964 FA Cup final victory over 2nd division Watford at Wembley. Hughes was quoted saying "I think it was a little bit of jealousy, wasn't it?".

The 70 year old Welsh singer stopped playing in the UK in 1993 but still performs regularly around the world and last played in Wales on May 25th at The Oval in Swansea. Stoke City play their football league matches at the Britannia Stadium, which was built in 1997 by owner Peter Coates for his football club Stoke City and has a capacity of 28,000 spectators.

Stoke City have been playing professional football since joining the Football League in 1885 but are only known as Stoke City since 1923 after they merged with Stoke Ramblers to create one big club that would be able to challenge for silverware and attract better players. In 1964, they finished second in the Second Division but were knocked out by Manchester United in the final of the FA Cup.

Stoke City are currently placed ninth in the Premier League table with two points off of safety. The club have been trying to return to European competition after their last appearance was in 1985 when they finished sixth in the old first division and qualified for UEFA Cup competition.
