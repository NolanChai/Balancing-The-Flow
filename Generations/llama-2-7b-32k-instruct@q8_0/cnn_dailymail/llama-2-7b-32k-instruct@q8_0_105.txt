ame defeats in the Premier League .

Stoke's 2-1 loss at Everton on Sunday was their fifth defeat in six games and left them just three points off relegation zone. They have managed only four victories all season, one of which came against bottom club West Bromwich Albion .

While Stoke boss Hughes can blame his side’s poor form, Jones has been struggling to get past the audition process at Swansea City and is still a long way short of securing a job. He has overseen six wins in 18 matches with the Welsh club and was last seen limping off the field during their FA Cup replay defeat by Chelsea .

“The pressure's on for everyone,” said Hughes, who had no complaints about referee Martin Atkinson’s decision to dismiss Mame Biram Diouf for a foul on Everton's Muhamed Besic . “The manager, the players – that's why they get paid. The manager and the players are here to win games of football.”

Stoke could find themselves in trouble when the Premier League board meets on Friday, although they are likely to be overlooked for now given their standing as a top-flight club . But they are the latest victims of a poor run that has seen Swansea City and Sunderland relegated already.

Burnley’s 1-0 victory over West Brom on Sunday extended their unbeaten run to seven games, lifting them out of the bottom three at least for now . They have not conceded a goal since they were thumped 4-0 by Stoke City at Turf Moor on Dec. 28 and sit six points above Swansea in 17th place, which is looking like being the cutoff point to remain in England's top soccer tier next season .

West Brom, however, could be forgiven for feeling aggrieved at losing a match they should have won after Jon Walters had put his side ahead at Goodison Park on 34 minutes when he tapped home from close range following Everton’s own goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg's parry of Ashley Williams' header .

The home team, however, were gifted a deserved equaliser by Diouf who tripped Besic after the ball had been played long to him and was shown the red card by Atkinson before half time. That brought an end to a 27-minute stoppage which began when Everton goalkeeper Stekelenburg collided with Williams on the edge of his six-yard box .

“It's hard to take,” said West Brom manager Alan Irvine, who has managed just seven wins in his previous 43 Premier League games and is fighting for his future at The Hawthornes. “We should be getting more points from this type of game than we are.”

Stoke had their moments but lacked bite in front of goal, failing to capitalise on Everton's own poor form and inability to convert chances . They were only denied an 18th minute lead when Stekelenburg was equal to Glen Johnson’s powerful strike from inside the area after being teed up by Charlie Adam’s corner kick .

West Brom had a good opportunity to make it 2-0 with just over five minutes remaining but Jonny Evans headed wide from close range following Salomon Rondon's cross into the box after a corner from Craig Gardner .

“We’ve got to find that finishing touch,” said Stoke forward Peter Crouch, who has managed only two goals in 14 Premier League games this season and had been denied by Stekelenburg when he fired over at close range just before halftime . “We know we can create chances – it's getting the goal at the end that is the problem."

Everton bounced back after a shock defeat in the Europa League against Austrian minnows Wolfsberger AC by coming from behind to beat West Brom with Gareth Barry and Steven Naismith grabbing goals within eight minutes of each other either side of halftime . “We were very poor for 45 minutes but came out strongly,” said manager Roberto Martinez.

The victory was Everton's first in four league games after a run that saw them lose three matches and draw two others . Martinez’s side has also struggled to convert chances, having failed to score in six of their last 10 Premier League games .

“We know the importance of getting back on track,” said Barry. “We needed this result.” (Reporting by Simon Evans; editing by Toby Davis)
