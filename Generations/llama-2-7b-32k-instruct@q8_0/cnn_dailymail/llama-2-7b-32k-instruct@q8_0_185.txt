The Delta, which spans some 1,200 miles in California's Central Valley, is a massive system of waterways that connect to the Sacramento River and San Francisco Bay. It supplies roughly three million people with drinking water daily and provides much-needed sustenance for the state's thriving agriculture industry.

But as Mother Nature has changed her tune, so has man.

Between 2011 and 2014, some farmers drained hundreds of thousands of acre feet of water from the Delta — enough to fill nearly three-quarters of Lake Mead in Nevada. The missing water is difficult to quantify because there's no concrete way to account for it or prove its absence.

"It's not like you have a measuring stick that goes into the ground," said Brad Udall, senior scientist with the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. "There are leaks, there's evapotranspiration. It could be any number of things."

The delta has been in decline for decades due to overuse and environmental damage. But a 2013 study published by Udall and the Pacific Institute concluded that if farmers pumped an extra 75 million acre feet of water from the Delta annually, the ecosystem would become so damaged it would collapse in less than two years.

"It's already collapsing," Udall said. "We need to have the political will to do something about it."

The study called for farmers to find alternatives to pumping Delta water and to stop draining so much of it when there is a drought, which could save the ecosystem. The report also recommended that water be delivered by pipelines from other sources to make up for what is lost in the delta.

Udall said the study's recommendations were not taken seriously enough because they conflicted with farmers' and politicians' interests.

The drought has made the situation even worse, as more Delta water was diverted by farmers looking to grow crops in what is now a dry environment. The California Department of Water Resources says the amount of Delta pumping is nearing pre-drought levels because some farmers have been pumping out groundwater they stored last year, which has allowed them to use more delta water than before.

A lot of the missing water comes from a 40-mile stretch on the southwestern end of the Delta known as "The Pumps." Here is where the California Aqueduct — a system that delivers water from Northern California to So...<s> <|endoftext|> Q:

How can I make a customized image slider in a wordpress theme? 

I want to create an image slider using Wordpress's own "Image Slider" plugin. However, instead of using the default slider format (a horizontal line of images), I want to create a vertical bar chart with 2 bars on it - each bar representing a different part of my website.
The chart should be animated in that when you click one of the sliders, the next image appears on top of the other. Here's what it will look like:

How can I do this? The slider plugin's documentation is a bit confusing and not very detailed.
Thank you for your help!  

A:

The easiest way to achieve that would be using CSS3 animation, as you can apply an animation with a delay to each bar while the other one fades out. 
You should first create an element wrapping both bars, then add the class .image-slider and set its position to absolute. After this you can set up an animation using keyframes and transitionend events.

To achieve what you want, I think you're going to need a custom plugin or theme that is built specifically for your needs. The Image Slider plugin only allows you to use the default slider format (horizontal line of images). 
However, if you're comfortable with coding and have some experience with WordPress plugins, you could try creating a custom plugin that uses jQuery UI's Accordion widget to create the bar chart effect. Here's an example of how you could do it:
