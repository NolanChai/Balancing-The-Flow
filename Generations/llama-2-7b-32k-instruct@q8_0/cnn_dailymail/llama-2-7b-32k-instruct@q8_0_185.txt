Water Theft in the California Delta 
The San Francisco Chronicle published a lengthy report that documented water theft from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and it suggests this has been going on for years. 
According to the article, “from at least two years ago until mid-2018, the water agencies routed much of their pumping through a single gate in West Sacramento where they could divert more water from the delta than federal rules and permits allowed.” The Chronicle says this was accomplished with “deceptively low flows” to disguise how much was really being stolen. 
The Chronicle found that the Central Valley Water District, which represents thousands of farmers in the region, has been quietly stealing millions of acre-feet of water each year by exploiting loopholes and legal technicalities in its permit and lease agreements with government agencies. According to the paper, “the district has allowed itself to siphon off massive quantities of delta water — hundreds of thousands of acre-feet per year, in some years” that’s not supposed to be part of its allotment under state law or federal rules. 
The Chronicle says the diversion of this much water is significant because it would have been enough to supply at least 4 million households with drinking water for a full calendar year. “The Central Valley Water District has had unlimited access to an essential resource that belongs to all Californians,” writes Tom Knudson, who authored the article and is a longtime investigative reporter for The Chronicle. 
Knudson says he reviewed more than two dozen water management documents over four years and spoke with numerous people involved in managing California's water supplies. “It’s as if the district had its own private pipeline to the delta, delivering millions of acre-feet of stolen delta water into the state’s aquifers and farmland,” he writes. 
The paper also found that the Central Valley Water District was not alone in taking advantage of these legal technicalities. The Turlock Irrigation District is another agency accused of stealing large amounts of water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and it’s unclear if other water agencies may be doing the same. 
Knudson notes that this kind of “water theft” has been going on for years despite laws that have long sought to protect California’s scarce water resources from misuse by those who pump them in large quantities and sell them illegally to thirsty Californians. 
“The delta is not a limitless resource,” Knudson writes. “It’s a fragile ecosystem that depends on the delivery of fresh water from the Sierra Nevada. It needs that fresh water now, when climate change and federal mismanagement have depleted its supplies.”
