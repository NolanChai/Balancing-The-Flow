Leicester are four points adrift of safety and face Manchester United in the FA Cup fifth round at the King Power Stadium on Friday night, a match which Cambiasso admits could prove decisive for their hopes of survival.

But if they fall short of victory over Jose Mourinho's side, the 39-year-old Argentine veteran says it will be time to pack it in and prepare for life away from the game.

"I have won everything there is to win as a footballer," Cambiasso told Press Association Sport. "Champions League, World Cup, Copa America; I've played all around the world.

"But if you ask me what would be one of the greatest achievements of my career, it will be staying up with Leicester City. It is something that I have never experienced before in my life, so for me to achieve this is amazing."

It has not been easy for Leicester under manager Claudio Ranieri who was sacked by the club just 23 days ago, with Craig Shakespeare taking over as head coach.

But Cambiasso believes it is time to bounce back and says their performances against Manchester United in last season's Premier League campaign prove they can compete at this level.

"We need to find a way of winning," the former Real Madrid midfielder said. "The only way we are going to win football matches is by playing our best game, which was what we did against Manchester United when we were still with Claudio Ranieri, so it's up to us to do that again."

Cambiasso also stressed there is no reason for Leicester players to feel daunted at the prospect of facing United.

The Red Devils are widely expected to win on Friday night, having won all of their last nine meetings with the Foxes.

But Cambiasso says it has been a tough start to the season for Ranieri's team and that they have not been given a fair chance by some critics in recent months, while also admitting he has enjoyed his time playing alongside Shinji Okazaki in Japan after leaving Leicester last summer.

"I don't think people respected us enough," the 39-year-old said. "We came into this season thinking we could stay up and that was our only objective, but no one expected it to be as hard for us as it has been.

"It's difficult when you haven't got a good start to the season like we did. If you don't win your first three games then people start to judge you.

"But I have enjoyed my time at Leicester and playing with Shinji Okazaki was amazing, he was fantastic. It will be hard for me to leave him because it is the best I have had in Japan but I think this might be a good time to finish."<s>
