Bringing back survival for Leicester City 
Leicester City midfielder Esteban Cambiasso knows what it feels like to claim football's biggest prizes but says saving the Premier League strugglers from relegation would be one of the highlights of his career.   
Cambiasso was a member of the Boca Juniors side who beat River Plate 4-2 in extra time in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to win the 1998 Libertadores Cup final - the equivalent of the UEFA Champions League in South America.   
"I have always been very proud of that moment," said Cambiasso, who was also a member of the Argentine national team when they beat France 3-0 in Paris, beating them on penalties to win the World Cup in 2014 and lifting the Confederations Cup following victory over Mexico.   
But he feels that winning the Premier League title would have been more impressive as Leicester are one of five clubs in the top tier who finished last season outside of the European places and were promoted from the second tier a year earlier, but currently sit 12th in the table, seven points clear of the drop zone.   
"We came out of nowhere to be here," Cambiasso added . "It's great for us as we don't have the resources other clubs do. For me it would be more satisfying because I have always wanted to stay in Europe and play football, not just to win something in my country but also internationally."   
Cambiasso is one of four foreign players who has plied his trade with Leicester City since they returned to the top tier - the others being Senegal's Idrissa Sylla, Brazilian midfielder Luis Hernan Pereira and Croatian defender Sven BaliÄ‡.   
Cambiasso was brought in on a free transfer from Inter Milan when Nigel Pearson took over as manager at the King Power Stadium last season but his first campaign was cut short after 30 appearances due to injury, having initially struggled to regain full fitness and adapt to life in England.   
"I had an operation on my knee when I was playing for Inter Milan," Cambiasso explained . "Then when I came here, it didn't help that the pitch is so quick - it was even harder for me to get used to."   
The 37-year-old believes that if he can play a significant amount of football in his final season then he will be happy, adding: "I don't have anything else to prove. I want to play as much as I can and give back to the team what they need from me."   
Cambiasso is currently one of four foreign players with Premier League experience at Leicester but two of them - Pereira and Sylla, are also on the books of Sporting CP in Portugal.   
Pereira said: "I have played for Portugal and I know that playing abroad is not easy . But if you're going to do it, why not do it with a team like Leicester City?"   
The former Portsmouth midfielder added: "I've had a good time here - the coaches have been great with me. They always asked if I was okay and wanted me to be fit."   
"They are a good club . There are three players who were at Sporting CP, myself, Idrissa Sylla and Esteban Cambiasso," he continued . "We all came here to help the team and to give something extra. You have to learn English, it's part of being in a foreign country."
