dashboard camera Wednesday morning around 10:30 a.m. The video shows the woman drive headlong at over 60 mph down a highway heading away from him while he flashes his high beams and attempts to get her to stop. She eventually crashes into another car and flips over in front of other oncoming vehicles, with pieces of her vehicle flying up onto the road. After the crash, the woman gets out of the truck and seems to stand there before sitting back down in it and driving off. "I almost hit her but I swerved just in time," Rivera says in his video. He continues: "She is gonna kill herself, I hope she's OK." In a second dashboard camera recording from Wednesday morning, the woman drives along another highway and then appears to park her car off to the side of the road before getting back into it again and driving away. The crash came just a week after the city recorded its 70th traffic fatality. "We are doing everything we can to reduce crashes," said Mayor Bill de Blasio's office in a statement Wednesday evening, noting that they've added more pedestrian islands at busy intersections and have increased street cleaning efforts to help keep New York City roads safe. (The city is also using a drone to catch speeders.)

A woman drove the wrong way down a highway and plowed into oncoming traffic in an apparent suicide attempt, according to a video of the crash posted online Wednesday morning. Jack Rivera, a New York trucker, captured the collision on his dashboard camera while driving along an elevated highway around 10:30 a.m. The video shows the woman drive headlong at over 60 mph down a highway heading away from him while he flashes his high beams and attempts to get her to stop. She eventually crashes into another car and flips over in front of other oncoming vehicles, with pieces of her vehicle flying up onto the road.
