A 27-year-old British adventurer made his bid to become the first person ever to cross the Indian Ocean in a powered paraglider when he took off on Monday from the resort town of Mombasa, Kenya. The flight is expected to last for three days, during which time Stephen Pestell will have to endure turbulence caused by a range of factors including bad weather and the occasional shark attack, as well as an ordeal by fire that could burn his aircraft. "The Indian Ocean is not known for its easy flight conditions," he told AFP in Mombasa on the eve of departure. Pestell's mission will begin with a 20-minute takeoff to reach an altitude of about two kilometres before he starts flying. His final destination, Mauritius, will be reached after around eight hours of flight and is expected to cost him around $3 million in fuel. "I expect the flight itself to last between three and five days," Pestell said on Sunday in Mombasa, adding that a maximum distance of 120 kilometres would have to be covered during this time. As well as being hit by sharks -- which are known for their speed, agility and teeth -- he will also be at risk from thunderstorms and turbulence caused by bad weather conditions. The 43-year-old adventurer has flown an ultralight aircraft over the Sahara Desert and swum with sharks in South Africa. Pestell hopes to promote awareness of plastic pollution, which threatens marine life as well as human health, on his flight. He is taking a paraglider instead of a conventional plane because it has no fuel tanks and therefore no polluting effect when landing. (AFP)
