Incredible Dust Storm Covers Russia, China in "Tombstones" (VIDEO) 
  
 An intense dust storm has engulfed eastern parts of Russia and neighboring areas of northeastern China, obscuring the sunlight with a wall of thick dark clouds. 
  
 The storm swept through the Russian city of Khabarovsk in the Russian Far East, covering it in "tombstones" of dust, according to eyewitnesses on social media. 
  
 The severe weather event has sparked chaos in eastern China with flights at major airports canceled due to heavy sand storms and poor visibility, while the Chinese city of Harbin was forced to close its airport for over an hour, local authorities said on Monday. 
  
 "A dusty cloud is shrouding most of the region," according to the website Weather Underground. 
  
 The phenomenon has also caused a severe sandstorm in central Asia with flights suspended at Astana International Airport, the Kazakh capital, the country's civil aviation agency said on Monday. 
  
 Earlier this month, an unprecedented dust storm blacked out sunlight over North China and even reached into Taiwan, forcing authorities to close schools, and cancel flights across the region as it caused a severe sandstorm. 
  
 The country has witnessed frequent dust storms in recent years amid climate change and worsening desertification, but the latest weather event was described by some experts as "historic" for its intensity and scope of impact. 
  
 China is prone to sandstorms due to strong winds blowing from the Gobi Desert in northern China or Mongolia that lead to a huge amount of dust being carried on currents. 
  
 The Asian country has witnessed frequent dust storms in recent years amid climate change and worsening desertification, but the latest weather event was described by some experts as "historic" for its intensity and scope of impact. 
  
 Experts have also linked the occurrence to a decade-long drought that has hit parts of northern China which has caused soil dryness and weakened vegetation, making the wind blowing sand storms more intense. 
  
 According to the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) data on June 10th, there were nearly 270 sandstorms in the country that year, up 46 percent from the same period last year and an all-time high since records began. The number of sandstorms during the past decade has been more than double compared to those observed between 1951 and 1980. (RT)
