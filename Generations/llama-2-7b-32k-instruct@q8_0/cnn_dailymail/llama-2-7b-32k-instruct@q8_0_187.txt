images emerged of a giant dust bowl in China, which some claim is due to climate change, while others say it is simply down to the dry conditions. The phenomenon was also seen in Mexico this month and even Russia has been hit by its own 'dust blizzards'. While experts admit that extreme weather events such as storms and floods have become more common, they are unsure what is causing them. A study published on Thursday in the journal Nature Geoscience found a link between these storms and El Nino - a natural climate pattern which sees warmer sea temperatures cause changes across the globe. Lead author Professor Jens Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'I have always thought of the dust bowl days as the beginning of the Anthropocene, but now we can see that this is not the only time in history where these dust storms occurred.' The study's findings were based on a 140-year record of observations taken from weather stations around the world. Professor Zimmermann said: 'We have observed similar phenomena during the pre-industrial period and also in our own lifetimes - including the 20th Century Dust Bowl.' However, he did not believe that this was a clear signal of climate change, because El Nino has been linked to dust storms for thousands of years. He added: 'It could be a coincidence or it could be due to changing temperatures in the Pacific Ocean - which is likely to have an effect on air currents.' The study found that El Nino's influence increased as the climate warmed, so future studies may find that this link will grow stronger over time. Professor Zimmermann said: 'In fact it was interesting for us to find a link between dust storms and climate change because we can use these data to reconstruct past climates by using proxy data.' However, he added: 'We cannot tell from this data alone if the changes in dust activity are due to climate change or just coincidence. What we do know is that over the last 140 years there has been a significant increase in the number of very large dust storms and these have occurred at different times.' Professor Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'We believe it might be caused by the drying trend which started about 15-20 years ago - but we cannot tell whether this is due to climate change or just a natural part of our planet's cycles.' He added: 'It may have been triggered by El Nino or maybe it has something to do with solar activity - there are many theories and many different factors that come into play here.' Professor Zimmermann said the number of dust storms is increasing for various reasons, including dryer soils as a result of climate change and wind changes because of weather patterns. He added: 'This could be related to El Nino or it could also be due to natural variability in our planet's cycles.' Professor Zimmermann said the study was looking into the history of dust storms, but he did not know if they were caused by climate change or not as 'we can't tell from this data'. He added: 'We are using these records to understand past changes and how they might relate to future changes - we are trying to get an idea about what is happening now.' Professor Zimmermann said the findings had been linked to previous dust storms, which were a feature of life on Earth for thousands of years. He added: 'It has been documented by different peoples living in the areas affected such as Native Americans and Australian Aborigines - there are various historical records showing this.' Professor Zimmermann said that while it was important to find out why these storms were increasing, he did not know if climate change would make them more severe. He added: 'We believe there has been a significant increase in the number of very large dust storms and these have occurred at different times - but we cannot tell if this is due to climate change or coincidence.' Professor Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'We don't know what caused them to become so frequent, but we are finding that they happen when there has been a very dry period leading up to the event and this is causing people in China to think about climate change. However, he said: 'There were also large dust storms during El Nino events in the past.' Professor Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'We need more information - we don't have a clear picture of what is going on.' He added: 'I don't think this is a signal that climate change has begun. I think it might be just part of our planet's cycles which we are now trying to understand better and this includes dust storms.' Professor Zimmermann said he would like to see more research into these storms and the weather patterns linked to them because they could provide 'a lot of information about past climate'. He added: 'We have to figure out what is going on here and why these dust storms are becoming so frequent - it is a big issue for people living in China.' Professor Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'There has been a drying trend which started 15 or 20 years ago - we don't know if this is due to climate change but what we do see is that it is getting more and more severe. It is hard to tell whether this was caused by climate change or just part of our planet's cycle, but the frequency seems to have increased.' Professor Zimmermann said: 'It could be a coincidence or it could be due to changing temperatures in the Pacific Ocean - which is likely to have an effect on air currents. It is clear that we need more research into these events and their links to climate change because they can give us valuable information about the planet's past.' Professor Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'We believe this could be due to the drying trend which started 15 or 20 years ago. We don't know if it is related to climate change but what we do see is that it is getting more severe and more frequent.' Professor Zimmermann said he did not think these storms would become 'more severe and frequent' because of climate change, adding: 'We are seeing a drying trend and this may be linked to the current warming - it could also be due to natural variability. We don't know if it is related to climate change but we do see that it has been increasing in severity over time.' He said: 'In my opinion these events will continue to occur because this is a part of our planet's cycles and we just need more research to find out what is going on and why they are becoming so frequent. These dust storms have occurred for thousands of years but it was only in the 20th Century that people became aware of them.' Professor Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'It could be due to climate change or just part of our planet's cycles, it is hard to tell but what we do see is that it is getting more frequent and more severe. It may not have been triggered by El Nino or maybe it has something to do with solar activity - there are many theories and many different factors that come into play here.'

He added: 'We believe there has been a significant increase in the number of very large dust storms and these have occurred at different times - but we cannot tell if this is due to climate change or coincidence.' Professor Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'There was always an increasing frequency of dust bowl days which might be caused by drying trend but I don't think it was directly related to the warming. In fact it has been linked to the recent drought in China - but not necessarily climate change.' Professor Zimmermann told MailOnline Travel: 'We believe there have been a significant increase in the number of very large dust bowl days and these are occurring at different times - but we don't know if this is due to climate change or just coincidence. In fact it was interesting for us to find that link between these storms and El Nino because we can use these data to reconstruct past climates by using proxy data.'

Professor Zimmermann said the study would show whether it was linked to climate change, adding: 'It could be a coincidence or it could be due to changing temperatures in the Pacific Ocean - which is likely to have an effect on air currents.' He added: 'We don't know if this is related to climate change but what we do see is that these events are occurring at different times and more often, so this may indicate a link between them. We need more research into it
