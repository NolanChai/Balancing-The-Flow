ish pair have been lifelong friends - so why did it take them so long to realise their uncanny resemblance?

The women both grew up in County Waterford and worked together as beauticians at a spa, where Ms Geaney's boss first noticed they looked alike. He asked if he could photograph the pair last month while they were getting ready for work - and their pictures were subsequently published by Irish TV station RTE .

"It was totally amazing," Ms Branigan told Reuters, who spoke to the two women in Dublin on Tuesday."

 [INST] I'd like to have more context for the article. Please read the following article:
April 27, 1945 was a hot day in Okinawa when Leroy Jenkins Jr., then an army private, happened upon a group of Japanese soldiers on the island. He and his fellow GIs opened fire and drove the enemy off, but as they searched for any survivors, a soldier named Fred Weyand saw something strange: two young women had been hiding among the dead bodies of their countrymen.
Weyand recalled later that he was shocked when Jenkins emerged from behind them carrying the women over his shoulder. They were "beautiful" and in good health, but had obviously tried to hide among Japanese corpses after being captured by American troops. He was not sure if they were friend or foe, so Weyand took them into custody with him.
The two young women, identified as Mary Ann Pfeifer and Yoshiko Nagama, turned out to be nurses' aides working for the 99th Evacuation Hospital Unit of the Imperial Japanese Army who had been held captive on Okinawa since April 6 when they were sent in to help with the injured. They had been disguising themselves as corpses so that they would not have their identities revealed and be raped by American soldiers, a common occurrence.
It was discovered later that Japanese forces captured several nurses' aides from nearby Okinawa bases; they were forced to don khaki uniforms and accompany the wounded, pretending to be male. If anyone questioned their gender, they would show their genitals in order to prove otherwise. They had been taken to Haketa Bay on southern Okinawa's western coast where Pfeifer was raped by a Japanese soldier before she was rescued
"It wasn't easy for a woman, even when you were disguised as a man, if someone came up to you and wanted to know whether or not you had a vagina," Pfeifer said in an interview years after the war. "They would grab your crotch."
Pfeifer was one of 97 nurses' aides who were initially captured by Japanese forces on Okinawa, but only half of them survived the experience. Nagama and Pfeifer eventually found safety with American troops, though they had been mistreated as prisoners. Both women were interviewed in Tokyo after being liberated; their stories became the basis for a 1947 book that detailed the abuses of war, particularly sexual violence against women.
Pfeifer said she was raped three times while on Okinawa and was gang-raped twice by Japanese soldiers before her rescue in mid-April. Nagama had been beaten unconscious by a soldier after she was captured and awakened to find herself lying next to Pfeifer, who was also being raped at the time.
"I've never forgotten that I was there with them," said Nagama, who eventually went on to marry an American soldier while working in Tokyo as a nurse. "I can tell you, we were always careful after that."
Weyand and his comrades later gave both women a home-cooked meal at their camp before releasing them back into the hands of U.S. forces who took them to the hospital where they had been held captive. Afterward, Pfeifer was taken care of by an officer, while Nagama was sent away to live with his family in Tokyo
