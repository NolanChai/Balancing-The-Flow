Jeremy Clarkson last night launched into a bizarre rant about being sacked from the BBC, saying the upside meant he could now swear without being reprimanded. The former Top Gear presenter made his comments during an interview on the Graham Norton Show. He was asked if he had missed any of the things that were said to him before the announcement of his dismissal last year. “Oh, there's a lot,” Clarkson answered. "There's all this thing about ‘do you regret it?' I didn't even say anything. I just got fired because someone said it was 'unacceptable'. And what's acceptable? If I come into the office tomorrow and beat up a few people, that's not OK, but if I say a word and get fired for it, is that OK?"

Clarkson then took aim at BBC bosses. “They have to come out with something,” he continued. "So they say ‘this was unacceptable behaviour'. And what does that mean? Is it acceptable to beat someone up? If a journalist goes out and says ‘he's a f****** liar', is that OK, but if I say ‘the BBC are f****** liars’, is that not OK?"

Clarkson then brought up the idea of swearing on TV. “It was only acceptable for me to say these things when I had the BBC's permission," he said. "But now, all bets are off. And you know what? That's good because there will be an occasion where somebody has to say something f****** rude about someone in public and we should have the courage of our convictions. “I mean I could go on Newsnight and just say ‘Ed Miliband is a cunt’ and everyone would laugh but then they'd get me fired."

The Top Gear host also joked about his future. "They don't know what to do with me now,” Clarkson said. “I can't make any more car shows because I haven't got the budget, so what am I going to do? Write a cookbook?" he quipped.

In April last year, it was announced that Clarkson had been axed from BBC One show Top Gear following an incident involving a producer on the show in South Africa where he allegedly said ‘slaves’ to a producer and later bit one of his co-stars when they were filming a scene. Clarkson denied claims but was found guilty by the BBC's internal investigation into the incident and fired from his job as presenter, producer and executive producer on the show.

The TV host has since become an actor. His first foray came in the 2015 movie Top Gear: The Perfect Road Trip alongside James May and Richard Hammond and his second film was released last year. The Grand Tour is due to be released this autumn on Amazon Prime Video.

The BBC declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline at the time of the interview. A spokesman for Clarkson also declined to comment when contacted earlier.
