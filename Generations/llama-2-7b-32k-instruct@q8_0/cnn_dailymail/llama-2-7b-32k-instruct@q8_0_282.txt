Jeremy Clarkson and Chris Moyles are chatting about Jeremy being sacked by the BBC, but this is definitely not how he intended it. #ImACeleb #ClarksonMoyles pic.twitter.com/D0WwcQVq8l — I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here! (@imacelebrity) December 5, 2017

"We have a lot of fun," said Clarkson before adding: "But you know what's good about being sacked? You don't get told off for swearing." Moyles then blurted out: "You're not supposed to say that!" as the camera zoomed in on him. The pair continued their interview and chatted more about Clarkson, but it was clear they were aware of how awkward things got when talking about his dismissal.

After being asked by Moyles about what he would do if he won I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here!, Clarkson said: "I wouldn't mind getting home. What are the chances?" But before he could continue, Moyles joked: "You can swear now! It's okay!" as his co-star laughed awkwardly and apologised for his earlier remark.

Clarkson was fired by BBC bosses in March after punching a producer on the set of Top Gear last year. A statement published by the corporation said: "The BBC has terminated Jeremy Clarkson's employment with immediate effect. There cannot be one rule for some and not others, on-air or off."

Clarkson was also suspended from hosting The Grand Tour after a video emerged of him using racist language to describe the programme's producer Oisin Tymon. An apology was later issued by Clarkson for his "inexcusable" behaviour but it wasn't enough for Amazon who ended his contract with them following the incident.

The Top Gear presenter has been sacked by the corporation for punching a producer.

Clarkson has previously been banned from hosting his show due to an incident with the producer of the programme Oisin Tymon, when he was recorded using racial language to describe him in March 2018 and issued an apology later on Twitter after the video surfaced online. However, Amazon bosses ended his contract following the incident, which meant he could no longer host The Grand Tour on their platform.

Jeremy Clarkson was also suspended by BBC bosses in March for punching a producer on the set of Top Gear last year, and they released a statement saying: "The BBC has terminated Jeremy Clarkson's employment with immediate effect. There cannot be one rule for some and not others, on-air or off."

After being sacked by the corporation in 2018, he was asked to host The Grand Tour but ended up being fired after a second incident when a video emerged of him using racial language to describe his producer Oisin Tymon. An apology was issued later on Twitter which read: "I wish to say sorry for the entire fiasco that I have caused. It is not in my nature to be a racist, and I apologise if it came across that way."

Clarkson's co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond also took to social media to issue statements following his sacking. In one statement released by the three presenters, they said: "We are very disappointed about Jeremy Clarkson’s actions in eating a pork pie whilst filming and we totally support the BBC Trust decision."

In another post, Richard Hammond wrote: "We all loved working together on The Grand Tour so we have agreed with Amazon not to take part in the last three shows. We will be going our separate ways and looking forward to what the future holds."

It is not known whether Amazon will still have an interest in hosting The Grand Tour, but it was revealed earlier this year that they are planning to move forward with another motoring show without the trio.

Clarkson had been working on a second series of The Grand Tour before his sacking when he punched producer Oisin Tymon whilst filming for the programme at the Diddly Squat Farm in Oxfordshire, which resulted in him being suspended from hosting the show by Amazon.

The BBC announced that they had launched an investigation into the incident and later published a statement saying: "We have now concluded our investigation into Jeremy Clarkson’s punching of Oisin Tymon. We are mindful that Jeremy has apologised for his actions to Oisin, which we believe was sincere. He is a highly regarded broadcaster and we want him to return to making programmes for the BBC as soon as possible."
