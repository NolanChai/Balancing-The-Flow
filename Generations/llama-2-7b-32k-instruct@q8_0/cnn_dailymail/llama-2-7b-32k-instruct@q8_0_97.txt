Islamic State (Isis) supporters are targeting young people through social media in a "highly-sophisticated" campaign to radicalise vulnerable individuals, a counter terrorism officer has warned . The Old Bailey was told that Kazi Islam, 18, sent texts to Harry Thomas, 19, who had learning difficulties, persuading him to buy parts for a bomb . A teenager bullied and groomed a friend with learning disabilities by sending him offensive images of beheadings and terrorist attacks before ordering him to take part in an online course teaching him how to make a bomb, a jury heard on Tuesday. The 18-year-old student, from Southampton, Hampshire, was also allegedly coerced into using his debit card to pay for parts which were ordered to make the device before Islam encouraged him to travel to Syria in order to carry out terrorist attacks there or elsewhere, jurors heard. It is claimed he threatened Thomas with death if he told anyone what they had been up to and even made him delete messages from his phone as part of the plan .
