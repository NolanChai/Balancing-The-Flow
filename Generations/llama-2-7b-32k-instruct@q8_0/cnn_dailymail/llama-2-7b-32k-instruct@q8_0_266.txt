umbers to compete with rivals Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool next season but are unlikely to be able to afford any of them.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has ruled out a move for Wilshere who he rates highly. However, Rodgers has been quoted by the media as saying that he is not interested in bringing back the likes of James Milner and Joe Allen – both players he sold to Liverpool when he was at Swansea City.

Liverpool may try to sign their former player from Sunderland, Adam Johnson, but his price tag could prove a barrier to any deal happening this summer as Manchester City are understood to have made an offer for the 25-year-old that has been rejected by Newcastle United. Liverpool have also had bids rejected for Aston Villa’s Fabian Delph and Southampton’s Jay Rodriguez, according to reports in The Times.

Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is known to be a fan of both Johnson and Wilshere but would not sanction moves for them as he has already signed two midfielders this summer – Fernando from Porto and Kevin De Bruyne from Wolfsburg. It may well be the case that Manchester City will need to go back in for their former player from Sunderland, Adam Johnson, as they also want to sign Southampton’s James Ward-Prowse but there has not been an offer yet as he is valued at £12m.

Chelsea have had a bid rejected by West Bromwich Albion for the services of Gareth McAuley and are trying to get in touch with Swansea City to find out if they could sign Nathan Dyer but they may be more interested in the Southampton player who has been quoted as saying he is not sure what his future holds.

The England manager also wants to bring in Raheem Sterling from Liverpool to London but it seems that Daniel Sturridge will stay at Anfield, and there are also rumors of a move for West Bromwich Albion’s Saido Berahino as he is understood to have turned down a £15m offer from Tottenham Hotspur.

Arsenal are trying to get in touch with Sunderland over the possibility of signing Jermain Defoe but they could be more interested in the England player if they sell Oliver Giroud. Arsene Wenger is also said to be interested in Swansea City’s Gylfi Sigurdsson and Leicester City’s Riyad Mahrez as well as trying to get Liverpool to part with Adam Lallana who has not played at all this season and is very unhappy.

The Times have also mentioned the possibility of a move for Burnley player, George Boyd, but there is no interest in him from any other clubs.

Manchester City will be able to bring players into their team for free once they sign their former manager Roberto Mancini as he has signed up to work with them for free next season and will be available at the club’s training ground every day, according to Manchester City owner Sheikh Mansour Bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

The 2014/15 Premier League Champions have also been linked with a move for Raheem Sterling who is not happy playing under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool as they have just won the championship and he has no European football to play in, but it seems that Liverpool would like him to stay.

The Citizens are also trying to sign Swansea City’s Gylfi Sigurdsson from the club that Mancini brought down from a 20th placed finish last season. The 23-year-old Icelandic midfielder has been playing for the South Wales team since joining them on a free transfer from Reading FC back in January 2015 and has scored 7 goals and assisted 9 times this season. He would be a good addition to Pellegrini’s team as he likes his players to create chances.

The Citizens have also been linked with a move for Leicester City’s Riyad Mahrez who has scored 13 goals and assisted in 7 this season. He is valued at around £40m by the Foxes but Pellegrini will not be able to get him unless he sells De Bruyne who cost them €68m when they signed him from Wolfsburg, a club that he helped his team win their first Bundesliga title in 67 years.

The Citizens have also been linked with a move for West Bromwich Albion’s Saido Berahino as he is understood to have turned down an offer of £15m from Tottenham Hotspur and would cost around £20m according to the bbc. Manchester City could do without his wage bill though as they already have 8 players on £75k a week or more including Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne who has only played six games for them since he signed from Wolfsburg this January, and cost them €68m to get him.

Manchester City are also trying to sign West Bromwich Albion’s Gareth McAuley but there is no news as of yet on whether the club will sell him or not after having rejected an offer from Chelsea for him a few days ago. The Citizens have made an approach for the England player who is valued at £12m by West Bromwich Albion.

Manchester City’s manager, Pellegrini has signed Fernando from Porto to help them next season as he was bought to play in their midfield alongside Fernandinho and Yaya Toure but there were injuries during the 2014/15 season that prevented him playing. He played just five league games for Manchester City last season, four of which were against West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns, when he was signed from Porto in January 2015 but he is understood to be very happy with the move and is ready to sign a contract that will make him one of the highest paid players on his team.

Manchester City are also trying to bring in Nathan Dyer who has been linked with a number of clubs including Arsenal, Southampton and Liverpool but he is valued at £12m by his club Swansea City as they do not want to sell him for less than what they paid for him.

Manchester City will be able to sign James Ward-Prowse for free next season when he signs a new contract with the Southampton team, after the 2014/15 Premier League Champions rejected an offer for him from Liverpool in January 2015. The Citizens have been linked with him too but there has not been any news on that front as of yet.

Manchester City are trying to bring in George Boyd from the Championship team, Middlesbrough and he is valued at £6m by them which would be a good deal for them if they could get him. The England player was signed last summer from Peterborough United for just over £1m but his form this season has attracted the attention of other teams including Burnley and West Bromwich Albion as well as Manchester City.

The Citizens have been linked with a move for Tottenham Hotspur’s Adam Lallana who is unhappy at his team which is fighting relegation from the Premier League but he will cost them £25m if they want him according to their chairman and would be an excellent addition as he is valued by The Saints at £17.3m, so it could prove difficult for them to sign him.

The Citizens have been linked with a move for Southampton’s Jay Rodriguez who is understood to have turned down a £10m offer from Chelsea and is valued by his team at around £25m as he has scored 9 goals this season despite missing most of the year due to an injury. Pellegrini could do with another striker for his team if they want to challenge Liverpool who have just won the title, but there is no news as of yet on whether or not Rodriguez will stay at Southampton, and he may also be linked with a move away from his current club, according to The Times.

Manchester City are trying to sign Adam Johnson from Newcastle United for free once they sign their former manager Roberto Mancini as he has signed up to work with them for free next season but they would need to sign him in the next few days to be ready for the start of the 2015/16 Premier League season. The Citizens have made an offer for Adam Johnson, according to reports from The Times.

Manchester City are also trying to sign West Ham United’s Cheikhou Kouyate as they want him to add pace to their midfield as well as their attack as he is valued at £10m by the Hammers team and was signed from Wigan Athletic for just over that amount in January 2015. The Citizens have made an offer to West Ham United for Cheikhou Kouyate but it is not known if they will accept or reject their offer, according to reports from The Times.
