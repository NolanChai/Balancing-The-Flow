, 21, was mistreated at a specialist school in Kent and suffered "severe social exclusion" by staff . Her solicitor claimed the council had been warned about complaints of bullying but did not take them seriously .

The case is due to be heard in the High Court on Wednesday. 

In a statement issued through her lawyers, Tracy said: "This has caused Tianni severe emotional trauma that still affects her daily life."

She added that she was seeking damages and an apology from Kent County Council, saying the school had failed in its duty of care.

The council said it did not believe there to be any evidence of bullying at the specialist school attended by Tianni between 2014 and 2017. A spokesperson for Kent County Council said: "We have been made aware that a complaint has been issued against Kent County Council regarding its management of the specialist school that provided educational provision to Tianni Stratton, who was a pupil at that time."

It is understood the claim relates to bullying allegedly suffered by Tianni when she attended The Willows School in Sevenoaks. In a statement, the council said: "The complaint arises from an incident which occurred whilst Tianni Stratton was attending The Willows School between 2014 and 2017."

Tracy Stratton's solicitor, Simon Lomax, of law firm Simons Solicitors, said the council had been warned about bullying but did not take it seriously. In a statement issued through his lawyers he added: "The claim is being made against Kent County Council in relation to its management of The Willows School which provides education to young people with autism."

He said that, following the complaints Tianni had lodged, the council had conducted an investigation and decided not to take any formal action. Mr Lomax added: "We have been instructed by our client to make this claim against Kent County Council in order to hold them accountable for their conduct."

He said that his team would be calling on the council's chief executive and legal officer to give evidence in person about its handling of complaints. He also claimed that Tianni had suffered severe emotional trauma as a result of her bullying ordeal and was "unable to work, socialise or concentrate for more than 10 minutes".

Mr Lomax said the claim had been brought against Kent County Council because it did not have jurisdiction over other agencies that Tianni had complained about. He said he believed this was an example of a "broken system" in which vulnerable people were failed by those who should be looking after them.

Mr Lomax added: "We would hope that this case will help to bring about change and prevent other children with special needs being failed in the same way as Tianni."

In a statement, Kent County Council said: "The safety and well-being of our pupils is of paramount importance. We take any complaints very seriously. In this case we have been made aware that a complaint has been issued against Kent County Council regarding its management of the specialist school that provided educational provision to Tianni Stratton, who was a pupil at that time."

It added: "We do not believe there to be any evidence of bullying at the specialist school attended by Tianni between 2014 and 2017. As soon as we were aware of any issues, we carried out an investigation which did not reveal evidence of bullying."

It said that Tianni had been referred to alternative provision but was found to have no specific educational need and therefore failed the assessment process.

The council's spokesperson said: "We take all complaints about our schools extremely seriously and investigate them fully as part of our ongoing monitoring of their performance."

It added: "Where we receive a complaint, we carry out an investigation which includes interviewing relevant staff members involved in the complaint. We then report back to the complainant with the outcome of that investigation and where appropriate take action. As soon as we were aware of any issues regarding Tianni Stratton's school placement, we carried out an investigation."

Tianni said she was "embarrassed" by her mother speaking about what happened to her at The Willows School and wanted people not to focus on that. She added: "I just want everyone to stop talking about it because I don't like it when they talk about me, especially my mum."

Tianni said she was a different person now but had learned how to cope with things in the past. She added: "It has been hard for me growing up because of everything that happened and sometimes it still is really difficult. I just want people not to focus on that - there are more important things."

She said she did not blame her mother for what had happened, but acknowledged she had had a tough time too. Tianni also wanted parents of children with special needs to be aware of the problems they could face and to report any concerns. She added: "I feel like I was just put on my own and it wasn't really dealt with properly."

Her mother told Sky News that she had tried repeatedly to get Tianni help but had been met with resistance from staff, including teachers and the headteacher. She said her daughter had suffered from anxiety as a result of being bullied at The Willows School.

Tracy Stratton added: "It's very hard - she has spent many hours crying to me about this."

She also revealed that she had been told by the school headteacher not to ask any more questions when dealing with her daughter's concerns. Tracy said: "The head of the school came up and asked me one day after picking my daughter up, 'Don't ask anymore questions' - which was a bit harsh."

Tracy also said she had been told by staff that they could not help her as their hands were tied because Tianni was an adult. She added: "I don't see how you can leave these people to deal with the vulnerable children that they have, without any support or training in place."

Tracy Stratton said she had been told by staff at The Willows School that they would report Tianni for "non-attendance" if she was not picked up on time from the school. She added: "I felt like my daughter's rights were being violated, and I have concerns about other parents in this situation."
